    <title>Epic Games buys artist portfolio site ArtStation</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sG8HXvyPvg6ueA6ScF5tKOOy4_U=/120x0:1080x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69227043/ArtStation_announcement_banner_1280x640_1_1200x640.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://magazine.artstation.com/2021/04/artstation-is-joining-the-epic-games-family/" target="_blank"&gt;ArtStation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pUTY5X"&gt;As it prepares to do &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;battle in court with Apple&lt;/a&gt; over App Store fees, Epic Games has acquired ArtStation, an online marketplace for digital artists, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/artstation-is-now-part-of-epic-games"&gt;the companies announced&lt;/a&gt;. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMORnL"&gt;“The ArtStation leadership team brings tremendous talent and an unparalleled track record of supporting a vibrant creator community and ecosystem,” Epic Games vice president and general manager Marc Petit said in a statement. “We look forward to working with them to provide creators with access to even more resources and tools, empowering them to do their best work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQy62v"&gt;Founded in 2014, &lt;a href="https://www.artstation.com/?sort_by=community"&gt;ArtStation&lt;/a&gt; is a popular portfolio site for professional artists in gaming and entertainment. ArtStation artists can also sell their work on the site, and Epic plans to reduce seller fees, putting more money in creators’ pockets. Standard fees will go from 30 percent to 12 percent, and for ArtStation Pro members, the fees will be reduced from 20 percent to 8 percent, and 5 percent for self-promoted sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjN7rP"&gt;ArtStation will continue to operate “as an independently branded platform,” and its &lt;a href="https://www.artstation.com/about/artists/learning"&gt;ArtStation Learning&lt;/a&gt; section, which has a library of educational videos, will be free for the rest of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4aA54"&gt;“You can still use the platform as you do today, and we will continue to be open to all creators across verticals, both 2D and 3D alike—including those that don’t use Unreal Engine,” ArtStation CEO Leonard Teo wrote in a &lt;a href="https://magazine.artstation.com/2021/04/artstation-is-joining-the-epic-games-family/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ll be actively hiring and growing the ArtStation team. We’re committed to improving the platform and now as a part of Epic, we’ll be able to do much more.” Leo added that Epic’s Unreal Engine team has been a strong supporter of the platform, with Epic giving ArtStation &lt;a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/megagrants"&gt;one of its Megagrants&lt;/a&gt; last year at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgQyjo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon sells AOL and Yahoo for about half of what it paid</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="aol man" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rPGL_9o4DzHE6BpKtw0ptYXAupA=/0x11:570x391/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69226681/runningman.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t7PpYT"&gt;Verizon has sold its AOL and Yahoo properties to Apollo Global Management in a deal said to be worth $5 billion, about half of the nearly $9 billion Verizon originally paid for the pair. Verizon will maintain a 10 percent stake in the company, now known as Yahoo and led by CEO Guru Gowrappan. The deal, which includes Verizon’s ad tech business, was heavily rumored over the last week and is still subject to closing conditions. Once complete, it’ll bring an end to Verizon’s troubled experiment with media production and advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaBJP2"&gt;Apollo is a private equity firm that owns the &lt;a href="https://www.apollo.com/stockholders/press-releases/2021/03-03-2021-113034148"&gt;Venetian resort in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; and crafts retailer &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/crafts-retailer-michaels-to-be-bought-by-apollo-global-for-5-billion.html"&gt;Michaels&lt;/a&gt;. Apollo co-founder Leon Black recently stepped down as Chairman, soon after it was revealed that he &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/business/jeffrey-epstein-leon-black-apollo.html"&gt;paid more than $150 million to Jeffrey Epstein&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Jeffrey Epstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="r4gwVP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yes, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Jeffrey Epstein&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HyKrly"&gt;“We are thrilled to help unlock the tremendous potential of Yahoo and its unparalleled collection of brands,” said Apollo partner Reed Rayman. “We have enormous respect and admiration for the great work and progress that the entire organization has made over the last several years, and we look forward to working with Guru, his talented team, and our partners at Verizon to accelerate Yahoo’s growth in its next chapter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOSTI7"&gt;Verizon originally paid $4.4 billion for AOL in 2015 and another $4.5 billion for Yahoo two years later. The media divisions, which included properties like &lt;em&gt;Yahoo Sports&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;, were consolidated under the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/3/15166872/aol-verizon-oath-announced-merger-rebranding-new-name-logo"&gt;absurdly named Oath&lt;/a&gt;, later renamed Verizon Media Group in 2018 after Verizon admitted defeat and wrote off about half of its value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTw5sD"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20802639/tumblr-verizon-sold-wordpress-blogging-yahoo-adult-content"&gt;2019 Verizon sold Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; for an undisclosed sum that was thought to have been less than $3 million, pennies compared to the $1.1 billion Yahoo paid for the blogging platform in 2013. Last year Verizon unloaded &lt;em&gt;Huffpost&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed&lt;/em&gt;, a property AOL paid $315 million for in 2011 that resulted in a $119 million charge to its quarterly earnings “primarily related to the disposition of the &lt;em&gt;HuffPost&lt;/em&gt; business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYHIzo"&gt;Back in the day, AOL was how people connected to the internet and Yahoo was its front page. At their peaks, AOL had a market capitalization of &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/15/how-aol-dominated-the-internet-of-the-90s-and-let-it-slip-away.html"&gt;more than $200 billion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dont-cry-for-yahoo%E2%80%94the-stock-has-raced-past-previous-leaders-of-the-dot-com-era-2016-07-25"&gt;Yahoo more than $125 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kroger begins testing drone deliveries for baby products and s’mores </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ZFvTK3BPnFUC58PkakVu2X36sg=/50x0:1951x1267/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69226543/Kroger_Delivery_x_Drone_Express_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kroger is partnering with Drone Express on deliveries of packages up to five pounds.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Kroger&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3A67oL"&gt;Kroger is joining rival Walmart by launching a drone delivery pilot program for groceries later this spring. The supermarket chain is partnering with Drone Express to deliver items like baby products, over-the-counter medications, and picnic supplies weighing up to about five pounds from a test store in Centerville, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BrpqK"&gt;A landing page for the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kroger.com%2Fdronedelivery&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F3%2F22416957%2Fkroger-drone-express-groceries-ohio" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kroger Drone Delivery service&lt;/a&gt; says that groceries will be flown by “certified drone pilots under FAA approval.” A &lt;a href="http://ir.kroger.com/CorporateProfile/press-releases/press-release/2021/Kroger-and-Drone-Express-Partner-to-Provide-Grocery-Delivery-by-Drone/default.aspx"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; suggests that deliveries can be made to street addresses as well as to parks or beaches by homing in on a customer’s smartphone location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QFNUb"&gt;As part of the pilot, Kroger is designing bundled product offerings that fit within the size and weight constraints of the Drone Express vehicles. These include a baby care bundle with wipes and formula, another with over-the-counter medications and fluids, and a “S’mores bundle” with graham crackers, marshmallows, and chocolate. Krogers says eligible orders can be delivered in “as little as 15 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jl9NlZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Send chicken soup to a sick friend&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="neeEkv"&gt;“Autonomous drones have unlimited potential to improve everyday life, and our technology opens the way to safe, secure, environmentally friendly deliveries for Kroger customers,” said Kroger CTO Beth Flippo. “The possibilities for customers are endless – we can enable Kroger customers to send chicken soup to a sick friend or get fast delivery of olive oil if they run out while cooking dinner.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iVtyCM2fBMrM6glQ9mVgyYCP9WY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22487786/Kroger_Delivery_x_Drone_Express_05.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Drone Express flight management trailer parked at Krogers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zlFJn2"&gt;Test flights, ahead of the consumer pilot, will begin this week from the Kroger Marketplace in Centerville, with flights managed from an on-site trailer with additional monitoring occurring offsite. A second pilot program is scheduled to launch this summer at a California Ralphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcHvJI"&gt;Walmart has been dabbling in drone deliveries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/26/9617600/walmart-drones-amazon-faa-test"&gt;since at least 2015&lt;/a&gt;. It is currently testing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430280/walmart-drone-delivery-pilot-program-north-carolina-flytrex"&gt;Flytrex drones in North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; for household goods and groceries, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430280/walmart-drone-delivery-pilot-program-north-carolina-flytrex"&gt;Zipline drones in Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; for health and wellness products.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Castlevania, West Side Story, Sweet Tooth, Luca, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p2d-94NMjGvMrcr__ZvKaUc5LwI=/244x0:1498x836/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69224311/castlevania.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Castlevania | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7iWXfZzEMc&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l7Rl5W"&gt;Just started watching season four of&lt;em&gt; The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt; and I remember why I prefer the weekly release schedule for this show: Bingeing it is utterly draining (Monica Hesse makes this point much more eloquently in her mostly spoiler-free review in the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/handmaids-tale-season-4-exhausting/2021/04/28/df2cb0da-9d3d-11eb-b7a8-014b14aeb9e4_story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The show has a conundrum: it can’t kill off its main character (which would be an incredible plot twist) and it can’t take her out of Gilead because that’s where the action is. So June has to keep suffering over and over. And over. After the first three episodes, June’s done plenty of suffering already. Over the rest of the season I’m really hoping to see A) much more of Alexis Bledel and Samira Wiley and B) something good happen to June. Anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLgnQ1"&gt;Here’s the roundup of this week’s trailers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1S8he4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2ZDEAH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0k2OdEzq-dc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0KzYfv"&gt;West Side Story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PddrHZ"&gt;Steven Spielberg’s remake of the classic musical looks a lot like the original 1961 film at first glance (this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18pNvg3ckdU&amp;amp;ab_channel=MattSkuta"&gt;side-by-side comparison&lt;/a&gt; from YouTuber Matt Skuta shows the many differences). But while the earlier film included white actors in makeup to play some of the Puerto Rican characters, &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/03/a-first-look-at-steven-spielbergs-west-side-story"&gt;Spielberg sought performers of Puerto Rican descent&lt;/a&gt; for his updated version. The spectacular Rita Moreno, who starred in the original as Anita appears in the Spielberg version, and is also an executive producer on the film. &lt;em&gt;West Side Story &lt;/em&gt;hits theaters (after a lengthy COVID-related delay) in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQ2vOw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IXkqnS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L7iWXfZzEMc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5KKK03"&gt;Castlevania&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hdetTW"&gt;The latest 10-episode season of &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; is going back to “where it all started,” according to the new trailer. The official synopsis from Netflix says “Wallachia collapses into chaos as factions clash” and mentions attempts to bring Dracula back from the dead (!!). “These are the end times.” This is the final season with this cast of characters (&lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/castlevania-canceled-end-season-4-premiere-date-netflix-new-series-universe-1234735439/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; has reported&lt;/a&gt; Netflix may launch a new series in the Castlevania-verse but with different characters), so expect plenty of blood. Season four of &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; drops on Netflix May 13th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0zHFO3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mYfJxlgR2jw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="M0KTUE"&gt;Luca&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0jkQMI"&gt;OK so as a parent, I am always a bit wary of Disney/Pixar movies, because they are typically emotionally devastating for parents to watch (see: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLkasScy7A&amp;amp;ab_channel=MovieclipsTrailers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finding Nemo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUAzGQ3nSY&amp;amp;ab_channel=Pixar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside Out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or maybe the final scene of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjTO-fwgaVk&amp;amp;ab_channel=ABCTV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toy Story 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) (aaand I just cried all over again dammit). &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt; is the story of two young sea monsters who become human when they’re not in the water as they explore the surface world in a seaside town on the Italian Riviera. Seems safe enough and the trailer looks beautiful but Pixar always gets you, so don’t say I didn’t warn you. &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt; hits &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1042702/9358?subId1=VergeTrailers050321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; on June 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xasff6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GrBw0pbF11s?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=2&amp;amp;start=2" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="T26mqk"&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Ax0GzX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; is a post-apocalyptic fairytale based on a DC Comic, with Robert Downey, Jr. as executive producer (is that the most &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt;-y sentence I have ever written? Possibly.). Our hero is a very cute hybrid deer-boy played by Christian Convery, who’s searching for a new beginning after society has been upended by something called The Great Crumble. &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; arrives on Netflix June 4th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kmCugN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tks_1uCO5kA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QqfM8V"&gt;Rick and Morty Season 5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="snWwRQ"&gt;The second trailer for season 5 of&lt;em&gt; Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; picks up where the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6Zy_mLgSNQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=AdultSwim"&gt;first trailer&lt;/a&gt; left off, which is to say, in the middle of a chaotic space battle? with cyberpunk birds? that is a parody of the &lt;em&gt;Power Rangers&lt;/em&gt;? Sure, why not. &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; returns to Adult Swim on June 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;iFixit did a teardown of Apple’s AirTags | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/50145/airtag-teardown-part-one-yeah-this-tracks" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vEMTjh"&gt;The team over at iFixit has done its teardown thing again, this time examining Apple’s AirTag trackers. Part one of its two-part review digs into the guts of the little trackers, and for those lamenting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;lack of a key ring loop on the AirTag&lt;/a&gt;, iFixit (carefully) drilled a hole into one without damaging any of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="toeOZh"&gt;After some reconnaissance inside our first AirTag, we grabbed a 1/16” drill bit and carefully punched a hole through the second tracker in our four-pack—after removing the battery, of course. We miraculously managed to avoid all chips, boards, and antennas, only drilling through plastic and glue. The best part? The AirTag survived the operation like a champ and works as if nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="N4Fe6g"&gt;The team cautioned that you have to remove the battery before drilling, and warned that drilling in the wrong place can cause serious damage. So try this at home only if you have skill with a drill. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;iFixit drilled a hole into an AirTag for a keyring, and it survived&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ri8tQD"&gt;iFixit compared ‌its AirTags‌ to the Tile Mate and the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag. AirTags are the smallest of the bunch, with its 3-volt coin cell removable battery— type CR2032, same as the one SmartTags use—taking up most of the internal space. “All three trackers open up with finger power—no other tools required,” according to iFixit, but they found the AirTag’s was the most difficult to remove. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SE0xbz"&gt;An X-ray of the three tags shows Apple made efficient use of its internal space, nothing that “the relative darkness of the AirTag [in the X-ray image] is due to a hefty central speaker magnet and its steel battery cover. iFixit tweeted a 360-video of the X-ray image:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook and Instagram notices in iOS apps tell users tracking helps keep them ‘free of charge’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVoAbhSy-1RHpv5ExeQve9Q6zV4=/0x112:890x705/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69222709/SpeakingUp_SmBiz_1.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="479dsF"&gt;Facebook is continuing its campaign against Apple’s iOS 14 privacy updates, adding a notice within its iOS app telling users the information it collects from other apps and websites can “help keep Facebook free of charge.” A similar message was seen on Instagram’s iOS app (Facebook is Instagram’s parent company). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6IAaY"&gt;Technology researcher Ashkan Soltani first noted the new pop-up notices on Saturday (see his tweet below), but a Facebook spokesperson directed &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/speaking-up-for-small-businesses/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to a blog post&lt;/a&gt; from earlier last week that detailed the update. The company refers to the notices as “educational screens,” and said they provided “more details about how we use data for personalized ads,” according to the blog post by Dan Levy, Facebook’s vice president for ads and business products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkNfJB"&gt;“This version of iOS requires us to ask for permission to track some data from this devices to improve your ads. Learn how we limit the use of this information if you don’t turn on this device setting,” the screen reads. “We use information about your activity received form other apps and websites to: show you ads that are more personalized, help keep Facebook free of charge [and] support businesses that rely on ads to reach their customers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HWpozB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And it begins.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Facebook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Facebook&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Instagram&lt;/a&gt; explore additional scare tactics to combat &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; iOS14 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ATT?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ATT&lt;/a&gt; privacy changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Help keep Facebook free of charge” &lt;a href="https://t.co/mOB9WJpz9A"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mOB9WJpz9A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ashkan soltani (@ashk4n) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashk4n/status/1388270878870310912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oCeMRL"&gt;The new opt-in requirements in the latest versions of iOS 14, including iOS 14.5,  require developers to get express consent from device owners to allow their Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) to be shared and collected across apps. Under Apple’s new policy, app developers are still able to use other information a user provides for targeted advertising, even if the user opts out of letting the app track them, but that information can’t be shared with another company for ad tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gHGFRL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Apple’s new privacy feature is such a big deal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EFu1Kt"&gt;If developers try to get around the opt-in requirement, or try to replace the IDFA with another piece of identifying information such as an email address, that app will be considered in violation of the opt-in requirement. The rules also apply to Apple’s own apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3qB4Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;Facebook has been a vocal critic&lt;/a&gt; of Apple’s iOS 14 privacy updates, arguing that the privacy changes could hurt small businesses which may rely on Facebook’s ad network to reach customers. In statements to the press and in newspaper ads, Facebook has said Apple is encouraging new business models for apps so they rely less on advertising and more on subscriptions, which would potentially give Apple a cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqb9H0"&gt;But the “keep Facebook/Instagram free” tactic seems to run counter to Facebook’s long-standing tagline which indicated the company was “free and always will be.” Of course, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-changes-free-and-always-will-be-slogan-on-homepage-2019-8"&gt;Facebook quietly removed that slogan from its homepage in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and CEO Mark &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17220534/paid-facebook-ad-free-version-mark-zuckerberg-testimony"&gt;Zuckerberg didn’t rule out a paid version&lt;/a&gt; of Facebook when he testified before Congress in 2018. “There will always be a version of Facebook that is free,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45wcCV"&gt; Zuckerberg called Apple out during &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/facebook-ceo-zuckerberg-says-it.html"&gt;Facebook’s January earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, referring to Apple as one of his company’s biggest competitors. “Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own,” Zuckerberg said. “This impacts the growth of millions of businesses around the world, including with the upcoming iOS 14 changes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ICqgd"&gt;Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9w6JfA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: May 2nd, 1:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds information from Facebook including updated image of the screens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYOygv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMOjQv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>President of Elon Musk’s Neuralink venture tweets that he’s left the company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo illustration of the Neuralink logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kl9vlybEurLZavllfeQ4AfLlSXk=/0x0:3888x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69222460/1232210861.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pJpqJE"&gt;Neuralink President Max Hodak tweeted Saturday that he has left the company he co-founded with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk xxx. Hodak didn’t elaborate on why he left the company or elaborate on the circumstance for his departure. “I am no longer at Neuralink (as of a few weeks ago),” he tweeted. “I learned a ton there and remain a huge cheerleader for the company! Onward to new things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nCy8cC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;✨Some personal news:✨ I am no longer at Neuralink (as of a few weeks ago). I learned a ton there and remain a huge cheerleader for the company! Onward to new things.&lt;/p&gt;— Max Hodak (@max_hodak) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/max_hodak/status/1388620553569726467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zXJ6Lk"&gt;Neuralink is focused on developing brain-machine interfaces. Last month, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374749/elon-musk-neuralink-monkey-pong-brain-interface"&gt;posted a video to YouTube&lt;/a&gt; that appeared to show a monkey with a Neuralink implant in its brain moving a cursor on a computer screen using only its mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYaAcU"&gt;Musk and Hodak founded Neuralink along with several other people in 2016, and Musk has invested millions of dollars of his own money into the venture. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/25/elon-musk-neuralink-update-brain-machine-implants/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that some former employees described a chaotic internal culture at Neuralink, saying that its scientists weren’t always given enough time to complete projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaCURu"&gt;While Neuralink didn’t invent brain-machine interfaces, its technology includes thin, flexible wires and more electrodes than other devices, potentially providing more data. Musk has stated that Neuralink’s technology could one day be used to allow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1380316949087854595?s=20"&gt;paraplegics to walk again&lt;/a&gt; and allow humans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406143/elon-musk-neuralink-ai-pigs-demo-brain-computer-interface"&gt;achieve “AI symbiosis,”&lt;/a&gt; merging the human brain with an artificial intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6q4DU"&gt;But some in the scientific and medical communities have criticized Neuralink and are skeptical of its scientific claims; after an August 2020 demonstration of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406143/elon-musk-neuralink-ai-pigs-demo-brain-computer-interface"&gt;a pig that had a Neuralink device&lt;/a&gt; implanted in its brain, &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/30/1007786/elon-musks-neuralink-demo-update-neuroscience-theater/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; called the company&lt;/a&gt; “neuroscience theater,” and said “most of the company’s medical claims remain highly speculative.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9Myuw"&gt;And as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493224/elon-musk-neuralink-neuroscience-brain-machine"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;Nicole Wetsman wrote&lt;/a&gt; last year, “fixing the brain isn’t an engineering problem.” Scientists need to learn much more about how the brain works before any of the concepts Musk describes can come to pass, she added. “The brain is still mysterious, and the neurological causes of things like anxiety and addiction are still unclear,” Wetsman wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gA2YEj"&gt;Hodak didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Are we seeing the return of the closed-door office? I hope not.</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A 1960s-style open office, with rows of desks and people working." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/md2CsyEq1lunbNeKSc3Lj7D9FLc=/184x0:817x422/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69222357/Apartment_Office_United_Artists.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An open office, 1960s-style.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: United Artists&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q5XPYK"&gt;So it seems that Google, the exemplar of the open-office concept, is trying now to figure out how to keep its design ideals intact while offering its employees at least some feeling of safety in these 6-foot-apart times. Apparently, these measures may include a number of interesting concepts, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/30/22411593/google-post-pandemic-office-plans-inflatable-robot-walls"&gt;such as inflatable walls&lt;/a&gt;. (A GIF of one of those walls slowly unfolding nearly had me doing a spit-take with my morning coffee.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9sHDaq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google’s answer to the problems of open plan offices? Inflatable walls","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/30/22411593/google-post-pandemic-office-plans-inflatable-robot-walls"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3UehDn"&gt;These rather complex measures may have some people wondering whether we should abandon the entire open-office concept and go back to a more old-fashioned — but in these pandemic days, safer — plan of separate offices and high-walled cubicles. To tell you the truth, it doesn’t sound like a bad idea. But.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5kNAq"&gt;First, let me assure you that I am not a great fan of the whole open-office concept myself. As someone who worked out of a home office for many years, and in a traditional office setting before that, while the comradery that the open office encourages is nice, I don’t love the need to dash for a closed-door “phone booth” every time I receive, or need to make, a personal call — or, in fact, any call. I don’t enjoy having to hide in a cubicle in the ladies’ room if I am even a little upset or angry. In fact, before the pandemic hit, I was strongly tempted to put a photo from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crowd_(1928_film)"&gt;1928 film &lt;em&gt;The Crowd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apartment"&gt;1960’s &lt;em&gt;The Apartment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; up at my desk to show that, well, open offices aren’t exactly new to our times.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The open office circa 1928, in King Vidor’s classic silent film The Crowd." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aubfm7IuA7hhVN7pnYReEjkHlm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22481773/the_crowd_1928_king_vidor.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The open office circa 1928, in King Vidor’s classic silent film &lt;em&gt;The Crowd&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="89uARa"&gt;On the other hand… One thing I definitely do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; miss about the traditional office structure is what having a private office represented. It was status. It showed what your boss thought of you and your potential. It represented your place in the organization — both to you, and to everyone else. In &lt;em&gt;The Apartment&lt;/em&gt;, for example, Jack Lemmon plays a worker who is promised his own office if he allows executives to use his apartment for their extramarital flings. In other words, he is strongly tempted to compromise his own ethics in order to gain this status symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4q3g3"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;The Apartment&lt;/em&gt; is just a movie. There are also real-life examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UN4FMQ"&gt;Years ago, a newly-appointed editor-in-chief at a publication where I worked decided that he didn’t like me, but didn’t want to look bad by firing an employee who had a good record with the company. So he reassigned me from a private office to a cubicle next to the sales department, where I had to try to do my work while the guy next to me spent the day shouting into his phone. I, and everyone I worked with, recognized the significance of the move. It was meant to tell other workers that I was a pariah. It was meant to tell vendors and PR reps that I was not respected by my publication, and perhaps they should be dealing with someone else. It was meant to convince me to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A more current type of open office.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mne2pR"&gt;In a truly open office, where nobody (including the editor-in-chief) has their own office, that is no longer an issue. There are other ways, of course, to mistreat an employee — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318369/google-hr-advised-mental-health-leave-racist-sexist-behavior"&gt;lots&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995453/away-luggage-ceo-steph-korey-toxic-work-environment-travel-inclusion"&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21314714/ubisoft-harassment-kotaku-toxic-culture"&gt;ways&lt;/a&gt;. But the use of the office as an indication of your status within the company can be incredibly toxic. If Google, and other current companies, can combine the better features of the open-office system with an increase in privacy and safety, then more power to them — even to their weird, inflating walls.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX’s Crew-1 astronauts make “flawless” nighttime splashdown in Gulf of Mexico</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NASAs SpaceX Crew-1 Splashdown" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j--fdvc1FgBqTrE_psiVCi4w3rQ=/168x0:3833x2443/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69222303/1232642553.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YetoPH"&gt;Four astronauts returned from the International Space Station early Sunday morning aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico nearly six months after arriving at the orbital laboratory in November last year as the first operational, long-duration crew under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqsV5u"&gt;NASA astronauts Mike Hopkins, Victor Glover, and Shannon Walker, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Soichi Noguchi boarded Crew Dragon and undocked from the space station on time at 8:35PM ET Saturday to begin their roughly six-hour trek home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UH3gE"&gt;The crew splashed down off the coast of Panama City, Florida at 2:56AM ET on Sunday, marking the first nighttime splashdown of a crewed US spacecraft since December 1968, when Apollo 8 splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, NASA said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GLB3hA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;strong&gt;68 million frequent flyer miles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmV3Db"&gt;“Dragon, on behalf of NASA and the SpaceX teams, we welcome you back to planet Earth, and thanks for flying SpaceX,” SpaceX mission control said to the crew upon splashing down, throwing in some comedy: “For those of you enrolled in our frequent flyer program, you’ve earned 68 million miles on this voyage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WzB0Cj"&gt;“Resilience is back on planet Earth. And we’ll take those miles — are they transferable?” Resilience commander Hopkins replied from the capsule, as it bobbed in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9PO-3PvYrn6TCx_jnaFmmrReGKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22486385/51153213160_451d2ff2ac_o.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;First-responding speed boats inspect Crew Dragon Resilience minutes after splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gTlzTr"&gt;Crew Dragon’s nighttime plunge in the Gulf of Mexico was seen on a live feed of infrared cameras. A pair of first-responding “fast boats” raced toward the space capsule moments after it splashed down to ensure Crew Dragon’s parachutes detached upon hitting the water, as planned, so they don’t yank the capsule upside down in the water. A SpaceX recovery ship arrived shortly after to hoist Crew Dragon on a platform using a crane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wr8a3"&gt;“It really could not have been a more flawless journey home for Crew Dragon Resilience,” NASA public affairs officer Leah Cheshier said on a live feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3V6G0"&gt;The four astronauts emerged from the capsule with the help of medics, before returning ashore to catch a NASA plane back to the agency’s astronaut headquarters in Houston, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="g9kSfc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21565237/spacex-crew-1-dragon-launch-success-falcon-9-nasa"&gt;Launching to space&lt;/a&gt; from Florida last November, the Crew-1 astronauts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295119/spacex-crew-dragon-iss-nasa-eyes-backup-soyuz-ride"&gt;tallied&lt;/a&gt; about 167 days aboard the space station, a science laboratory orbiting Earth 250 miles above ground that has continuously housed international crews of astronauts for over two decades. Their return was initially set for Wednesday, April 28th, but was delayed due to high winds in the splashdown zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6R36x"&gt;This particular Crew Dragon spacecraft, dubbed &lt;em&gt;Resilience&lt;/em&gt; by its crew, was the second SpaceX capsule to fly humans, coming after SpaceX’s first crewed mission, Demo-2, in May 2020. &lt;em&gt;Resilience &lt;/em&gt;broke the record for the longest-serving US spacecraft to be docked on the ISS, surpassing the 84 days tallied by the 1974 Skylab 4 crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0LawK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/2/21350663/nasa-spacex-crew-dragon-astronauts-bob-behnken-doug-hurley-splash-down"&gt;The first splashdown&lt;/a&gt; of a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule took place in August 2020 for the Demo-2 mission, returning NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley from space after a two-month test mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Uz2cHW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It’s not very often you get to wake up on the space station, and go to sleep in Houston”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VFVF7f"&gt;That mid-day splashdown, also in the Gulf of Mexico, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/2/21351811/spacex-capsule-boaters-splashdown-boats"&gt;attracted a swarm of Florida boaters&lt;/a&gt; coming dangerously close to Crew Dragon. NASA and the US Coast Guard beefed up protections for Crew-1’s splashdown to make sure no curious boaters came close this time, out of caution that the capsule’s flammable fuel could leak and endanger anyone outside the spacecraft. Since splashdown was so early Sunday morning, no boaters were around, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program Steve Stich said in a press conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="inN26H"&gt;“Reentry is hard, and the spacecraft was in a beautiful condition,” NASA’s human exploration chief Kathy Lueders said in a 5AM ET press conference after the Resilience crew splashed down. “But you just worry as you go through the comms blackout — and it was so great to hear Mike’s voice,” she added, referring to the moments of radio silence as Crew Dragon plunges through Earth’s atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGdkZ2"&gt;“All four crew members are doing really well,” NASA’s chief flight director Holly Ridings said at the news conference. “It’s not very often you get to wake up on the space station, and go to sleep in Houston... The orbital mechanics and the weather don’t always work out, but today they did.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer Chromebook Spin 513 review: a chip off a new block</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A sleek, but slow, Chromebook&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="c4AR1O"&gt;The $399.99 Acer Chromebook Spin 513 (currently listed at $349) is one of the very first Snapdragon-powered Chromebooks to hit the market. Specifically, it’s powered by the Snapdragon 7c Compute SC7180, the type of chip you’d generally expect to see in a tablet or phone. Just from seeing that name, some readers can probably predict exactly what this device is going to be: a lightweight, mediocre performer with excellent battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 open, seen from the back, on a stone bench." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/POZKfbR9jgVDkQCLrCSZOKfgihE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480601/mchin_20190722_4563_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Say hello.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="urY4aB"&gt;That’s pretty much what it is — but you get some other nice bonuses, too. The display is much nicer than those I’ve seen on other Chromebooks at this price. It’s portable at 2.65 pounds, its speakers and microphones are serviceable, and it has a really smooth Gorilla Glass touchpad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWWZUU"&gt;If performance is your priority, there are Chromebooks with better processors you can get for this price. But if it’s not, the Chromebook Spin 513 outshines even more-expensive competitors in a few other areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bZt89N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10475676"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 on a stone bench, seen from above, open. The screen displays a pastoral landscape." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OKipoVnpQd2IIyXi9qHyhE3sxnk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480602/mchin_20190722_4563_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You could fool me into thinking this was $600.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uFeCgG"&gt;Look through the Chromebooks available at the $300-$400 price point, and you’ll see a whole lot of clunkers. Take a look at Lenovo’s $349 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22400085/lenovo-ideapad-flex-3-chromebook-review-price-screen"&gt;Flex 3 Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, for example, or its $309 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Flenovo%2Fstudent-chromebooks%2FLenovo-Chromebook-C340-11%2Fp%2F88LGCC31288&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22412759%2Facer-chromebook-spin-513-review-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chromebook C340&lt;/a&gt;. They’re thicker than the Spin 513, with big bezels, and they both look like they were built in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQ6TDO"&gt;But the Spin 513 looks and feels like it belongs in a higher price category. Acer’s model is thinner than both of these devices at 0.61 inches, and has a much more modern look. The lid is made of aluminum, and the reflective Acer logo adds some flair. The bezels on the sides and top are reasonably small, while still leaving plenty of room to hold as a tablet. It’s also quite portable at 2.65 pounds — easy to carry with one hand, and to slip into a backpack or briefcase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 on a stone bench, half open, seen from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y6NL1m7suvbUVxlne5Do2SgfBJY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480595/mchin_20190722_4563_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB-C, USB-A, audio jack on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 on a stone bench, closed, seen from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o876F34nXOWj3njeHTtB2-GmoZQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480596/mchin_20190722_4563_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And another USB-C on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="amn8xF"&gt;Speaking of tablet mode, the hinge is sturdy, and you need two hands to open the lid. I’m okay with this, though, because there’s also almost no screen wobble (and screen wobble is the worst). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="CQOw6v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10475703"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UjmgXL"&gt;The chassis has some other features you don’t often see at this price point. The keyboard is backlit, which is a huge surprise. It also offers a comfortable typing experience, with satisfying keys that are still quiet. I’m picky about touchpads, but this one is quite roomy, with a smooth Gorilla Glass surface — I’d choose it over plenty of touchpads I’ve used on multi-thousand dollar Windows laptops. And you get a good, modern port selection including two USB Type-C ports (supporting USB 3.2 Gen 1, DisplayPort, and DC-in), one USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, and a 3.5mm combination audio jack. There’s a USB-C on both sides, which I’m very happy about for charging convenience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CQKU0"&gt;But the biggest highlight for me is the display. I generally expect to see bad panels at the $349 price point — the Flex 3 and the C340 are both small (11.6 inches), low-resolution (1366 x 768), and dim. But the Spin 513 has a quite nice 1920 x 1080 screen, which is as good of a resolution as you’ll ever see on any laptop at this price. It delivers a crisp picture, and it gets bright enough for even some outdoor use (if you’re in the shade). If you’re looking for an affordable Netflix machine, the Spin is a great candidate — especially given its movie-friendly 16:9 aspect ratio. Oh, and it even has USI stylus support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wC8K1F"&gt;My one disappointment was audio. The Spin comes with two stereo speakers, as well as two microphones. The Chromebook delivered decent volume — certainly enough to fill a room — but percussion was tinny as I listened to music, and you can forget about bass entirely. I also heard some occasional distortion at maximum volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 keyboard deck seen from above, angled slightly to the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YHY6qzs01ejvZ-_snRtqbGa-v8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480600/mchin_20190722_4563_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer calls this the “FineTip” keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SySAnv"&gt;Inside, the 7c processor comes paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Some models will support LTE connectivity, though my test unit did not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7n7ej"&gt;The 7c certainly works — but the experience was a bit slow. I’ve been using the Spin as my primary work driver for a week, and I was able to get done &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the things I needed to — Google Docs for work, emailing, tweeting, etc. But I got impatient at times. Resizing a window or sending it to fullscreen, for example, takes just a bit longer than it does on $600 devices. There were occasions where my Google Doc would freeze, and I’d have to wait a couple seconds to resume working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krtsMq"&gt;Unlike with ARM Windows machines, the Spin 513 doesn’t come with restrictions on which Android apps you can download. But some of them were glitchy. Slack, for example, was only usable in a tiny phone-sized window, and completely froze whenever I tried to fullscreen it. Gmail also occasionally froze when I tried to archive messages by swiping, and I sometimes had to repeat the action. I didn’t have either issue when using the same apps on the Intel-based Flex 3 last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxilwd"&gt;And some things didn’t work at all. Zoom meetings in the Zoom app weren’t possible on this device — despite using the same internet connection I always use, my audio lagged so far behind on calls that people couldn’t understand me. Editing a batch of photos in Google Photos was also a slow and stuttery experience that I wouldn’t recommend. It’s hard to know whether these can be attributed to Snapdragon compatibility issues that will improve over time, or whether they’re beyond what the processor can do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2f13N"&gt;Now, none of this means the Spin 513 is a bad laptop. But it does mean I’m not the target audience for this Chromebook, and my standard office workload is a bit above its ideal ceiling. You certainly wouldn’t want to use this if you’re doing anything more than what I was doing. That includes anything elaborate with Linux, and anything that requires an external monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 seen from the left, half open, on a stone bench. An apartment building is in the background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZ0IhfLSaqJxuGZscfAPreM6fvE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480598/mchin_20190722_4563_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I just want to Zoom, man.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The top right corner of the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zh9C9sBOdlE-jNkt7Lh7LNexA0g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480599/mchin_20190722_4563_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No fingerprint sensor on this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="50oFTc"&gt;For comparison, the Spin 513 is largely competing with Mediatek and Intel Celeron machines. It’s difficult to compare the Snapdragon 7c to these chipsets (in terms of power) because their architecture is completely different. The best I can say is that anecdotally, I had a slightly faster experience on the Flex 3 with the Celeron N4020. Zoom calls were more feasible on that machine (though they were still bad). With that said, I don’t think the difference is noticeable enough to make the Flex 3 a better buy unless you’re really picky. Both devices are really only meant for basic tasks. Think more elementary school level as opposed to high school or college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="ROe2l7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10475715"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BvD5rQ"&gt;The flipside of this low performance is that the Spin’s battery life is really excellent. I averaged 10 hours and 15 minutes to a charge. That was continuous use, with a more intense workload than anyone should really be putting this Chromebook through, and screen brightness at 50 percent. If your brightness will be lower, you’re doing easier things than I am, and you’re taking some breaks (likely on all three counts), I imagine you’ll be able to go a couple days without needing an outlet. The 45W charger is also quite small, and won’t add much weight to your backpack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 sits on a stone bench, open. The screen displays a pastoral scene." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kISaT_FNIA5KDjORQajNlqumZDY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480592/mchin_20190722_4563_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No glare here. (This was in the shade.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Q06Nvf"&gt;The big question with a Chromebook that costs $399.99 is whether the drawbacks are things you can live with. In this case, the big drawback (and the big area where the Spin 513 is a bit behind competitors) is the processor and the limited RAM. It’s important to understand what this system &lt;em&gt;isn’t &lt;/em&gt;made to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fspPs7"&gt;But if you’re mostly looking for YouTube and light browsing, this Chromebook is definitely the best value I’ve seen at its price point. When it comes to the keyboard, touchpad, and screen, as well as the sturdy build, hinge, and modern port selection, it’s more comparable to something like the $649 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt; than to other budget Chromebooks like the Flex 3 and the C340. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9pMtg"&gt;The more interesting comparison is to Lenovo’s $279 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Chromebook Duet,&lt;/a&gt; which also comes with 4GB of RAM, as well as a MediaTek chip. If you’re open to a tablet form factor, that device has better battery life, and its processor flies. But it’s also quite a small device (10.1 inches), so it won’t be a better buy if you’re looking for a full-sized laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yWpAa"&gt;The Chromebook Spin 513 won’t be for everyone. But it’s certainly the device it set out to be — a long-lasting, portable machine for light workloads — and if you’re shopping in the $399 range, it’s certainly worth a look. &lt;/p&gt;
