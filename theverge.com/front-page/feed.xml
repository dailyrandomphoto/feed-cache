    <title>China launches latest crew of three en route to nation’s Tianhe space station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hVjZKx"&gt;China successfully launched a new crew of three taikonauts into orbit this afternoon, sending them en route to the country’s primary space station, dubbed Tianhe. The crew will &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/china-shenzhou-13-astronaut-launch-webcast"&gt;meet up with the station in roughly eight hours&lt;/a&gt;, sparking a six-month stay in orbit. It’s set to be the longest mission taikonauts have ever taken in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="firstHeading"&gt;The three taikonauts include commander Zhai Zhigang, Wang Yaping, and Ye Guangfu, part of China’s Shenzhou 13 mission. Zhai has been to space before and even performed the first spacewalk for China back in 2008 during the Shenzhou 7 mission. This will be Wang’s second spaceflight, and she will become the first woman to visit the Tianhe station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TOreLt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wang will become the first woman to visit the Tianhe station&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NDniLS"&gt;While onboard the space station, the crew will test out technologies needed to continue construction and assembly on Tianhe. China launched the core module for Tianhe back in April, and the country plans to add two more modules to it throughout 2022. The Shenzhou 13 crew will also test out the station’s robotic arm, using it to move a spacecraft attached on one docking port to another, &lt;a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-10-14/Shenzhou-13-China-to-send-another-3-astronauts-to-space-on-Saturday-14lRSJXnj5C/index.html"&gt;according to CGTN&lt;/a&gt;. A couple of spacewalks are also planned to add a “robotic arm adaptor and suspension system” to help with future space station construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgJoja"&gt;This is China’s second crew to live on Tianhe long-term. The last crew of three &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537815/china-rocket-launch-astronauts-crew"&gt;launched in June&lt;/a&gt; and lived on the station for three months before returning in September. Shenzhou 13 is part of 11 planned launches to fully construct the Tianhe space station by next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tether will pay $41 million over ‘misleading’ claims it was fully backed by US dollars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cryptocurrency Illustrations As Musk Roils Crypto Market" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jmksx5P5lWpchuky6NlbHQyTOdQ=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000133/1233100485.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tether will be fined $41 million | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n04D5w"&gt;Tether will pay $41 million to settle allegations by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that it made untrue or misleading statements when it claimed its stablecoins were fully backed by fiat currencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIisGB"&gt;The CFTC said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21"&gt;statement Friday&lt;/a&gt; that between June 2016 and February 2019, Tether misrepresented to customers and the cryptocurrencies markets that it had “sufficient US dollar reserves” to back every token when, in fact, its reserves were not fully backed the majority of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8IQAJY"&gt;In addition, the CFTC said, Tether failed to disclose that it included unsecured receivables and non-fiat assets as part of its reserves, falsely telling investors it would conduct routine audits to show it maintained 100 percent of reserves at all times, even though its reserves were not audited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TaWZV8"&gt;“This case highlights the expectation of honesty and transparency in the rapidly growing and developing digital assets marketplace,” acting CFTC chairman Rostin Behnam said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzkQuR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal"&gt;Tether was investigated&lt;/a&gt; by the New York attorney general for claims about its backing, setting with the agency in February. Under the terms of that settlement, Tether is prohibited from doing business in New York state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1TuOd"&gt;Tether said in a &lt;a href="https://tether.to/statement-on-tethers-settlement-with-the-cftc/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Friday that the CFTC order “found no issues relating to Tether’s current operations,” adding that issues in the agency’s order were resolved when Tether updated its terms of service in February 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvjPro"&gt;“As to the Tether reserves, there is no finding that tether tokens were not fully backed at all times — simply that the reserves were not all in cash and all in a bank account titled in Tether’s name, at all times,” Tether’s statement continues. “As Tether represented in the Order, it has always maintained adequate reserves and has never failed to satisfy a redemption request.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZ95HD"&gt;The inquiry by the CFTC “arose during a markedly different time in our ecosystem,” according to Tether, and dealt with challenges it says were common in the digital currency industry at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FdVJ4"&gt;Tether is a digital currency known as a stablecoin, typically backed by a fiat currency like the US dollar or the Euro. They’re used mainly as payment vehicles and viewed as more stable (hence the name) than other digital currencies because they’re backed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsOmDo"&gt;CFTC commissioner Dawn D. Stump said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/stumpstatement101521"&gt;concurring statement&lt;/a&gt; that she agreed with the terms of the settlement, as “there were misrepresentations regarding the assets backing Tether, specifically that the USDt tokens were backed 1-to-1 by US dollars.  The evidence establishes that this assurance provided to tether customers was not 100% true, 100% of the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jdsdzu"&gt;But Stump added she was concerned that the settlement might cause confusion among investors, noting that the CFTC “does not regulate stablecoins, and we do not have daily insight into the businesses” involved with stablecoins. Stump questioned whether “the actions of the CFTC in entering into this settlement with the Tether respondents create a false sense of security for those investing in stablecoins?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ymDY3f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Tether controversy, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="r0oK2X"&gt;The CFTC also announced Friday that Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange affiliated with Tether, has been fined $1.5 million for “illegal, off-exchange retail commodity transactions in digital assets” with Americans, in violation of the &lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7380-16"&gt;terms of a 2016 order&lt;/a&gt; from the CFTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIOYjO"&gt;In a statement, Tether said the CFTC’s findings regarding Bitfinex “relate to the timing and implementation of its ban on U.S. customers,” noting the CFTC’s order found no violations after December 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLZtxe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Batman is getting another Fortnite comic crossover with one of the game’s most mysterious characters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ioquGQUoXmBSCIuPheRwStXZYjA=/0x102:3030x2122/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999934/Untitled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DWjjEo"&gt;Epic and DC Comics are teaming up again for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303107/batman-fortnite-comic-crossover-epic-games-dc-launch-date"&gt;another crossover&lt;/a&gt; with the one-shot comic &lt;em&gt;Batman/Fortnite: Foundation&lt;/em&gt; #1, which will arrive in comic book stores on Tuesday, October 26th. The physical comic will also include a bonus code for a Batman Who Laughs skin (which will also be available for purchase in the in-game store) and an exclusive loading screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GezDku"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"With Batman: Zero Point, Fortnite’s lore makes a lot more sense","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399355/batman-fortnite-zero-point-comic-book"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XclQG7"&gt;The new comic will pick up after the six-issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399355/batman-fortnite-zero-point-comic-book"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman: Zero Point&lt;/em&gt; crossover comics&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this year. But unlike last time, where the Caped Crusader was transported to Fortnite’s uniquely violent island, in the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Batman/Fortnite: Foundation&lt;/em&gt; one-shot, the island — or at least, one of its most mysterious denizens — is coming to face off against Batman in Gotham City:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aQpNaB"&gt;Returning to Gotham City after the events of &lt;em&gt;Zero Point&lt;/em&gt;, Batman is faced with a new mystery and a new arrival. The Foundation, an enigmatic figure from Fortnite Island, emerges from the depths of Gotham Harbor, and the Dark Knight wants to investigate what he is doing in his city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="43VRoO"&gt;The new comic also sounds like it’ll tie even deeper into Fortnite’s burgeoning lore, given the emphasis on &lt;a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/The_Foundation"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious character who appeared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333635/fortnites-season-6-single-player-event-storytelling"&gt;during Fortnite’s season six finale event&lt;/a&gt; and helped Agent Jones contain the energy of the exploding Zero Point (that sentence won’t make any sense unless you’ve been following the increasingly elaborate storyline of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s second season). The character also appeared at the bottom of a river &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lBFoxLvYHs"&gt;in the current season eight story trailer&lt;/a&gt;, hinting at a return soon — which presumably will tie into the upcoming Batman comic in some fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz52BY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman/Fortnite: Foundation #&lt;/em&gt;1 also features a unique list of creatives behind the project: it’s co-written by Epic Games’ chief creative office Donald Mustard, Christos Gage (who wrote the previous Batman/Fornite crossover comics), and Scott Snyder, best known for his elaborate &lt;em&gt;Dark Nights Metal&lt;/em&gt; Batman comics (which introduced the villainous Batman Who Laughs character).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1CWS0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best budget laptop of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Cheap Laptop 2021: HP Envy x360 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/91Ojp27YU24CRpqeGNGMFxMlSuQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807794/mchin_200705_4086_0001.0.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best cheap laptops for video editing, gaming, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="3v5Ons"&gt;If you’re shopping for the best cheap laptop of 2021, the question to ask is: what’s most important, and what are you willing to sacrifice? Even the best cheap laptops aren’t perfect in every area — they have some strengths but cut corners to achieve their price tags. You can almost certainly find a budget laptop with a touchscreen, a premium-looking chassis, an HDMI port, a backlit keyboard, or stylus support, but you may need to consider which of those features you want the most, and which you can go without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqLems"&gt;Our pick for the best cheap laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. We feel that the Envy has build quality, performance, and battery life that surpass those of many premium laptops. But we’ve tested dozens of systems in the sub-$800 range, and we’ve got a number of additional models on this list from Lenovo, Acer, Samsung, HP, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVG16P"&gt;Our other picks for the best cheap laptop of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these laptops also appear on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptop&lt;/a&gt; lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPoJxi"&gt;Many of our picks for the best cheap laptop of 2021 are currently Chromebooks. We believe that Chromebooks are, in many cases, the best-value option for shoppers seeking a laptop under $500 and tend to offer better specs, features, and build quality than most Windows laptops at that price point. We hope to add more Windows laptops under $500 to this page in the future and are keeping a close eye on those releases.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 13 is the best cheap laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best cheap laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="r62WQ4"&gt;HP’s Envy x360 13, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeBestLaptop101521&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-x360-laptop-13z-ay000-8lz58av-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $689&lt;/a&gt; is the best budget laptop you can buy under $800. With a high-quality and sturdy convertible build, it looks like a device that should cost twice its price. It has plenty of other great features as well, including a really excellent keyboard and a bright, colorful screen. It’s also exceptional on the inside. Thanks to its AMD Ryzen processor, the system delivers all-day battery life and very smooth performance — it can even handle some light gaming. (Intel options are available as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ox216u"&gt;We have some minor complaints about the Envy, of course. The screen is 16:9, which is a cramped aspect ratio for multitasking. Our test unit had a somewhat limited port selection (notably, missing Thunderbolt and HDMI support) and came with some bloatware preinstalled. But none of these are deal-breakers at the Envy’s price point. Overall, budget shoppers will want for very little with this machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best laptop under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hyeIry"&gt;If you’re looking for an absurdly cheap Chromebook that absolutely gets the job done, you should definitely be looking at the $260 Lenovo Chromebook Duet. The Duet is a 10-inch aluminum alloy Chrome OS tablet that comes with a kickstand and keyboard cover. It looks sturdy and classy, and it can easily function as either a tablet or a PC. But you’re not compromising &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;much on performance for this device’s tiny size; as long as you’re not running dozens of tabs and apps, you should be fine. And we got over 11 hours of battery life in our testing, making it one of the longest-lasting Chromebooks we’ve seen in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHlVCe"&gt;The main thing to know about the Chromebook Duet is that the screen is quite small — just 10.1 inches. That’s a fine size for a young student (especially with the touch capability) and for an adult’s secondary device for note-taking, Netflixing, and the like, but it’s not an ideal size for a primary work device unless you’re fine with quite a bit of squinting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop with Chrome OS &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="N34v09"&gt;If you’d prefer a more traditional Chromebook with a clamshell form factor, the $329 Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is an affordable option that’s all-around excellent. It has a gorgeous 3:2 display that delivers a sharp picture and bright, vibrant colors with plenty of vertical space. The screen alone would make the Chromebook Spin 713 a standout, but it has a number of other strengths as well, including a great keyboard, all-day battery life, and a comprehensive port selection, including an HDMI, in addition to USB-C, USB-A, and a microSD slot. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 is the best cheap laptop with a built-in stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h2 id="SSaLnR"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best cheap laptop with a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iQA7Ph"&gt;If you like the Duet’s size and detachable form factor but are willing to spend on something a bit more upscale, you may find the Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 to be a better choice. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, kickstand, and detachable screen. But the CM3’s kickstand folds multiple ways: you can crease it lengthwise to stand the tablet up like a laptop or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. Plus, it comes with a built-in USI stylus and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. Battery life was also quite impressive: we averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUYikQ"&gt;Where the CM3 lags a bit behind the Duet (and other cheap laptops you may try) is the power. Its MediaTek processor can be a bit sluggish compared to more pricier offerings. But the CM3 still offers a surprising number of perks for its sub-$400 price and makes a great student driver or secondary device. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a 13-inch powerhouse that weighs almost nothing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best thin-and-light laptop under $1000&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="o8zBHM"&gt;If you’re looking for a budget Windows laptop that’s thinner and lighter than the Envy x360 while delivering similar category-topping performance, the $669 HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a good choice for you. It has a powerful eight-core Ryzen processor, which is one of the fastest processors for thin and light laptops that you can get. Not only does it perform well, but it’s also unbelievably light at just 2.1 pounds, and it comes with a blindingly bright 16:10 screen. It’s a standout in battery life, too — I averaged almost 11 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOWROI"&gt;HP did have to cut a few corners to achieve those benefits at this price point. The audio on our model wasn’t great, and the device shipped with some cheap bloatware installed. But the Pavilion Aero 13 is excellent in almost every other way, and it won’t disappoint if you’re looking for a functional, cheap Windows PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;An affordable laptop with a bold look&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pT23AG"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable Chromebook that stands out from the crowd, the $549 Galaxy Chromebook 2 should be on your list. It comes in a bold “fiesta red” color (as well as a regular gray, if you prefer to blend in). It’s a touchscreen convertible with stylus support (though the stylus isn’t included). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QIDME"&gt;On top of the design, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 includes an excellent QLED panel, which is one of the best displays we’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. You also get a solid keyboard, decent battery life (we averaged 7 hours and 21 minutes of continuous work), and a port selection that includes two USB-C ports, a microSD slot, and a headphone jack. It’s easily one of the best Chromebooks you can buy and one of the best cheap laptops as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best cheap laptop for Surface fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9t4Ji3"&gt;The $399 Surface Go 2 is a 10.5-inch tablet that’s about the size of a regular iPad. You’ll have to buy the keyboard cover separately, but the overall package is still quite affordable if you’re buying a lower-priced model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hPLGr"&gt;You can configure the Surface Go 2 with a Pentium Gold or Core m3 processor. Those aren’t the fanciest or most powerful processors, but the system should still be adequate for your streaming and browsing needs, especially if you only need it to do one task at a time. It can run any Windows app, it’s easy to carry around, and it makes a solid secondary computer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best budget laptop for students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DeUYiZ"&gt;Many of the best cheap laptops might be good choices for high school and college students, but the Acer Swift 3’s exceptionally durable build makes it an excellent choice for backpack-battering and dining hall spills. Its 14-inch screen also gives you more room for homework multitasking than some of the 13-inch machines here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVxnSd"&gt;But the highlight of the Swift 3 is its Ryzen 4000 processors. We tested a model with a Ryzen 7 4700U, which did an excellent job handling our daily multitasking workload, and delivered seven-hour battery life as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWSkuR"&gt;On the outside, the Swift 3 isn’t the thinnest or most beautiful laptop you can buy, but it’s a solid performer in most areas. It has all kinds of ports, including USB-C, USB-A, and an HDMI. The backlit keyboard has a nice click to it and has a reliable integrated fingerprint reader as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;A cheap laptop with standout build&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HqEdaD"&gt;The Yoga C740 is as straightforward as a laptop can get. It has a sturdy aluminum build and perfectly fine 10th Gen Intel processors. We were pleasantly surprised by the device’s audio — the upward-firing speakers on the sides of the keyboard deliver a nice surround-sound experience. The keyboard and touchpad are both quite comfortable to use. There’s not much to complain about and not much to enthusiastically praise — if you’re looking for a sub-$800 Windows laptop with a well-made aluminum chassis and a sturdy frame, you’re looking for the Yoga. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGHm6c"&gt;The C740 is a year old now, but that means you can get it at very affordable prices. We’re looking forward to reviewing its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373719/lenovo-yoga-7i-6-convertible-laptops-intel-amd-processors-windows"&gt;Yoga 7i&lt;/a&gt;, shortly in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just fired a leader of the #AppleToo movement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MsR1rRZa5V1NA66eGMooeWmxaQA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999823/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wmn5zY"&gt;Apple has fired Janneke Parrish, a leader of the #AppleToo movement, amid a broad crackdown on leaks and worker organizing. Parrish, a program manager on Apple Maps, was terminated for deleting files off of her work devices during an internal investigation — an action Apple categorized as “non-compliance,” according to people familiar with the situation. The files included apps like Robinhood, Pokémon GO, and Google Drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZWZrT"&gt;Internally, some employees expressed disbelief that Parrish’s firing could be anything other than retaliation for organizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7DJxKT"&gt;It’s the second time in recent months that an employee has been terminated after speaking out about Apple’s company culture. In September, the tech giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22666049/apple-fires-senior-engineering-program-manager-ashley-gjovik-for-allegedly-leaking-information"&gt;fired Ashley Gjøvik &lt;/a&gt;for allegedly leaking confidential information. Gjøvik has filed multiple charges with the NLRB related to how Apple treated her and the broader workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoDODk"&gt;Gjøvik’s latest charge alleges that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-ceo-s-anti-leak-edict-broke-the-law-ex-employee-alleges?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Tim Cook’s anti-leaking memo might violate US labor law&lt;/a&gt;. In September, the CEO sent a note to all Apple employees saying that “people who leak confidential information do not belong” at Apple. He also said the company was doing “everything in our power to identify those who leaked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66nB9c"&gt;The comments were related to an all-hands meeting on September 17th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687747/tim-cook-employee-leak-memos-do-not-belong-at-apple"&gt;which leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qg3J4K"&gt;Apple’s recent actions seem designed to chill worker organizing. In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;employees launched the #AppleToo website&lt;/a&gt; to allow workers across the company — including AppleCare and retail — to submit stories about workplace harassment and discrimination. Parrish and Cher Scarlett, an Apple software engineer, then began &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@UrsulaRa"&gt;sharing these stories on Medium&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7nECa"&gt;Parrish declined to comment for this story. Her attorney, Vincent P. White of White, Hilferty and Albanese, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge:&lt;/em&gt; “We can confirm she is no longer with Apple but cannot speak further to address the situation at this time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YacI3p"&gt;Scarlett is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/14/apple-worker-cher-scarlett/"&gt;currently on paid medical leave&lt;/a&gt; due to internal harassment she’s received while advocating for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;remote work&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;pay transparency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6l1JD"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch says passwords weren’t exposed in massive data breach</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A4VEkwYODEuYKUZOu_cJUMwS82Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999719/acastro_200901_1777_twitch_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ebknHa"&gt;Twitch has definitively stated that passwords weren’t exposed in last week’s major data breach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeWPKD"&gt;“Twitch passwords have not been exposed,” Twitch said in an update to its webpage about &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/10/15/updates-on-the-twitch-security-incident/"&gt;the security incident&lt;/a&gt;. “We are also confident that systems that store Twitch login credentials, which are hashed with bcrypt, were not accessed, nor were full credit card numbers or ACH / bank information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tR4Vv"&gt;Last week, what appeared to be leaked source code for Twitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712250/twitch-hack-leak-data-streamer-revenue-steam-competitor"&gt;hit the web&lt;/a&gt;, and in Friday’s update, Twitch confirmed that was the case. “The exposed data primarily contained documents from Twitch’s source code repository, as well as a subset of creator payout data,” the company said. Twitch claims that the information exposed “only affected a small fraction of users, and the customer impact is minimal,” and it says it is following up directly with those who were affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqITPK"&gt;Sources who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last week painted a picture of a company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714160/twitch-hack-security-data-breach-problems"&gt;with bad security practices&lt;/a&gt; and detailed a previously unreported security problem that took place in 2017. On Thursday, &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reported on &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkb7qg/urgent-pizza-untold-story-of-the-largest-twitch-hack-in-history"&gt;another massive hack&lt;/a&gt; that happened in 2014. In Friday’s update, Twitch said it has “taken steps to further secure our service.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZmBIZI’s $550 Z2 phone pays you for your data usage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HzIRy1GZvCR0i5xnYHyUYlIdLa0=/0x0:2522x1681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999652/image__1___1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZmBIZI Z2 is a the $550 4G phone that pays you for the personal data you share on your phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HflYoT"&gt;We live so much of our lives on our smartphones these days that our mobile devices are just full of valuable data that we often unknowingly and freely give to all the major tech companies: our spending habits, our personal preferences, our locations, and much more. Since we can’t really live without our phones, and tech companies aren’t going to stop monetizing our data without a fight, we might as well get our cut of the data pie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ooKny"&gt;That’s the premise of ZmBIZI phones, the LA-based and minority-owned startup backed by the &lt;a href="https://streetcredcapital.com/portfolio-item/zmbizi/"&gt;fintech lender Street Cred Capital&lt;/a&gt; that is trying to make our phones work for us. Both its new phone, the Z2, and its proprietary software are designed to share the profit that your mobile data generate, back with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUyqmx"&gt;I spoke with ZmBIZI co-founder &lt;a href="https://www.gq.co.za/culture/entertainment/alpesh-patel-the-african-connection-16554524"&gt;Alpesh Patel&lt;/a&gt;, the former director of sales at Motorola in Africa and founder of Mi-Fone in Africa, who explained ZmBIZI’s ambitions on both the hardware and software fronts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoyxnN"&gt;ZmBIZI is putting its bets on its new $550 unlocked 4G phone, the Z2. It has a high-resolution, 6.67-inch Full HD+ LCD display (1080 x 2400 pixels; 20:9 aspect ratio), a MediaTek Helio P60 processor, 8GB RAM, and 128GB of storage. The version I saw through a Zoom video call has a glossy fuchsia back cover with transparent cut-outs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdwasm"&gt;Like many phones these days, the Z2 has multiple cameras on the back. It has a 64-megapixel rear camera, a 16-megapixel wide-angle, 5-megapixel macro, and a 0.3-megapixel photosensitive one. The Z2 is powered by a 4,400mAh battery, has a dual-SIM slot, but has no 3.5mm audio jack. According to &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/this-startups-flagship-smartphone-pays-you"&gt;PCMag’s research, this phone is likely a rebrand of Cubot X50&lt;/a&gt; with some tweaks. PCMag also notes that it will work best on AT&amp;amp;T’s network, will have limited coverage on T-Mobile, and is unlikely to work at all on Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mk4JnC"&gt;Most importantly, the Z2 can accept contactless payments through NFC, which means it can be used as a point-of-sale terminal for someone running a food truck without additional hardware, for example. This is actually the first phone &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210616005325/en/Visa-Launches-its-First-U.S.-Tap-to-Phone-Pilot-in-Washington-D.C.-to-Support-Region%E2%80%99s-Black-Owned-Small-Businesses"&gt;Visa has partnered with to pilot its Tap to Phone&lt;/a&gt; program in America. This means customers can just tap their existing forms of payment (card or Apple or Google Pay) rather than download a third-party app like Venmo to pay or use a card swiping dongle from Square. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OnR7PacRrSulpTnWKQ_A0q-pKEQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22928858/ZmBIZI_Z2_back.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;ZmBIZI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZmBIZI Z2 has quad cameras on the back, with a 64-megapixel main camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S8fgQ4"&gt;The main selling point of this phone is that you can earn ZmBIZI Coins by using partnered apps or doing organic smartphone tasks on the Z2. It’s similar to using cash-back websites like Rakuten to shop, where you get money back by buying at their partnered retailers. Each ZmBIZI coin is equivalent to $0.01 USD, and when you’ve accumulated at least $20 USD, then you can move your coins onto a digital Visa debit card preloaded on the phone, which enables you to use that money in the real world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Us7qjW"&gt;The website and press materials claim you can make an average of $10 per month from the Z2, but that number feels very optimistic. Patel explained the payment scheme this way: when you buy something with your credit card on your phone, the retailer will share a fraction of the 3.5-percentage processing fee with ZmBIZI, and ZmBIZI will share 1/5 of that amount, evenly divided by the number of its users. This is the amount you can expect. Perhaps other things you do on the phone, such as viewing ads, will offer bigger payouts, but it’s hard to tell over a short Zoom call with limited app demonstrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dww2f"&gt;Based on what I could see over Zoom and the company’s website, the Z2 homescreen has a circular launcher that ZmBIZI plans to serve custom ads to its users, so they can watch and get paid. This feature is more of a concept rather than a reality at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfnTlI"&gt;The Z2’s list of curated apps with rewards is long and often strange; you can see the complete list by hovering your mouse over different app icons on its &lt;a href="https://zmbizi.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. For example, you can get paid by doing something very simple, like using Yahoo Search rather than Google to search the web, because they have a paid partnership. There’s also an aptly named app called Earn Money, which gives you tasks like snap photos around your neighborhood and surveys to complete to earn your rewards. Perhaps you’d prefer the Smilecheck app, where “the more you smile, the more you get paid” — my guess is that you’d be feeding the AI valuable facial recognition information. It’s not clear whether each app will disclose how and where it will be using the information it collects about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbqIaS"&gt;Some of these coin-earning tasks are essentially asking you, the user, to allow yourself to become a data guinea pig, but I’m not sure the minimal reward will be worthwhile. I used to do &lt;a href="https://surveys.google.com/google-opinion-rewards/"&gt;Google’s Opinion Rewards surveys&lt;/a&gt; for fun until I got bored answering the same few questions, never redeemed my Google Play points, and have since lost track of my account. With the Z2, I guess even if you stop participating in the data collection, you’ll still be able to use the $550 Z2 as a fully functioning phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21FqN5"&gt;Who knows if the company will be able to realize its vision of paying its users for their data usage or if the startup will just fold. Back in 2017, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/7/14841604/freedompop-free-mobile-plan-android-smartphone-v7"&gt;FreedomPop V7 phone in Europe&lt;/a&gt; had promised a “free mobile plan for life,” but it offered such low data limits (200 megabytes) that made the company pivot its strategy again. Or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/21/22635779/ceo-saygus-smartphone-company-fraud"&gt;Saygus company&lt;/a&gt; that raised money in 2006 for a new phone that was never made and ended up defrauding investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0sYht"&gt;If you don’t mind taking a bet on ZmBIZI, you can pre-order the unlocked ZmBIZI Z2 directly from its &lt;a href="https://zmbizi.com/"&gt;website &lt;/a&gt;now (the phone should be available for sale by November 2021).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XDpTh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mobile app helps people manage their blood pressure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hello Heart app and blood pressure monitor." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0RPsJe2n6F_S_U_Ut7IHg1i13GM=/0x0:880x587/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999648/Monitor_mock1_with_phone_overlapping.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Hello Heart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vsr8mg"&gt;People with high blood pressure who used a smartphone app and at-home monitor were able to drive down their blood pressure, &lt;a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.27008?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=101521"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; showed. The program, called Hello Heart, lets people track their blood pressure, weight, and physical activity and offers tips on how to manage blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JbURGh"&gt;Around half of adults in the United States have high blood pressure, but only around a quarter of those people have the condition under control. It can be a tricky condition to manage, particularly if people are only getting measurements taken in the doctor’s office — where it can be higher (from the stress of a doctor’s visit) or lower (through a condition called masked hypertension) than it is at home. But it can be dangerous and puts people at risk for heart disease and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtplHK"&gt;Digital health approaches to managing blood pressure, which give people resources to track the condition at home, are appealing to doctors and researchers because they could be widely distributed. The Hello Heart program includes a blood pressure monitor that automatically sends readings directly to an app. The app monitors trends and automatically gives users strategies to improve their blood pressure with things like diet and exercise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8KmBm"&gt;After one year using the program, over 85 percent of people with stage two hypertension, a condition that puts people at risk for heart disease, had reductions in their systolic pressure — which measures the amount of force blood puts on artery walls while the heart is squeezing. They stayed at lower levels over the course of three years, according to the study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5BAbR"&gt;The app was also effective for people with less serious conditions: around half of people with elevated blood pressure had reductions after a year, as did around 70 percent of people with stage one hypertension. People who signed into the app more frequently saw greater impacts and tended to have lower blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIY82X"&gt;This analysis of the Hello Heart program included over 28,000 participants. People who had certain employer-based health insurance plans and a diagnosis for high blood pressure were asked if they wanted to participate. They ranged in age from 43 to 58, and most lived in areas with higher socioeconomic status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JjOy7"&gt;Most notably, the study tracked participants for up to three years — the authors said they believe it's the first long-term study of a digital blood pressure management program. Following participants over an extended period of time helps researchers check that the impact of a program like this isn’t just short-lived and can help people manage their blood pressure in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T40xeG"&gt;“This is the first peer-reviewed, published study reporting the long-term experience of a digital health application for blood pressure management,” said study author Alexis Beatty, a cardiologist and associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxd9yr"&gt;Hello Heart is currently only available through employer wellness programs — it’s offered by some companies as part of their health benefits. People who don’t work for a company offering Hello Heart aren’t able to use it, but it’s still possible to &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings/monitoring-your-blood-pressure-at-home"&gt;monitor blood pressure at home&lt;/a&gt; without an app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seq7js"&gt;Despite the promising results, the authors note that the people who used the program were middle-aged and that the vast majority weren’t low-income. It’s hard to say if the app would work as well in groups of people more likely to have serious complications with blood pressure, like&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;older people or people who didn’t have health insurance, they wrote in the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmhchB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now order the new Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis controllers for Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R56AKlVhZWOudvESqo3NBJvRqAY=/4x0:1597x1062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999507/switch64genesiscontrollers.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J4iihA"&gt;To faithfully play the Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis games coming to Nintendo Switch Online, you’re going to want the original controllers. Nintendo has posted pages for both the revised &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-64-controller.html"&gt;Nintendo 64&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/sega-genesis-control-pad.html"&gt;Genesis controllers&lt;/a&gt;, and you can buy one right now if you’re a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3zPP3"&gt;Each one costs $49.99 and includes USB-C charging. In the case of the N64 controller, it includes built-in rumble for games that support it, like &lt;em&gt;Star Fox 64&lt;/em&gt;. Both controllers are set to ship on October 25th, and Nintendo is limiting account holders to four of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gD6vp"&gt;Nintendo Switch Online is the paid service that nets you cloud save backups and access to &lt;em&gt;Tetris 99&lt;/em&gt;, retro SNES and NES games, and other content. The cost of that membership is going to go up for people who want access to N64 and Genesis games. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728113/nintendo-switch-online-plus-expansion-pack-price-n64-genesis-animal-crossing"&gt;My colleague Chaim Gartenberg has all of the pricing details for you here.&lt;/a&gt; Though, you don’t need to purchase these controllers to be able to play the new games being added to the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing is getting a big update and paid DLC on November 5th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_B8gibp0z-dPWhUopCPjoIosbw8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999505/20211015_ACNH_Update_scrn_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brewster is back.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EmIqrT"&gt;Nintendo just wrapped up a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6LdBAbT1Xw"&gt;huge Direct presentation&lt;/a&gt; focused on new content coming to &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons,&lt;/em&gt; including the game’s major 2.0 update and a significant paid DLC expansion. Both will be available on November 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGYVHu"&gt;Let’s start first with the free update, which brings back a lot of familiar faces for longtime &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; fans. You’ll be able to visit Brewster in his coffee shop, The Roost, Kapp’n will be able to whisk you away to mysterious islands (while serenading you along the way), Katrina the fortune-teller will appear on Harv’s Island, and the odd, noise-making Gyroids have returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMWhvS"&gt;There are also some great new features for people who have already sunk hours (or hundreds of hours) into &lt;em&gt;New Horizons.&lt;/em&gt; There are new house exterior options, storage expansions, hairstyles, KK Slider songs, things you can buy with Nook Miles, and even a pro camera app for the NookPhone that lets you take photos from a new perspective. Perhaps one of the most significant updates is that you’ll be able to cook food using ingredients that you grow, meaning you can set the table for a fun (virtual) dinner with your friends. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/anBFN7QURGPPI_lkIbKEsVi07Jg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929423/20211015_ACNH_Update_scrn_009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make some food for your friends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VWWUoD"&gt;But for players who want to do even more in &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, Nintendo is also releasing a paid expansion, &lt;em&gt;Happy Home Paradise&lt;/em&gt;. In the DLC, you’ll travel to an archipelago of islands and help visitors build the paradise home of their dreams on a resort. For example, if a bear wants a house with plush bears, you’ll be able to place the furniture they want in the house but also decorate it however you want to try and make the paradise home that matches what they’re looking for. You’ll also be able to decorate the resort itself. And as part of the DLC, you’ll eventually gain new house decorating techniques, like partitions, that you can bring back to your home on your main island. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T28rGIKU1AK6NeBd0YChdbN3glU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929425/20211015_ACNH_HHP_scrn_006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Decorate a vacation home in &lt;/em&gt;New Horizons&lt;em&gt;’ upcoming DLC.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YNtenS"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Happy Home Paradise&lt;/em&gt; DLC will cost $24.99, and you can preorder it starting October 29th. It will also be included as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728113/nintendo-switch-online-plus-expansion-pack-price-n64-genesis-animal-crossing"&gt;the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription&lt;/a&gt;, which launches on October 25th and will cost $49.99 for one person for 12 months or $79.99 for a family membership for 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toJmkU"&gt;Nintendo also announced that the &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; Series 5 amiibo cards will launch on November 5th. Each pack will cost $5.99 and comes with six cards each.&lt;/p&gt;
