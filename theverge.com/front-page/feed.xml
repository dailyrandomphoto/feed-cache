    <title>Two queens in talks to join Marvel’s Secret Invasion on Disney Plus</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wSd2x8"&gt;The Marvel Cinematic Universe may soon be home to two new queens. Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/olivia-colman-in-talks-to-join-samuel-l-jackson-in-marvels-secret-invasion-exclusive"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter &lt;/em&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that Olivia Colman was negotiating a role in Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Secret Invasion &lt;/em&gt;Disney Plus series, and today, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/emilia-clarke-secret-invasion-marvel-1234955746/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Emilia Clarke is in talks to do the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vm5eAJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secret Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is expected to be the television adaptation of the comics storyline of the same name that’s focused on a hostile takeover of Earth led by a shape-shifting alien race you may already know and love from &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt;: the Skrulls. Few details have been revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;since the project was first announced&lt;/a&gt;, but we do know the show will feature the return of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Ben Mendelsohn as the friendly Skrull Talos, who was last seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681596/spider-man-far-from-home-mid-post-credits-scene-plot-hole-nick-fury-maria-hill-aliens"&gt;impersonating Fury&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Far From Home. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7T0in"&gt;There are some interesting possible characters for Colman and Clarke to play, too. In the comics, Empress Veranke is the leader of the Skrulls, and Colman’s time as both Elizabeth II on &lt;em&gt;The Crown &lt;/em&gt;and Queen Anne in &lt;em&gt;The Favorite&lt;/em&gt; could certainly translate to alien royalty. You could make the same case for Clarke’s turn as Daenerys Targaryen in &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;as well. There’s also the possibility of Abigail Brand, the leader of extraterrestrial-focused security agency S.W.O.R.D., making an appearance in the show, which could be a great recurring role for either actress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hc2nRA"&gt;There’s no announced release date for &lt;em&gt;Secret Invasion&lt;/em&gt;, but with at least three Marvel films and several TV shows still slated to come out in 2021, there’s a good chance there’ll be some hints of what’s going on with the cosmic, space-based side of the Marvel universe soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You may have to actually pay for Apple TV Plus to watch Ted Lasso’s second season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B1EptwL5tAw0vo1N4La88skGlJI=/108x0:1280x781/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159678/ted_lasso.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple TV Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FkJGBf"&gt;Apple TV Plus launched on November 1st, 2019, but odds are that you (along with almost two-thirds of other Apple TV Plus customers) aren’t actually paying for it, thanks to Apple’s lengthy free trials. But Apple may have finally found the carrot to convince people to actually shell out their hard-earned cash for another streaming service: the upcoming second season of sleeper hit &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, which is set to debut on TV Plus on July 23rd — just after Apple’s free subscriptions for its earliest customers end on July 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bfKm3"&gt;It’s no secret that Apple TV Plus has a paying subscriber problem: as of January, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/apple-tv-plus-freeloader-problem-percent-free-1234890385/"&gt;research firm MoffettNathanson noted&lt;/a&gt; that approximately 62 percent of TV Plus subscribers are enjoying Apple’s free ride. The free trials for the service were originally intended to last a year, but Apple has kept extending them — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508148/apple-tv-plus-free-period-extended-february-2021-streaming"&gt;first to February&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233276/apple-free-tv-plus-service-trials-extended"&gt;and then to July&lt;/a&gt;. The company still offers a free year for new customers, but July 1st will be the day that anyone who signed up at or shortly after launch runs out of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="joZ5Oh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple TV Plus is still looking for its big win","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21262291/apple-tv-plus-morning-show-licensed-movies-netflix-disney-plus-quibi"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wINydT"&gt;Apple has been trying to grow TV Plus into a hit, but some of its highest-profile shows (like &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;See&lt;/em&gt;) failed to be the big, breakout hits that Apple was hoping for. And the ongoing extensions of the free trial period have started to feel like Apple was fishing for a big enough hit to hook customers into signing up — and somehow, it seems that the wildly popular &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; might be it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ow2nfS"&gt;The first season of the show (which is based on a series of Jason Sudeikis commercials) debuted quietly last summer, but the charming cast, heartfelt storytelling, and sheer optimism of the series have resonated with fans in the past several months. It’s also won Apple some of its streaming service’s most prestigious awards, including a Golden Globe for Sudeikis’ role as the titular coach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQv0wd"&gt;The show is by far the biggest hit for Apple’s service, which makes the upcoming second season Apple’s best shot for hooking subscribers. That’s especially true since &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s second season will offer 12 episodes, which could guarantee several months of customers given Apple’s weekly releases — enough, perhaps, for Apple to get subscribers on board with another big marquee show like &lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295512/apple-tv-plus-foundation-show-trailer-isaac-asimov-wwdc-2020"&gt;its upcoming &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; adaptation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why is the old Apple TV HD still so expensive?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YaoFx3fuFyTZN9flXFwKjihnEyM=/0x55:1305x925/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159585/AppleTVHD.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xTKXdb"&gt;Apple refreshed its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22386298/apple-tv-4k-a12-bionic-price-features-release-date"&gt;Apple TV 4K streaming box&lt;/a&gt; today with upgraded specs and, perhaps most importantly, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/18277449/apple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date"&gt;redesigned, simpler Siri remote&lt;/a&gt;. When the new device ships in late May, it’ll cost the same price as before: $179 for a 32GB unit or $199 for 64GB. (Sidenote: I’ve yet to meet anyone who has needed the higher storage option on any Apple TV.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUflyQ"&gt;But along with the new Apple TV 4K and improved remote — &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJFM3LL%2FA%2Fsiri-remote%3Ffnode%3D990e806f0bfc36af5eebcfc8fa133eaec016ee7aa27dad125662ec22c9b5ad7434fc19e39ac8e19d0e35bdbe26ad2ed65f3382ac03c6aaae1ecc7c32096b0e1d8fb5ce1b176cfc2454a2fa411918ebecafff71fd1d67d13b70034373386abd62&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394168%2Fapple-tv-hd-siri-remote-too-expensive-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can buy it standalone&lt;/a&gt; — it turns out Apple is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-tv%2Fapple-tv-hd%2F32gb&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394168%2Fapple-tv-hd-siri-remote-too-expensive-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;keeping the ancient 2015 Apple TV HD around&lt;/a&gt;. And for some reason, it still costs the same $149. I just... I don’t get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mN7SCJ"&gt;How was this not the moment to slash the price to something more reasonable? Something closer to competitive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kq5qKG"&gt;The price discrepancy between Apple TV 4K and 4K streamers from Roku, Amazon, and Google is already something that hurts Apple’s market share in the living room. But at least there’s a &lt;em&gt;case to be made&lt;/em&gt; with the new hardware. It’s got a faster chip (albeit still not Apple’s latest and greatest), covers the whole gamut of 4K / HDR / Dolby Atmos functionality you could want, and now includes Wi-Fi 6 and that flashy new screen calibration feature that works in conjunction with iPhones. And a lot of people appreciate Apple’s stance on privacy and are willing to chip in a bit extra for that cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CJ2F2L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best streaming device to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SRoanA"&gt;But asking a dollar shy of $150 for a device with an aging processor that’s limited to HD playback in 2021 feels many steps past bewildering. The Apple TV has HDMI 1.4. It’s got Bluetooth 4, which means the new remote has fresher technology than the box itself. Sure, it can serve as a HomeKit hub, but so can the $99 HomePod mini. AirPlay 2? Yep, but many TVs and even Rokus can do that now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvfUBz"&gt;Who wouldn’t just spend the extra $30 for the more future-proof Apple TV 4K? How many more tvOS updates are really in store for this thing? What are you getting here over a Roku Express or Fire TV Stick that is worth such a premium? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czLMrE"&gt;Yes, the new remote is clearly an improvement; I don’t even need to hold it to know that much. But Roku’s and Amazon’s remotes fall under “good enough” territory — especially when they come packaged with such affordable players. The Apple TV HD continues to live in a price bracket several rungs above streaming products from Amazon, Roku, and Google that can simply do more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfWPQr"&gt;Just look at how out of place it is in this price roundup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MEvuzB"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$199.99 &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia Shield TV Pro (4K HDR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="m1VCk6"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$179 &lt;/strong&gt;Apple TV 4K (4K HDR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Pwcy9W"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$149.99&lt;/strong&gt; Nvidia Shield TV (4K HDR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uer5yL"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$149&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Apple TV HD (1080p HD)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tjANXE"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$99.99&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon Fire TV Cube (4K HDR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SGnaCV"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$99.99&lt;/strong&gt; Roku Ultra (4K HDR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I9Wnsa"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$49.99&lt;/strong&gt; Chromecast with Google TV (4K HDR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2SfGba"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$49.99&lt;/strong&gt; Fire TV Stick 4K (4K HDR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jlJ5Ex"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$39.99&lt;/strong&gt; Fire TV Stick (1080p HD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7T95Cw"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$39.99&lt;/strong&gt; Roku Express 4K Plus (4K HDR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IkR0tK"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$29.99&lt;/strong&gt; Fire TV Stick Lite (1080p HD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VVzWd1"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$29.99&lt;/strong&gt; Roku Express (1080p HD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0hmySd"&gt;It’d be one thing if Apple were just selling through remaining inventory. But the fact that the company is bothering to bundle the new Siri remote with the Apple TV HD suggests that it still has plenty of these boxes lying around and it isn’t on the way out in the immediate future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZDiwt"&gt;I don’t follow Apple’s thinking on the Apple TV HD still demanding such a high price, and it’s come to the point where I really can’t recommend this product to anyone. It’s an almost six-year-old device priced as if it were a modern top-spec streamer. Apple should either cut the price or just cut it loose.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix subscriber growth is stalling as it runs low on hits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zqykUMHQ3b3ogZ-1DA4btaGr2hI=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159565/BRIDGERTON_108_Unit_01959R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image from the Netflix series Bridgerton.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ywsjY"&gt;Netflix is seeing a slowdown in new subscriptions as the company puts out fewer shows following a year of delayed productions. The company now has 208 million paid subscribers across the globe, up from 204 million last quarter. That’s not much to complain about, but it’s a substantial slowdown compared to the rapid growth Netflix saw during the same time period in 2020 when it added four times as many new subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnJmRE"&gt;It’s also fewer subscribers than Netflix had hoped to add. The company believed it would hit 210 million subscribers by the end of the first quarter, but it came in 2 million short. The results were reported in &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/FINAL-Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;Netflix’s Q1 2021 earnings release&lt;/a&gt;. Its stock fell around 10 percent in after-hours trading following the results, speaking to the surprise from investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EORyBd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Netflix believes a “very strong back half slate” will boost subscriptions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P2gUwU"&gt;Netflix spends the bulk of its quarterly letter to shareholders explaining why it thinks there’s been such a dramatic slowdown in growth. The root of the problem — no surprise here — is the pandemic, Netflix says. The pandemic accelerated subscriptions this time last year when everyone was stuck at home and looking for things to watch. The pandemic also delayed production on shows and movies, leading to what Netflix describes as “a lighter content slate” for the first half of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhWn30"&gt;Put the two together, and you’ve got the unfavorable comparison of putting a slower quarter up against a blockbuster quarter, which was never going to look good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Z35pV"&gt;The sluggish growth is expected to continue next quarter, with Netflix predicting only 1 million additional subscribers. Last year, it added 10 million during the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbL7rl"&gt;Things should turn around later in the year, Netflix says. A “very strong back half slate” — including the return of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher &lt;/em&gt;and debut of films with some big stars (The Rock, Leonardo DiCaprio) — should help to bring more people to the service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The chart shows Netflix’s 2021 additions (and Q2 forecast) falling below the years 2017 through 2020." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FnnoVWHXamyexJZd6EoFv1WOLU4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458016/netflix_earnings_q1_2021.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A chart from Netflix showing its weekly subscriber additions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kmAOLw"&gt;Netflix has some catching up to do if it wants to continue growing at the same pace as it has in years past. A chart Netflix includes with its earnings (embedded above) shows the company falling substantially behind even its usual pace — in 2017 through 2019 — of gaining additional subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQNJWc"&gt;Not only does Netflix face constraints from the pandemic, but the company is also facing increased competition. HBO Max and Disney Plus continue to publish big titles on a regular basis. Netflix said its quarter started strong, thanks to &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lupin&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; Cobra Kai,&lt;/em&gt; but it evidently didn’t have enough hits in waiting to keep up with its former growth.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wisconsin amends Foxconn’s contract to reflect radically smaller project </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Foxconn’s “Fab”in Wisconsin. A state report says it no signs that it manufactures LCDs, or ever will" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/usFArhRcJLIny1LMoX0cC6rarlE=/0x3:7192x4798/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159445/Foxconn_proof_08_080520_3892.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://aerialscapes.com" target="_blank"&gt;Curtis Waltz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZlRolV"&gt;After more than three years of grandiose promises and missed deadlines, Foxconn and Wisconsin have agreed to amend their contract to reflect the reality of a much-diminished project. Under the amendment, which was approved by the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) today, the company will receive vastly smaller tax subsidies in exchange for greater flexibility about what business it ultimately pursues in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s82Zex"&gt;Foxconn had originally promised to build an enormous LCD factory employing 13,000 workers and costing $10 billion. With the amendment, it now says it will employ a total of 1,454 people and invest $672 million. In return, the tax subsidies the company is eligible for have been slashed, from $2.85 billion to $80 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2wUphb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instead of 13,000 employees, Foxconn aims to hire 1,454&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jj53Vw"&gt;“When I ran to be governor, I made a promise to work with Foxconn to cut a better deal for our state—the last deal didn’t work for Wisconsin, and that doesn’t work for me,” Gov. Tony Evers said in a statement. “Today I’m delivering on that promise with an agreement that treats Foxconn like any other business and will save taxpayers $2.77 billion, protect the hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure investments the state and local communities have already made, and ensure there’s accountability for creating the jobs promised.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x2mGK22uzz6W0JaafNL66pZ2PJQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457988/Foxconn_Comparison_Document_4.20.21.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ttbm19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cBSo7"&gt;The original Foxconn deal was arranged in 2017 by former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former President Trump, who called the project “the eighth wonder of the world” and touted it as a victory in his campaign to return manufacturing to the US. The Taiwanese electronics manufacturing giant was supposed to build a 20 million-square-foot LCD manufacturing facility. In return, Wisconsin offered the company an incentive package worth more than $4 billion, a mix of “refundable” tax credits, land, and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEICNc"&gt;The project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;went awry almost immediately&lt;/a&gt;. Manufacturing LCDs in Wisconsin never made economic sense, yet abandoning the plan risked incurring Trump’s wrath. Instead, the company spent years pivoting wildly from idea to idea. The enormous “Gen 10.5” LCD factory specified in the contract became a far smaller Gen 6, then was canceled, then came back. The company announced it was building something called “the AI+8K+5G ecosystem,” to be developed in a network of “innovation centers,” buildings that the company purchased only to leave empty. It looked into building fish farms, exporting ice cream, storing boats. It announced plans to build coffee kiosks and ventilators that never moved forward. Most recently, it said it would build &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333868/foxconn-ev-wisconsin-fisker-geely-faraday-future"&gt;electric cars&lt;/a&gt; — though maybe, the company acknowledged, that will happen in Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QBmEY0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It looked into building fish farms, exporting ice cream, storing boats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GI8Fxu"&gt;Foxconn’s delays and dead ends put both parties in a difficult position. Wisconsin has already spent at least $400 million on land and infrastructure, and Mount Pleasant, the small town where the factory was to be built, took on hundreds of millions in debt that was supposed to be repaid by taxes generated by the project. Foxconn has both fallen orders of magnitude short of its promises and invested too much to painlessly walk away. It owns a lot of real estate in Southern Wisconsin now, and it has built an odd collection of buildings, including the million-square-foot structure it called the LCD Fab (though a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21526765/foxconn-lcd-factory-not-real-confirmation-wisconsin-report-exclusive"&gt;government report&lt;/a&gt; found it was more akin to a demonstration facility) and a glass orb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CaD8NQ"&gt;For two years, the Evers administration has been urging Foxconn &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/13/21020885/foxconn-wisconsin-deal-renegotiate-tax-subsidy-lcd-factory-plant"&gt;to revise its contract&lt;/a&gt; to reflect its current plans, but the company refused. Last October, the latest attempt at negotiations failed, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21512638/wisconsin-foxconn-tax-subsidies-lcd-factory-rejected"&gt;WEDC denied the company&lt;/a&gt; what would have been its first tranche of cash subsidies. One likely reason for the company’s refusal to negotiate, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last year, is that the process to amend the contract would entail admitting it was not going to manufacturer LCDs and disclosing in detail what its new plan, which it did not have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBigUe"&gt;But Foxconn &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189436/foxconn-wisconsin-lcd-factory-trump-contract-negotiation"&gt;came back to the table&lt;/a&gt;, and the result is this amendment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CT6exi"&gt;The original contract effectively reimbursed Foxconn for 15 percent of its capital investment and 17 percent of its payroll provided it hit certain hiring targets each year. It was an outlandishly lucrative subsidy. If Foxconn built an expensive and highly automated factory that employed few workers, it could have come to about $1 million per job. In 2019, the economist Timothy Bartik compiled a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20747166/wisconsin-foxconn-deal-state-report-lcd-factory-innovation-centers"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; at the request of the Evers administration that found Foxconn’s incentives would likely fall around $172,000 to $290,000 per job. Average US incentives are $24,000 per job, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sH2GXl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In exchange for the radically reduced subsidies, Foxconn gets flexibility&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rLpqtO"&gt;The per-job subsidy under the amendment is around $41,000. The company would receive subsidies equal to up to 7 percent of wages and 10 percent of capital investment, which is in line with the state’s general &lt;a href="https://wedc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WEDC_ARED-FY20.pdf"&gt;Enterprise Zone&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRqOZb"&gt;In exchange for the radically reduced subsidies, Foxconn gets flexibility. The contract no longer specifies that Foxconn build an LCD facility. Instead, it defines the project as “economic investment activities related to locating and operating a technology and manufacturing ecosystem.” Foxconn Industrial Internet, a Foxconn subsidiary that came into Wisconsin after the LCD plan fell apart but did not count under the original contract, was also made eligible by the amendment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUQyPr"&gt;In a statement, the company thanked Evers and WEDC for finding an amendment “that will give Foxconn the flexibility to pursue business opportunities in response to changing global market conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjobfV"&gt;The company’s amendment application says the project “will include the construction and development of facilities for the manufacturing of data infrastructure and other operations related to high-performance computing, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.” But the company, as always, says it might also go on to pursue “new industries such as electric vehicle, digital health, and robotics using AI, semiconductor, and 5G technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ziql4L"&gt;It remains to be seen how &lt;a href="https://www.wpr.org/foxconns-next-challenge-fulfill-promises-made-racine-county-taxpayers"&gt;Mount Pleasant&lt;/a&gt; will fare given the project’s diminished scope. The town had committed to invest nearly $1 billion to acquire land and support the project, a sum so great it resulted in a credit downgrade. The state had pledged to cover 40 percent of its debt if taxes from the project fell short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HK4URO"&gt;For Wisconsin and for Foxconn, the agreement marks an end to a costly and embarrassing saga. Foxconn’s failure had already ensured Wisconsin wouldn’t have to pay billions in tax subsidies, but the new deal means the Evers administration likely avoids the threat of a costly legal battle. After hundreds of millions in state funds were spent, dozens of people pushed from their homes to clear land, and years of grand promises followed by disappointment, the company will become just another manufacturer with a small regional presence. Perhaps its new status will allow Foxconn to finally figure out something to do in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2oD2u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are all the AirTag accessories we know about </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fYC-sV9f26gLYdwC4ya5f937KLY=/821x0:2261x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159412/airtag_accessories_header_202104.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="afQCgp"&gt;The Apple AirTags &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;have finally been announced&lt;/a&gt;, and with them come a ton of accessories to make them easier to use (so much easier than if it had, say, a built-in way to attach it to things). While a small tracking puck could be carried in a bag, there are a variety of other things that you may want to put an AirTag on that require some sort of holder or the judicious use of tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aibtVD"&gt;These are all the accessories we could find that are either listed for preorder or have a page on Apple’s store. We don’t have official ship dates for most of them, but it’s probably a safe bet that the ones on the Apple Store will become available when the AirTags do, on April 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zukTwfmRIxQklWUdl7oFS7ls-Ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457924/HNPX2.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Belkin’s AirTag holder. Tie it to anything!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pAbwNc"&gt;Belkin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RWmQC6"&gt;Belkin currently has two offerings, a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHNPR2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-secure-holder-with-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D4a11a0f92a3f82e2bc68e69e973caa245ea296126f6a1dea5da19b97d0d9b65242da69bc60433105cb23b3dcbfae194c6018f7a0e0a92d0ee1a81f4dc9a5d78ffd2ec296ae3f8902c56b9bb67e4de40bd67223cf08e2e2b4ddc7c848f910584ae10043f1f735c80aea4750706def61ce&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;key ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHNPX2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-secure-holder-with-strap%3Ffnode%3D4a11a0f92a3f82e2bc68e69e973caa245ea296126f6a1dea5da19b97d0d9b65242da69bc60433105cb23b3dcbfae194c6018f7a0e0a92d0ee1a81f4dc9a5d78ffd2ec296ae3f8902c56b9bb67e4de40bd67223cf08e2e2b4ddc7c848f910584ae10043f1f735c80aea4750706def61ce&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a strap&lt;/a&gt;, which both sell for $12.95. Both products have a circular holder for the AirTag and come in white, black, blue, and pink. They’re currently listed as unavailable in Apple’s online store and as “coming soon” on Belkin’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ACO1OVMfOG9bRTqGaMafFuiVKRI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457922/7245bb43_16cd_47d2_9cb4_94bc7f177b9a.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nomad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I genuinely love this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lTlcNk"&gt;Nomad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="678fYv"&gt;Nomad also offers its take on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-leather-keychain&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a keychain&lt;/a&gt;, but (characteristically) its version is a leather pouch that encases the AirTag. The company also has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-glasses-strap&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a glasses strap&lt;/a&gt;, which acts both as a strap to keep your glasses handy and as an AirTag holder in case you manage to misplace them. Both are listed for $39.95 but are marked down to $29.95 if you preorder, which you are able to do now on Nomad’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8DcdqCayePsBxP8zc6ye9XhXgWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457915/detail_airtags_rugged_armor_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spigen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spigen’s rugged AirTag case. Maybe you could attach it to your rock climbing gear?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XGObNE"&gt;Cyrill / Spigen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IwxThP"&gt;Cyrill is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.cyrill.com/collections/airtag/products/black-airtag?variant=36909671776414"&gt;vegan leather keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; in two colors, black and “stone” (which is a light gray). It costs $19.99 and seems to be available now. Spigen, Cyrill’s parent company, is also offering its own AirTag cases: a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-valentinus%3Fvariant%3D32709738725423&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-rugged-armor%3Fvariant%3D32709737971759&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a ruggedized case&lt;/a&gt; with a hefty clip connector (and what appears to be a bottle opener, though it’s not listed as a feature). Both are $24.99 — the keychain is available to order today, and the rugged case is available for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAOJkLEdPjYmgkJgBM3cysqxx9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457912/MX852.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the bag charm. I dare you to put it on a Gucci or Louis purse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kuvoxz"&gt;Hermès&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5fM4hd"&gt;Apple has a history with Hermès; the French luxury company made some jaw-droppingly expensive Apple Watch bands. True to form, the Apple Store lists a leather &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX872AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;key ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX8A2AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-luggage-tag%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;luggage tag&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX862AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-bag-charm%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bag charm&lt;/a&gt; made by Hermès — costing $349, $449, and $299 respectively. It is worth noting, though, that the accessories do include an AirTag with a custom “Hermès” engraving, so you can flex while you find. The key ring and bag charm come in orange, brown, and what looks like black but is listed as “bleu indigo.” The luggage tag is currently only shown in brown. Like Belkin’s offerings, they are currently unavailable through the Apple Store.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="p5SyxI"&gt;Apple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pqFTWr"&gt;Of course, Apple offers its own first-party accessories. Currently, Apple has a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHJ23ZM%2FA%2Fairtag-leather-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;leather key ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX4A2ZM%2FA%2Fairtag-leather-loop%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;leather loop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMK0W3ZM%2FA%2Fairtag-loop%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;polyurethane (think Apple Watch sport band) loop&lt;/a&gt; listed on its store, coming in at $35, $39, and $29 respectively. All three are available in various colors and are currently listed as unavailable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ENSzYI"&gt;Everybody else &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CeOHhl"&gt;Of course, with how long AirTags have been rumored, there were some manufacturers that wanted to get a head start with their accessories. Last night, we saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393404/airtags-accessories-keychain-leaked-photos-listings-trackers-tile"&gt;various key rings show up on Walmart, Etsy, and eBay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the new iPad Pro with the M1 processor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPad Pro 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q9GZIA0Gfi4WQPK-l2mCpNu-xOw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159356/ipadpro2021lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Pro&lt;/em&gt; | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GUYWLh"&gt;Apple announced a 2021 refresh to its iPad Pro lineup, which now includes the same powerful and efficient M1 processor that’s in its MacBook Air, Pro, and Mac mini computers. Both the new 11-inch and 12.9-inch models will feature the chip, as well as a Thunderbolt port and optional 5G support. The display on the larger tablet has received a particularly big boost, jumping to a Liquid Retina XDR Mini LED screen. My colleague Monica Chin has gone deeper on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;more of this year’s big improvements&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m just here to tell you when you’ll be able to buy them and how much it might cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iB5ppe"&gt;Before the pandemic, it was common for preorders to begin shortly after a product’s announcement. Alas, things have changed. If you have your eye on the new iPad Pro, you’ll need to come back on Friday, April 30th, to place your order. (The links below currently lead to the correct pages on Apple’s site, but there won’t be any “buy” buttons available.) The 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $799 for 128GB of storage and Wi-Fi connectivity. The model with LTE and 5G support costs $200 more. If you want the big 12.9-inch iPad Pro, that model starts at $1,099 and comes with 128GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLBAcP"&gt;Your purchase won’t ship until the second half of May. That doesn’t mean you can’t take a gander at Apple’s site right now to see all of the specs and configure the iPad Pro of your dreams. We’ll update this post once the buying links are live.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new iPad Pros and TV remote don’t have U1 locators to help find them in your couch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fmctdqcCJ27r-jb8zh79NUa694Q=/0x0:1478x985/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159216/2UiJGkD.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rsm2tv"&gt;Apple has been quietly sticking special locator beacon chips into some of its new iPhones that’ll &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299182/apple-carkey-ios-14-13-digital-key-unlock-car-iphone-wwdc-2020"&gt;let you unlock your car&lt;/a&gt; and find lost items through walls — the latter thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;the $29 AirTags&lt;/a&gt; announced today — but sadly, you won’t find that chip in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;the new M1-based iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/18277449/apple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date"&gt;the long-awaited new Siri remote&lt;/a&gt; for the Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QztKa9"&gt;Apple confirmed to us that the U1 locator chip, which uses pulses of ultra-wideband (UWB) radio to broadcast its precise location, won’t appear in the Siri remote. We’re waiting on final bulletproof confirmation about the iPad Pros, but it also doesn’t appear in their product page, spec sheet, or press release. Last year’s iPad Pros didn’t include a U1 chip, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nUhMXp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ckqvG0Rj35I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Za91aO"&gt;Is Apple expecting us to stick AirTags to our iPads and TV remotes to escape the jaws of the ever-ravenous couch? Unlikely, but the company has been pretty choosey about which devices get the chip so far. You can find it in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20859550/apple-iphone-11-pro-airdrop-u1-locator-chip-tag-tile-bluetooth-tracking"&gt;the iPhone 11 and newer&lt;/a&gt; (but not the iPhone SE) and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/15/21438497/apple-watch-series-6-u1-locator-ultra-wideband-location"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; (but not the Apple Watch SE), but we’re pretty sure it hasn’t made its way to any iPads or MacBooks that have been announced since the chip’s introduction in September 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFRFzN"&gt;Theoretically, Apple could build an ecosystem where any Apple device can easily find any other Apple device (not to mention UWB devices from Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230960/samsung-digital-car-key-audi-bmw-ford-genesis-uwb-bluetooth"&gt;which is also deeply invested in the tech&lt;/a&gt; and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373410/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-uwb-ar-bluetooth-price-release-date"&gt;its own AirTag-like device&lt;/a&gt; as well). But for now, you’ll primarily just be using your phone to find AirTags, not other gadgets, except perhaps your future car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pODdAU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLgfVN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emyNjp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHfFuv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple quietly reveals that iOS 14.5 will arrive next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TUSQo9wvznWlWZ9pyHG1BruKEuE=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69158860/findmy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 14.5 will enable use of AirTag trackers to help locate tagged items using Apple’s Find My feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wYXsIE"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-introduces-airtag%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394200%2Fapple-ios-14-5-watch-os-7-4-mac-os-11-3-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; for Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;new Tile-like AirTag tracker&lt;/a&gt;, the company has revealed that iOS 14.5 will officially arrive “starting next week” — as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoannaStern"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s Joanna Stern&lt;/a&gt;. AirTags go on sale April 30th and will only work with devices running iOS 14.5 or higher. Likewise, watchOS 7.4 and macOS 11.3 will also launch next week, as they support new Apple Podcast feature updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwDeAc"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267230/apple-ios-14-5-watchos-7-4-public-beta-unlock-iphone-apple-watch-mask"&gt;first launched the 14.5 beta&lt;/a&gt; to the public earlier this year in February alongside watchOS 7.4 beta (no word on whether that’s arriving soon, too). Along with AirTag support, it will implement Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253366/apple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch"&gt;App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt; requirement, which mandates that developers ask for permission to track users for ad targeting. The feature was announced last year and met with sharp resistance from Facebook in particular, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;argues that the move&lt;/a&gt; will harm small businesses that benefit from ad tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohaQHf"&gt;iOS 14.5 also introduces some welcome inclusivity features, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;ability to change Siri’s voice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285963/apple-emoji-ios-14-5-smiley-faces-hearts-more-skin-tones"&gt;new skin tone options&lt;/a&gt; for some emoji. Another feature we’ve appreciated in our testing thus far is Siri’s ability to learn which audio-listening apps you prefer for certain activities. This stops short of letting you select a new default app, like picking Spotify for all of your streaming music requests, but it’s a helpful evolution in any case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWsSBM"&gt;Of course, this feature may or may not make it to the final release, but we &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;know now when we can expect to find out which features made the final cut. Apple doesn’t say specifically which day we can expect 14.5, but when it does, iPhone users will be able to download the update in their phone’s settings as always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ycu2tJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A first look at Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS and the web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KtQzQbETtYs7zwp7GZhFlnHcsOk=/9x0:2631x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69158828/xcloudiphone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Game Streaming running on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1OuUcS"&gt;Microsoft has started inviting Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to test its Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service on iPhones and iPads today. The service works through web browsers, allowing it to also run on PCs and Macs on Edge, Chrome, or Safari. We’ve managed to get an early look at this beta and see how Xbox Cloud Gaming works on an iPhone or iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQRIZq"&gt;The web interface for xCloud (yes, we’re going to keep calling it xCloud) is very simple to use. It scales across devices like the iPhone, iPad, or even a large monitor attached to a PC to provide quick access to games. Microsoft has even included a search interface, which is something that’s strangely missing on rival service Google Stadia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIiBSM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;here’s a first look at how xCloud, or Xbox Cloud Gaming, works on an iPhone. Full details here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/4QlTfCCjSQ"&gt;https://t.co/4QlTfCCjSQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Td6TOKZh9d"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Td6TOKZh9d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1384594572622319616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tfadur"&gt;You don’t need to install any apps or extensions; it works natively in Chrome, Safari, or Edge. All you need is a compatible USB or Bluetooth controller. Some games even work with Xbox Touch Controls, so a controller isn’t required if you’re happy to tap on the screen and play. I managed to quickly start games using an Xbox Elite 2 controller paired to an iPhone 11 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ewqJY"&gt;Once you launch a game, you’ll have to wait a fair amount of time for it to actually load. Much like xCloud on Android, the backend servers for Microsoft’s Xbox game streaming are actually Xbox One S consoles. This older Xbox hardware isn’t powered by a modern CPU or SSD, so game loads are affected as a result. Microsoft is planning to upgrade xCloud servers to Xbox Series X hardware at some point this year, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zGUsoHhwMiYbZ1T0EQUfuKrkRX4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457711/20210420_190102000_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Game Streaming on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E29pDW"&gt;I’ve only been playing xCloud via the web for a few hours, so it’s difficult to judge the experience, but I’ve certainly run into a lot of connection issues both wireless and wired with my desktop PC. Microsoft says it’s working on a routing issue with this beta, but it’s worth pointing out this is a test service, and it’s only just launched, so hiccups like this are to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gURABC"&gt;Once the connection settles down, it’s very similar to xCloud on Android. If you run this through a web browser on a PC or iPad, you’ll even get a 1080p stream. It feels like I’m playing on an Xbox in the cloud, and there’s a dashboard that lets me access friends, party chats, achievements, and invites to games. This is all powered by Xbox Game Pass, so there are more than 100 games available — and even some original Xbox and Xbox 360 titles that can be streamed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b6TQaAuBYmCrYOhEtLTW0hOVA0k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457712/20210420_190115000_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can search and easily launch Xbox games in a browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pwkKce2up0hlNX-QGfr1gZ9icBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457713/20210420_190300000_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Touch Controls can be used for certain games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="59BiXk"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t said when the company plans to roll this out more broadly yet, but given the early connection issues, there’s clearly still some work to be done until the web version is available for everyone. Still, it’s impressive how well this scales across multiple devices and opens up the ability to stream Xbox games to virtually any device that has a Chromium or Safari browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jklbgr"&gt;I also tried this xCloud browser version on the new Edge app for Xbox consoles, but it’s not fully supported yet. Both the service and the browser are in early beta right now, so full support might come at a later date. Either way, I imagine that xCloud will arrive on Xbox consoles through the ability to quickly stream a game while you’re waiting for it to download in the background. That’s really where xCloud makes sense on a console that can already play Xbox games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwRUeA"&gt;This browser-based version of xCloud does open up the service to many more possibilities, too. Xbox chief Phil Spencer has previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21529925/xbox-tv-streaming-stick-xcloud-cloud-gaming-phil-spencer-interview"&gt;hinted at TV streaming sticks for xCloud&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft has already committed to bringing the service to Facebook Gaming at some point. It’s easy to imagine Xbox Game Streaming apps for smart TVs, coupled with the ability to access the service from web browsers to ensure almost any device can access an Xbox Game Pass subscription. That’s clearly Microsoft’s goal here, and this beta feels like just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
