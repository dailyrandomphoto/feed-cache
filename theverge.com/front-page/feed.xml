    <title>Specialized Como SL e-bike review: mellow yellow</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A fun lightweight commuter from the maker of the Turbo Vado&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cCW5rF"&gt;Specialized just released one of its most interesting electric bikes to date, the Como SL. The SL stands for “Super Light,” and Specialized is marketing it as an everyday commuter, perfect for zipping over to a friend’s house, picking up some groceries, or, if you really need to, carrying up a few flights of stairs. There’s even a hand grip built into the frame to help lift the bike when needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1JzBX"&gt;The Como SL is a slimmed-down version of Specialized’s Turbo Como, which is the company’s entry-level electric bike for commuters. The company is doubling down on a lot of the elements that made the Turbo Como so inviting to riders, while also adding a whole host of additional features — including aluminum fenders, a rear rack, and a front-mounted basket — without adding unnecessary pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlDKFz"&gt;For the last week and a half, I’ve had the pleasure of riding the Como SL all over my neighborhood to see how it measures up — not only to Specialized’s other highly capable, extremely powerful (and at times very pricy) e-bikes, but also to the other lightweight commuter e-bikes that have been flooding the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AS5sna"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10421956"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gFmo6e"&gt;I tackled steep hills, busy county roads without bike lanes, and even a languid ride through the park. While the Como SL is not the most powerful e-bike I’ve ever ridden, it is among the smoothest and easiest to handle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLhUwx"&gt;Maybe it was the warming spring weather or the way the Como SL’s yellow paint job reflected the daffodils just now emerging from the ground, but I found this bike to be an absolute delight to ride. I did have some issues with the UX of the digital display, and the gearing left a little bit to be desired. But overall, the skill and craftsmanship Specialized put into the Como SL really shone through, and I think this will be a worthy addition to the company’s growing lineup of e-bikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m8ClsxKpsNx6e9i_24smEUOZd3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408145/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Como SL has a surprising amount of cargo capacity for errands or other outings. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="86gBfy"&gt;Specialized may be based in California, but its design team is headquartered in a nondescript brick building in Cham, Switzerland. That’s where the company designs its Turbo-branded e-bikes like the Levo, Creo, Vado, and Como, as well as their Super Light variants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlBMpq"&gt;To make the Como SL worthy of that suffix, the company started out by fully integrating the battery into the frame of the bike. Many direct-to-consumer e-bike brands have unsightly batteries perched on the downtube, while other companies have tried to have it both ways by integrating it into the frame while also having it be removable. Specialized decided to make its battery both fully integrated and non-removable, placing the Como SL in the same category as companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18484541/ampler-stout-e-bike-review-its-not-easy-being-green"&gt;Ampler&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344679/gogoro-eeyo-1s-e-bike-review-score-price-date"&gt;Gogoro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1Dlni"&gt;“By integrating [the battery] we were able to make a really lightweight aluminum frame,” Dominik Geyer, head of business for Specialized’s Turbo brand, who is based in the company’s Swiss office, told me. “We have a system that is super efficient, that needs less battery cells [which] makes it lighter weight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LfkYvQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have a system that is super efficient, that needs less battery cells [which] makes it lighter weight.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OTrKNq"&gt;Specialized says the Como SL’s 320Wh battery should be good for 62 miles (100 kilometers) of range, depending on the terrain and power setting. I found that while riding in the middle “Sport” setting, I burned through nearly 100 percent of the battery in less than 35 miles. That’s pretty standard for an e-bike battery, but Specialized does offer an optional Range Extender for $449.99, which the company says adds about 31 miles (55 km) of range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uq44Qz"&gt;Specialized says the battery can recharge from 3 percent to 100 percent in approximately 2 hours and 35 minutes. There’s a port at the base of the downtube where you can plug in the 48V charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDCmWQ"&gt;Another driving factor was simplicity, Geyer said. Specialized wanted a bike that was easy to ride and even easier to maintain. The Gates carbon belt drive and internal geared hub motor speak to this desire, as well as the simplicity of the cockpit controls. “The bike simply needs to be a trusted partner in your daily life to get around,” Geyer added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YueJOM"&gt;Still, the Como SL isn’t exactly a featherweight. It essentially weighs the same as the Turbo Como — between 47 and 48.5 pounds, depending on the frame size — despite all those new accessories. That means Specialized has found other, unique ways to shave off some of that bulk without compromising on what makes it so much fun to ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvAMUy"&gt;One of those is the SL motor, which tips the scale at 4.3 pounds (1.95 kg). Compare that to the Turbo Como’s motor, which weighs about 7.5 pounds (3.4 kg), and you can see how much work Specialized put into shrinking down the components in this bike. The motor is developed jointly by Specialized and Brose, a German company that also makes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22179185/harley-davidson-serial-1-ebike-test-hands-on-specs-price"&gt;e-bike motors for Harley-Davidson&lt;/a&gt; and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sgW3Cl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’d think that by reducing the size of its motor that you’d be dealing with a less powerful bike — and you’d be right&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="61fDnG"&gt;You’d think that by reducing the size of its motor that you’d be dealing with a less powerful bike — and you’d be right, to some extent. Specialized says the Como SL’s rear-hub motor has 240W of peak and continuous power as well as 35Nm of torque. That’s slightly less than the Turbo Como, which has a mid-drive motor rated for 250W of nominal power and 415W of peak and 50Nm of torque. Specialized says the Turbo Como offers riders four times their natural power input while pedaling, while the Como SL only delivers twice as much power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qjfrec"&gt;That becomes readily apparent when powering up a steep hill. I found myself having to exert a lot more force than I usually do when riding an e-bike, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I appreciate an e-bike that makes you work a little bit harder to get you to where you’re going, though I realize I might be in the minority with that opinion, especially if your goal is to arrive at your office job sweat-free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoLXOB"&gt;Overall, the look of the bike is very clean and polished, with all the wires integrated into the bike’s frame. That’s a stark contrast to most DTC e-bikes, which typically come with a rat’s nest of wires tangled around the handlebars. After all, there are clear advantages to going with an e-bike from a legacy bike company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OJG9WixZVCDcpJs6bZaqUMC4o2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408079/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The on/off button on the downtube also displays battery levels. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ih_oVku91IpcqPqxlvBAxGnrWcs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408147/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Gates carbon belt drive is cleaner and easier to maintain than a traditional chainring. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p8mGQjJ0QS_Dqv237E8YmTDpAVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408146/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0015.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Front and back lights are connected to the bike’s battery.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UYjVfaMFfE1q1kDvYGHoIIcik88=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408078/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The display has left and right buttons to toggle between different screens. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oI4JYT"&gt;Let’s talk about the digital display because this was my least favorite part about the Como SL. The LCD display is small by e-bike standards, 2.5 x 2 inches, or about the size of a pack of gum. There are only two buttons, left and right, which can be used to scroll through a half-dozen different screens showing speed, odometer, calories burned, distance traveled, and a timer. It’s a clean design, but I found it to be over-simplified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sAxwoZ"&gt;The real controls are routed through Specialized’s smartphone app, Mission Control, which is paired with the bike via Bluetooth. I’ll be completely honest: I am not a fan of app-based controls for e-bikes. It was one of my few beefs with Gogoro’s Eeyo 1S, and the same goes for the Como SL. I understand that by offloading certain controls to an app, manufacturers can offer nicer graphics and more functionality while saving on the costs associated with the on-bike display. And you don’t need the app to actually turn the bike on; the button for that is placed on a nice rubber pad in the downtube, along with a series of blue light bars that indicate battery strength. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVIZTw"&gt;But when I’m riding an e-bike, I want to be able to toggle between power settings without fumbling in my pocket for my phone. The Como SL doesn’t come with a standard phone mount. Although one could certainly be purchased separately, I’d struggle to find a place to mount it. The sloping handlebars would likely direct the phone’s display off to the side. And the LCD screen is mounted in the center, which would be another obvious place for a mount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZQ5xed"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I want to be able to toggle between power settings without fumbling in my pocket for my phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fYAsBj"&gt;The good part about the app is the level of fine-tuning it allows. You can customize the power settings to fit your riding style. The “Smart Control” feature automatically tailors the electronic assist in real time based on the information you input, such as how far you plan on riding. That worked well when I took the Como SL on a 10-mile ride with a lot of steep hills. The gearing on this bike is also among the most seamless I’ve ever experienced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kUABm"&gt;My last issue with the Como SL is the price. Specialized’s build quality is among the best in the industry, so you won’t be surprised to learn that this bike is very expensive. There are two versions of the Como SL: the 4.0, which retails for $4,000, and the 5.0, which sells for $4,800. &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/26/prices-on-the-rise-more-major-us-e-bike-companies-hike-prices-under-cost-squeeze/"&gt;Prices for e-bikes have been increasing across the board&lt;/a&gt;, with tariff exemptions expiring, but these prices certainly put the Como SL in the premium category that will be unaffordable to many people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnAmZy"&gt;The difference between the two is the number of gears in the Shimano drivetrain. The Como SL 4.0 features the 5-speed Nexus system, while the 5.0 comes with the 8-speed Alfine. There are also different paint jobs that come with both. The 4.0 comes in three colors: “cast umber,” “dove grey,” and “raspberry.” The 5.0, which is the one I tested, comes in “brassy yellow,” “brushed silver,” and “smoke.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dc8joiTT970ppQwPQeZdNRTJI6g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408082/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Como SL is very approachable, with a low-step frame that makes mounting and dismounting a breeze. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kg2YLB"&gt;Specialized claims both bikes can reach a top speed of 28mph — which technically puts them in the speed pedelec category. However, on a flat surface and in the highest “Turbo” power setting, I was only able to get up to 24–25 mph. Not a huge deal, but it still left me wondering what I was missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQdjvP"&gt;Overall, the Como SL is a super fun, super lightweight, very approachable electric bike. The shape and contours of the frame are inviting, the front basket and rear rack allow for a decent amount of storage, and the drivetrain is extremely simple to use. Although I would have preferred less reliance on the app for basic functionality, I’m also not a Luddite, and I realize this is a direction some e-bikes appear to be heading. Fortunately, it’s not ubiquitous, so there’s still time to figure this out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BC1VRV"&gt;The price may deter those looking for something inexpensive. But for fans of Specialized — or for anyone who’s interested in an e-bike from a trusted company with decades of experience in the building, selling, and maintenance of bikes, both traditional and electric, — the Como SL should be the perfect fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfLPgE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photography by Andrew J. Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxPWLs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 31st, 3:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Como SL 4.0 is $4,000, and the Como SL 5.0 is $4,800. A previous version of this review included incorrect prices due to a miscommunication by Specialized. As a result, we have reduced our score for the Como SL and have updated the review to reflect the correct prices. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will recalibrate iPhone 11 batteries to fix performance and capacity issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s6UobovBkZN2k4tEaUbFNgCdWuM=/0x40:700x507/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055875/ios14_iphone11_pro_settings_battery_battery_health_recalibrating_maximum_capacity_and_peak_performance_capability_crop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NJb6HW"&gt;Apple will try to fix battery drain and reduced performance issues that have affected some iPhone 11 devices by recalibrating their batteries in an upcoming update (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/31/ios-14-5-iphone-11-battery-recalibration/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212247#messages"&gt;an Apple support document&lt;/a&gt;, the process will happen when you update an iPhone 11, 11 Pro, or 11 Pro Max to the upcoming iOS 14.5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9aFej"&gt;It might take a few weeks for &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387"&gt;the battery health system&lt;/a&gt; to figure out how much capacity your battery has left, and how much performance it can provide, according to the document. It doesn’t seem like users should notice too much of a difference during the process, though there will be a message in the battery health section of the settings menu explaining what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgJtMq"&gt;The process is currently being tested in the latest release of the developer beta, but given that Apple has a support page already up for it, there’s a good chance it’ll make it into the final release. If the recalibration fails, for some reason, Apple says it or an authorized service provider will replace the battery for free. Hopefully, if you were experiencing battery issues with your iPhone 11, this process will help alleviate them when 14.5 is finally released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gb0Pcl"&gt;It’s not unusual that Apple would release a document about a battery change before it starts happening. The company has been a lot more transparent when it makes changes to the iPhone’s power delivery system ever since it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/21/16806582/apple-battery-slowdown-science"&gt;caught throttling the performance of older iPhones&lt;/a&gt; to protect the battery.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft says controversial Georgia law will ‘unfairly restrict the rights of people to vote’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft campus stock image" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q40lPInTqiUApZey4YZkPhv2F2Q=/0x1:1100x734/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055739/Microsoft-_from-Msft_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mdYQvk"&gt;Microsoft is rarely shy about wading into the political conversation these days, and &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/31/why-we-are-concerned-about-georgias-new-election-law/"&gt;the latest missive&lt;/a&gt; from president Brad Smith is no exception: in a blog post titled “Why we are concerned about Georgia’s new election law,” he slams the state’s new Election Integrity Act for making it harder for its employees (and others) to vote — making Microsoft the first big tech company to speak out against the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ODHEz"&gt;If it’s not clear why Microsoft would go out on a limb to challenge the state on this particular issue, there are a few things you should probably know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="VIXHUA"&gt;As Smith points out, Microsoft is becoming a big employer in the state — he says Atlanta is “on the path toward becoming one of Microsoft’s largest hubs in the United States in the coming decade, after Puget Sound and Silicon Valley.” He writes that Microsoft’s workers alone will likely have 80 percent fewer drop boxes for their ballots as a direct result of the law, among other restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0VwHKp"&gt;Big employers in Georgia are currently under scrutiny from activists, including some threatening to boycott both Delta Air Lines and Coke for failing to condemn the law. #BoycottDelta and #BoycottCocaCola were trending topics, &lt;a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/business/delta-coke-face-boycott-campaigns-over-new-georgia-voting-law/ZJUGGDO3HBA3BF2J64WVOQ5YE4/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; Monday. Though Delta and Coca-Cola have each now called the bill “unacceptable” &lt;a href="https://news.delta.com/ed-bastian-memo-your-right-vote"&gt;in a new memo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/1377325405468823560"&gt;a new interview&lt;/a&gt; respectively, it may be a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidshepardson/status/1377309103786225667"&gt;little late&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is now positioning itself favorably compared to these other big companies, largely by being a newcomer that already issued &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BradSmi/status/1374072187263533057"&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QzSa7J"&gt;Smith, the company’s former chief legal officer, is still toeing the line here. While many critics of the Georgia law are happily calling it a form of voter suppression, Microsoft simply explains how this might be “challenging” for voters rather than tugging on heartstrings. Smith doesn’t get any spicier than “From our perspective, there is no rational basis for the Georgia legislature to authorize secure drop boxes but limit their use so severely” or “Can anyone imagine telling taxpayers that they must stop using a mailbox to send in their tax return four days before taxes are due?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UZbPV2"&gt;There’s no promise of any action from Microsoft, just a hope that “companies will come together and make clear that a healthy business requires a healthy community,” and that “we should work together to press the Georgia legislature to change it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="Eb6WIV"&gt;It’s nice to see Microsoft — or any company — voice a desire to maintain or improve voting rights and explain why, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YoTld5"&gt;For the second year in a row, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-cancels-april-fools-day-pranks-coronavirus-2021-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; has obtained an internal email&lt;/a&gt; stating that Google will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; create &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_April_Fools%27_Day_jokes"&gt;a series of elaborate and occasionally entertaining April Fools pranks&lt;/a&gt; this year. Google confirmed the memo to &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;, and to us, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkhMXW"&gt;For the second year in a row, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201179/april-fools-day-2020-is-canceled"&gt;thank you&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google union wins dispute over discussing pay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iBLgDy2bj3q87LLPPjOPr7Nh97I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055725/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xnVHXJ"&gt;Google is telling workers they are allowed to discuss pay and working conditions as part of a settlement agreement with the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU), &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-31/google-promises-not-to-muzzle-staff-on-pay-settling-labor-case?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The move settles a labor dispute &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/alphabet-union-alleges-contract-workers-were-silenced-about-pay?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;brought by AWU in February&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hwhu5L"&gt;The initial complaint alleged that managers at Adecco, a Google subcontracting firm, banned workers from talking about wages and bonuses. It also said that Adecco retaliated against contractor Shannon Wait after she posted pro-union messages on Facebook. The complaint said Google was a joint employer and should therefore be held liable for the treatment of contractors. Google did not admit to this classification in the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TC4Iju"&gt;Wait, who’d been suspended from her job, was reinstated a week after the complaint was filed. She left the company shortly after, as her contract was only for two years, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhAgTq"&gt;On Twitter, she credited the union with helping her get her job back. “The external pressure of our #union, which is only 3 months public, held both Google and its subcontractor accountable for violating labor law,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ComradeShannon/status/1377315839389659142"&gt;she wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s 2021 — the year that tech companies like #Amazon and #Google stand face-to-face with workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUjQjC"&gt;Google is posting signs at the data center in South Carolina as part of the agreement. “WE WILL NOT tell you that you cannot discuss policies with other employees,” the notice reads, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “WE WILL NOT discipline you because you exercise your right to discuss wage rates, bonuses, hours and working conditions with other employees.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x53f3E"&gt;It’s a symbolic victory for the Alphabet Workers Union. The organization, which launched in January, is not currently recognized by the National Labor Relations Board. The complaint brought against Google and Adecco, however, shows the union still has teeth. Its status as a solidarity union also allows it to welcome contractors to the group. The treatment of these workers is a primary concern for union organizers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qfY0dJ"&gt;News of the settlement comes as workers at Amazon face off with management in a union fight that could change the fabric of the tech industry. Warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;voted this month on whether to form a union&lt;/a&gt;. The vote count began yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Among Us getting ‘full art style revamp’ in future update </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rP8rTAIH5W32Ngl7po_IAm9dC_Q=/289x0:2272x1322/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055717/Screen_Shot_2021_03_31_at_2.28.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kvd1IJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is changing its look. In a&lt;a href="https://innersloth.itch.io/among-us/devlog/237019/lets-go-airship-new-update-out-now"&gt; post&lt;/a&gt; on its site today, developer InnerSloth said that its plans have “completely updated the art style with cleaner lines and an easier animation process.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSXMvG"&gt;Since becoming the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196330/among-us-half-billion-players-november"&gt;breakout hit of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, InnerSloth has refocused its efforts on improving and updating the game, even going as far as to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21453499/among-us-2-sequel-popular-canceled-developers-innersloth"&gt;cancel&lt;/a&gt; a planned sequel. Today, InnerSloth said it will also expand its lobby size to include up to 15 players. The developer added that it plans to give players more frequent, transparent updates in an effort teach players more about the game’s behind-the-scenes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dx4Bxz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/shX9aZH1bjs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DEyrOK"&gt;The game gets a new map today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338782/among-us-airship-map-accounts-update-innersloth"&gt;Airship&lt;/a&gt;, on all platforms. The map — the game’s fourth — adds new tasks, including emptying the trash and polishing jewels, as well as additional hats and skins. That includes the so-called “chocolate ice cream” hat that looks suspiciously like poop. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353088/among-us-airship-update-poop-hat-chocolate-ice-cream"&gt;It’s poop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon insists it will give you up to $1,000 in trade-in credits for your broken phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The rear of the iPhone 12 is glossy and it picks up both fingerprints and micro-scratches fairly easily. Use a case." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CDeVlyf59mC0XzVvG5_q53Qu8Ko=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055702/vpavic_4243_20201017_0103.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y0ZsK7"&gt;April Fools Day is at hand, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fyou-broke-your-phone-so-verizon-breaking-rules&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360418%2Fverizon-april-fools-day-trade-in-broken-cracked-water-damage-phone-android-iphone-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon has willingly stepped into the fray&lt;/a&gt; with a deal that seems too good to be true — especially for people who have a broken, useless phone. The US carrier insists that starting tomorrow, April 1st, customers can trade in an “old, cracked, or water damaged phone” for up to $1,000 off a new 5G phone, like an &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/vergeVerizonInsists03312021/https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/apple-iphone-12/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/vergeVerizonInsists03312021/https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt;. The promo doesn’t extend to phones with battery damage (for safety concerns).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSJ3xR"&gt;You’ll get the most out of this deal if you’re on a different carrier and looking to open a new line and port your number into Verizon’s network. But current customers can reap some savings, too. You can find out the value of your phone online or at any of its retail stores, although if you plan to visit in-person, the company encourages you to make an appointment on its &lt;a href="http://vzw.com/stores"&gt;store locator page&lt;/a&gt; or through the My Verizon app. The offer &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fshop%2Fonline%2F5g-cell-phones%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360418%2Fverizon-april-fools-day-trade-in-broken-cracked-water-damage-phone-android-iphone-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will go live on this page&lt;/a&gt; starting April 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8KQTct"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Trust us — this offer is #NoJoke”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XuZgYa"&gt;So, here’s the fine print (there’s a lot of it, but it’s worth trudging through if you think you may want to try for the deal):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RWnyZj"&gt;Eligibility requires upgrading, or adding a new line and porting a number, to one of Verizon’s Unlimited plans with 5G&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0Qa1a0"&gt;For new lines and phone number port-ins, or current customers porting a line from a different network: you can get a $300 Verizon e-gift card for an iPhone trade-in, or a $200 card for an Android phone (sent to you within eight weeks after transaction)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="74npNW"&gt;Stacked on that for new lines and port-ins (and also applicable for current customers who want to add a line, but not port in a number): you’ll get up to $700 in monthly credits sent your way for an iPhone trade-in, or up to $800 for a qualified Android phone (sent to you as a credit each month over a 24-month period)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cZ2zUm"&gt;If you’re simply upgrading your phone, but only have a broken phone to trade, Verizon will give you up to $440 in savings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="W8wz5J"&gt;There’s no limit as to how many people per account can trade in broken phones to take advantage of the deal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aO7Q6A"&gt;This is a “limited time” offer, but Verizon didn’t share when it will end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1qxg1k"&gt;Once all is said and done, you’ll eventually have a $300 Verizon credit sitting on your account, and / or an additional credit coming your way each month, which will lower the cost of your monthly bill. It won’t make the investment of buying a pricey, new 5G phone any less steep upfront, but it’ll soften the blow a little by spreading the credits out over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndZWHu"&gt;Verizon didn’t share exactly how much trade-in value every phone has, but it offered a list of phones that are in a “higher value” category and others that will fetch a “lower value.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Verizon trade in" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ew0cMFeYfkZ0u5p2VZK_24dWIEA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410998/verizontrade.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, that’s right — Verizon will take your RED Hydrogen One as if that never happened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UykTyw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 3:00PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Verizon responded to &lt;/em&gt;The Verge’&lt;em&gt;s request for clarification on a few points, including how many people can take advantage of this promo within a single account, when the promo will end, and how the credits received differ depending on whether you’re a new or current customer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="D9Ipaf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Your phone’s unlimited plan, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="H8BhBi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram launches its own TikTok Duet feature called Reels Remix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BRcA2qxLA-CKwGuyJh6PimKqVM4=/297x0:2151x1236/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055614/Remix_Press.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yMdSbd"&gt;Instagram Reels already mimics TikTok in multiple ways, and now, it’s getting one more feature from the popular video app: duets. On Instagram, users can now &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1377304845204422661?s=21"&gt;“remix” a reel&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they can upload a video next to another user’s, building on top of the original clip. The feature is already popular on TikTok, often for dance challenges, under the “duet” function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8mVQc"&gt;To remix a reel, tap the three dot menu on a reel and select “Remix this Reel.” From there, you can record your reel or upload pre-recorded footage. You can also control the volume for the original audio or your recorded audio, and add a voiceover, along with other editing functions. Only new reels will have remixes enabled automatically, but if you already have a reel that you want people to be able to remix, you can manually turn that on by tapping that three dot menu on your own video and selecting “Enable Remixing.” If you want to turn off remixing on all your reels, you can do so via your broader profile settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HLkeh"&gt;Reels launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;in August last year&lt;/a&gt; and initially, Instagram seemed open to having people repurpose their TikToks on the platform. But as the months have gone by, Instagram has added more TikTok-like features while also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274332/instagram-algorithm-tiktok-watermark-recommendation-software-best-practices"&gt;deemphasizing&lt;/a&gt; any content that’s been recycled.   The company is clearly serious about making the short-form video content a mainstay. It added a Reels button to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21561099/instagram-reels-shopping-home-screen-tab-update"&gt;home screen&lt;/a&gt; and even ensured the videos made the cut for its global &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22321394/instagram-relaunch-lite-app-release-update-reels-android"&gt;Lite app&lt;/a&gt;. It’s just getting closer and closer to resembling TikTok exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmBvN6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord’s new Clubhouse-like feature, Stage Channels, is available now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/imiwdmSET9OJiQs8gkFexkLB85k=/0x64:2880x1984/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055520/Audience.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Discord&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zxy7bb"&gt;Discord is the latest company to introduce a Clubhouse-like feature that lets people easily broadcast live audio conversations to a room of virtual listeners. Discord says its take, called Stage Channels, is available now on all platforms where Discord is available, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFVR6q"&gt;If you’ve used Discord before, you might know that the app already offers voice channels, which typically allow everyone in them to talk freely. A Stage Channel, on the other hand, is designed to only let certain people talk at once to a group of listeners, which could make them useful for more structured events like community town halls or AMAs. However, only Community servers, which have some more powerful community management tools than a server you might share with a few of your buddies, can make the new Stage Channels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nf7svx"&gt;The feature’s broad availability makes Discord the first app to offer an easy way to host or listen in on social audio rooms on most platforms. Clubhouse is still only available on iOS, though an Android version &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/clubhouse-says-its-android-launch-will-take-a-couple-of-months/"&gt;is in development&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter’s Spaces feature works on iOS and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309629/twitter-launches-spaces-android-ios-audio-clubhouse"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, but only some users have the ability to make audio rooms right now. (The company plans to let anyone host a Space &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323767/twitter-spaces-april-release-date-plan"&gt;starting in April&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315866/mark-cuban-fireside-app-podcast-platform-clubhouse"&gt;Mark Cuban&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; are also working on live audio features, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;Facebook reportedly has one&lt;/a&gt; in the works, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYiv7n"&gt;At the top of this post, you can see what a Discord Stage Channel looks like on desktop, and here’s what one looks like on mobile:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TpMG23KLKUcOpg_MBwV4-icXsgQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22409295/Default.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Discord&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G9DQAL"&gt;I got to participate in a Stage Channel to be briefed on the feature, and it was quite similar to using Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces. When I joined the Stage Channel, I was automatically put on mute and listed as an audience member. I could see who was speaking and who else was with me in the virtual crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEN3aY"&gt;When I wanted to ask questions, I pressed a button to request to speak, and a Stage moderator brought me “on stage” so I could talk. Stage moderators can also mute speakers or even remove them from the room if they are being disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gO1W8G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cell phone plan fine print, explained</title>

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XX4UYQkK_A81tQh9b_JmRvspGho=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055394/acastro_210330_4500_phoneData_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlimited plans from Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile all have one thing in common: limitations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A guide to the limitations on your unlimited data&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ejBS9S"&gt;Phone plans are notorious for including the worst kinds of jargon — things that seem to tell you what you’re signing up for but actually conceal a long list of conditions and exceptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfKPDU"&gt;This is the industry that brought us the term “anytime minutes.” Seriously, have you ever really thought about that phrase? &lt;em&gt;Anytime minutes.&lt;/em&gt; Even the 10-year-old &lt;em&gt;Portlandia&lt;/em&gt; sketch where Kumail Nanjiani sells Fred and Carrie a phone plan is still painfully accurate. (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrccTMwoLv8"&gt;Go watch it&lt;/a&gt; for such gems as “After you pay for it, it is free” and “It’s just a one-time fee that you pay annually.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPW9SB"&gt;So it should come as no surprise that when wireless carriers call a service “Unlimited,” there are, in fact, limitations on it. T-Mobile recently brought attention to one of those practices known as “deprioritization” by introducing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;an unlimited plan without it&lt;/a&gt;. But that’s just one of a handful of fine print provisos that all three of the major US carriers impose on their customers. Here’s a jargon-free guide to the most common limitations on your favorite carrier’s so-called unlimited plans, postpaid and prepaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qHiyY4"&gt;Premium data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HnEpNO"&gt;You will likely see the phrase “premium data” or “premium network access” on your plan details; that’s a nice way of describing “deprioritization,” or “throttling” as it’s also called. This is when carriers temporarily slow down data speeds for their heaviest users when network traffic is high. The carriers say this practice is necessary to ensure networks aren’t overwhelmed. In many cases, deprioritization doesn’t kick in until users hit a certain monthly threshold of data usage — often 50GB — but some carriers’ lowest-tier plan subscribers are always subject to slowdowns, regardless of how much data they’ve used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="R5GdxD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some carriers’ lowest-tier plan subscribers are always subject to slowdowns&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UzMdrt"&gt;That’s the case for users on Verizon’s Start Unlimited plan and AT&amp;amp;T’s Unlimited Starter, while those on the carriers’ more expensive unlimited plans aren’t subject to slowdowns until they’ve used 50GB in a month. T-Mobile’s basic Essentials plan includes a 50GB threshold. Its most expensive plan, Magenta Max, is the only one of the major carriers’ plans that doesn’t include a limit on its fastest mobile data speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBMPZK"&gt;Prepaid unlimited plans from all of the major carriers across the board are subject to slowdowns, regardless of how much data has been used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N9MpjO"&gt;Video streaming limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="EherbJ"&gt;With your smartphone connected to home Wi-Fi, you can stream video at whatever resolution you please. Streaming video over mobile data is another story. Just about every phone plan out there limits streaming video to 480p quality, but there are a few exceptions. But even the plans that do support higher-quality streaming usually require you to enable it in your account. If you do have this option and choose to enable it, just keep in mind that streaming video might eat into your monthly “premium data” allotment faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yz9TMC"&gt;For example, Verizon’s more expensive unlimited plans include 720p streaming, but you need to log in to your account online and enable it. For an extra $10 per month, you can raise that to 1080p. And if you’re connected to the company’s fast Ultra Wideband 5G — which is only included on those more expensive unlimited plans — you’ll get streaming up to 4K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eoqSn2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even the plans that do support higher-quality streaming usually require you to enable it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8IM7fz"&gt;The other two carriers work in a similar way. AT&amp;amp;T’s basic unlimited plans get 480p, and while the “Elite” plan includes 1080p, you’ll need to turn off a feature called “Stream Saver” in your account settings to enable it. T-Mobile’s most expensive plan, Magenta Max, includes 4K streaming, which customers need to activate. All others are limited to 1.5Mbps, which essentially translates to 480p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0ysgF"&gt;With a couple of exceptions, customers on prepaid unlimited plans are restricted to 480p streaming, too. AT&amp;amp;T’s most expensive prepaid unlimited plan allows users to disable Stream Saver and get 1080p streaming if they like. Verizon prepaid customers on the unlimited plan with Ultra Wideband 5G service will also get 4K if they’re connected to that network. Some data-capped prepaid plans from T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T allow customers to opt for HD, but not so for basic unlimited plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UnH9SV"&gt;Tethering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ObhxDk"&gt;Another one for the category of “your unlimited data is not truly unlimited” is mobile tethering. Even though your phone might support tethering (using your mobile device’s data connection as a Wi-Fi hotspot or via a USB cable to your computer), your phone plan has limitations on if and how much you can use this feature. Basic unlimited plans tend to offer slow or no tethering at all, while even the most expensive plans include some limit to how much data you can use this way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="C0Hpfa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Basic unlimited plans tend to offer slow or no tethering at all&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HLcpEf"&gt;There’s no mobile tethering offered on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s most basic unlimited plan. More expensive plans from both carriers offer progressively more generous 15GB and 30GB caps the more you pay. T-Mobile offers 3G tethering (600 Kbps) on its basic plan, which is adequate for web browsing but not ideal for streaming SD or HD video. Up to 5GB of much faster 4G / 5G data is included on its middle tier and a cap of 40GB on Magenta Max — these speeds will feel much closer to what you get with home internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrsCFv"&gt;Mobile tethering tends to not be included on basic prepaid unlimited plans; AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon offer it as an add-on for an additional monthly fee, while T-Mobile includes it at 3G speeds. The step-up prepaid unlimited plans include high-speed tethering across the board, albeit with a lower 10GB cap in all cases. Verizon does include unlimited Ultra Wideband 5G tethering for its top prepaid plan (again, if you can manage to find an Ultra Wideband signal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qhruad"&gt;Mexico and Canada&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vpbF5d"&gt;If there’s one way that your unlimited plan might actually be getting you more than you realized, it’s that your plan likely includes some international data for trips to Canada and Mexico. Most plans include, as a bare minimum, very slow 2G speeds in those countries, but a few include a certain amount of 4G data on either a monthly or daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FNWFev"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most plans include, as a bare minimum, very slow 2G speeds&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RGkzUd"&gt;Verizon makes it simple: it includes up to 0.5GB per day for all of its postpaid and prepaid unlimited plans. Once that daily cap is reached, you’ll get 2G speeds after that. AT&amp;amp;T only says that all unlimited plans — postpaid and prepaid — include data in Mexico and Canada but that “2G off-net data speeds may apply.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeQe49"&gt;T-Mobile’s basic postpaid Essentials plan gets 2G only; the top-tier plans include 5GB of 4G monthly and then 2G after that. The company’s prepaid unlimited plans don’t include even 2G data, and “additional charges apply for international use.” Instead, users can add 5GB of 4G data for use in Canada and Mexico for an additional $5 per month. T-Mobile and Verizon also specify that the majority of a subscriber’s usage must come from within the US; otherwise, the companies are entitled to cut off international service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QDXOKP"&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="n9VNnO"&gt;Those are the major items, but what else will you find if you go peering down the dark alleyways of your phone contract? Some are obvious, like clauses to keep you from turning your phone into your home Wi-Fi hub. Plans with generous tethering data allowances are more likely to include these details, stating, for example, that the majority of use must come from a smartphone or tablet. And of course, your contract prohibits you from certain types of bad behavior and illegal activity. But you knew that already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzGw8Q"&gt;You might also be pleasantly surprised to find discounted or subsidized streaming video services are included in your plan, too, but you’ll definitely want to read the conditions closely. Often, it’s a promotion for a set time period, like Verizon’s “Disney Plus for six months on us,” after which you’ll be charged on your monthly phone bill unless you cancel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyTPmo"&gt;Others — usually on the more expensive plans — are included standard, like HBO Max included on AT&amp;amp;T’s Elite plan, and Netflix subscriptions on T-Mobile’s Magenta and Magenta Max. Even in those cases, you’ll want to read the conditions; a certain number of lines are required on T-Mobile to qualify for the Netflix deal, and the subscription offered may be for a more limited version, like SD quality only on one screen per account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="985AFE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s one more agreement in your contract to be aware of: the privacy policy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5TWlaB"&gt;But there’s one more agreement in your contract to be aware of: the privacy policy. Specifically, all three major carriers sell anonymized data about their customers to third-party advertisers in the name of serving more relevant ads. It’s an unwelcome but extremely common practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3ruipH"&gt;The good news is that you can opt out of these programs. Verizon customers can do so by logging in to My Verizon and following the steps on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fprivacy%2Ffull-privacy-policy%23acc-item-34&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360228%2Funlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company’s privacy page&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, T-Mobile customers can find instructions for opting out on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fprivacy-center%2Ftake-control-of-your-data&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360228%2Funlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;carrier’s privacy center page&lt;/a&gt;, and AT&amp;amp;T customers can opt out by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http://www.att.com/cmpchoice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321733/t-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22085774__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;logging in to their account’s privacy controls&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not going to stop the dozens upon dozens of other websites and services that you use from selling your information, but it’s at least one less source to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
