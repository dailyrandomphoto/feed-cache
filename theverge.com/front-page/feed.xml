    <title>Colleges across the US and Canada are adopting virtual student IDs</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vC0XZi"&gt;Apple Wallet has supported contactless student IDs &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2018%2F10%2Fapple-adds-support-for-contactless-student-id-cards-in-wallet%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F4%2F22609571%2Fapple-wallet-student-ids-university-expansion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt;, with three US universities supporting the feature at launch. The program has been &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2019%2F08%2Fapple-brings-contactless-student-ids-on-iphone-and-apple-watch-to-more-universities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F4%2F22609571%2Fapple-wallet-student-ids-university-expansion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gradually expanding&lt;/a&gt; ever since. Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F08%2Fstudent-ids-on-iphone-and-apple-watch-expand-to-canada-and-more-us-universities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F4%2F22609571%2Fapple-wallet-student-ids-university-expansion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt; that its virtual IDs will finally arrive in Canada this fall. An unspecified number of additional US universities will adopt it for the first time as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lO6K5Z"&gt;The University of New Brunswick and Sheridan College will be the first two Canadian schools to use Apple Wallet IDs. The new US roster includes Auburn, Northern Arizona University, University of Maine, and New Mexico State University, in addition to “many more colleges across the country.” &lt;a href="https://news.ua.edu/2021/04/old-swipe-action-cards-deactivating-this-summer/"&gt;The University of Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, one of the program’s early adopters, will also be the first school to issue exclusively mobile student IDs (to students with eligible devices) this fall. (Those with Android phones can use the digital cards through Google Pay.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fl2DdY"&gt;Apple claims that “tens of thousands of college students” will have access to the feature during this upcoming school year.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Duke was one of the first universities to support virtual IDs in 2018.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3KiTja"&gt;In theory, the virtual student ID should offer all the functionality of a regular student ID — holders can access restricted areas of campus or pay for amenities like food and laundry by placing their iPhone or Apple Watch near a physical reader. Transaction history isn’t shared with Apple or stored on Apple’s servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXmkxl"&gt;The new student ID format is part of Apple’s larger effort to expand Apple Wallet’s functionality. The app can also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;store hotel room keys&lt;/a&gt; with the release of iOS 15 and will support driver’s licenses and state IDs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reconciliation could create a new kind of climate job</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bicameral Democrats Call For Civilian Climate Corps To Be Included In Reconciliation Process" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rbAJ1wY-bjEqRVI8z9YKWVL-1jY=/0x34:6594x4430/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69678467/1329721258.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) speaks at a press conference urging the inclusion of the Civilian Climate Corps., a climate jobs program, in the budget reconciliation bill, outside of the U.S. Capitol on July 20, 2021 in Washington, DC. Ocasio-Cortez was joined by (L-R) Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Rep. Judy Chu (D-CA), Rep. Joe Neguse (D-CO), Joe Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and climate activists. | Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OZKWTb"&gt;If Democrats and progressives have their way, tens of thousands — or even millions — of Americans could soon find work planting urban trees, managing forests, and making homes more energy efficient and resilient to the ravages of climate change. They’d form a new “Civilian Climate Corps” that lawmakers and activists are hoping to fund through the budget reconciliation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ehubwh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The idea has picked up significant momentum&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1wYCzK"&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/dems-agree-on-a-climate-corps-now-comes-the-hard-part/"&gt;more than a decade&lt;/a&gt;, different proposals have floated around for a new civilian mobilization focused on climate adaption. Recently, the idea has picked up significant momentum. The most ambitious proposal yet was introduced by Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) in April. Joe Biden proposed a more pared down Civilian Climate Corps as part of his American Jobs Plan in March, drawing on a range of previous proposals. Most recently, lawmakers have pushed for some form of the corps to be included in upcoming budget reconciliation negotiations, sending a &lt;a href="https://kaptur.house.gov/sites/kaptur.house.gov/files/Civilian%20Climate%20Corps%20Congressional%20Letter%20-%20Kaptur.pdf"&gt;joint letter&lt;/a&gt; to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgUaBx"&gt;The proposals differ in size and scope, but each would put people to work on federally funded projects that can minimize the toll climate change takes on the US. That might mean installing solar panels in Philadelphia, tending to sustainable urban farms in New York City, or building new career pathways for former coal communities in Appalachia. The Climate Corps would be overseen by a new body within the White House, and would also bolster the work of federal agencies like FEMA that already partner with other corps programs. And as the government establishes a new funding stream, the hope is that communities will find new projects and ways to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLe3Aj"&gt;There are already a range of nonprofit groups doing this work, and many are already looking to the Climate Corp proposals as a way to expand. “We’re ready to go,” says Julia Hillengas, executive director of one such program called PowerCorpsPHL. “There’s 130 plus corps across the country. There’s communities that are ripe and primed to start corps … they have all the pieces there, it’s just a matter of being able to get some of that seed funding to get things off the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="yavEdA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re ready to go.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CIBxe2"&gt;The idea of a civilian environmental mobilization on New Deal-era concepts was launched by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to fight the Depression — particularly, the Civilian Conservation Corps launched in 1933, which provided job training and stipends to young men. &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/08/01/fdr-cabinet-descendents-new-deal-biden-progressive-500659"&gt;Many in Biden’s staff&lt;/a&gt; have taken cues from Roosevelt as the current president looks to boost the economic recovery and prepare for future shocks from the climate crisis.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSER6A"&gt;Today’s corps programs generally serve two purposes: to accomplish some kind of public good, and to prepare its members for a particular vocation. In Philadelphia, PowerCorpsPHL members join “industry academies” focused on stormwater infrastructure, urban forestry, and solar energy. Since Hillengas co-founded the program in 2013, its members have planted more than 11,000 trees — an important &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573081/google-new-tool-hot-cities-trees-climate-change-temperature"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; for cooling down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22575481/nyc-urban-heat-island-effect-thermal-camera-surface-temperature"&gt;city neighborhoods that tend to be hotter&lt;/a&gt; than surrounding, greener areas. Many of their alumni move on to find related work afterward — members in the solar academy, for example, might find work installing or selling solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzIJrh"&gt;A similar program in New York City, called Green City Force, employs public housing residents who have built sustainable farms on public housing properties to provide organic, local produce to other residents. They also retrofit homes to make them more energy efficient, a vocation in which 65 percent of the program’s graduates have gone on to find employment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Philadelphia, PowerCorpsPHL members receive training on installing solar panels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pTBMK4"&gt;“What we hear from a lot of corps is this need for institutional support that is equitable and just and robustly funded, for making sure that they have the monetary resources to go out into the community to recruit folks, to give them the training they need, and to put them to work,” says Becca Ellison, deputy policy director at the nonprofit Evergreen Action. Evergreen, environmental activist group Sunrise Movement, and Democratic lawmakers are also asking that 50 percent of the funding and jobs for the Climate Corps go to environmental justice communities. Those are places that have been disproportionately burdened with pollution from industry, and that typically have more low-income residents and residents of color.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjZOGX"&gt;In the long term, advocates hope that climate mitigation and resiliency initiatives could also create new, green career paths for people who otherwise might have found work in coal, oil, or gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4uLg9"&gt;“We can kind of create this new world, this new Appalachia that has vibrant communities with good paying jobs,” says Béla Williams, a sixteen-year-old community organizer from southwest Virginia who joined the Appalachian Conservation Corps this summer. “I think a lot of communities can benefit greatly from opportunities like the Civilian Climate Corps, especially in places that have been ravaged by the coal industry or other extractive industries leaving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WvQ5G3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can kind of create this new world, this new Appalachia.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HsCuvV"&gt;Advocates are optimistic that the package will include some kind of Civilian Climate Corps — but the size of the program is still up for debate. The Biden administration proposed $10 billion to be doled out over a decade, which might be able to fund up to 20,000 jobs a year by some estimates. Markey, Ocasio-Cortez, and Sunrise Movement have asked for far more — $132 billion to hire 1.5 million Climate Corps members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqj0RD"&gt;“[Markey and Ocasio-Cortez’s] proposal, we believe will signify the beginning of the decade of the green New Deal because it would give millions of good jobs to people,” says Ellen Sciales, communications director for Sunrise Movement. They say the more expensive proposal will also ensure that corps members make at least $15 an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjdGVC"&gt;Without that funding, participants may be stuck making less than a living wage. Current members of AmeriCorps-funded programs get paid a minimum stipend of $16,000 a year, although organizations like PowerCorpsPHL often try to raise funds to pay their members more. The hope is that, with economic stimulus still on the White House agenda, the federal government will be willing to put in the necessary funds to make the programs economically sustainable and make climate mitigation part of a sustainable career path for young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wKkaG"&gt;“That’s money in young people’s pockets that they’re using to support their families,” Hillengas says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sh516W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The author of this story was previously a member of Public Allies and Jumpstart, corps programs that are part of the AmeriCorps network. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Buying an Oculus headset to help get your Facebook account back is a risky move</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0F-A37zq9kFNKi8U5Tnp3A6B8L4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69678427/akrales_200904_4160_0135.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0dDzlk"&gt;Some Facebook users stymied by the company’s seemingly impenetrable support channels have turned to an interesting — and expensive — loophole to get access to their locked accounts: buying an Oculus Quest headset, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/02/1023801277/your-facebook-account-was-hacked-getting-help-may-take-weeks-or-299"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But it doesn’t appear to be a reliable way to get access, as many reports online indicate that the solution didn’t work out for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tm6Qzh"&gt;The crux of the issue is that it’s often difficult to know if Facebook is receiving support requests when you submit them through its normal channels. From &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jY5bX0"&gt;Facebook tells users to report hacked accounts through its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/hacked"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. The site instructs them to upload a copy of a driver’s license or passport to prove their identities. But the people NPR spoke with said they had trouble with every step of this automated process and wish Facebook would offer a way to reach a real person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXB0Bi"&gt;“I sent these forms in morning, noon and night, multiple times a day,” [Jessie] Marsala said. “Nobody got back to me, not once.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6VM9r2"&gt;Facebook says &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/155050237914643?helpref=faq_content"&gt;on its own support site&lt;/a&gt; that “we have fewer people available to review IDs because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic” and that reviews “may take longer than usual” as a result. And a Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; that “we also know that we need to keep improving in this area and plan to invest more in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZeyYz"&gt;The breakthrough, for some people, was a tip they found to buy a headset from Facebook-owned Oculus, which has its own customer support system, according to &lt;em&gt;NPR. NPR &lt;/em&gt;spoke with two people who successfully got access to their Facebook accounts after buying an Oculus. But we’ve found a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/on2ykq/buying_an_oculus_to_use_their_tech_support_to/h5psvmr/"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/jc7ys6/oculus_support_can_not_help_you_with_facebook/g90tqaq/"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/k66izc/facebook_account_issue/gejbaw8/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; indicating that Oculus support &lt;em&gt;hasn’t&lt;/em&gt; delivered a smoother support experience, so there’s no guarantee that it might work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pb4prU"&gt;And even if you are thinking of buying an Oculus Quest 2 to try to get some support help, you can’t actually get one right now — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596076/facebook-oculus-quest-2-storage-upgrade-foam-face-mask-recall"&gt;Oculus has paused sales until August 24th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York Auto Show canceled as delta variant spreads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c_-Giq0cD0_UUAZZXKjm64k32_k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69678406/akrales_180328_2315_0942.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1oiU7a"&gt;The 2021 New York International Auto Show has been canceled as the delta variant of COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the United States. The show was supposed to run from August 20th to August 29th at the Jacob K. Javits Center in New York City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BLTip"&gt;The show’s organizers announced the cancellation Wednesday “with great disappointment,” according to a statement, citing the spread of the delta variant and increased safety measures such as the new proof of vaccination requirements &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607882/key-to-nyc-pass-covid-vaccine-proof-new-york-city"&gt;announced by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio this week&lt;/a&gt;. The decision came suddenly, as just last week organizers revealed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMartinez_AN/status/1422970236400193536"&gt;a poster for the event&lt;/a&gt; titled “The Future is Bright.” This year’s show was supposed to have a special focus on electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w3jb9p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All signs were positive... but today is a different story.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c3e1MX"&gt;“At the onset of planning for the August Show, we were increasingly excited at the prospect of hosting the event as the number of vaccinations in New York continued to climb and mask-wearing reduced the spread in the City,” the organizers said in the statement. “All signs were positive, and the Show was coming together stronger than ever, but today is a different story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjsNlg"&gt;The 2020 New York Auto Show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173663/new-york-international-auto-show-2020-canceled-coronavirus-covid-19"&gt;was one of the first to get delayed&lt;/a&gt; last year as the pandemic took hold, with organizers first pushing it to August before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267785/new-york-international-auto-show-nyais-2020-canceled-coronavirus"&gt;outright canceling it&lt;/a&gt;. (The Javits Center was used as a field hospital in the interim.) This year’s show was meant to be one of the first to return, following the &lt;a href="https://www.beloitdailynews.com/news/illinois-news/chicago-auto-show-2021-special-edition/article_17ca652d-baa0-58f9-9f99-3b39e6ac6e73.html"&gt;Chicago Auto Show last month&lt;/a&gt;. Others slated for later this year, such as the Los Angeles Auto Show in November, now hang in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXlZnB"&gt;“The Covid pandemic has challenged our City, the country and the entire world, but just like the automobile industry, we know that the New York Auto Show will rebound and be bigger and better than before,” the organizers wrote. “We firmly believe that will be the case when the Show returns to its regular spring schedule in April 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrhl1Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u6dPXS"&gt;If you’ve ever hit “Send” on a Gmail email and regretted it ten seconds later, you’ll know how handy — even necessary — a delayed send function can be. It could be the sudden realization that you accidentally hit “Reply all,” or a feeling that you may have sent it to the wrong contact, or that there is a misspelling somewhere in there — or, perhaps worst of all, the knowledge that you just sent off an angry missive that you probably shouldn’t have. In any of these cases, a few seconds to stop that email could keep your day from imploding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Pt5Sc"&gt;(Gmail, of course, isn’t the only email app with this ability; other apps offer it as well.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VwHx4K"&gt;Gmail offers a standard five-second window to allow you to change your mind and unsend the email, but if you feel that you need a little more time, you can arrange it. I find it valuable to allow myself a longer time to rethink an email; while I’ve only had to stop an email from going out a few times, those few times probably saved me from, at the very least, having to send out an apologetic follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yW7NmW"&gt;You set it up using the web version of Gmail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Ofqpzt"&gt;Click on the “Settings” cogwheel in the upper right corner, and on “See all settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kbHzEe"&gt;Under the “General” tab, look for “Undo Send.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iFX0no"&gt;Choose how long you’d like Gmail to give you to change your mind: you can select five seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds, or 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pj5hW0"&gt;Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on “Save Changes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can have up to 30 seconds to change your mind." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L1UTv0wlhqE0hJVVKpq195CPd9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759448/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_4.06.35_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can have up to 30 seconds to change your mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gUMzf0"&gt;When you click on send, you’ll see an option in the lower left corner to “Undo” your email that will last as long as you’ve set it to; it will also be available in the mobile app. If you want, you can click on “Undo” and you’ll be brought back to your email draft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Undo” link at the bottom left will let you bring back your email, unsent." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2XmsEr7UInHhyS6qv4KbqXtF69w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759459/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_4.11.19_PM.png"&gt;

    <title>Code for America employees are unionizing </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XDj7CHqe0oenEBxNdOyeqJZBvpM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69677844/CFA_169.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nV4pEz"&gt;Employees at Code for America (CFA) announced today they are unionizing with the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) Local 1010. Organizers say 62 people have signed authorization cards, meaning 77 percent of eligible employees have indicated their support for the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWpQEf"&gt;The national nonprofit builds tech products for government agencies, including helping &lt;a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/programs/criminal-legal-system/clear-my-record/"&gt;county courthouses automatically clear peoples’ records&lt;/a&gt; once they are eligible and operating one of the &lt;a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/programs/social-safety-net/getcalfresh/"&gt;biggest intake sites for California food stamp benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHt3Um"&gt;Employees say they are largely happy with the work — and are better paid than colleagues at other nonprofits. Still, they feel a union could give them more of a say in business decisions. “A union gives independent contributors a seat at the table,” says Ash Campo, a CFA employee and organizer. “Unionizing allows us to rethink the barrier between staff and management, so that regular staff can have a meaningful say in decisions that affect them and benefit the organization collectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bV9eYQ"&gt;The announcement is part of a larger movement of white collar workers unionizing. In 2020, workers at Kickstarter formed&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/kickstarter-workers-vote-form-first-union-tech-industry-n1138006"&gt; one of the first unions made up of full-time white collar workers&lt;/a&gt; in the tech industry, also with OPEIU. Earlier this year, employees at Glitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22307671/glitch-workers-sign-historic-collective-bargaining-agreement-cwa"&gt;signed one of tech’s first collective bargaining agreements&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ryJcA"&gt;CFA’s organizing effort began almost a year ago. At first, some employees were skeptical, noting that the organization already gives employees input on policy decisions. But organizers felt this wasn’t enough. “Folks are generally happy with the way things are going and speak to the collaborative nature of management,” explains Ben Calegari, a software engineer and union organizer. “But I think an issue with that is it relies on having a relationship with managers to create change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQdQyS"&gt;Another union organizer who asked to remain anonymous agrees. “A union would give us collective power, where right now we have to rely on individual power to get things changed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpPigP"&gt;Employees say they plan to advocate for better compensation and promotion policies and possibly a seat on the board. “We have an opportunity as nonprofit workers who make a little more and are better funded than others to prove that nobody is above dignified work, with the consent and input of workers,” says Calegari. “There are many people in worse conditions than ours who do not have the latitude to speak and move as freely as we do. So it’s our responsibility to use our freedom for the collective good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ud6pWn"&gt;Ash Campo also says the union is a chance for CFA to fully realize its goals. “Code for America’s mission is to build technology by and for people, and for me unionizing is the actualization of that mission internally,” they explain. “We want to create policies that are built by people for people and unionizing is the only way to give us a seat at that table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TW5dcz"&gt;On Monday, the union asked Code for America management for voluntary recognition. Grace Reckers, a lead organizer with OPEIU, says she’s hopeful that will happen, but notes employees are prepared if it doesn’t. “I have full confidence they would win an election if we needed to go there,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCXfrc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6I4v4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ghost of Tsushima’s multiplayer mode is getting new content and a standalone release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O-Ujovrm_2w2a2sx-Bsj7aVfWNI=/170x0:2006x1224/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69677809/51355499484_95d501812b_o_scaled.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima: Legends’ new Rivals mode.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d73nRP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima’s&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer mode, &lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt;, is getting some new free content and a standalone release, Sony and developer Sucker Punch &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/04/ghost-of-tsushima-legends-gets-standalone-release-adds-new-rivals-mode-on-september-3/"&gt;announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The standalone release will be available on September 3rd for $19.99 / €19.99 / £15.99 on both PS4 and PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mG1TNl"&gt;That same day, a big new 2v2 mode called Rivals will be introduced to &lt;em&gt;Legends.&lt;/em&gt; Here’s how Darren Bridges, a senior game designer at Sucker Punch, &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/04/ghost-of-tsushima-legends-gets-standalone-release-adds-new-rivals-mode-on-september-3/"&gt;describes it in a blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NK5z5y"&gt;In Rivals, two teams of two will compete to defeat waves of enemies. With each defeated foe, you’ll collect Magatama that you can use to harm the other team. For example, you can spend Magatama on Shades to block your opponents’ purchases, Curses (health drain, exploding bodies, etc), Hwacha fire, and more. Once you’ve spent enough Magatama, you’ll unlock Final Stand waves. Complete these before the opposing team to win!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ahg62g"&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCgjNK8etz8"&gt;check out this video for a preview&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zTtpyT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mCgjNK8etz8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tXthDP"&gt;Alongside Rivals, &lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; will also get a Gear Mastery system to further kit out your gear. According to Bridges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="P4Npfj"&gt;Players who’ve earned 110-level gear will now be able to bind it to a class and activate “Mastery Challenges.” This will allow a piece of gear’s Ki level to be upgraded to 120 and eventually unlock a second perk slot! As you activate Mastery Challenges, you can also unlock a new Ability and new Techniques for each class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mprtsS"&gt;Sucker Punch is also launching an update to &lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; on August 20th, the same day as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559264/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-sony-ps4-ps5-sucker-punch-iki-island"&gt;the release of &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that includes rebalancing Survival mode. And the developer is promising that &lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; will receive a “new piece of content each week from September 10th through October 1st,” including a new map for Rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ahz6OL"&gt;If you pick up the standalone &lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; and want to play the &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima &lt;/em&gt;single-player campaign, you can upgrade to &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;, which includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559264/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-sony-ps4-ps5-sucker-punch-iki-island"&gt;a new island to explore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587775/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-expansion-pet-cats-deer-monkeys-sony-sucker-punch"&gt;more animals to pet&lt;/a&gt;, for $40 / €50 /£44 on PS4 or $50 / €60 / £54 on PS5.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy VII Remake for PS4 and PS5 is half off through August 19th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WKeKP807QHUY7ZaylOBnixZs2Q8=/37x0:1657x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69677587/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REMAKE_E3_2019_screenshot_6.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SSqJ1d"&gt;If you haven’t yet played the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;, now is a good time to jump in since you can get the game for up to half off its usual cost. Square Enix has slashed the price of the digital copy of the base game for PS4 (upgradeable to the PS5 version for free, with &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-guide/22524412/ff7-intergrade-save-transfer-data-download-ps5-ps4"&gt;your game saves intact&lt;/a&gt;) down to $30. This matches the best deal we’ve seen yet for the digital version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPXOSg"&gt;Though, if you’re a PS5 owner and want access to the &lt;em&gt;Integrade &lt;/em&gt;downloadable content &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;containing a new episode focused on Yuffie&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a great deal for you, too. Normally $70, you can get the digital version of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&lt;/em&gt; for $50 — essentially making the Yuffie-focused episode a complimentary goodie on top of the base game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgRSm1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; launched in April 2020 for the PS4, but it received a big PS5 update in June 2021 that speeds up load times and improves graphical fidelity. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4"&gt;Read our review of the game right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Floods endanger millions more people than previously estimated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rescue Works At Floods In Henan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jTDLJ1VGiuLgmhoB6bLnFO3htjk=/0x165:3963x2807/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69677537/1330827068.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AiAZ6Q"&gt;Flooding poses a grave risk to tens of millions more people than researchers previously estimated. Up to 86 million more people lived in flood-prone areas around the world in 2015 compared to 2000, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03695-w"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiuxAD"&gt;Thanks to satellite remote sensing, researchers were able to build what they say is the most comprehensive dataset of observed floods yet. It shows that more people have moved to waterfronts where they’re at risk. The findings also suggest that older flood maps used to inform urban planning and insurance policies might be underestimating the real-world risk of flooding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjqvpR"&gt;Just in the past month, shockingly severe floods have taken hundreds of lives in &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-58056667"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/world/europe/europe-floods-germany-belgium.html"&gt;Germany, and Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. In just a few days, a year’s worth of rainfall inundated Zhengzhou, a city in China’s Henan province. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/16/europe/germany-deaths-europe-severe-flooding-intl/index.html"&gt;Record-smashing rainfall&lt;/a&gt; across Western Europe overwhelmed dams and nearly washed away entire towns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fLzxnL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s urgent now that we deal with the resilience issue”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9pJJ3e"&gt;“It just really hits home, the urgency of the issue,” says Colin Doyle, one of the authors of the new study and the director of technology at Cloud to Street, a flood tracking and risk analytics platform. “It’s urgent now that we deal with the resilience issue — both adapting to the events and also creating infrastructure as a safety net.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FP1yeK"&gt;The proportion of people living in flood-prone places grew by 20 to 24 percent since 2000, according to the new research. That’s up to ten times as much as previous studies had estimated. That rise was driven by a few different factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWk9am"&gt;First, satellites have given scientists a better view of flood events. In the past, most flood maps relied on models and not observations of actual floods. Now, with more satellites in space and greater cloud computing ability, researchers like Doyle have new tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6zIwH"&gt;For their comprehensive global study, Doyle and his co-authors were able to look back at images taken daily by two NASA satellites to study floods that took place between 2000 and 2018. They paired that with data on population growth in affected areas to come to their findings. (An interactive Global Flood Database went live today to accompany the new study. On the database &lt;a href="https://global-flood-database.cloudtostreet.ai/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, you can explore the new maps that Doyle and colleagues put together.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qp2o57"&gt;The satellite data also allowed Doyle and his co-authors to look at more kinds of floods than typical flood maps. They included flooding from dam failures, snow melt, and surface water floods. Modeling, on the other hand, tends to limit traditional flood maps to hazards posed when heavy rainfall causes rivers and other bodies of water to swell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QyMLA"&gt;But the rise in flood risk that Doyle and his colleagues documented isn’t merely a reflection of technological advances. New development seems to have gotten more concentrated in flood-prone places. Population growth in those risky areas outpaced global population growth over the same period. That’s partially driven by poverty and a lack of other options for many vulnerable populations, the study notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="aSE3rW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The only option for some communities will be to manage their retreat out of flood-prone areas”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gdSchH"&gt;While more accurate flood maps can give city planners a better idea of where to beef up protective infrastructure, they can also tell them where &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to build in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwuCPe"&gt;“The only option for some communities will be to manage their retreat out of flood-prone areas,” writes Brenden Jongman, a senior disaster risk management specialist at The World Bank who reviewed the study and wrote an accompanying opinion article in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGMG1S"&gt;There’s still more work that can be done to improve flood maps for big cities, both Doyle and Jongman note. The satellites had a harder time peering down into densely packed areas. “If you’re above New York City and looking down, you’d mostly be seeing the tops of all the skyscrapers,” Doyle says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeAv26"&gt;Newer commercial satellites can take images with higher resolution, but it’s still expensive for researchers to access that data. And while newer satellites might be able to take a better picture, they haven’t necessarily been up long enough to let researchers look as far back as Doyle and his colleagues were able to with NASA’s satellites.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5blrp"&gt;Hopefully, time will unlock those tools for researchers, too. They’ll need all the help they can get to forecast future flood risk. Climate change is pushing up sea levels and eating away at coastlines and river deltas that millions of people call home. Rising global average temperatures can also &lt;a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/hurricanes-and-climate-change/"&gt;soup up storms&lt;/a&gt; and lead to more &lt;a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/extreme-precipitation-and-climate-change/"&gt;intense rainfall&lt;/a&gt; in some regions. The &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; study forecasts that by 2030, even more people will be exposed to dangerous flooding.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uszaBp"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S7 FE is officially coming to the US starting on Thursday for the 5G version with the Wi-Fi model expected a few weeks later, the company has announced. The specs of the stripped-back FE, or “Fan Edition,” version of Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;flagship tablet from last year&lt;/a&gt; have been public since a listing for the tablet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451398/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-fe-germany-no-oled"&gt;appeared on its German store in May&lt;/a&gt;, but now we have full details of its US pricing and availability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz3yhb"&gt;The first version of the Galaxy Tab S7 FE to release in the US will be its 5G model. It’ll be available to order starting Thursday, August 5th, from AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, and Samsung’s own online store, with prices starting at $669. It will also be available from other retailers, as well as T-Mobile and US Cellular “in the coming days,” according to Samsung. Meanwhile, the Wi-Fi model will be priced lower at $529, and will release beginning in September. Preorders for the Wi-Fi version open Thursday. That compares to a starting price of $649 for the Tab S7 Wi-Fi, or $849 for its 5G version. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wi-Fi version of the tablet comes in black, silver, green, and pink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6zg3HR"&gt;The big selling point for the Tab S7 FE is its large 12.4-inch display, which is the same size as last year’s $849 Tab S7 Plus, although it’s LCD rather than OLED. Internally the 5G version of the Tab S7 FE is powered by a Snapdragon 750G, while the Wi-Fi version has a Qualcomm SM7325 chipset. Rounding out the specs are 4GB of RAM, 64GB of expandable storage, and a 10,090mAh battery. There’s an 8-megapixel camera on the rear, and a 5-megapixel camera on the front, orientated so it’s on the top while you’re using the tablet in landscape. You also get an S Pen stylus in the box, which is helpful for note taking and sketching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mh2kGg"&gt;As well as the Tab S7 FE, Samsung has also announced that the 5G version of the Galaxy Book Go laptop will be available from AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon this month. AT&amp;amp;T preorders open on August 5th, while Verizon’s availability starts on August 13th. AT&amp;amp;T is selling the laptop for $799.99. It will be available to preorder on August 5th, and will be available “in the coming weeks,” AT&amp;amp;T says.&lt;/p&gt;
