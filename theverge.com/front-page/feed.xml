    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uC7IsM"&gt;If you’re currently shopping for a PlayStation 5 console, you have another chance right now at Best Buy. The electronics retailer just opened up a fresh batch of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcljGhDR4o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 consoles for $499.99&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4DCfC"&gt;Be sure to log in and queue up on Best Buy’s site, with your billing and shipping info saved. Click the “Add to Cart” button on the right to jump into the waiting line, and stay calm. You don’t need to refresh the automated system, though, you may be prompted to verify your account when it’s your turn. Best Buy’s recently-updated queue system may not work well if you try to open multiple tabs, but keep your phone handy — if you have trouble verifying your account you may be able to do it in the mobile app and check out once the PlayStation 5 is in your cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSq4pr"&gt;After that, you should be able to see if there are any PS5 consoles available in your area. If you strike out, stay vigilant, the store tends to restock in waves so there may be more consoles in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1URumo"&gt;We are continuing to track restocks as they roll out at various retailers. Be sure to also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe to the &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for the latest tech and gadget savings we can find and deliver right to your inbox twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kRs6ae"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why the PS5 paywall may not pay off at Amazon, Walmart, or Best Buy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="xvWX9b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="82lPGd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UAvH7w"&gt;We’re wishing you all of the luck in getting a PS5 today. As usual, signing into your account ahead of the restock, and making sure that all of the pertinent shipping and payment info, can only help your chances of success. But generally, once you’re in the queue for a console, just hang tight and maybe cross those fingers that you actually get a console today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MWcsCA"&gt;Some must-have PS5 accessories and games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1BKh8"&gt;Whether you end up getting a PlayStation 5 today or not, it might not be a bad idea to stock up on some essentials that you may want to have on Day One with your console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ryKE4I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10687661"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new Yoga 9i embraces hardware shortcut buttons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKj8HcdcEYeFCC6b7jsKs8oG5Es=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350386/mchin_200331_4955_0026.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="txda5t"&gt;Lenovo’s newest Yoga 9i convertible laptop is embracing one of the more fun trends of ‘90s and early ‘00s computer design: shortcut keys. While plenty of laptops have added handy shortcuts to the Function row on the keyboard, few are making keys that have one express purpose. Now Lenovo is planning to release a laptop in 2022 with five of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYoWRb"&gt;The 1-Click Function keys all sit to the right of the keyboard. There’s a key for switching between performance mode and a battery-sipping Smart Power mode that sacrifices a little power to boost battery life. Another key lets you toggle between light and dark mode in Windows 10 &lt;em&gt;(or 11? does this laptop ship with 10 on it?&lt;/em&gt;), and the Vibe Check (lol) key toggles between the various built-in audio profiles so you can better hear what the heck each profile actually does. The one I’d most like to see on other laptops lets you turn the background blur off and on when in video calls. Sometimes I don’t want people to see my dog sleeping directly behind me, and sometimes I do! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3gnHNY"&gt;The final button was already featured in previous Yoga 9i laptops: the fingerprint scanner. Previously it was a button sort of haphazardly stuck down on the palm rest, where it was prone to accidental clicks. Now it's a little larger and corralled over to the right of the keyboard with the rest of the new single-use buttons. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MOiBaTIzbQF9PLluJjv4S3FKvjM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134043/Lenovo_Yoga_9i_Gen_7_keyboard_Oatmeal.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another shot of the new shortcut buttons on the Yoga 9i.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QwYiry"&gt;While single-use keys were all the rage on desktop computers in the ‘90s and ‘00s, the adoption of laptops as the primary computer in homes saw these buttons disappear. You’ll still find them on 15-inch and above gaming laptops — and the occasional workstation, but they’re pretty rare in a slim little 14-inch number like the Yoga 9i. The addition means the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569871/lenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review"&gt;big bezel found around the keyboard of previous iterations&lt;/a&gt; is now a whole lot thinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EMPmN"&gt;The new Yoga 9i also has a touchpad that should be about 45 percent larger than last year’s, two new Thunderbolt 4 ports, and Wi-Fi 6E. It’ll be available with up to a 4K OLED IPS display and 12th Gen Intel Core i7-1260P CPU combined with Intel Iris Xe graphics. Lenovo says it will start at $1,399 and be available starting in Q2 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FEzaDBuYRz-bdobcc4IeLmgBM4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134046/Lenovo_Yoga_7i_Gen_7_16in_Two_Mode.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 16-inch Yoga 7i.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I0aKkn"&gt;But it won’t be the only new Yoga. The 14-inch Yoga 7i gets a refresh with the option for a 12th Gen Intel Core i7-1260P CPU and packs in a beefy 71Wh battery with Rapid Charge Express. The 16-inch Yoga 7i looks to be more work-oriented with up to a 12th Gen Intel Core i7-12700H CPU. There will also be the option to tack on Intel’s new Arc A-series discrete GPU. But we haven’t gotten to test the new GPU yet, so no telling how fast it will drain the 100Wh battery. The 14-inch model will start at $949 and the 16-inch model at $899, and both will be available sometime in Q2 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IISLq3"&gt;The 13-inch Yoga 6 is also getting a minor refresh. The option for a fabric case isn’t going away, thankfully. Lenovo seemed to focus on improving its sustainability chops with the Yoga 6. Fifty percent of the plastic in the fabric case is recycled, and Lenovo claims approximately 25 percent of the batteries are made of post-consumption plastic. Lenovo’s press release says even the box it comes in will be the “greenest” ever made for a Yoga product. The laptop itself relies on AMD and can be outfitted with up to an AMD Ryzen 7 5700U. It will start at $749 and, like the other Yoga laptops announced today, is expected to ship in Q2 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tile is working with Lenovo to help you find your lost laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Lenovo ThinkPad with the Tile app on the screen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZIpW4P_4dvUzMz6ndgEJQfcMISA=/390x0:4611x2814/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350412/Lenovo_FWT_laptop_PR2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Tile’s second embedded PC partnership.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tile, Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DiToR0"&gt;No one likes misplacing expensive gadgets, but especially not a laptop. If you were thinking about copping one of Lenovo’s newly announced ThinkPad X1s, good news. Tile and Lenovo are teaming up to make the computers findable via the Tile app, even when the laptops are offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIKbS5"&gt;This is Tile’s second embedded PC collaboration — the first was with HP. As for which Lenovo laptops are compatible, the list includes the X1 Carbon 10th gen, X1 Yoga 7th gen, and the X1 Nano 2nd gen. To enable the feature, download and install the Tile Windows app from the Microsoft Store. From there, activate the ThinkPad as if it were a Tile tracker. Once that’s done, should you misplace your shiny new laptop, you can find it using the Tile app for iOS or Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWqK1q"&gt;One neat perk is that the laptop remains findable even if it’s shut down or offline for up to 14 days. However, because it acts like one of Tile’s own trackers, there are some limitations. One of the handier Tile features is to ring your lost device. You can do that with the Lenovo PCs as well, except it has to be within Bluetooth range or 250 feet. If you’re outside that range, Tile says you can view the most recent location or “enlist the secure help of Tile’s global network.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVlIMS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetileapp.com%2Fen-us%2Fblog%2Fwhat-is-tile-network-community-find-lost-stolen-far-away&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F5%2F22859022%2Ftile-lenovo-thinkpad-x1-findable-laptops-lost" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tile’s network&lt;/a&gt; works similarly to Apple’s FindMy network in that it relies on other nearby Tile devices to find a device that’s out of range. It’s just not quite as effective, given that there aren’t as many Tile users as there are iPhones (for what it’s worth, Tile says its Find with Tile business has expanded to over 40 different third-party devices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hi4CKt"&gt;In any case, if this is a feature you want, you’ll have to wait a bit. Lenovo’s new ThinkPad X1s won’t be available until March, and the Tile integration isn’t backward compatible with older ThinkPads. It’s probably not the number one reason why you’d want a new ThinkPad, but hey, at least the feature is free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tr2Nrq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s 16-inch Legion 5 Pro is about to get even better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lenovo Legion 5 Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-8fLh5Fnpc6vIfruYvvqNFe5LI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350367/lenovolegion5pro1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aLXGdR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529429/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-performance-features"&gt;Lenovo impressed us in 2021 with its Legion 5 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a 16-inch QHD+ laptop that delivered excellent gaming performance at a price that undercut many of its key competitors, like Razer and Asus. It also got bonus points for being powerful without being too thick or heavy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knRT6B"&gt;Like many companies during CES 2022, Lenovo is upgrading the specs of its Legion 5 Pro for this year, and despite my never-dying thirst for new chassis design, it seems like Lenovo may have another hit on its hands without having to change all that much (here’s to hoping Lenovo stocks it at more retailers than just Walmart). Though, according to the company, the chassis is thinner than the previous generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2obWvC"&gt;The new Legion 5 Pro will be available in the standard storm grey colorway with four-zone RGB key backlighting. New for 2022 is a glacier white colorway with blue backlighting, which looks lovely. Lenovo hasn’t shared the pricing for this model yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo Legion 5 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ggR2B-rif7z9N7piyBDF9UNKjQs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134323/lenovolegion5pro2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New for 2022 is a glacier white colorway.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U0bD0e"&gt;Getting into the specs, the Legion 5 Pro for 2022 will once again support the latest AMD Ryzen processors, up to the Ryzen 9 6900HX. It’s actually making an Intel-based version, too, called the Legion 5i Pro (the “i” is for Intel). That model will support up to Intel’s 12th-Gen Core i9-12900H. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lb96l8"&gt;In the graphics department, Lenovo says both laptops will support up to the Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti graphics chip that can draw a total graphics power of 150W (Lenovo told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this is subject to change per additional testing ahead of its release) at a boosted clock speed of 1485MHz, which should push it well beyond what last generation’s model is capable of in terms of graphical fidelity at QHD+ resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fM8Nib"&gt;Last year’s Legion 5 Pro was one of the first gaming laptops to ship with a 16-inch IPS screen that had a 16:10 aspect ratio. Now it claims that the 2022 Legion 5 Pro and 5i Pro are the first gaming laptops to offer variable refresh rate displays, supporting up to a 240Hz refresh rate at that QHD+ resolution. Other notable display specs include a 3ms response time, DisplayHDR 400 with up to 500 nits of brightness, and 100 percent coverage of the sRGB color space. I can’t wait to see games running on this laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo Legion 5 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JrQv_nPpfkUTwWSrQcL8RP-xwH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134328/lenovolegion5pro3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legion 5 Pro is well stocked with ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ol2VXs"&gt;Like many gaming laptops being announced at CES 2022, the Legion 5 Pro and 5i Pro support up to 32GB of fast DDR5 RAM clocked at a lightning-fast 4,800MHz and can be configured with up to a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD. Other laptop makers support up to 2TB or, in some cases, up to 4TB of total storage, so it’s disappointing to see Lenovo falling behind here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6EZkI"&gt;One other feature I’m unsure about with the Legion 5 Pro is battery life. Compared to other Ryzen Zen 3-packed laptops, I thought that the 2021 laptop delivered middling battery life. Once again, the 2022 model has an 80Wh battery, though Lenovo more than doubled the wattage for charging it via USB-C, from 65W to 135W. So, at least quickly topping it up won’t be an issue, and you won’t need to lug around its 230W adapter to do so (unless you plan to do some serious gaming). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpZ1Bo"&gt;In terms of ports, both configurations have two USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports with DP 1.4 video support on the left side (on the 5i Pro, one of those parts is Thunderbolt 4 and USB 4), while an extra USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port on the rear supports DP 1.4 and PD charging up to 135W. Also on the rear are two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, an HDMI 2.1 port, an RJ45 ethernet port, and a power plug. Over on the right, there’s one USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 port, alongside a headphone jack and an electronic kill switch for the 720p webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwHVSB"&gt;There are a lot of gaming laptops that we’ll be testing in early 2022, and I’m particularly excited to see if Lenovo’s new version of the Legion 5 Pro is as good as the last.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fossil activates gamer mode with a Razer smartwatch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Razer X Fossil Gen 6 on top of a lit-up mechanical keyboard." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4RdcUwgt5kctGKlQsJuCkGCq6Ro=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350375/vsong_211229_4952_0015_Recovered.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer X Fossil Gen 6 might not have RGB but it can still match your keyboard.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7U4Wn0"&gt;Fossil usually shows up to CES with a hoard of smartwatches, but last year was a weird one for Wear OS. Google and Samsung announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;a new unified version of Wear OS&lt;/a&gt;, but the catch was that non-Samsung watches — including Fossil’s — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;won’t be eligible for an upgrade&lt;/a&gt; until mid to late 2022. Given the circumstances, this year, Fossil is keeping it relatively simple with a limited-edition Razer smartwatch and an updated version of the Skagen Falster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R23Q7I"&gt;Before you ask, no, the Razer X Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch does not come with RGB lighting. It does, however, come with three Razer-branded watch faces — including a “Chroma” face that you can customize to match Razer’s other Chroma products. It’s technically not RGB, but you can enable “breathe” and “wave” lighting patterns, so it’s the next best thing. The other two are more subtle. One is an analog face with the Razer logo, the other spells out the time in a Razer-inspired font. The 44mm watch comes with a matte black case and two interchangeable straps: black and a spectacularly neon green.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yGlriP"&gt;That’s pretty much the extent of what makes this a “gamer” smartwatch unless you count the fact that there’ll only be 1,337 of these available for purchase. While Garmin &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/garmin-made-an-esports-fitness-smartwatch-for-streamers-1845449723"&gt;launched an esports fitness watch&lt;/a&gt; in late 2020 that lets you track esports activities and stream your biometrics on Twitch, you shouldn’t expect that here. The Razer X Fossil smartwatch is basically the same as the Gen 6, which means it’s a Wear OS watch with a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100+ chip. It’s got also got a 1.28-inch color touchscreen, built-in GPS, and contactless payments. Like Fossil’s other watches, it’s capable of fast charging, meaning you can get 80 percent battery in 30 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LowdaW"&gt;Fossil demurred as to whether it would re-release the watch if it proved popular, saying that nothing was 100 percent planned. However, it didn’t rule out collaborating with Razer again down the line. As for why Razer wanted to collaborate on a smartwatch, Fossil says it ties back into the gaming company’s recent efforts to &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fesports%2Fwellness&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;promote mental health and wellness in e-sports&lt;/a&gt;. (And who can forget that Razer also once tried to launch its own ill-fated line of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/15/8611425/razer-nabu-x-review"&gt;fitness&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/6/7496871/razer-nabu-x-fitness-tracker-ces-2015"&gt;bands&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/7/10730934/razer-nabu-watch-video-interview-ces-2016"&gt;not-so-smart smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O02Uzf"&gt;If the Razer watch is a gamer version of the Gen 6, the new Skagen Falster is the Gen 6 with a Danish minimalism veneer. The main upgrade here is it adds the 4100+ chip and six colorways. That’s not entirely nothing. Fossil says the more powerful 4100+ chip meant it was possible to cram more features while maintaining the Falster’s 42mm case size. In a world where smartwatches keep getting bigger, it’s refreshing to see a watch stay small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxgh9h"&gt;Both watches feature the same health features — a new SpO2 sensor, sleep tracking, and Fossil’s new Wellness app. The 4100+’s greater power efficiency also means you can finally use Fossil smartwatches for sleep tracking, though you still have to charge daily. They both also have 3ATM of water resistance, meaning they’re safe enough for the shower and rainy days but not entirely swim-proof. (You generally want 5ATM of water resistance for the pool.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Skagen Falster Gen 6 with a woven metal strap." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zdL_AEB_WLec26ios0kaSdkf8GA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144714/vsong_211229_4952_0013.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Skagen Falster Gen 6 is powered by the faster Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100+ platform.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vDNat4"&gt;I got to spend some time with both the Razer watch and the new Skagen Falster — the 4100-chip does make a significant difference in performance and battery life over the 3100-powered Gen 5 watches. Design-wise, the Falster looks quite nice on the wrist, but it’s also not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; different from the Falster 3. My unit came with a metal woven strap, and while it was stylish, it wasn’t ideal for working out or sleeping in. The Razer watch is also a handsome smartwatch, though the 44mm case was a bit big on my wrist. The neon green strap was also too loud for my taste and a little unnecessary, given that most of the pizzazz comes from the Razer watch faces. That said, if you want your smartwatch to match your mechanical keyboard, this should fit the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecvDzN"&gt;The main thing to note is that both watches are currently running the outdated Wear OS 2. The upside is that since both are powered by the 4100+ platform, so they’ll be eligible to upgrade to Wear OS 3 later this year (aka whenever it is that Google gets around to pushing out the update). It is, however, awkward timing when Samsung’s watches are already out there running the new Wear OS and there are rumors that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814461/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-2022-rohan"&gt;Google’s working on a Pixel Watch&lt;/a&gt; for 2022 — a fact that Fossil has admitted to hindering initial Gen 6 sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFQ5Es"&gt;The 1,337 Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatches will retail for $329 and will be available later this month at Fossil, Razer, and GameStop’s websites. Meanwhile, all versions of the Skagen Falster Gen 6 will retail for $295 this month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new ThinkBook Plus Gen 3 has an eight-inch secondary screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkBook plus Gen 3 keyboard seen from above. The primary screen displays a blue swirl on a white background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/onp0WFvvkOHJJwsKuFXRSxuyzjI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350369/mchin_200331_4955_0013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the ThinkBook Plus Gen 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LeHnFU"&gt;Lenovo has announced the new ThinkBook Plus Gen 3, which has two (two!) screens. There’s one 17.3-inch primary screen (like, the regular one), and there’s another eight-inch screen on the keyboard deck. Various other models that have tried this form factor (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431381/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-15-review"&gt;namely, Asus’&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285164/asus-zenbook-duo-review-screenpad-plus-dual-screen-laptop-specs-freatures-price"&gt;gaggle of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20908627/asus-zenbook-pro-duo-review-screenpad-plus-dual-screen-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Duo products&lt;/a&gt;) have put the secondary screen in the back of the deck and pushed the keyboard to the front. But Lenovo has instead put the keyboard on the right side of the chassis, smushing the keyboard to the left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSuaq2"&gt;While the ThinkBook Plus Gen 3’s look takes a bit of getting used to, I definitely prefer this layout to those of the Duos. You don’t have to buy a separate palm rest, and you don’t look and feel like a &lt;em&gt;T. rex&lt;/em&gt; when you’re typing. (I know that members of the Keyboard In The Front Club will disagree with me on this, but so be it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqIR6l"&gt;The primary screen is... well, it’s very wide. Specifically, it has a 21:10 aspect ratio, which is very unusual to see on a laptop. I’ve never used a notebook this wide and would be loath to try to carry it around too many places, but it certainly affords quite a bit of screen space for multitasking. The eight-inch secondary display has 800 x 1280 resolution and supports a stylus that comes integrated in the chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkBook Plus Gen 3 open on a table angled to the right. The primary screen displays a blue swirl on a white background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xJJl1BQs77GIHdr9NV5eHxxzKs0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145970/mchin_200331_4955_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a wide one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TLS5dI"&gt;Lenovo showed off a couple neat use cases for the secondary screen during my brief demo. You can write notes on it (if you’re right handed, lefties might have some issues), and it syncs directly with OneNote. There’s a cool thing where if you’re, say, editing a photo on the main screen, you can use the stylus to blow a small part of it up on the secondary screen. You can dump distractions like Twitter and Spotify down there, you can pull up a calculator, you can mirror certain smartphones, or you can just extend whatever app you’re looking at on the primary screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhiXYT"&gt;The software does not look as elaborate as Asus’ is (though that may be for the best, as figuring out how to use Asus’ is a whole thing). Lenovo, also unlike Asus, does not appear to be trying to get developers to make things specifically for this form factor — they noted that it has plenty of uses already. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkBook 14 Gen 4 open on a white table, plugged in, angled to the left. The screen displays a field of purple flower beneath an orange sky." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tOOq2QJ6whSEfqm6_aOFkcK6z58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145910/mchin_200331_4955_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the ThinkBook 14 Gen 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XKIe4q"&gt;The Plus, which starts at $1,399 and ships in May, is (like the rest of the ThinkBook family) targeting small and medium businesses that may not have the budget for Lenovo’s top-of-the-line ThinkPads. Dual-screen devices are generally expensive, and a price tag of $1,399 could make this technology accessible to a new swath of business customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eaxc8d"&gt;The ThinkBook Plus also comes with 12th Gen Intel Core processors, up to 32GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of storage, as well as an FHD infrared camera with a physical privacy shutter. But come on — the screens are the exciting part. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkBook 13X open on a white table. The screen displays an outdoor night scene with a red tent in the middle and the Lenovo logo on the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XAEOAz0vHHNkQcdGLD_JlnD2wjE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145886/mchin_200331_4955_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here’s the ThinkBook 13X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ClctfL"&gt;Lenovo announced updates to a few other ThinkBooks as well. We’ve now got the ThinkBook 13X Gen 2, the ThinkBook 14 Gen 4 Plus i, and the ThinkBook 16 Gen 4 Plus i. (The names are a lot, I know — Lenovo does this sometimes.) These will all be available in April, with starting prices of $1,099, $839, and $859 respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fx7giP"&gt;All three models will feature Intel’s 12th Gen processors. The 13X now comes with an optional wireless charging mat, which can charge a compatible mobile device alongside it. The ThinkBook 14 and ThinkBook 16 have thinner designs from their predecessors, with 16:10 displays and larger glass touchpads. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkBook 16 Gen 4 on an angled stand, open. The screen displays a night outdoor scene with a small red tent in the center and the Lenovo logo on the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bbjflicjdtvQ3FsafBvgC-qikIs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145939/mchin_200331_4955_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here’s the ThinkBook 16 Gen 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbgiCi"&gt;I’m a fan of the ThinkBook line in general, and I’m glad to see it getting some funky features. Given how outrageously expensive business laptops have a habit of being, it’s good to see that models at more accessible prices are keeping up with the latest hardware. These models are all sturdy, attractive, and well made, and (assuming the performance is up to snuff) I’d have no problem bringing one into the boardroom. I say the more innovation at this price point, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Carbon and X1 Nano get better webcams and OLED displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X1 Nano 2nd-Gen open on white table. The screen displays a blue swirl on a white background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6N6ERTibKZwyngqNgs_voH2U9AI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350372/mchin_200331_4955_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the new ThinkPad X1 Nano, which looks a lot like the old ThinkPad X1 Nano.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3CBwf3"&gt;At CES 2022, Lenovo announced updates to three of its most premium laptops on the market: the ThinkPad X1 Carbon 10th-gen (that’s right, this is the tenth one), the ThinkPad X1 Yoga seventh-gen, and the ThinkPad X1 Nano second-gen. The Carbon and the Yoga will be available in March (starting at $1,639 and $1,749, respectively), and the Nano is coming in April (starting at $1,659). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5OBYC"&gt;These are some heavy hitters. The X1 Carbon and the X1 Yoga are two of the most established and beloved laptops in the business sphere. The X1 Nano is newer to the scene but was one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;favorite laptops that we reviewed last year&lt;/a&gt; — it’s the lightest ThinkPad ever made, and it packs impressive power into that chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0wn2fz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The X1 Nano was one of our favorite laptops that we reviewed last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X1 Carbon open on a white table angled to the left. The screen displays a night desert setting with an orange ribbon running through it and the Lenovo logo on the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VMkF4L2cASBcPOifZUg3QEy_KjE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145982/mchin_200331_4955_0017.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the X1 Carbon — can you believe there are 10 of these now?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W2duBd"&gt;I’ve spent a brief amount of time with each of these devices, and I also reviewed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22623290/thinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs"&gt;all three of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22691965/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-9-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;their predecessors&lt;/a&gt;. They all look and feel pretty dang similar to last year’s models. That’s totally fine by me — ThinkPads have an established aesthetic, and any big changes would likely make some X1 fans very unhappy. If you are looking for something new and different, you’re better off looking at the brand-new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22862528/lenovos-thinkpad-z-series-z13-z16-business-laptop"&gt;ThinkPad Z-Series&lt;/a&gt;. (The comments section on that video has been somewhat... heated.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X1 Yoga angled to the right, half open on a white table with a blue and pink background. The screen is off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qqBsvp_RbZe84bpTkcAQr2gLdgc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146014/mchin_200331_4955_0022.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the X1 Yoga.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jJ0GfP"&gt;But tweaks have certainly been made, largely targeting remote employees. The new ThinkPads are “optimized for hybrid workers and professionals who seek higher levels of performance, better camera and audio capabilities for more immersive collaboration, and a more secure laptop to protect them from the daily demands of hybrid working,” Lenovo wrote in its blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9J9Gu"&gt;There’s a “newly designed communications bar” housing an upgraded webcam with a 1.4μm sensor (which is welcome — the sixth-gen Yoga’s camera was particularly bad) and 360-degree far-field microphones. The internals have been bumped up to Intel’s 12th Gen Core processors, LPDDR5 memory, PCIe Gen 4 storage, and all of the models come with Windows 11 Pro. And the Yoga and the Carbon both have OLED display options this year — 4K for the Yoga, 2.8K for the Carbon — while the Nano has new AI noise cancellation technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwf9OI"&gt;Finally, Lenovo’s Human Presence Detection (available in “select models” across the line) has gotten smarter thanks to a new neural processing unit. Previously, the AI recognize when “a person” was leaving or approaching its screen. Now, it’s able to recognize when you specifically approach the screen (as opposed to a colleague or potential snoop) and wake or lock accordingly. Lenovo’s Computer Vision technology can also dim or turn off the display when you’re looking away, as an energy saver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WK1V3p"&gt;While ThinkPad X1 users of five years ago might never have expected that webcams and speakers would ever be areas where Lenovo focused its energy, it’s clear that those features have become a priority for Lenovo’s target audience. The company is combining the exceptional build quality the X1 line is known for with innovations targeting on-the-go hybrid work. It’s a choice that makes complete sense — which, during a CES where some other established lines appear to have undergone some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865547/dell-xps-13-plus-2022-hands-on-new-design-features"&gt;controversial changes&lt;/a&gt;, is refreshing to see.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PG&amp;E found responsible for yet another devastating fire </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Flames from the Dixie fire approach powerlines. The Dixie..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LIzx_kWGU6KtjcsSF_lpoFNCeFs=/0x0:3750x2500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350247/1234738028.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fQCuC8"&gt;California utility company PG&amp;amp;E was found at fault for sparking another massive inferno. This time it was the Dixie wildfire, the second &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/4jandlhh/top20_acres.pdf"&gt;largest&lt;/a&gt; in state history. Electrical distribution lines sparked the blaze after coming in contact with a tree, according to the results of an &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/edwez51p/dixie_fire_release.pdf"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; completed by state firefighting agency Cal Fire yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glUDXM"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7690/"&gt;Dixie Fire&lt;/a&gt; raged for more than three months last year, burning over 1,300 structures and killing one person. In perhaps its most traumatic episode, the blaze tore through the town of Greenville one August evening — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22612874/wildfires-worse-night-hot-dry-california-us-west"&gt;growing explosively overnight&lt;/a&gt;. By morning, it had decimated most of the historic Gold Rush town. “We lost Greenville tonight,” local Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) said as he held back tears in a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=423084935691083"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; posted to Facebook on August 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bgIYDP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The scenes were reminiscent of the most destructive blaze the state has seen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmEYqG"&gt;The scenes were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652695/paradise-california-wildfires-fire-season-dixie-caldor"&gt;reminiscent&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/t1rdhizr/top20_destruction.pdf"&gt;most destructive blaze&lt;/a&gt; the state has seen to date, the Camp Fire in 2018. Investigators pointed to PG&amp;amp;E power lines as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18626819/cal-fire-pacific-gas-and-electric-camp-fire-power-lines-cause"&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; of that disaster as well. Camp Fire nearly wiped out the town of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21300937/coronavirus-pandemic-california-wildfires-high-school-paradise-climate-change-graduation"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt; and nearby communities, killing 85 people and scorching more than 18,800 structures. In a case brought against it by Butte County, PG&amp;amp;E ultimately pleaded guilty to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter and another felony count of unlawfully causing a fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYk4wk"&gt;After that catastrophe, which contributed to the utility &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/business/energy-environment/pge-bankruptcy-ends.html"&gt;filing for bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; in 2019,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;PG&amp;amp;E started to implement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20908434/california-blackouts-utilities-fires-lawsuits-san-francisco-bay-area-pge-pacific-gas-electric"&gt;preemptive power outages&lt;/a&gt; when hot, dry conditions make landscapes ripe for fires. While that’s aimed at preventing blazes, it’s caused more troubles for California residents — particularly for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20932780/california-blackout-healthcare-electricity-fires"&gt;healthcare facilities&lt;/a&gt; and people who depend on medical devices that need to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRlTzL"&gt;The company still faces another &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/24/1040630538/pacific-gas-electric-manslaughter-charges-california-wildfire-zogg"&gt;charge of manslaughter&lt;/a&gt; after one of its distribution lines &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/u2kh4nyd/zogg-fire-press-release.pdf"&gt;sparked&lt;/a&gt; the Zogg Fire that killed four people in Northern California in September 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDosB5"&gt;Days after PG&amp;amp;E first &lt;a href="https://www.abc10.com/article/news/local/wildfire/judge-pge-dixie-fire/103-5e30a17b-0598-4a99-9f25-681ca3ada33e"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; that its equipment might have sparked the Dixie Fire last July, the company &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/21/1019058925/utility-bury-power-lines-wildfires-california"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it plans to bury 10,000 miles of its power lines in another effort to prevent more devastating blazes. That project would sequester about 10 percent of the utility’s distribution and transmission lines underground, away from trees and vegetation that might burn if they come in contact. However, many experts &lt;a href="https://grist.org/wildfires/can-burying-power-lines-prevent-california-next-wildfire-pge/"&gt;are doubtful&lt;/a&gt; the utility can pull it off or that the benefits would outweigh the costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVkYHh"&gt;PG&amp;amp;E did not immediately return a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;about the results of the investigation into the cause of the Dixie Fire. In a statement to the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/04/business/dixie-fire-california-pge.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it said, “This tree was one of more than eight million trees within strike distance to PG&amp;amp;E lines ... Regardless of today’s finding, we will continue to be tenacious in our efforts to stop fire ignitions from our equipment and to ensure that everyone and everything is always safe.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta reportedly canceled a 300-person VR / AR operating system project</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bv27Swhm1hvxtIO5qNKzS4cad5Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350201/acastro_211101_1777_meta_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vweGmr"&gt;Meta reportedly pulled the plug on a custom operating system that was supposed to power upcoming virtual and augmented reality headsets, although its full reasoning and future plans still aren’t clear. &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-platforms-halts-vr-and-ar-operating-system-project"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported the news today&lt;/a&gt;, saying the company formerly named Facebook suspended development of a project called XROS — named after XR, an umbrella term for AR / VR — in November. That leaves Meta with the Android-based operating system used in Quest (previously Oculus) VR devices, something that offers convenience but also makes Meta dependent on another company’s OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKFblo"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Information&lt;/em&gt; article reports that XROS development began in 2017 and had more than 300 people working on it. It’s apparently synonymous with the “reality operating system” that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CTO Andrew Bosworth have discussed publicly before. &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/zuckerberg-bosworth-vr-transcript/"&gt;In June of 2021,&lt;/a&gt; Zuckerberg described making a “microkernel-based operating system” that would give Meta tight control over every layer of its hardware, saying a team was “pretty far along” on the initiative and pegging its existence to “the ‘not too distant future.’” There’s no sign that canceling XROS will affect Meta’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22752986/meta-facebook-andrew-bosworth-interview-metaverse-vr-ar"&gt;plans to produce new AR glasses&lt;/a&gt;, which include prototypes known as Project Aria and Nazare, but it may apparently mean that they use an Android-based OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtXm2H"&gt;Development on XROS reportedly stopped soon after team lead Mark Lucovsky, formerly of Microsoft, announced he was leaving to work on a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marklucovsky/status/1470528993984081921"&gt;similar AR OS project&lt;/a&gt; at Google. Lucovsky told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; that he departed after former Facebook employee Frances Haugen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;publicly accused the company&lt;/a&gt; of harmful business practices in a &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes &lt;/em&gt;interview, as well as because of “the company’s new metaverse-centric focus,” a reference to Meta’s interest in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;VR and AR-heavy virtual worlds&lt;/a&gt;. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHbmbr"&gt;Zuckerberg has looked to VR and AR as a way to escape the dominance of Apple and Google in mobile phones, however. And the company reportedly remains interested in building its own OS — potentially including a revived version of XROS.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>That Walmart VR shopping video is old news — but so is the metaverse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JKy0CKsuVJwCo5dL7KMu3X_EhOk=/64x0:537x315/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350180/walmart_metaverse_gif.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P9SnYR"&gt;There’s a video &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DigitalisHomo/status/1478094074909540354"&gt;doing the rounds on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; today that supposedly shows “how Walmart envisions Shopping in the #Metaverse.” In it, a virtual avatar browses shelves of virtual groceries, picking and tossing items into a shopping cart with all the grace of stop motion skeleton in a ’50s adventure film. Responses to the clip have been suitably mocking, criticizing the VR experience for its pointless skeuomorphism and outdated visuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHKQ0Z"&gt;This is appropriate, given that the video is actually four years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XrHHpG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Current metaverse demos still look like this sloppy ad from 2017&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CEmrPf"&gt;A quick Google reveals that the clip was &lt;a href="https://mutualmobile.com/work/walmart"&gt;made for Walmart&lt;/a&gt; by a digital agency in 2017 to “impress influencers at SXSW” (an example of an obscure capitalist ritual known as a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/16/8226909/sxsw-2015-best-brand-activation-pepsi-bates-motel"&gt;brand activation&lt;/a&gt;”). The video, then, has nothing to do with the current wave of metaverse hype sluicing through Silicon Valley, which makes its criticism of it an example of the sort of knee-jerk, anti-tech cynicism that’s stopping us all from getting rich on crypto, right? Well, no, not really. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OtszoU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is how Walmart envisions Shopping in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Metaverse?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Metaverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thoughts?   &lt;a href="https://t.co/5l7KhoBse7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5l7KhoBse7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Homo Digitalis (@DigitalisHomo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DigitalisHomo/status/1478094074909540354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 3, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gECfEk"&gt;Because although the clip itself is not an example of contemporary metaverse visionscaping&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the fact that it’s &lt;em&gt;indistinguishable from this material&lt;/em&gt; is damning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zauqgq"&gt;It’s an illustration of the fact that the metaverse itself is not news. It is, in fact, a stagnant concept: a re-hashing of decades-old ideas of how we might live, work, and socialize in virtual environments. Like that recent &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article that touted “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/fashion/metaverse-virtual-wedding.html"&gt;Getting Married in the Metaverse&lt;/a&gt;” as some novel experience, it shows how a lot of marketing and money have been deployed to sell the public on an experience that’s at least as old as &lt;em&gt;Second Life, &lt;/em&gt;the Linden Lab VR project that launched in 2003. The reason people are willing to believe that a four-year-old video shows the best the metaverse can offer is that the metaverse hasn’t offered anything better yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hlt0GI"&gt;Might things be different this time? Might new virtual worlds succeed, letting us all don VR headsets for office meetings populated by clown, robot, and cowboy avatars? Sure, maybe. The hardware has certainly improved since the ’90s, and there’s a lot more funding for this round of virtual dreaming. But, as reactions to the Walmart shopping clip show, no one seems to be impressed or energized by this would-be revolutionary vision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zS8KhZ"&gt;Life in virtual reality just doesn’t feel like the future anymore. It feels like a past we already gave up on.&lt;/p&gt;
