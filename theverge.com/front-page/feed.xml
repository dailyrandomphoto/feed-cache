    <title>This laptop has seven times the average number of screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Expanscape Aurora 7 prototype" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mp7bdSSOZxpfsILFOdQ__IbhrYo=/1x0:2539x1692/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789392/aurora7hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Expanscape&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f6tkVC"&gt;A company called Expanscape has created the most Inspector Gadget-like device that I’ve ever seen. It’s a laptop prototype called the Aurora 7 (a working title), and attached to its humongous black box of a chassis are six extra displays that extend out in every direction away from the main screen, each showing its own windows and applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdXSlV"&gt;If you’re like me, the first thought that comes to mind is “that poor hinge!” Yeah, poor hinge, indeed. Many laptop hinges don’t gracefully handle having one screen attached, let alone seven. Piggybacking on the main 17.3-inch 4K display are three other screens of the same size and resolution. Above the left and right displays is a single seven-inch 1200p monitor. You’ll also find one more seven-inch 1200p touchscreen display mounted into the wrist rest. This prototype weighs about 26 pounds and is 4.3 inches thick. It has an imposing, intimidating presence, and I haven’t even seen it in person.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Expanscape Aurora 7 prototype" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/huWkTCK7lkya3iCRoLs41k-RvCU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290505/aurora73.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Expanscape&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bow down to the Aurora 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P9VQQo"&gt;What GPU is responsible for powering its four 4K displays? None other than the midrange Nvidia GTX 1060, which isn’t exactly a powerhouse. It also has an Intel Core i9-9900K processor and 64GB of RAM. You can find more specs &lt;a href="https://expanscape.com/the-aurora-7-prototype/aurora-7-prototype-specifications/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In future revisions, Expanscape wants to use the Nvidia RTX 2070 instead, with options for the AMD Ryzen 9 3950x processor or Intel’s i9-10900K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xl7BtJ"&gt;Even though it’s built primarily to be a mobile security operations station (and stay plugged pretty much all the time), maybe it’ll be able to run some games, too. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/its-no-surprise-this-absolutely-obscene-7-screen-laptop-1846222859"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noticed in its write-up of this gadget that its current prototype can last for just one hour before the battery cries for more power, which is frankly longer than I expected. It uses a secondary 148Wh battery just to power its additional displays, and that’s over the FAA’s legal limit to fly in a plane. Expanscape says it’s working to remedy this in future prototypes. In other words, the company is committed to letting you &lt;em&gt;bring a seven-screen laptop onto a plane&lt;/em&gt;. You’d probably have to buy a whole row of seats for the necessary space to use it, though. (If you’re reading this in the future, please take a picture of one of these if you see it on your plane.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nrQ8j0"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Razer’s laptop with three screens is unreal|25617" data-volume-uuid="2868e7566" data-volume-id="25617" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-723" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nEk5xO"&gt;Sure, the Aurora 7 looks more rough around the edges than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/5/14112686/razer-project-valerie-multi-monitor-gaming-laptop-concept"&gt;Razer’s triple-screened Project Valerie laptop&lt;/a&gt; from a few years ago. But nevertheless, Expanscape claims it’s willing to actually sell this thing, which is more than Razer can say about its Valerie concept. If you want to buy one, &lt;a href="https://expanscape.com/the-aurora-7-prototype/a7-m3-prototype-pricing/"&gt;Expanscape says it can help interested parties in reserving a prototype of its upcoming revision&lt;/a&gt;. As for the price, the company will ask you to sign a nondisclosure agreement, prohibiting you from publicly sharing the cost. That doesn’t bode well for the bank account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQKcYF"&gt;I look forward to hearing more about future revisions of the Aurora 7, especially if it gets a button that makes all of the displays pop open in a comical fashion. Currently, it seems like &lt;a href="https://expanscape.com/the-aurora-7-prototype/screen-transition-method/"&gt;an extremely manual process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hackers tampered with a water treatment facility in Florida by changing chemical levels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Il4jxUZwM1cWsdNFhYRMlNLCJxs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789271/acastro_180109_1777_0001_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XQGUMk"&gt;Hackers successfully infiltrated the computer system controlling a water treatment facility in the city of Oldsmar, Florida, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/pinellas/2021/02/08/someone-tried-to-poison-oldsmars-water-supply-during-hack-sheriff-says/"&gt;report from the &lt;em&gt;Tampa Bay Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In doing so, the hackers were able to remotely control a computer to change the chemical levels of the water supply, increasing the amount of sodium hydroxide before a supervisor was able to catch the act in real time and revert the changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZA5BE"&gt;“At no time was there a significant adverse effect on the water being treated,” Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said during a press conference on Monday, which was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkXDSOgLQ6M&amp;amp;ab_channel=PinellasSheriff"&gt;later posted to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. “Importantly, the public was never in danger.” Sodium hydroxide, commonly known as lye, is used in water to regulate acidity levels, the &lt;em&gt;Tampa Bay Times &lt;/em&gt;reports, but in excess it can be dangerous to human beings because it’s the same inorganic compound used in corrosive household cleaners like Drano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fgm2L5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hackers tried to increase the amount of lye in the water supply&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zSIirC"&gt;Although no one was injured, the incident is a disturbing example of hackers taking aim at public infrastructure with unclear intentions. Pinellas County is currently investigating the hack alongside the FBI and the Secret Service. Other nearby cities and towns have also been alerted to the potential threat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khpWNP"&gt;It is not the first incident of water supplies being targeted — a water utility in Illinois was &lt;a href="https://wsabc.ca/water-utility-hacked-are-our-scada-systems-at-risk/"&gt;targeted by suspected Russian hackers&lt;/a&gt; in November of last year, while an attempted cyberattack on Israel last year that intelligence officials have linked to Iran involved attempts to manipulate the water supply, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/intelligence-officials-say-attempted-cyberattack-on-israeli-water-utilities-linked-to-iran/2020/05/08/f9ab0d78-9157-11ea-9e23-6914ee410a5f_story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01MjXM"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Tampa Bay Times &lt;/em&gt;has a rather chilling anecdote in its &lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/pinellas/2021/02/08/someone-tried-to-poison-oldsmars-water-supply-during-hack-sheriff-says/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; detailing the moment the remote plant operator noticed something was terribly wrong, when his mouse started moving on-screen without him touching it: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2itqJO"&gt;A plant operator was monitoring the system at about 8 a.m. Friday and noticed that someone briefly accessed it. He didn’t find this unusual, Gualtieri said, because his supervisor remotely accessed the system regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3g0Nj"&gt;But at about 1:30 p.m. the same day, Gualtieri said, someone accessed the system again. This time, he said, the operator watched as someone took control of the mouse, directed it to the software that controls water treatment, worked inside it for three to five minutes and increased the amount of sodium hydroxide from 100 parts per million to 11,100 parts per million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7bAEM"&gt;The attacker left the system, Gualtieri said, and the operator immediately changed the concentration back to 100 parts per million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="csJiEt"&gt;The county says there are other safeguards in place that would have prevented direct harm to the 15,000 or so residents that rely on the Oldsmar plant for drinking water. For one, the water would have taken more than a day to enter the water supply, the sheriff says, meaning ample public warnings could have been issued in that time. There are also “redundancies in the system” that would have caught changes to the acidity of the water supply, the sheriff says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Justice Department drops challenge to California net neutrality rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUReDjnJkKCtMLNTS6_FAWgdqVc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789186/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D0ONEO"&gt;The Justice Department dropped its 2018 lawsuit challenging California’s state net neutrality rules on Monday, removing one of the law’s major roadblocks preventing it from going into effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3qlBO"&gt;In 2017, the Trump Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776154/fcc-net-neutrality-vote-results-rules-repealed"&gt;voted to repeal&lt;/a&gt; the Obama-era internet regulations banning internet service providers, like AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon, from throttling or blocking traffic and implementing paid fast lanes. The following year, California passed its own law instituting net neutrality rules at the state level. That law &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-net-neutrality-lawsuit-against-state-california-0"&gt;was quickly challenged&lt;/a&gt; by the Trump-led Justice Department, which argued that California’s law was preempted by the FCC’s 2017 repeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8OSmX"&gt;“I am pleased that the Department of Justice has withdrawn this lawsuit.  When the FCC, over my objection, rolled back its net neutrality policies, states like California sought to fill the void with their own laws,” FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement Monday. “By taking this step, Washington is listening to the American people, who overwhelmingly support an open internet, and is charting a course to once again make net neutrality the law of the land.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXmRr8"&gt;California’s law has yet to go into effect due to separate legal challenges, independent of the Justice Department case. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet-justice/u-s-drops-challenge-to-california-state-net-neutrality-law-idUSKBN2A82D1"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, another challenge to the law brought by industry groups is pending a February 23rd hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZRfH0"&gt;Former FCC Chairman &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726572/ajit-pai-fcc-step-down-date-trump-telecom-net-neutrality"&gt;Ajit Pai stepped&lt;/a&gt; down from the agency last month when President Joe Biden was inaugurated. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22240827/biden-acting-fcc-chair-rosenworcel-net-neutrality-acting"&gt;Rosenworcel currently chairs&lt;/a&gt; the agency in an acting capacity, and it’s unclear when Biden will nominate an official replacement for Pai.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA takes a big step into mobile with acquisition of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood developer Glu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Electronic Arts Inc. Event Ahead Of 2018 E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xl-Ail1BD5cMduprBgMvKC1Lq4I=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789167/970613582.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Eq2YZf"&gt;EA is making a big move into the world of mobile gaming with the acquisition of Glu Mobile, a developer best known for its work on celebrity-focused titles, based on stars like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/16/10287726/katy-perry-pop-glu-mobile-game"&gt;Katy Perry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/4/5966973/kim-kardashian-game"&gt;Kim Kardashian&lt;/a&gt;. Its portfolio also includes popular titles like &lt;em&gt;Design Home&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Covet Fashion&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;MLB Tap Sports Baseball&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;EA says that once the deal is closed, it will have acquired Glu for “$2.1 billion in enterprise value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L1XCzF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re doubling the size of our mobile business.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a4Rw1O"&gt;“Mobile continues to grow as the biggest gaming platform in the world, and with the addition of Glu’s games and talent, we’re doubling the size of our mobile business,” EA CEO Andrew Wilson said in a statement. EA says that it currently has a mobile audience of more than 100 million monthly active players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzEBuj"&gt;The move is analogous to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9662214/actvision-blizzard-buys-candy-crush-king-5-9-billion"&gt;Activision Blizzard’s acquisition of &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; maker King in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, serving as an expensive way to break into the lucrative mobile space. During its recent Q4 earnings statement, Activision said that King raked in $577 million in net revenues, not far from Blizzard’s $579 million. King is also now tapping into existing Activision franchises with the upcoming release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21317994/crash-bandicoot-mobile-ios-android-candy-crush-saga-temple-run"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crash Bandicoot: On the Run&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="255j6B"&gt;There’s no word on what new projects Glu might be working on under the EA umbrella, though the publisher said that Glu’s experience with casual games coupled with EA’s “industry-leading IP in sports and beyond” are a big reason behind the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash has acquired salad-making robot company Chowbotics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSFHDCqHpj547zcTZemp8c4H1WI=/161x0:2539x1585/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68788641/chowbotics.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Salad vending machine company Chowbotics is now part of DoorDash&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AEYUQi"&gt;DoorDash has acquired salad-making robot startup Chowbotics, the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@DoorDash/welcoming-chowbotics-to-the-doordash-team-cf0b59c4ce94"&gt;companies announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but the Chowbotics team have all become DoorDash employees, and the company will operate independently within DoorDash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3hLeh"&gt;“We have long admired the work that Chowbotics has done to increase access to fresh meals, with its groundbreaking robotics product and vision,” DoorDash co-founder Stanley Tang said in statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “With the Chowbotics team on board, we can explore new use cases and customers, providing another service to help our merchants grow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kIKHS9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bPeE-zfU00w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="keVa67"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chowbotics.com/about-us/"&gt;Chowbotics&lt;/a&gt; was founded in 2014, and its fresh food robot Sally — a rectangular machine that’s essentially a salad vending machine — can create customizable salads, grain and poke bowls, parfaits, cereals, and snacks all within a small space. The robot is used by companies like universities, hospitals, and grocery stores, according to a blog post from DoorDash general manager Penn Daniel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWyMuI"&gt;DoorDash currently has the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/edison-discovers/q4-2020-food-delivery-rideshare-sales-report-70382329c1b1"&gt;greatest share&lt;/a&gt; of the US food delivery market, around 48 percent, ahead of rivals like UberEats and Grubhub. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21563716/doordash-ipo-profit-pandemic-food-delivery-drones"&gt;Its revenue skyrocketed in 2020&lt;/a&gt; as restaurants closed in-person dining due to the pandemic and customers relied on delivery services. But when DoorDash went public late last year, its IPO was criticized by some analysts as lacking in value; they questioned how DoorDash would be able to continue to grow if demand for food delivery subsides once the pandemic is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1a9WDK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/doordash-ipo-most-ridiculous-david-trainer-bailing-out-private-investors-2020-12-1029870440"&gt;Analyst David Trainer of New Constructs said at the time&lt;/a&gt;, “We think this proposed public equity offering holds no value, $0, beyond bailing out private investors before unsuspecting public investors realize the business is not viable in its current form.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JT8HQQ"&gt;But the Chowbotics acquisition raises interesting questions about DoorDash’s post-pandemic plans. Daniel wrote in the blog post that Chowbotics will allow DoorDash to help the restaurants that use its delivery platform expand their offerings. It seems likely that Chowbotics’ vending machines would fit into the ghost kitchen model, which are delivery-only restaurants that &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/21540765/ghost-kitchens-virtual-restaurants-covid-19-industry-impact"&gt;some in the industry regard warily&lt;/a&gt;. DoorDash has a &lt;a href="https://www.nrn.com/delivery-takeout-solutions/doordash-launches-program-revive-closed-restaurants-using-ghost-kitchens"&gt;ghost kitchen facility&lt;/a&gt; in California, and last year announced it was working with Chicago restaurant Krazy Hog — which closed in-person dining during the pandemic — as part of its &lt;a href="https://blog.doordash.com/helping-restaurants-to-reopen-for-delivery-4326c4edf29d"&gt;Reopen for Delivery&lt;/a&gt; initiative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XB4yXR"&gt;If you’re ordering for delivery, chances are you’d never know whether your salad was made by a Chowbotics robot or a human unless the restaurant tells you. It’s not uncommon for restaurants to brand their delivery operations under a different name — like when some diners discovered the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chuck-e-cheese-pasquallys-grubhub_l_5ec2dd89c5b646534f558efa"&gt;pizzas they ordered from “Pasqually’s”&lt;/a&gt; actually came from kids’ eatery Chuck E. Cheese. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c9dXsf"&gt;On Monday, California state Senator Connie Leyva introduced the Silenced No More Act, a bill that advocates say will protect employees who speak out about discrimination at work, even if they’ve signed nondisclosure agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raHVAj"&gt;“SB 331 will prevent workers from being forced to sign non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements that would limit their ability to speak out about harassment and discrimination in the workplace,” Leyva said in a statement. “It is unacceptable for any employer to try to silence a worker because he or she was a victim of any type of harassment or discrimination—whether due to race, sexual orientation, religion, age or any other characteristic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga9tqL"&gt;The newly introduced legislation builds on work by Ifeoma Ozoma, a former Pinterest employee who went public in June, alongside her colleague Aerica Shimizu Banks, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/"&gt;with allegations of racism and sexism&lt;/a&gt; at the company. Ozoma knew she was partially covered by a California law called CCP 1001, which passed in the wake of the Me Too movement to protect employees speaking out about sex discrimination in the office. But she also realized the law had serious limitations: it didn’t account for other forms of workplace harassment, including racism, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/Policy/new-california-law-ndas"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJu9Mb"&gt;“If Pinterest decides to sue me, they’d have to state affirmatively that the discrimination I faced was not because of my sex — it was because of my race,” &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/Policy/new-california-law-ndas"&gt;Ozoma said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This has been the only time being a Black woman was a double-bind for the other person, not for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FC7eeJ"&gt;After she went public, Ozoma started working to expand CCP 1001 protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpqEXk"&gt;If successful, the law would have a dramatic impact on the tech industry, which is famous for making workers sign strict nondisclosure agreements. These NDAs can include broad non-disparagement clauses which prevent employees from speaking out. The rule is especially hard for contract workers who often lack the protections and resources of full-time employees. In recent years, contractors at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have chosen to speak out anyway — and risked retaliation as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ynpnv"&gt;The Silenced No More Act, which is jointly sponsored by the California Employment Lawyers Association and Equal Rights Advocates, covers “every discrimination category under California law,” &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; reports. This includes race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, ancestry, disability, and age, among others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RrE8Q"&gt;“NDAs are inherently harmful because they prevent workers from speaking out against abuses in the workplace,” said Jessica Stender, senior counsel for workplace justice and public policy at Equal Rights Advocates. “We are proud to cosponsor SB 331, which will prohibit forced NDAs related to all forms of discrimination—including overdue race discrimination protections—to ensure that workers are not silenced and discrimination is not swept under the rug.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s App Store is hosting multimillion-dollar scams, says this iOS developer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nRMuVrltnfZKYSvIEWrK-dR5QdU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68788371/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UakKY0"&gt;Mobile app developer Kosta Eleftheriou has a new calling that goes beyond software development: taking on what he sees as a rampant scam problem ruining the integrity of Apple’s App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7m4aTz"&gt;Eleftheriou, who created the successful Apple Watch keyboard app FlickType, has for the last two weeks been publicly criticizing Apple for lax enforcement of its App Store rules that have allowed scam apps, as well as apps that clone popular software from other developers, to run rampant. These apps enjoy top billing in the iPhone marketplace, all thanks to glowing reviews and sterling five-star ratings that are largely fabricated, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bfrJAE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Up to now, I've been in the "Apple *wants* to do the right thing" camp. My viewpoint is starting to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How to spot a $5M/year scam on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt;, in 5 minutes flat: &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1357938977748078594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zq0wOY"&gt;“It’s surprising more people don’t know about this. The extent to which this has been going on and is currently going on is absolutely mind-blowing,” Eleftheriou tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;of the magnitude of fraud he says is occurring daily on the App Store&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;In particular now with the App Store, which is my main concern, the problem has grown to such an extent that having the rating and review system is making it worse. It gives consumers a false sense of security and a false idea that the app is great as you’re entering it through a glowing App Store page with raving reviews.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otnjzC"&gt;His vocal complaints, which have attracted the attention and support of countless other app developers in the iOS community, underscore the increasing tension between Apple and the software makers upon whom it depends. It comes at a time of unprecedented antitrust scrutiny and legal challenges from competitors related to the company’s stewardship of the App Store, from which it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;estimated to have made more than $64 billion last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpAAa8"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZkhTKG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The extent to which this has been going on and is currently going on is absolutely mind-blowing.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eoaFRC"&gt;The issues Eleftheriou is raising are interlocking ones all stemming from what he says are inconsistently enforced App Store rules and lazy moderation. It’s not just apps that try to siphon money away from consumers under false pretenses using exploitative subscription services. It’s also fake reviews and ratings that can be bought and a broken algorithmic ranking system that helps these apps float to the top and take the spot of genuine paid apps developed by small teams or singular developers, Eleftheriou says. Letting it perpetuate, he adds, is a platform that Apple does not actively police unless it’s an issue that gains the attention of the media or involves one of Apple’s current rivals like Facebook or &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;maker Epic Games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEXORD"&gt;Eleftheriou first detailed his personal experience with App Store scams &lt;a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;amp;jsonp=vglnk_161281136039111&amp;amp;key=c1c7d488bb2df8a8b659d5d41634d304&amp;amp;libId=kkwxug0j010023dg000DLc57hpt7i&amp;amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2021%2F02%2F08%2Fapp-store-scam-apps-how-to-spot%2F&amp;amp;v=1&amp;amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fkeleftheriou%2Fstatus%2F1356011069395755009&amp;amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;amp;title=Developer%20exposes%20multiple%20scam%20apps%20on%20the%20App%20Store%2C%20some%20bringing%20in%20millions%20of%20dollars%20in%20revenue%20-%209to5Mac&amp;amp;txt=thread%20began%20two%20weeks%20ago"&gt;late last month in a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;, where he explained how his app FlickType was maliciously copied by numerous developers that built non-functioning versions of the software and charged egregious subscription fees, only getting away with it because of strong App Store reviews and high five-star ratings he claims are fake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDyny2"&gt;Eleftheriou says his primary competitor, a scam app called KeyWatch, was charging users $8 per week and amassing more than $2 million a year, according to analytics from Appfigures, despite the app not functioning properly. He says KeyWatch even advertised its software using his promotional video — with his name still attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7onrML"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The App Store has a big problem &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You: an honest developer, working hard to improve your IAP conversions.&lt;br&gt;Your competitor: a $2M/year scam running rampant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1/ &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011069395755009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dDNC96"&gt;Eleftheriou has since embarked on an online crusade to bring more attention to the topic, fueled in part by Apple choosing to take down some of the apps he’s been highlighting but letting the developers behind those apps continue publishing to the App Store. Scores of other developers have begun chiming in with their own experiences, too, including notable Apple critics like Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KZ5te"&gt;Some of these critics, including Hansson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;with regard to his company’s Hey email client&lt;/a&gt;, have accused Apple in the past of mistreating and overcharging developers using the App Store’s standard 30 percent cut of app downloads and in-app purchases. These critics see the scam situation as further proof that Apple profits off of these developers and therefore doesn’t take proper steps to moderate the platform and enforce its rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kkilUu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The subscription scam apps that Apple allow in the App Store really are bananas. While they're busy hunting legitimate developers down for their pound of flesh, they're letting these hyaenas strive on the savannah unopposed. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NpsjjWC0CY"&gt;https://t.co/NpsjjWC0CY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1358822574243905538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="S1tG5n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple refuses to take down two scam apps that destroy my honest business via fake ratings and false marketing claims.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have hard proof yet Apple ignores my numerous reports.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt;, please do something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is my story.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppStore?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AppStore&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Appocalypse?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Appocalypse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Scams?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Scams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/SCw9FHrN7g"&gt;https://t.co/SCw9FHrN7g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WatchChat (@WatchChatInfo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WatchChatInfo/status/1358825883465904131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AqKXD9"&gt;Apple has yet to respond publicly to Eleftheriou’s claims, though the company has removed KeyWatch and some of the other scam apps he’s brought attention to over the past week. But the issues are systemic, Eleftheriou says, and nothing short of an overhaul to how the App Store ranks software, measures trustworthiness, and roots out bad actors will remedy the issue. Until then, Eleftheriou says he’s going to keep sounding the alarm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DP3h6I"&gt;“I’m not gonna stop. Whenever I see a scam, I’m going to call them out,” he says. “I just can’t wait for some actual proper change from Apple to make me feel like I should concentrate on what I should be concentrating on, which is app development.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="zke3Gs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The more users understand this is a problem, the more pressure there will be on Apple to act.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2FSGs"&gt;He says a competing app store on the iPhone could help solve a lot of these issues. That’s the same line of argument Epic has used in its lawsuit against Apple over the removal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Epic and its chief executive, Tim Sweeney, have called for alternative marketplaces on iOS, as well as the ability for apps distributed through the App Store to use their own payment systems and not give Apple 30 percent of every transaction. After Epic deployed its own in-app payment system within &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;last summer, Apple removed the app for violating its rules. Epic is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;suing both Apple and Google&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95KyD4"&gt;“In an ideal world, competition does have the tendency to sort a lot of things out, whether it’s pricing or enforcement of rules. Competition is like creativity; you get all these new ideas and hopefully the best get to the top,” Eleftheriou says. “The other way would be for developers to publicly share their stories as far and as wide as possible. The more users understand this is a problem, the more pressure there will be on Apple to act.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOAb8y"&gt;Eleftheriou adds that he’s disappointed in Apple’s silence on the matter, though that’s only energized him further to continue speaking out. “It’s not just acting. I think Apple needs to, at the minimum, say something, acknowledge the issue and that they’re working on it,” he says. “Just staying silent about it is just falsely reinforcing this notion for consumers that App Store reviews and ratings are to be trusted. They are not.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYjouv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alabama warehouse workers prepare to face down Amazon in union vote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WxqYexX5a2tyiy9Vp8fivS3YIRU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68788137/acastro_210208_4402_amazonVote.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An Amazon warehouse in Alabama could become the first to unionize in the US &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="jq4fTt"&gt;For the next seven weeks, employees at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama will vote on whether to become the first of the company’s US employees to unionize. The only other US Amazon employees to make it as far as a union election was a smaller group of maintenance workers at a Delaware warehouse in 2014. That effort failed after an aggressive &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/technology/amazon-proves-infertile-soil-for-unions-so-far.html"&gt;anti-union campaign&lt;/a&gt; from a company that has long been &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dp3yn/amazon-leaked-reports-expose-spying-warehouse-workers-labor-union-environmental-groups-social-movements"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-worker-retaliation-coronavirus"&gt;worker organizing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNeO4L"&gt;The vote in Alabama, at a warehouse outside Birmingham called BHM1, comes at a pivotal time for the company and its workers. Amazon is emerging from the pandemic in a stronger position than ever: posting &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-amzn-4q-earnings-report-2020-11612221803"&gt;record earnings&lt;/a&gt;, opening new warehouses at a rapid clip, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/pushed-by-pandemic-amazon-goes-on-a-hiring-spree-without-equal.html"&gt;hiring&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of new workers a day. Those workers, however, have become increasingly vocal about the fact that they haven’t shared in the company’s success. Last year’s wave of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216172/amazon-coronavirus-protests-response-safety-jfk8-fired-covid-19"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; and walkouts over COVID-19 safety measures and other issues won some partial &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-workers-who-petitioned-for-paid-time-off-claim"&gt;victories&lt;/a&gt;, but the Bessemer union, if it succeeds, would give workers the power to negotiate a contract that could lock in durable changes to wages and working conditions. It could also inspire other Amazon warehouses to organize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5RcSDF"&gt;Workers at BHM1 say that one of the primary issues driving the union push is Amazon’s grueling and automatically enforced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155254/automation-robots-unemployment-jobs-vs-human-google-amazon"&gt;productivity metrics&lt;/a&gt;, a complaint that has prompted demonstrations at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20696154/amazon-prime-day-2019-strike-warehouse-workers-inhumane-conditions-the-rate-productivity"&gt;other Amazon facilities&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oV8jO2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You don’t have time to step back.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xbNIUW"&gt;Darryl Richardson started working at BHM1 when it opened in March, after the automotive company he worked at closed down. At first, he thought it would be a good job, but it wasn’t long before Amazon’s productivity tracking started to grate on him. Richardson is a “picker,” which means he removes products from shelves that robots bring to his station, sometimes climbing a ladder to do so, scans them, and sends them to be packaged for shipment. Amazon tracks how many items he scans, how quickly, and how much time he spends not scanning, which it calls “time off task,” or “TOT.” Going to the bathroom counts as “TOT.” Stretching between items counts as “TOT,” and after 30 minutes of “TOT,” workers get an automated writeup, and after two hours, they get fired, Richardson says. He estimates he has to scan an item approximately every ten seconds, all day, to avoid penalties. “It’s a very consistent fast pace. You don’t have time to step back.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyHOaH"&gt;“You go get some water, you can’t pause your time, and you get docked, because you aren’t scanning,” Richardson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="df9s9O"&gt;“I mean, you come into work and need to be treated like a human being,” says another worker, a longtime Amazon employee who transferred to BHM1 when it opened. He supports the union but asked to remain anonymous because of “Amazon’s reputation for how they deal with people trying to unionize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2rFB7S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You come into work and need to be treated like a human being.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MuLU6K"&gt;By the summer, other issues had arisen. Amazon had ended the hazard pay it implemented at the beginning of the pandemic, as well as its policy of allowing workers to take unlimited time off without pay. Meanwhile, COVID cases in the South were spiking. (A filing with the National Labor Relations Board provides a snapshot of the COVID rate at BHM1, with Amazon saying 218 workers at BHM1 had tested or were presumed positive for COVID-19 in the two weeks ending January 7th.) The warehouse was also extremely hot, workers say, and schedules would change unpredictably. “They change your schedule while you sleep,” Richardson says. “If they change the schedule and you don’t know, they terminate you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9Ih8W"&gt;“I think like a bunch of these frustrations with the company trying to make every little extra dollar, at the expense of the person actually doing the work, has really frustrated people down here,” says the Amazon worker who asked to be anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrHLUb"&gt;Amazon spokesperson Rachael Lighty said that the company offers a starting salary of $15.30 per hour with benefits at the Bessemer facility, and that 90% of employees there would recommend Amazon as a good place to work. “We don’t believe the RWDSU represents the majority of our employees’ views,” Lighty said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPHSHK"&gt;Beth Gutelius, who studies the logistics industry at the University of Illinois Chicago Center for Urban Economic Development, sees the Bessemer union push and other Amazon protests as a symptom of tensions that have long existed in e-commerce but have been heightened by the pandemic. “We’re reaching this point where some of the contradictions that have existed uncomfortably maybe can’t hold anymore,” Gutelius says. “Companies like Amazon really benefited from fulfilling consumer demand during the pandemic, and workers are seeing that those gains have not trickled down to them. Warehouse work in particular has long been invisible to the public, and highly undervalued by firms as a supply chain function, and I think it’s possible that we’re seeing the start of a pretty big course correction on this question, with the value of warehousing being seen in a new light.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VdN2s1"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2 id="U31BKe"&gt;An atmosphere of activism &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3C88co"&gt;At Richardson’s previous job, he had been a member of the United Auto Workers, and he felt employees there had been treated with more “respect.” There had been a procedure for addressing workers’ grievances and rules that made firings less arbitrary. Meanwhile, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union had been waging a public battle for better COVID-19 protections at nearby poultry plants. Richardson and other BHM1 employees decided to reach out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oopw4z"&gt;The campaign came together quickly, a fact that employees attribute to a confluence of factors. Frustration with Amazon — with the grueling work, dehumanizing management approach, and the company’s rocketing profits — was intense and widespread. This frustration coincided with a rising tide of activism at the facility. The majority of BHM1 workers are Black and many had been galvanized by the summer’s Black Lives Matter protests following the killing of George Floyd. “I think it also correlated with the recent racial justice movement,” says the anonymous employee. “There’s a lot of support for the movement in that building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWlhDZ"&gt;Joshua Brewer, the lead RWDSU organizer on the campaign, agrees with the role the movement played. “A lot of these workers are involved in that, especially a lot of these activists that have really worked hard to get their co-workers on board,” he says. “You feel that kind of spirit throughout the campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eW2ZGk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You feel that kind of spirit throughout the campaign.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Om7hos"&gt;He also attributes the campaign’s success to Bessemer’s deep union roots. “It’s a union town, so they go home to their families, and they hear from their aunts and uncles and dads and grandparents that worked in the steel industries or in the mines, and they say unions are good, you need to sign that card and get involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZBzo5"&gt;After several months of workers talking privately to other workers, Brewer says they decided it was time to go public. On October 20th, RWDSU members from nearby poultry plants and warehouses came to the BHM1 gates and started talking to employees. A month later, they had collected enough signatures supporting an election to feel confident filing a petition with the National Labor Relations Board. Brewer says over 3,000 employees, more than half the workers Amazon says work at the facility, have now signed cards in favor of an election. (Organizers need 30 percent of workers to show interest in an election to begin the election process, and more than half of workers who vote to win the election and certify the union.) On January 15th, the NLRB &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/15/amazon-union-alabama-vote/"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that the election could go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUk6kv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o2uzNW"&gt;Amazon goes on the offensive &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Zv5Zyi"&gt;By then, Amazon’s anti-union campaign was underway. In late December, it had launched a &lt;a href="https://www.doitwithoutdues.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; with the tagline #doitwithoutdues, with warnings that signing cards in support of a union election could legally obligate workers to pay dues. (This is misleading: dues wouldn’t start unless workers voted to approve a union contract, and even then, Alabama is a right-to-work state, so dues would be voluntary.) The site also featured photos of happy Amazon employees and an animated cartoon dog that was, inexplicably, also a DJ. Managers started pulling workers aside for anti-union presentations — so called “captive audience” meetings — where they made similar arguments about dues, workers say, and gave out anti-union pins to wear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7nzxS"&gt;Richardson and the other BHM1 employee say some of these meetings were conducted by people who don’t work at the warehouse. It’s common for companies to hire anti-union consultants who specialize in dissuading employees from organizing, though Amazon did not comment directly on whether consultants had been hired for BHM1’s unionization effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRHycH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;It is important that all employees understand the facts of joining a union and the election process,” said Amazon’s Lighty. “We host regular information sessions for all employees, which include an opportunity for employees to ask questions. If the union vote passes, it will impact everyone at the site and it’s important all associates understand what that means for them and their day-to-day life working at Amazon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjGrJF"&gt;Workers now get near-daily text messages from Amazon telling them to vote no, that “a union is a business that takes money out of your paycheck to fund itself,” and other anti-union messages, according to screenshots viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. On Facebook and Instagram, employees are targeted with anti-union ads linking to Amazon’s #doitwithoutdues website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ujh27x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even in the bathrooms, Amazon’s anti-union campaign inescapable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="moZKxj"&gt;“I have never seen Amazon fight for something like this. I have never seen them try to push for something this hard before,” says the longtime Amazon employee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WINSOM"&gt;Anti-union banners and signs have gone up across the warehouse. Even in the bathrooms, Amazon’s anti-union campaign inescapable: signs have been posted on stall doors and at eye level above the urinals warning workers about union dues and telling them to “remember everything you already have without giving any of your hard earned money to the RWDSU,” one poster reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2fmas"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qoiSalYN-kx6GK5tGYpflExSfv8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22289064/Screen_Shot_2021_02_08_at_9.25.32_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ce-U4MS7_ncJ93oeC7ezq9eI-8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22289066/Screen_Shot_2021_02_08_at_9.24.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-union signs in the BHM1 bathrooms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8pdmdw"&gt;“It’s right in your face, like when you walk up to it, so you have something to read. It’s a pretty great way to get the info out there, but come on,” says the worker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEnyEC"&gt;At the NLRB, Amazon tried to delay the election and have it be conducted in person, rather than by mail. Since the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-establishes-standards-for-mail-and-manual-ballot-representation#:~:text=Since%20March%2C%20approximately%2090%20percent,concerns%20raised%20by%20the%20pandemic."&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of union elections have been by mail, but Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244413/amazon-union-vote-decision-appeal-alabama-us-labor-board"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that mail-in voting would decrease turnout, and that, in an argument that echoed misinformation about the presidential election, it would have a greater risk of “party fraud and coercion.” Instead, Amazon proposed setting up a tent in the warehouse parking lot, testing all participants for COVID, conducting temperature screening, and monitoring the line for social distancing, either using a “digital assistant” or with human teams. Amazon also proposed renting a floor of a local hotel for NLRB election agents and providing them with chauffeurs and food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cw8oCj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I have never seen Amazon fight for something like this.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LCw3bs"&gt;On Friday, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22268280/amazon-nlrb-denied-union-election-alabama-warehouse"&gt;NLRB denied&lt;/a&gt; Amazon’s appeal, reaffirming its position that mail voting is safer, and that letting Amazon rent out hotels and monitor voting lines would create an impression of bias and surveillance. Ballots will be sent out February 8th and need to be returned by March 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="FOHr0O"&gt;Amazon will undoubtedly continue its anti-union campaign, though it can no longer hold mandatory meetings on company time now that ballots have been sent out. But the BHM1 organizers are optimistic about their chances and about what a victory will mean for Amazon workers elsewhere. “I hope they’re watching what’s going on,” says Richardson. “And that they stand strong, they stick together, and do what they need to do to try to make it better there, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PIH6j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 8th 3:14PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The story has been updated to include responses from Amazon. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>E3 2021 may be digital as ESA says it’s ‘transforming’ the gaming showcase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WVURhht5P1Ja8MDkQkKcbpnKKbk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787987/acastro_190531_1777_e3_lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="syw46E"&gt;The Entertainment Software Association has announced that E3 2021 is happening this year, and it could be going digital, &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/e3-pushes-forward-with-plans-for-a-digital-2021-event/amp/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Video Games Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The event will be held from June 15th through June 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KljMd9"&gt;“We can confirm that we are transforming the E3 experience for 2021,” an ESA spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And will soon share exact details on how we’re bringing the global video game community together.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfs37P"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Video Games Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;, the ESA has outlined its plans for E3 2021, with intentions to hold multiple two-hour keynote sessions from games partners, an awards show, a preview night on June 14th, plus some small streams from various game publishers, influencers, and media partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84udVn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video Games Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; also notes that the ESA’s outline proposes that the broadcast event would be supplemented by media previews the week before, and game demos slated to appear at the event would be released on consumer platforms. The ESA would also allow partner companies to remotely stream playable game demos to the media across “thousands” of scheduled meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5N3xQL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can confirm that we are transforming the E3 experience for 2021”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qOZUes"&gt;While the entire plan sounds ambitious, it still requires approval from ESA’s membership, which is made up of some of the industry's biggest companies, which also hold significant influence over the structure of the event. Traditionally, E3 has been one of the biggest weeks in the gaming industry, with the event showcasing some of the year's largest announcements. However, in recent years, the ESA has faced pressure with redefining E3 as major publishers, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063737/sony-ps5-e3-2020-skip-again-launch-new-console-generation"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;, have opted to skip the event entirely in favor of hosting its own events around the week E3 is normally held. Following E3’s cancellation, many digital events were held to fill the void, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21243981/summer-game-fest-news-events-geoff-keighley-sony-microsoft"&gt;Summer Games Fest&lt;/a&gt; hosted by industry veteran Geoff Keighley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21OcVK"&gt;This is the first time the ESA is holding E3 after the organization &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21163570/e3-canceled-coronavirus-outbreak-xbox-nintendo"&gt;canceled E3 2020&lt;/a&gt; due to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. But E3 is not the only event that plans to go digital this year due to the pandemic; Activision Blizzard plans to host an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449517/blizzconline-blizzcon-blizzard-entertainment-event-convention-19-20-date"&gt;online-only BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; from February 19th through February 20th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Kaitlin Hatton?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_nva1kx3i753k7aqG9zbj0FbAWY=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67375083/khatton_200826_4171_0010_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘Is meatball an fruit?’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6bAL14"&gt;Like many businesses, the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has largely decamped to our homes. Starting in early March, we packed up our laptops and headphones, and we are now working from home offices, dining room tables, desks set up in the corners of bedrooms, or living room sofas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAMMnn"&gt;We thought it would be fun to find out, six months later, what adjustments the staff has made to their various living quarters in order to be able to turn out the same journalism that was formerly produced in an office setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGoGYf"&gt;For this article, we talked to &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; social media manager Kaitlin Hatton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqAnWw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaitlin, what does a social media manager do, actually?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="em4NoD"&gt;I handle everything from analytics to posting across all of our platforms, with a bunch of responsibilities in between. I tend to focus on our &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/verge/"&gt;Instagram accounts&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VergeDeals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; Deals&lt;/a&gt; Twitter account, so if you’ve ever wondered who is behind the screen for those profiles, that would be me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCB0ab"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking at the photos of your desk, I have to tell you that’s a great space. Was that an existing setup or did you put it together once you knew you’d be working at home?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8zi4t"&gt;Thank you! The situation around my setup is unique in that it came about when I switched from being in Vox Media’s office full-time while I lived in New York City to going entirely remote and moving to Ohio. I had always envisioned what I wanted my workspace to look like at home, but I wasn’t able to actually act on it until I moved. So everything from the setup to relocating was a fresh start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSV8UG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love the view out your window.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmIrdy"&gt;The large windows are my favorite part of the apartment — especially since I’m home all the time now. I spend a lot of time at my desk, and the natural light is a lifesaver.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQMjXEYG4cE67w7srpFGBqOfDJU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21845696/khatton_200826_4171_0017.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m66sGx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joERzR"&gt;Believe it or not, the desk is actually a Facebook Marketplace find. I was on a tight budget from moving and trying to be eco-conscious with some of my furniture choices. I made a pact with myself that I would try to find something that fits my needs and aesthetic secondhand first before buying new. I ended up really lucking out on this desk because it was $25, is incredibly spacious, and it’s been super sturdy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wT8hjE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What Are the Best Office and Desk Chairs Under $250?","url":"https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-desk-office-chairs-under-250.html"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8cKn9k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s great. It’s hard to find something that useful secondhand. Is the chair secondhand as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk7Jzc"&gt;It’s not! It’s from a set of dining chairs that I purchased new. I decided it was more comfortable than my previous desk chair so I swapped them out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bez4dZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think you’ll be looking around for a “real” desk chair? Or is this one comfortable enough to last you for a while?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5j2rX"&gt;It’s actually pretty comfortable so I’m going to keep it around for a while!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxg1xa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, can you tell me about your tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hW1hTW"&gt;Yes! The most crucial items that I need for work are my 2017 MacBook Pro, my external Dell monitor, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OWC-Thunderbolt-3-Pro-Dock/dp/B081K9J5FV/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OWC Thunderbolt 3 dock&lt;/a&gt; that I use to connect them. As a social media manager, I have to keep a lot of different websites and platforms up at all times so I’d be lost without a second screen. Unfortunately, my laptop is about to be sent off for repair because it’s missing the H key. It just popped off one day! As a solution, I’m using another Apple keyboard and mouse so my desk is a little crowded at the moment. (&lt;em&gt;Note: since this was written, Kaitlin reports that her H key has been fixed&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3tm1m"&gt;I also keep my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/ref=sr_1_3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DPMXZZ7/ref=s9_acsd_al_bw_c2_x_5_i?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt; within close reach so I can just grab them as I move around the apartment throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pv1kPh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s interesting that you grab for your Kindle rather than your phone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xvDF3"&gt;I wear an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-watch-series-3%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21409065%2Fremote-work-desk-setup-from-home-office-tech#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; nearly every day, so unless I need to post to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Instagram accounts, I tend to just leave my phone around since I’ll see texts coming in anyway. I’m always reading books so I like to make sure my Kindle is around me in case I have some spare time to use it. It’s ancient; I’ve had it for years, but it’s still chugging along just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1fs19j"&gt;
&lt;div id="gkOGsP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="q5RbIl"&gt;
&lt;p id="yHuwAX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And you knew I was going to ask: “Is meatball an fruit?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JanYp"&gt;Honestly, it’s one of the best things I own! I’m a major &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406041/post-malone-envy-gaming-dallas-empire-fuel"&gt;Post Malone&lt;/a&gt; fan, for starters. Then several acquaintances of mine in the social media management sphere were getting these plaques with their favorite inspirational tweets on them. The only tweet I could think of that I wanted to look at every day was this one. It’s truly iconic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="x2TKI1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a beautiful decoration on the back of your monitor. What is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUB7kl"&gt;Thanks! It’s an embroidered coffin! Halloween is my favorite holiday, and I refuse to limit my celebration of it to just October. So I keep little, subtle holiday decorations up year-round. I got this one from a local artist at an art fair last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="zVAYK9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s lovely. Okay, just two more questions. First: is your desk always this neat? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndGP5F"&gt;Ha! Yes! I like to call myself an accidental minimalist. I unintentionally own relatively few things, so it’s easy for me to stay tidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbkLsR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second: is there anything you’d like to change or add to the current setup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJtSlM"&gt;I’ve actually been thinking about that a lot recently. I think I’d like to add some LED strip lights to my desk in some way so I can light up the rest of my living room with a pretty color. I’d also like to find a cable box to hide my mess of cords that are currently tucked in the corner behind me. I’ve never been one for cable management until I put my desk out in the open.&lt;/p&gt;
