    <title>The US has a long way to go to make up for its part in the climate crisis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks And Signs Executive Actions On Climate Change And Creating Jobs" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fUIAzRoMeumpooDurKj8-5b2UNg=/0x0:5676x3784/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166361/1230821705.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cTxnEI"&gt;The US plans to officially ratchet up its climate commitments going into Earth Day tomorrow, but many advocates are skeptical that it will be ambitious enough to balance out the nation’s inordinate role in creating the climate crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9Z8HUM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No possible ethically justifiable story in which the United States does not do more”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ajesja"&gt;Biden is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/04/20/biden-climate-change/"&gt;expected to commit&lt;/a&gt; the US to slashing its greenhouse gas emissions by at least half compared to what they were in 2005. That’s already a significant ramp-up compared to the trajectory the US was on before. (Barack Obama committed the US to a roughly 27 percent cut by 2025.) But there’s still somewhat of a mismatch between what the US is willing to commit to and what some say it owes to the rest of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMAWhE"&gt;“There exists in my mind no possible ethically justifiable story in which the United States does not do more,” says Tom Athanasiou, executive director of the activist think tank EcoEquity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaRsp1"&gt;Two specific targets have emerged as rallying calls since a landmark United Nations &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;2018 report&lt;/a&gt; set out pathways to achieving the goals set in Paris: global emissions should reach net zero around 2050 and drop in about half compared to 2010 levels this decade. (While the United Nations report uses a 2010 baseline for pollution cuts, different countries use different years. The US uses 2005, around the time that its emissions peaked.) Biden’s been talking about reaching that 2050 goal domestically since he was on the campaign trail. Since then, hundreds of companies and some mainstream environmental groups &lt;a href="https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/ambitious-u-s-2030-ndc/"&gt;have called for him&lt;/a&gt; to commit to the 2030 target, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fqcd4t"&gt;But others say that target falls short and that the US should do much more because of how much fossil fuel pollution it’s created. China is currently the country that releases the most carbon dioxide emissions each year, so it also has a lot of responsibility. But cumulatively, the US has pumped out nearly &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1007454/cumulative-co2-emissions-worldwide-by-country/"&gt;twice as much&lt;/a&gt; carbon dioxide as China since 1750. Even today, the US’s modern &lt;a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/each-countrys-share-co2-emissions"&gt;per capita emissions&lt;/a&gt; are more than double that of China’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cvCtx"&gt;That’s why Athanasiou, and the Climate Action Network that he’s part of, say that the US’s “&lt;a href="https://usfairshare.org/"&gt;fair share&lt;/a&gt;” of the work to address the climate crisis is much higher than the 50 percent reduction target for this decade. “If there’s a global average number, and you’re doing something fair, then the United States has to do more than the global average. End of story,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="CKrjE8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US’s “fair share” of the work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RvTMDy"&gt;They’re asking the US to slash its emissions by 70 percent. The Climate Action Network also says the US has the responsibility and financial capacity to help developing nations with their emissions cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvA0P1"&gt;Another independent &lt;a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/1o5C-consistent-benchmarks-for-us-2030-climate-target/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that for Biden to hit his aspiration of net zero emissions by 2050 and help the rest of the world do the same, he needs to up the ante. The US should slash pollution by between 57 to 63 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, according to the analysis by the nonprofit organizations NewClimate Institute and Climate Analytics. It also said that the US would need to support other countries’ efforts to lower emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhmjbJ"&gt;So far, the US seems to be falling short when it comes to investing in pollution cuts elsewhere. An important piece of the Paris agreement is a Green Climate Fund established to help developing countries transition to clean energy. The Obama administration committed $3 billion to the fund but was only able to fulfill about $1 billion of it. Donald Trump then pulled the US out of the agreement and reneged on the remaining funds. When Biden recommitted the US to Paris, many thought he would follow through — and maybe even put down more cash. But they were &lt;a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2021/04/13/joe-bidens-1-2bn-budget-green-climate-fund-falls-short-campaigner-demands/"&gt;disappointed&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month when the president’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/FY2022-Discretionary-Request.pdf"&gt;budget proposal&lt;/a&gt; only laid out an additional $1.2 billion for the fund — not even enough to make up for what Trump had previously backed out of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4J08dO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The world is teetering ever closer to catastrophe&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="17IleY"&gt;The US has a long way to go to show the world that it is actually serious about tackling the crisis again. When the US helped strike the Paris climate agreement in 2015, it promised, along with all of the other signatories, that in five years, it would submit even more ambitious commitments to tackle climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plVJG8"&gt;Those five years are up. Now, the world is teetering ever closer to catastrophe: it’s already heated by &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/2020-was-one-of-three-warmest-years-record"&gt;1.2 degrees&lt;/a&gt; Celsius, close to the 1.5 degree threshold that the Paris agreement hoped to avoid. That’s why people around the world are holding their breath to learn what governments’ new commitments are. Of the almost 200 countries that signed the accord, some &lt;a href="https://www.climatewatchdata.org/2020-ndc-tracker"&gt;80 have already turned in&lt;/a&gt; their homework. Notably, the two top greenhouse gas polluters, China and the US, have not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyhaRj"&gt;“Many countries around the globe that are kind of hiding and saying, ‘Okay, we don’t move forward because we don’t see that the big economies are moving forward,’” says Gustavo de Vivero, a climate policy analyst at the NewClimate Institute and one of the authors of its recent analysis. “It’s extremely important [that the Biden administration] show commitment, show that it’s possible to go as high as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52hhCM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaHvpv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bill Nelson backs NASA’s Moon plans, climate change work in confirmation hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBXnLI_OBhpKDa2jkLHQHmE9K7E=/0x0:5128x3419/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166281/_MG_3326.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nelson smiles for cameras before his Senate confirmation hearing to be NASA’s 14th administrator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qeJKfO"&gt;President Biden’s pick for NASA administrator, former Sen. Bill Nelson, breezed through his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, as expected. Facing questions from his “old buddies” about NASA’s commercial partnerships, climate change, and workforce diversity, Nelson’s hearing was uneventful and garnered bipartisan praise. He backed the agency’s current plan to send its first crew of astronauts to the Moon on a SpaceX rocket and emphasized NASA’s role in studying climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5mJKa"&gt;Just over a month after being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337787/biden-nasa-chief-choice-senator-bill-nelson"&gt;tapped&lt;/a&gt; by Biden for NASA chief, Nelson told lawmakers he supported the president’s 2022 summary budget request for NASA and defended the $2.3 billion it set out for the agency’s Earth sciences wing — a 15 percent increase from the prior year. “It’s a very important increase. You can’t mitigate climate change unless you measure it, and that’s NASA’s expertise,” he said. “Understanding our planet gives us the means to better protect it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFSUok"&gt;In his &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/4AB228AD-89D0-459D-9ADD-16CBBB76838A"&gt;testimony&lt;/a&gt; and remarks to lawmakers, Nelson, a former congressman and a three-term US senator from Florida, made “constancy of purpose” his priority if confirmed by the Senate. He plans to maintain the moonshot momentum that brewed under the Trump administration, while upping support for climate-focused objectives championed by Biden, including “climate change, educating and inspiring a diverse STEM workforce, building back better through innovation, and using space to create and strengthen global alliances and ensure U.S. global leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_31bc60Wv6m_75u0by3jXM28R0g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22460769/_MG_3360.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before his Senate confirmation hearing to be NASA administrator, Bill Nelson greets Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Nelson’s former colleague in the Senate and the first Republican to endorse Nelson’s nomination.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="POtBHt"&gt;The hearing came less than a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;NASA picked Elon Musk’s SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; to build the country’s first human lunar lander since 1972, one of the most significant awards from the agency in years. The sole award was a surprise to many who expected NASA to pick two providers, either Blue Origin or Dynetics, who had also been developing rival landing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Samh18"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nelson: “Space is hard”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9Z17Rc"&gt;Asked by senators where Nelson stands on NASA’s commercial partnerships and the Artemis program — the Trump administration’s agenda to land humans on the Moon by 2024 — Nelson supported the program and the agency’s decision to award SpaceX a sole lunar lander contract to mature Starship for NASA’s first two missions to the Moon (one uncrewed, the other crewed). Based on what he read in the news about SpaceX’s award, he said, NASA still has a shot at getting to the moon by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttenBM"&gt;“I think you may be pleased that we’re gonna see that timetable try to be adhered to, but recognize that with some sobering reality that space is hard,” Nelson said. Without naming SpaceX, he said NASA’s current “awardee” for the lander means NASA should try to stick to its 2024 date, a goal set by then-Vice President Mike Pence in 2019 that has been widely viewed as unrealistic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44iCoo"&gt;That 2024 date wasn’t realistic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22323621/trump-moon-program-artemis-biden-nasa-timeline"&gt;Biden’s transition team found&lt;/a&gt;, because of funding shortfalls from Congress. But that was when NASA was still expected to pick two lunar lander providers&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Now with Starship as NASA’s initial ride to the Moon, which came at a price far lower than SpaceX’s rivals, agency officials might publicly stick with the 2024 goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45bR7G"&gt;Nelson’s support for the sole-source selection seemed reserved only for the initial phase of NASA’s human landing system program. NASA plans to invite more companies to compete for future lunar lander contracts. Asked if other elements of Artemis, like space suits, should be built by multiple companies instead of just one, Nelson said, “I do, senator. And competition is always better than sole-sourcing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajRaeW"&gt;Throughout the hearing, Nelson sprinkled praise for Jim Bridenstine, the former NASA chief whose past experience as a congressman proved crucial to rallying support for Trump’s Artemis program. Nelson railed against Bridenstine for being a politician during his confirmation hearing in 2018 but switched gears on Wednesday. “Jim had tremendous success in growing political and public support for NASA, particularly around the Artemis program,” Nelson said in written testimony. “If confirmed, I look forward to continuing to work with him and will seek his advice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k6RJ6H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think he has all the tools necessary to be a great NASA administrator.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8UgVqE"&gt;The Senate Commerce Committee is slated to vote on sending Nelson’s nomination to the Senate on April 28th, and it’s all but certain he’ll clinch confirmation.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Wednesday’s hearing was a “total love fest,” one NASA source said, echoing characterizations made on Twitter. “I think you are seeing exactly why Joe nominated him.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9umeY"&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; Bridenstine said he expects that Nelson “will sail through the confirmation process,” given his support among Republican senators. “If there are members of the Senate who are considering not supporting him, I am very happy to say I think that’s a mistake. I think he has all the tools necessary to be a great NASA administrator,” Bridenstine said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiSOzO"&gt;Republican Sens. Ted Cruz, who held up two of Biden’s nominees in March, and Rick Scott, who defeated Nelson in his 2018 reelection bid, made the bipartisan vibes clear at the end of the hearing. Scott said, “It’s nice to see a Floridian nominated for NASA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPjH8K"&gt;Cruz, smiling, said to Nelson: “There are not many Biden nominees about whom I am enthusiastic, and your nomination is a notable exception to that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Congress is diving into the App Store fight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rw1jktUqu509TLPu7lluKOhSU4E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166179/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s App Store was in the hot seat of Wednesday’s hearing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="CxLVIP"&gt;For years, tech companies like Facebook and Amazon have faced the brunt of antitrust criticism by Congress, and Apple has gotten far fewer questions. But that changed on Wednesday, when Congress finally sunk its teeth into Apple as part of a hearing titled “&lt;a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/antitrust-applied-examining-competition-in-app-stores"&gt;Antitrust Applied: Examining Competition in App Stores&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUPicq"&gt;The hearing brought in representatives from companies like Spotify, Tile, and Match Group, a dating app company, to explain how Apple’s App Store fees and walled-garden business strategy harms their companies. All three companies gave harsh testimony, accusing the iPhone-maker of anti-competitive behavior over the burdensome fees it charges some app developers on its App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="azEotX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If Apple turned on us, it can turn on anyone.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EJuIjq"&gt;The timing couldn’t be worse for Apple, coming just a day after the company announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;an iPhone-linked item tracker&lt;/a&gt; called the AirTag in direct competition with Tile. Speaking to Congress, Tile’s General Counsel Kirsten Daru said that once Apple decided to develop its own item-tracking devices and services in 2019, the two companies’ friendly relationship dissolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsTAHu"&gt;“If Apple turned on us, it can turn on anyone,” Daru told lawmakers. “And Apple has demonstrated that it won’t change unless someone makes them, making legislation so critical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2St8f"&gt;Apple’s shifting platform relationships were a theme in the hearing, with each company testifying to how quickly Cupertino’s collaborative outreach could turn competitive. Match’s Chief Legal Officer Jared Sine told lawmakers that app store fees amount to the company’s single largest expense, totaling around a fifth of the company’s total sales. Spotify’s Head of Global Affairs and Chief Legal Officer Horacio Gutierrez said that Apple’s business model equated to “a classic bait and switch,” luring developers into its app store and suddenly changing the terms to benefit the iPhone-maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qe8U0"&gt;“We all appreciate app stores and the roles that Apple and Google have played in helping to create many of the technologies that have defined our age,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar, chair of the subcommittee, said on Wednesday. “We’re not angry about success... It’s about new products coming on. It’s about new competitors emerging. This situation, to me, doesn’t seem like that’s happening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6GEOwR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IT MEANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pyU24Q"&gt;Sen. Klobuchar, who chairs the committee, is using these hearings to build support for her Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Act, which &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/2/senator-klobuchar-introduces-sweeping-bill-to-promote-competition-and-improve-antitrust-enforcement"&gt;she introduced in February&lt;/a&gt;. The bill’s provisions don’t line up perfectly with the App Store problem, but there are a few key provisions that would make it easier for companies like Tile to push back against Apple. In particular, the bill would make it less difficult for law enforcement to bring cases against tech companies for engaging in “exclusionary” conduct, something Sen. Klobuchar has been eager to highlight in interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0S7kA"&gt;“I don’t think people realize there’s this 15 to 30 percent tax on major companies people enjoy getting music from, like Spotify, that Apple or Google assesses, that there’s all this exclusionary conduct going on,” Klobuchar &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/senate-targets-apples-tight-app-store-reins-19bee492-bf13-4112-b3de-b0baeeb81b8f.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6GKPtd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They are fighting so hard because it’s core to the maintenance of their monopoly”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kqu77n"&gt;For the most part, the companies giving testimony seemed happy to agree. Throughout the hearing, all three representatives argued that legislation is necessary for companies like Apple to change their behavior. But Spotify and Tile argued that the committee should also look into proposing federal legislation specifically targeting app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZxDjp"&gt;“We respectfully request that some consideration be given to app stores right now,” Tile’s Daru said in light of discussion over Klobuchar’s larger bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyAQy4"&gt;Outside of federal legislation, states like Arizona have introduced their own measures to make developer-friendly changes to Google and Apple’s app stores. Many of these bills, like Arizona’s, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22357121/arizona-hb2005-app-store-bill-dead-apple-google-big-tech-lobbying"&gt;have failed following intense lobbying&lt;/a&gt; efforts by tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbI3M2"&gt;“They are fighting so hard because it’s core to the maintenance of their monopoly,” Sine said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8SL72e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE HIGHLIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="K79ERn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346828/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-biden-nomination-facebook-google-doj-garland"&gt;Biden’s nominee&lt;/a&gt; to be the next Democrat on the Federal Trade Commission is also ready to turn up the heat on the App Store. At Lina Khan’s &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/4/nomination-hearing"&gt;confirmation hearing&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, Klobuchar asked Khan about the power companies like Apple and Google have in regards to their app stores:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hcnZF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khan: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s really the source of the power. Basically, there’s two main options so that gives these companies the power to really set the term in this market in some cases. I think you’re absolutely right that certain terms and conditions really lack any type of beneficial justifications. So, I think in those cases we need to be especially skeptical and really look closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O3cXgJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT’S NEXT? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M4e0Mv"&gt;Earlier this year, Klobuchar said that the committee would hold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338763/facebook-google-antitrust-cicilline-ftc-slaughter-monopoly"&gt;a series of hearings&lt;/a&gt; aimed at competition in the tech sector, including Facebook and Google’s dominance in the ad market. The hearings have yet to be scheduled. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyundai stops making the Kona EV for South Korea after battery recall</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6a3MIM"&gt;Hyundai is discontinuing its first mass-market electric SUV, the Kona EV, in South Korea following a massive recall due to a fire risk in the battery pack, the &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210421006400320"&gt;Yonhap news agency reports&lt;/a&gt;. The automaker will instead turn its focus to the forthcoming Ioniq 5 (and the EVs that will follow it), though Hyundai will still sell the Kona EV in the United States, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/hyundai-kona-electric-discontinued-battery-fire-recalls/?PostType=link&amp;amp;TheTime=2021-04-21T20%3A06%3A46&amp;amp;ftag=COS-05-10aaa0b&amp;amp;UniqueID=19DEE852-A2DD-11EB-B8AB-C34416F31EAE&amp;amp;ServiceType=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roadshow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mg2tuB"&gt;More than a dozen reports of fires in Kona EV battery packs have been documented since 2019, and so this February, Hyundai finally decided to spend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299121/hyundai-kona-electric-recall-battery-fire-lg"&gt;nearly $1 billion to recall 76,000 Kona EVs across its home country&lt;/a&gt; (though &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/03/04/hyundai-profit-electric-car-recall-lg-chem/"&gt;battery supplier LG Chem is contributing a big portion&lt;/a&gt;). It also recalled some Ioniq sedans and electric buses that used the same battery technology. Sales of the Kona EV &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/hyundai-kona-electric-discontinued-battery-fire-recalls/?PostType=link&amp;amp;TheTime=2021-04-21T20%3A06%3A46&amp;amp;ftag=COS-05-10aaa0b&amp;amp;UniqueID=19DEE852-A2DD-11EB-B8AB-C34416F31EAE&amp;amp;ServiceType=twitter"&gt;dropped dramatically following the recall&lt;/a&gt;, and some owners have said the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hyundai-motor-electric-recall/kona-ev-owners-say-hyundai-mishandling-recall-for-battery-fires-idUSKBN2BG3ET"&gt;process of getting the battery replaced has been a mess&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFSBjt"&gt;Hyundai &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2019/HYUNDAI/KONA%252520ELECTRIC#recalls"&gt;officially started the recall process&lt;/a&gt; for the Kona EV in the US in March, and the company has been notifying owners since early April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B14TYM"&gt;One reason Hyundai is still exporting Kona EVs to places like the US is that, just before the original recall in February, it announced &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2022-hyundai-kona-electric-ev-suv-new-look-tech/"&gt;a refreshed version of the electric SUV with a facelift and various tech upgrades&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also still one of the more affordable electric vehicles on the market in North America that has more than 250 miles of range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m547yw"&gt;“There are certainly no plans to discontinue the Kona EV in the U.S. market. It is an extremely important product for Hyundai in the U.S. In fact, we recently heavily invested in a mid-cycle enhancement to Kona EV that makes our small CUV even more appealing,” a spokesperson for Hyundai North America said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re also expanding availability into even more states as EV vehicle adoption becomes more widespread. Hyundai has proactively addressed two potential Kona EV safety issues with voluntary recalls.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Call of Duty: Warzone now has 100 million players — as does Apex Legends</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lnZNYq"&gt;In the battle royale of battle royale games, there doesn’t need to be a single winner. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; now has 100 million players, the same number &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;achieved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382560/apex-legends-100-million-players-respawn-ea"&gt;just a week ago&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2KMFl"&gt;They can share a victory royale with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite, &lt;/em&gt;with its 350 million-plus players (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249497/fortnite-350-million-registered-players-hours-played-april"&gt;as of May 2020&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the original &lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds,&lt;/em&gt; which has sold north of &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/pubg-sales"&gt;70 million copies on console and PC&lt;/a&gt;, and its free-to-play &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; variant &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pubg-mobile-five-billion-revenue"&gt;reportedly raked in $5 billion last year&lt;/a&gt; ($7.4 million per day). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hzDBUA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;100 million players and counting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you all for dropping in. It wouldn't be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Warzone&lt;/a&gt; without you. &lt;a href="https://t.co/knanptnCMU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/knanptnCMU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Call of Duty ☢️ (@CallofDuty) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1384582733830176769?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p id="Jf722F"&gt;If you’re counting, &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; is growing faster than &lt;em&gt;Apex&lt;/em&gt;, though. It took two years for &lt;em&gt;Apex&lt;/em&gt; to hit 100 million, but it’s been just over a year since &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;’s March 2020 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNGHE2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;will kick off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391634/apex-legends-mobile-beta"&gt;a beta for its own mobile game&lt;/a&gt; later this month, as well as jumping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323591/apex-legends-switch-port-cross-progression-purchases-fortnite"&gt;onto the Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple targeted in $50 million ransomware attack resulting in unprecedented schematic leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LBYgVBc3Ek8Dec1w5qjVOtYcv8g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165959/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ApmGF9"&gt;Apple has been targeted in a $50 million ransomware attack following the theft of a trove of engineering and manufacturing schematics of current and future products from Quanta, a Taiwan-based company that manufactures MacBooks and other products for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJXze0"&gt;The leak, &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/ransomware-gang-tries-to-extort-apple-hours-ahead-of-spring-loaded-event/"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was carried out by REvil, a Russian hacking group that’s also known by the name Sodinokibi. The group had already begun posting the stolen images on April 20th, timed specifically to coincide with Apple’s latest “Spring Loaded” event, after Quanta refused to pay the $50 million ransom for the data. The group is now hoping to get Apple itself to pay up by May 1st, promising to continue to post new images from the leak daily until it does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsdD19"&gt;Quanta has confirmed that its servers were breached &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-21/apple-targeted-in-50-million-ransomware-hack-of-supplier-quanta"&gt;in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, commenting: “Quanta Computer’s information security team has worked with external IT experts in response to cyber attacks on a small number of Quanta servers.” Quanta also says “there’s no material impact on the company’s business operation” as a result of the hack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1jVkRa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The documents appear to be accurate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="knvHRM"&gt;REvil has a history of similar ransomware attacks, &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt; points out, with the group also carrying out similar hacks on &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/computer-giant-acer-hit-by-50-million-ransomware-attack/"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/leading-cosmetics-group-pierre-fabre-hit-with-25-million-ransomware-attack/"&gt;other companies&lt;/a&gt; in the past several months. But the Quanta attack — by virtue of its connection to Apple and the potential to reveal unannounced Apple hardware — marks the group’s highest-profile target yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7QZvI"&gt;The company hasn’t clarified the extent of the leak yet, but images leaked by REvil so far include schematics for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Apple’s just-revealed iMac redesign&lt;/a&gt; — which, prior to yesterday, hadn’t been seen by anyone outside of Apple’s sphere of influence, lending credence to the fact that the documents are indeed accurate. The schematics also include warnings on nearly every page: “This is the property of Apple and it must be returned,” and they specify that the documents are not to be reproduced, copied, or published. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oA7P5h"&gt;Also contained within the revealed files are manufacturing diagrams for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s already-released 2020 M1 MacBook Air refresh&lt;/a&gt; and an as-yet-unreleased laptop that features additional ports in line with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;existing rumors for the upcoming laptop refresh&lt;/a&gt; from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEGHhr"&gt;These documents were stolen and are being leaked to extort Apple and Quanta. Due to the nature of their origin, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/12/7384871/why-were-reporting-on-sony-leak-hack-ethics-mpaa"&gt;we believe it would be unethical&lt;/a&gt; to extensively report on their contents. We’ve reached out to Apple for comment and will update this post with any new information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brydge’s new keyboard for the M1 iPad makes it more MacBook-like than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KLmXH6d9BXFWlQZZxe4MTGLxlcA=/55x0:1045x660/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165808/BRY_129_MAX_Plus_filler_01.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6W9KkO"&gt;Brydge is announcing a keyboard and trackpad accessory for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/21/brydge-unveils-new-max-keyboard-trackpad-combo-for-12-9-inch-ipad-pro/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"&gt;the company’s previous accessories&lt;/a&gt;, the Brydge 12.9 Max Plus will let you take your iPad from being a tablet to a laptop, just by connecting it to the accessory. With Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;new M1-powered iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, some might already be thinking about using it to make a MacBook replacement, while others may just be excited for the way you can now neatly attach it via magnets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qznUJg"&gt;The answer to whether this will help replace your MacBook with an iPad is more or less &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22391979/apple-ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air-2021-anouncement"&gt;what it’s always been&lt;/a&gt;: it depends on whether you can do all your work with what’s available on iPadOS. The iPad Pro has been more powerful than a lot of MacBooks for years, but hardware is only part of the equation. While the 12.9-inch iPad Pro may now have a processor as fast as a MacBook’s and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;a better screen&lt;/a&gt; to boot, it’s still using an OS that, for some, won’t be able to fully take advantage of those features. If you’re fine with the limitations of iPadOS, then the Brydge 12.9 Max Plus could be a new solution for taking the iPad into laptop mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AddzH"&gt;The iPad will attach to the new Max Plus magnetically, instead of using the clamp system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"&gt;used by previous Brydge keyboards&lt;/a&gt;. That system required you to wedge your expensive tablet between clamps that then held onto that breakable glass — a nerve-wracking and not terribly pleasant experience. This brings Brydge’s offering more in line with the Magic Keyboard, and users will likely appreciate increased ease in switching between laptop and tablet mode. Easy, magnetic attachment is something that’s generally been associated with Apple’s iPad keyboards instead of third-party ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaE9AZ"&gt;While Brydge’s built-in trackpads have generally not compared favorably to Apple’s, the company is hoping to change that by adding native multitouch support. With the Max Plus, Brydge is also playing the size comparison game — its trackpad is the largest on an iPad keyboard, according to the company’s site. That may be a nice bonus if you’re the type of person who likes to use the mouse a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLuQap"&gt;The Brydge 12.9 Max Plus is available for preorder &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-12-9-max-plus%3Fvariant%3D39379780075625&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22396039%2Fbrydge-keyboard-magnetic-tablet-laptop-m1-ipad-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Brydge’s site&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s expected to ship in June. It comes in three color options (space gray, silver, and white) and costs $249.99 — $100 cheaper than &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJQJ3LL%2FA%2Fmagic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-11-inch-3rd-generation-and-ipad-air-4th-generation-us-english&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22396039%2Fbrydge-keyboard-magnetic-tablet-laptop-m1-ipad-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s ethical AI researchers complained of harassment long before Timnit Gebru’s firing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G0C3OTOYIsbqoozEDbopsQQ-9-g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165743/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="snJ16V"&gt;Google’s AI leadership came under fire in December when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;star ethics researcher Timnit Gebru was abruptly fired&lt;/a&gt; while working on a paper about the dangers of large language models. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-21/google-ethical-ai-group-s-turmoil-began-long-before-public-unraveling?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new reporting from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests the turmoil began long before her termination — and includes allegations of bias and sexual harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yOI63"&gt;Shortly after Gebru arrived at Google in 2018, she informed her boss that a colleague had been accused of sexual harassment at another organization. Katherine Heller, a Google researcher, reported the same incident, which included allegations of inappropriate touching. Google immediately opened an investigation into the man’s behavior. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; did not name the man accused of harassment, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; does not know his identity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXPKW9"&gt;The allegations coincided with an even more explosive story. Andy Rubin, the “father of Android” had received &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html"&gt;a $90 million exit package despite being credibly accused of sexual misconduct&lt;/a&gt;. The news sparked outrage at Google, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18057716/google-walkout-20-thousand-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai-meeting"&gt;20,000 employees walked out of work&lt;/a&gt; to protest the company’s handling of sexual harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeMChr"&gt;Gebru and Margaret Mitchell, co-lead of the ethical AI team, went to AI chief Jeff Dean with a “litany of concerns,” according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. They told Dean about the colleague who’d been accused of harassment, and said there was a perceived pattern of women being excluded and undermined on the research team. Some were given lower roles than men, despite having better qualifications. Mitchell also said she’d been denied a promotion due to “nebulous complaints to HR about her personality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NibrGh"&gt;Dean was skeptical about the harassment allegations but said he would investigate, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports. He pushed back on the idea that there was a pattern of women on the research team getting lower-level positions than men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RScxFP"&gt;After the meeting, Dean announced a new research project with the alleged harasser at the helm. Nine months later, the man was fired for “leadership issues,” according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. He’d been accused of misconduct at Google, although the investigation was still ongoing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Fa13m"&gt;After the man was fired, he threatened to sue Google. The legal team told employees who’d spoken out about his conduct that they might hear from the man’s lawyers. The company was “vague” about whether it would defend the whistleblowers, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zH0njI"&gt;The harassment allegation was not an isolated incident. Gebru and her co-workers reported additional claims of inappropriate behavior and bullying after the initial accusation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63n3hk"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Google spokesperson said: “We investigate any allegations and take firm action against employees who violate our clear workplace policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7e4eXF"&gt;Gebru said there were also ongoing issues with getting Google to respect the ethical AI team’s work. When she tried to look into a dataset released by Google’s self-driving car company Waymo, the project became mired in “legal haggling.” Gebru wanted to explore how skin tone impacted Waymo’s pedestrian-detection technology. “Waymo employees peppered the team with inquiries, including why they were interested in skin color and what they were planning to do with the results,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZMeUy"&gt;After Gebru went public about her firing, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309962/timnit-gebru-google-harassment-campaign-jeff-dean"&gt;she received an onslaught of harassment&lt;/a&gt; from people who claimed that she was trying to get attention and play the victim. The latest news further validates her response that the issues she raised were part of a pattern of alleged bias on the research team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="72sc8C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 21st, 6:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article updated with statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NFL RedZone is coming to Hulu’s live TV service in time for the 2021 season</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rah4qH"&gt;NFL fans will have another place they can watch NFL RedZone and the NFL Network next season, as both channels are coming to the Hulu with Live TV plan &lt;a href="https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/NFL-Media-and-Hulu-Reach-Carriage-Agreement.aspx"&gt;by August 1st&lt;/a&gt;. NFL Network will be included in the base package, while NFL RedZone will be offered at an additional cost, Hulu tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDLaEW"&gt;Hulu isn’t the only streaming service where you can get the NFL channels, as they are also available on YouTube TV, Sling, and fuboTV. And similarly, only NFL Network is part of the base subscriptions for these services — you’ll have to pay for sports-focused add-ons to get access to NFL RedZone. But if Hulu with Live TV is your preferred live TV streaming service, now you don’t have to go somewhere else to get your NFL channel fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgY8zS"&gt;The NFL’s deal with Hulu comes weeks after the league signed new streaming deals &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339636/nfl-streaming-deals-amazon-peacock-paramount-tubi-espn-plus"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;, which included Amazon getting exclusive rights to &lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt; starting with the 2023 season. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Microsoft Classroom Pen 2 is an affordable Surface Pen for students</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vdDhDLubfo02J6AnGhbWEIosAnM=/67x0:787x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165390/Picture1.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iGOAiA"&gt;Microsoft is releasing a new stylus for classroom use: the Classroom Pen 2. The pen will be available on April 27th and will be sold directly to schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NMCWq"&gt;The company launched its first &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-launches-40-classroom-pen-for-students"&gt;Classroom Pen&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. That stylus sold for $39.99 per unit. It was compatible with any device that supported the MPP protocol (including a number of non-Surface Windows devices). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3Wg5D"&gt;Microsoft is going even more budget with this release. The Pen 2 will be sold to schools in packs of 20 for $399.80, which works out to $19.99 per pen. Per &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2021/04/21/best-in-class-microsoft-classroom-pen-2-empowers-every-student-to-achieve-more/"&gt;Microsoft’s blog post&lt;/a&gt;, however, it seems like this pen may only be optimized for Microsoft’s own Surface Pro and Surface Go devices — other Windows devices aren’t mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CfDLkd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p_j3aPr_y6k?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mclcpW"&gt;Microsoft claims that the device has an “improved design” from the &lt;a href="https://www.connection.com/product/microsoft-surface-classroom-pen-20-pack-black/nwh-00001/36623795"&gt;previous model&lt;/a&gt;, though the announcement doesn’t share many specifics. It looks like the Pen 2 is a different color and has a pen clip to attach to a Surface Type Cover. The company also says the new device has a longer enclosure “to optimize for grip strength.” Sure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIpvxC"&gt;Like its predecessor, the Pen 2 appears to have two buttons. It also shares some classroom-specific features with the Classroom Pen: it ships with replacement tips and has a slot that teachers can loop a string through to tether the pen to a Surface device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3izap"&gt;The release is part of Microsoft’s long-standing push to challenge Chromebooks in the education sphere. (Those devices had their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22256873/chromebook-best-year-ever-double-yearly-sales"&gt;best year ever&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, as many students around the world began attending class from home.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="086Oju"&gt;Microsoft has worked with partners like Acer, Dell, and Lenovo to release dozens of &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Feducation%2Fdevices%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sub-$500 Windows PCs&lt;/a&gt; in the past few years, alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18192906/microsoft-classroom-pen-chromebook-challenge-devices-2019"&gt;updates to Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt; that are tailored to classroom use. Stylus support can be a must-have for students who want to draw graphs and take notes on their laptops, and widely distributing Surface Pens could certainly save teachers some paper and ink. And if you’re an average Joe like me who just really wants to play around with a $20 stylus, it’s time to make friends with some neighborhood teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
