    <title>The Book of Boba Fett’s first trailer teases the spinoff fans have been waiting for</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idqoBPPQ0ndehgnSQlsgLCsmbOM=/713x0:3128x1610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074250/06_Boba_Fett_trailer_stills_uhd_t_r709_211010.088651.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GAj0WH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; just got its first trailer ahead of its debut on Disney Plus on December 29th, giving an initial look at the upcoming spinoff for the galaxy’s most infamous bounty hunter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5Tcjl"&gt;The spinoff has been a long time coming: Boba Fett has long been one of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars’&lt;/em&gt; most popular characters since his introduction (in the otherwise reviled &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Holiday Special&lt;/em&gt;). He’s captured the imagination of fans with his action-figure-worthy costume and ice-cold demeanor in &lt;em&gt;The Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Return of the Jedi&lt;/em&gt;, despite scant minutes of screentime and just four lines of dialogue across the two films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDDypX"&gt;Fett’s character was later expounded upon in subsequent &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; novels, an introductory backstory in the prequels, and eventually, the entire genesis of the fan-favorite Mandalorian culture that’s in turn lead to &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; series. And while there have been rumors for years that Disney was planning to give Boba Fett his own film spinoff, it wasn’t until a post-credit reveal following &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s second season that the news of the bounty hunter finally getting top billing was revealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mlfof8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; is set just after that post credit scene, which saw Fett (Temuera Morrison) — aided by fellow bounty hunter Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen) — killing Bib Fortuna and reclaiming the palace and territory once held by Jabba the Hutt. The new series appears to follow Fett’s efforts to bring some order to the former crime lord’s holding — presumably without &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; many disintegrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7KrGr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; is also just the first of several planned &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; spinoffs that Disney has in the works for Disney Plus; the company is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168619/disney-plus-star-wars-rangers-of-the-new-republic-ahsoka-mandalorian-spinoffs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ashoka &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Rangers of the New Republic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will cross over with the original series in the future in a “climactic story event.” That’s in addition to other &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; shows set to hit the streaming service in the future, including the&lt;em&gt; Rogue One&lt;/em&gt; prequel &lt;em&gt;Andor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Obi-Wan Kenobi&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lando&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Acolyte&lt;/em&gt;, and future seasons of &lt;em&gt;The Bad Batch&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can buy an orange Apple HomePod Mini now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KoAQwXDhfahOw3348hXpCyTavFo=/77x0:904x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074127/apple_minis.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s HomePod mini is now available in three new colors — orange, yellow, and blue — in addition to white and space gray. | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dctHY3"&gt;You can now &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/homepod-mini-is-available-in-bold-new-colors-starting-today/"&gt;buy Apple’s HomePod Mini in new colors&lt;/a&gt; yellow, orange, and blue (in addition to the standard white and space gray), and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod-mini/"&gt;the $99.99 devices&lt;/a&gt; are available for in-store pickup today. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22723141/apple-homepod-mini-new-colors-price-release-date-features"&gt;announced the new colors at its October Unleashed event&lt;/a&gt;, where it unveiled its new MacBook Pro models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEne8p"&gt;It’s also where Apple announced its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733053/apple-music-voice-plan-playlists-price-siri"&gt;Apple Music Voice&lt;/a&gt; subscription, a cheaper tier of its music streaming service that you access only via the Siri voice assistant, although there will be a limited app option; it arrives later this year for $4.99 per month and will work with the Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAis36"&gt;The new speakers will have the HomePod mini’s tinted touch surface, fabric mesh, volume icons, and power cable, along with color-matched details. Apple’s competitors already have more colorful options for their small home assistant speakers — Google has blue and orange versions of its Nest Mini speaker, and Amazon’s Echo Dot comes in blue and some animal-themed designs for kids— so it seemed like only a matter of time before Apple caught up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTbuG8"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod-mini/"&gt;order them from Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHomePod-mini-Space-Gray%2F159302133&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-homepod-mini-blue%2F5902427.p%3FskuId%3D5902427&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; with pick-ups available as soon as today and delivery dates available for this week, in Canada, Mexico, and the US. In China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan orders are also opening today, while availability is listed as “later this month” for Australia, Austria, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Luigi’s Mansion expansion sets join Lego’s Super Mario World collection</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Luigi’s Mansion Lego set" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KGMPU95XSPaz7BSEDRd31h-Thkk=/0x1:1440x961/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074187/lego_luigis_mansion_mario.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Lego&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qZC6Fe"&gt;Just months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393486/luigi-lego-super-mario-interactive-sets-nintendo-starter-course"&gt;Luigi joined Lego’s interactive Super Mario World collection&lt;/a&gt;, Lego has announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Faboutus%2Fnews%2F2021%2Foctober%2FLEGO-Super-Mario-Luigis-Mansion-Sets&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F1%2F22756073%2Fluigis-mansion-expansion-sets-legos-super-mario-world-collection" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion&lt;/em&gt; expansion sets&lt;/a&gt; that give the green-clad plumber the attention he deserves (via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-luigis-mansion-set-110023202.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). With the $30 Lab and Poltergust set, you can equip Luigi with a Poltergust and use it to capture the Gold Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vl6upD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YuGsLRNS5VI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NxUW2O"&gt;The $40 Mansion Entry set lets you step into a haunted mansion, where you’ll encounter Boo as you grab the Golden Bone for Polterpup. Finally, the $80 Haunt-and-Seek set offers an experience that’s just like the &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion&lt;/em&gt; game — build and wander through a series of rotating hallways filled with ghosts and hidden gems to find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2Xcrk"&gt;You can attach all three sets for the ultimate ghost-hunting experience, or use each one separately. And although Lego announced the &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion&lt;/em&gt; set on Halloween, it won’t hit the stores until January 1st, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DCp8f"&gt;Just keep in mind that Luigi actually isn’t included in any of these sets, so you’ll need a Luigi or Mario Starter Course to get started. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Building-Collectible-Creative/dp/B08YPBBRR5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Luigi Starter Course&lt;/a&gt; is currently $60, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Building-Interactive-Featuring/dp/B085878WLK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mario Starter Course&lt;/a&gt; is on sale right now for $47.99 on Amazon, down from $60. You can expect to spend $150 for the entire &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion&lt;/em&gt; set or a total of $210 if you decide to add the Luigi Starter Course.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beats announces Fit Pro earbuds with wing tip design and $200 price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ocF-gwmGtLrClQFPhiePrHWRSns=/0x39:1419x985/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074042/_BeatsFitPro_4FAM_Lifestyle_0036_WEB_v4.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Beats&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WaG4LB"&gt;Beats today announced its latest wireless earbuds, the $199.99 Beats Fit Pro. The new product slots into the Apple-owned brand’s lineup between the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review"&gt;Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt;, which were released earlier this year, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price"&gt;Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21181088/beats-powerbeats-4-2020-review-wireless-earbuds-fitness-specs-price"&gt;Powerbeats&lt;/a&gt;. The Fit Pros have active noise cancellation, IPX4 water and sweat resistance, and up to seven hours of continuous playback (or 30 hours of total listening when you include case recharges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpgqYB"&gt;The most noticeable thing about the new earbuds are the wing tips that are a permanent part of their design. Beats says it did a ton of research and user testing to land on the right material and level of flexibility. The wing tips are intended to help the Fit Pros stay locked in your ears no matter how strenuous your workout routine might be.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8nmQN76TlgSQxMzVwRK0kdTCUE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22975264/file.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Beats&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro earbuds have flexible, removable wing tips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tidHHI"&gt;Unlike the Studio Buds, which lacked Apple’s usual silicon inside, the Fit Pro buds include the H1 chip and thus come with the entire suite of features like one-step pairing, automatic syncing across your iCloud devices, auto switching between Apple hardware products, and more. They also include dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, and Beats even integrated the brand-new skin detect sensor that only just debuted on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;third-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHlMY1"&gt;The noise cancellation system is essentially the same as what’s on the AirPods Pro, so it should prove rather effective at quieting the outside world. When ANC and transparency mode are both off, the Fit Pro buds still use Apple’s Adaptive EQ to optimize audio performance based on your particular ear shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIOOFO"&gt;Beats will offer the Fit Pro earbuds in four colors: black, white, gray, and purple / pink. Preorders start today and they ship on November 5th. You don’t need to wait long to read the verdict on the latest Beats buds: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22517199"&gt;I’ve been testing them for several days now&lt;/a&gt; and have found that they’re the company’s best, most focused product since the Powerbeats Pro. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beats Fit Pro review: sporty AirPod Pros with better sound</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The latest Beats earbuds are the company’s best product since the Powerbeats Pro&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="nDxaBa"&gt;Beats has been busy. After releasing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review"&gt;Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, today the Apple-owned brand is back with the more premium Beats Fit Pro wireless earbuds. It’s unusual to see two completely new products from Beats in a single year, but perhaps the company is trying to make a point that it’s not idly sitting by and playing second fiddle to Apple’s AirPods and AirPods Pro. If anything, the $200 Fit Pros demonstrate that Beats has found its focus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O44goa"&gt;The Fit Pros are a wonderfully designed pair of earbuds that integrate the best of Apple tech. They’ve got active noise cancellation that’s on par with the AirPods Pro. The same spatial audio with dynamic head tracking. The same Adaptive EQ. They even have the brand-new skin detect sensor that only just debuted in the third-generation AirPods. There’ve been many questions about where Beats fits into Apple’s long-term plans, and while a single product can’t really provide an answer to that, the Fit Pros are solid evidence that this brand isn’t being pushed to the wayside anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8cPj7p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10835161"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VQ9YjT"&gt;When I reviewed the Studio Buds, I praised their ambition and Beats’ attempt to cater to Android users as much as iPhone owners. But despite their great comfort, good sound, and compact design, those earbuds had some key missing features and fell a bit flat on execution. Not so with the Beats Fit Pros. They’re exactly what you’d want them to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXEoWH"&gt;These are the best earbuds Beats has ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ro362AyFIV-Gne_F-Aom3OwEGKQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973215/DSCF6033_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro earbuds have a permanent wing tip as part of their design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9iFJoD"&gt;As Beats explains it, the Fit Pros are meant to fill a gap in its lineup between the Studio Buds and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21181088/beats-powerbeats-4-2020-review-wireless-earbuds-fitness-specs-price"&gt;Powerbeats&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price"&gt;Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Their wing tips make them more gym-ready than the Studio Buds, but they don’t go as far as including the Powerbeats’ signature hooks that wrap around your ears. I have marathon runner friends who swear by the ear hooks and say nothing comes close to that stability for vigorous activity. But Beats thinks it has found a great alternative with the Fit Pros — all in a design that’s much more compact, lightweight, and comfortable than the Powerbeats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8gtNz"&gt;The Fit Pros come in a case that’s basically a miniaturized version of the Powerbeats Pro case. Just as with those, there’s no wireless charging — a very frustrating omission at this price — but the case at least uses USB-C instead of Lightning. A longstanding gripe with the Powerbeats Pro is they can be finicky with charging unless you place them in the case just right. Their ear hooks make it easy to get this wrong, and on many occasions I’ve gone to use them only to find one earbud fully charged and the other completely drained. I’m happy to say this isn’t something you need to fret about with the Fit Pros: each earbud drops into its cradle with a reassuring magnetic pull and I’ve experienced zero charging mishaps. The lid has a little more play than I’d like, but I can be nitpicky about that sort of thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="we1gy2"&gt;As for the buds themselves, they’ve got a unique look thanks to their permanent, curved wing tips. Beats is selling them in black, gray, white, and a pinkish purple. The gray and purple have gotten the best feedback among &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff. At 5.6 grams per earbud, they weigh in slightly heavier than the AirPods Pro but lighter than some fitness-geared buds like the Jaybird Vista 2s. The new Jabra Elite 7 Active buds are a hair lighter at 5.5 grams. Regardless, the Beats are extremely comfortable and also have microventing to alleviate ear pressure buildup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5cfhDDBbzE9rbvau1NyEFEQBC4c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973216/DSCF6032_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;They’re designed for a secure, stable fit during active use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BfmCQi"&gt;Beats is very proud of how much it crammed into the Fit Pros, which have the company’s smallest enclosure yet — not counting the wing tips, obviously. They contain 30 percent more components than the Studio Buds and the transducer is 15 percent larger. Three sizes of silicone ear tips come in the box, along with a short USB-C cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwNfcA"&gt;But what about those wing tips? They’re meant to help the earbuds stay put. But I’ve found that on some earbuds, like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMKgWMO3fu8"&gt;the second-gen Pixel Buds&lt;/a&gt;, these wing tips and numbs can cause discomfort the longer you wear them, so there’s definitely a risk in Beats making them a permanent part of the design. But the company says it sweated the details over the wing’s shape and material. And after several days spent testing the Fit Pros — often for several hours at a time — I haven’t noticed any soreness. The wing tip is flexible and pliable enough that it doesn’t press into the concha of your ear in an annoying way. You’ll feel it there during extended listening, don’t get me wrong, but at most it produces a little itchiness instead of more serious irritation. And you can alleviate that just by adjusting the earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rqULYd7Vneck60NRlyx1aucD5Hc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973267/DSCF6021_Edited_2.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The charging case disappointingly lacks wireless charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Syd1jUW8K0nbniLo10_UbyMk_2o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973219/DSCF6026_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;But it’s much smaller and more pocketable than the Powerbeats Pro case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S5XkUB"&gt;Beats says it designed the wing tips for “every ear imaginable,” but ears are all different, and there will always be exceptions. That said, I let several people try the Fit Pros and even those with small ears could find a way to make the wing tip work for them and said it resulted in a more steady overall fit. They passed the gym test and didn’t come even slightly loose during high intensity runs. They also stayed in while eating, something that’s a challenge for many earbuds. The Fit Pros are rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance, which is adequate for workout purposes, but below the IP57 of Jabra’s latest active buds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbL4uu"&gt;Like the Studio Buds, these have a nice and clicky “b” button on each earbud with the usual control scheme: press once to play / pause / answer call, twice to skip to the next track, and three times to go back. But there’s one interesting tidbit: for the first time, you can remap a long press to adjust volume instead of toggling noise cancellation or summoning Siri. This can be done right in the iOS settings menu and is something that the AirPods Pro can’t do, nor can the Beats Studio Buds. I like having the option, even if I ended up sticking with the defaults. Bring that remapping capability to your other earbuds, Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88pUIZ"&gt;Beats has outfitted its latest earbuds with 9.5mm drivers, and they produce very satisfying sound quality that I’d rank above the AirPods Pro. This isn’t the bloated bass Beats of old: the company shed that reputation quite a long time ago. The Fit Pro buds might have slightly less overall boom and oomph than the Powerbeats Pros, in fact, but switching back and forth between the two, it was close — and I preferred the more refined sound of the newer buds. If there’s one weakness I’ve noticed, it’s maximum volume. The Fit Pros seem to have a lower volume ceiling than some of their competitors, so if you tend to crank things up for motivation during a run or fitness routine, you might be underwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ptNyqVVjvt3IM3On3kkY-q2tLvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973260/DSCF6027_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fit Pros also come in black or white.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I5DKkh"&gt;Unlike the Studio Buds, which didn’t have Apple’s usual earbud chipset inside, the Fit Pros have the H1 and all the features that come along with that. The main benefits are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SUW64G"&gt;Dynamic head tracking for spatial audio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7PiN2B"&gt;Automatic device switching between iPhone, iPad, and Mac&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ks3YKH"&gt;Automatic syncing with all of your iCloud devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JVHpWj"&gt;Audio sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="B1kp8M"&gt;Find My integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ek848h"&gt;Hands-free “Hey Siri” voice commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JFeJdA"&gt;Beats notes that a lot of other functionality — ANC, transparency mode, one-step setup, Apple Music spatial audio (minus head tracking) — works just as well on Android as on iOS. You’ll need the Beats app for some things like control customization and more detailed battery status. The Studio Buds supported Android’s native Fast Pair feature, but the Fit Pros do not. That’s not surprising considering there’s once again Apple silicon inside. But it means that there’s an extra layer of seamlessness when using the Fit Pros within Apple’s ecosystem. You can get most of the way there on Android, but not quite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LodQQX"&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the Fit Pros essentially have the same noise cancellation system as the AirPods Pro — also powered by the H1 chip. Performance between the two is more or less identical, and transparency mode sounds natural here in the same way it does on the Pros (with the same sound effects as you switch between modes). When ANC is off, Beats refers to this as “Adaptive EQ” mode. That’s where you’ll get the best battery life: seven hours of continuous playback and up to 30 hours including case recharges. Using ANC or transparency drops those figures to six hours and 27 hours, respectively, so you’re not losing much no matter how you’re using the buds. Beats says you’ll get an hour of playback (with ANC) from a quick five-minute top off, and fully recharging both earbuds and the case takes around 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GwSNeI81-knRJSxigKLlbqVaLcY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973283/DSCF6031.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wing tips rarely cause any discomfort.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zeFH6b"&gt;The Fit Pro buds also include Apple’s new skin detect sensor, first seen in the latest AirPods, for more accurate automatic play / pause when removed from your ears. This sensor can tell the difference between skin and other tight confines like pant pockets, so the earbuds are less likely to resume playing when you don’t want them to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0axW5"&gt;Voice call performance is quite good but falls short of the AirPods. If you’re wearing one of the earbuds alone, three mics are used for voice calls. When both earbuds are in use, the voice system leverages five mics. The Fit Pros utilize beamforming mics and voice detection algorithms to help isolate your voice from background commotion. My co-workers heard me loud and clear on Zoom calls, and people I chatted with on the phone said I sounded fine, if slightly less pronounced as when using the AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="8auFU5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10838399"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ggRvHJ"&gt;The Fit Pros successfully thread the needle between everyday and fitness-focused earbuds. They’re objectively a better choice than the AirPods Pro for workouts and running, and they handle more casual listening equally as well. They improve upon the lackluster noise cancellation that dragged down the Studio Buds, and they restore Apple’s full arsenal of ecosystem tricks. They also bring back features that Beats left out last time like in-ear detection. Making wing tips part of the core design was a gamble, and there will no doubt be cases where that decision causes issues for some people. All I can say is these are among the most comfortable wing tips I’ve ever had in my ears — and they succeed at their purpose of keeping the Fit Pros locked in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ink9Ul"&gt;If you already own a set of AirPods or bought the Studio Buds earlier this year, these aren’t a must have. But if you’ve been searching for something worthy of replacing your Powerbeats Pro, the Beats Fit Pro might just be the ticket. They’re the sporty AirPod Pros a lot of people have been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iPhone’s location tracking </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/leEXkTb0hpgtXR8qvSk-3L4t47o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69871891/akrales_190913_3628_0277.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TeBzxN"&gt;Your iPhone uses information from your cell service, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS to pinpoint its location, and since you almost always have your phone on you, your location as well. That information can be useful for a lot of things, such as letting others know where you are or finding your phone when it’s lost. Other times, it’s just more data that services and companies collect about you, creating privacy concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2rbnr"&gt;The good news is you can tighten your controls so that apps are only accessing your location when it’s necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGeN94"&gt;Toggling your location settings can differ from phone to phone, depending on what model of iPhone you have and what version of iOS it’s running. The following directions were tested on an iPhone 11 running iOS 15; if you’re running a different version of iOS, there shouldn’t be much difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nJYdGZ"&gt;Turn off location access for specific apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2bachq"&gt;Location data is useful for some apps (for example, if you want to order food) and necessary for others, like maps or ride-shares. However, if an app asks for your location and you don’t feel it needs the data, you can disable location services for that app. Here’s how to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="10QMkI"&gt;Open Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yjxmeM"&gt;Go to “Privacy” &amp;gt; “Location Services.”  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XXWXWw"&gt;“Location Services” will most likely be switched on. Unless you want to completely cut all location services off (see below), leave it alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qwmyHl"&gt;Scroll down to find a list of all the apps that enable location services. Each listing will show the app’s name and the type of permission it has: “Never,” “When Shared,” or “While Using.” “When Shared” refers to the option “Ask Next Time Or When I Share.” Meanwhile, “While Using” will usually mean “While using the App,” but it can sometimes also refer to “While Using the App or Widgets.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="APxPyw"&gt;If you want to change a specific app’s access to your location data, click on the app listing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can adjust location services for specific apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zSpH0kbFBBPq3Pdd52RfatmGL9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857412/IMG_13B4445EF110_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can adjust location services for specific apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="How you can allow location access depends on the app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BpBbvHInOumIiH0y2cORf5Nv3bw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857413/IMG_6D2F84330D37_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you can allow location access depends on the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0xJQiW"&gt;If you click “While Using the App,” then that app will have access to your location either when it’s open or when it’s in use in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4mvxq"&gt;For more ways to limit location access, click on “System Services” at the bottom of the “Location Services” screen. Here, you can toggle location access for a number of things, including Wi-Fi, time zone, emergency calls, and Apple News and App Store ads that are relevant to your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YugSqN"&gt;To the left of some of the service toggles, you may see a small arrow. A hollow arrow means the item may have access to your location under certain conditions; a purple arrow means the item has recently used your location, while a gray arrow means it used your location sometime in the last 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="For more ways to limit location access, click on “System Services.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1BI4ULPUOLpp4D6EXdpLY1UeSoU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857589/IMG_11AB5BCB37D6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more ways to limit location access, click on “System Services.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Arrows show which apps are accessing your location." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0NqNW6ZvUftQBR3XzifVQDNuOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857582/IMG_4283119948D6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arrows show which apps are accessing your location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f9PkYM"&gt;To check whether your phone is still collecting location data, go down to the very bottom of the “System Services” screen and toggle the switch on for “Status Bar Icon.” This will display an arrow at the top of your screen when an app on your phone is accessing your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvTXrC"&gt;If you want to truly go off the grid, you can disable location services to prevent your phone from collecting any location data at all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="r8HSiU"&gt;Open Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hknF2h"&gt;Go to “Privacy” &amp;gt; “Location Services.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4s36Y6"&gt;Toggle the “Location Services” switch to off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="affITu"&gt;You’ll get a notice telling you that, while Location Services will be disabled for all apps, it will temporarily come online if you use the “Find My iPhone” and report your phone lost. Select “Turn Off.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CcJJeH"&gt;If you have an iPhone 11 or later&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NSGXGW"&gt;If you have a phone designed with Apple’s U1 chip — such as an iPhone 11 or later — and have disabled location services for specific apps, you may find that you still sometimes see the arrow. According to Apple, this is because these models &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997338/apple-ultra-wideband-u1-chip-iphone-11-pro-location-data-request-privacy-issue"&gt;use ultra wideband technology&lt;/a&gt;, which Apple says is regulated, so the phones use location services to determine if they’re in an area where ultra wideband use is restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwciFf"&gt;The iPhone requests location data when location preferences are set on an app-per-app basis, so switching off location services for your phone overall will stop these location requests since your phone won’t be able to collect any location data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0BmHZV"&gt;Share your location with individuals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AvJ5VO"&gt;If you’re walking alone at night or you’re in an Uber by yourself, you might want a friend or family member to know your location in real time. If you have iOS 13 or later, you can use the Find My app to share your location with family and friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yd7T8R"&gt;Open “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qRKhHK"&gt;Go into “Privacy,” and make sure “Location Services” is switched on. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZS7j0A"&gt;Go back to the main “Settings” menu and tap on your name at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wO93M2"&gt;Select “Find My.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ADpOmK"&gt;Toggle “Share My Location” so that it’s on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aajRcv"&gt;Then go to the Find My app. If this is your first time using the app, it will ask you whether you want it to access your location. Choose either to “Allow While Using App,” “Allow Once,” or “Don’t Allow.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EP4LB6"&gt;You may get a screen explaining that “Find My” can be used with an AirTag or for AirPods, and that there are apps for the watchOS as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C2oZkD"&gt;On the map screen that appears, select “People” at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TJymR1"&gt;Click the button that says “Start Sharing Location.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="poO8DJ"&gt;In the “To:” field, type in either the phone number or name of your friend or family member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MMwj9E"&gt;If the person you select has a phone number that isn’t associated with an iPhone, you’ll be notified with a pop-up. (But you can still share your location.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v9RYlu"&gt;Tap “Send,” then select either “Share for One Hour,” “Share Until End of Day,” or “Share Indefinitely.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Find My app lets you share your location." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IoCeKInZlvEqdEYDXrfO3-0j4qs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857616/IMG_425BFDC7C40D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Find My app lets you share your location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Start Sharing Location” and choose whom you want to share it with." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FDV8vATBkeqsU6AiIwFDxv73JN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857538/IMG_80499A0AC888_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Start Sharing Location” and choose whom you want to share it with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OLskUW"&gt;It will then start sharing your location. In order to switch it off, click on your contact’s name in the “Find My” app under “People,” then tap “Stop Sharing My Location.” Confirm by clicking on the “Stop Sharing Location” button that pops up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaDFmh"&gt;(Note: For some reason, the “Share Until End of Day” selection seems to always select midnight Pacific Time rather than the end of day local time. For example, I’m on Eastern Time, and so “end of day” is always somewhere around 3AM. I’ve reached out to Apple to find out if they have a fix for this and will let you know if / when I hear back.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YX8aIT"&gt;Send recurring notifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="alLgD7"&gt;You can have your phone send out recurring notifications as well. These are useful if you want your friend or relative to know when a you get to a location (or don’t get there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4aqISQ"&gt;In the “Find My” app, tap the “People” tab at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ikQYZL"&gt;Select the person you want to send notifications to (it should be somebody you’re already sharing your location with).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Oj16lY"&gt;Scroll down until you see “Notifications” and tab “Add.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4QBnWx"&gt;A pop-up from the bottom will give you the option to notify that person. Select it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="TzQf1e"&gt;You can notify the person when you arrive at or leave a specific location, and send the notification just once or every time you arrive or leave (for example, if you want to let somebody know every day when you get home from work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KY2bKD"&gt;Share via Messages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uB02dt"&gt;You can share your location through Messages as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LrbY2N"&gt;Open a conversation in Messages. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VCb4XE"&gt;Tap on the contact name and then click “Info.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="25EDCT"&gt;This will give you the option to “Share My Location,” which will give you the option to “Share for One Hour,” “Share Until End of Day,” or “Share Indefinitely.” Click one of those to start sharing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ScUruo"&gt;If you want to stop sharing, click “Stop Sharing My Location” where “Share My Location” was. A button labeled “Stop Sharing My Location” will pop up. Click on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="KqQCyG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 17th, 2021, 10:15AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on December 12th, 2019, and has been updated to account for differences in iOS and in available services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="snbctc"&gt;November 1st has brought on a huge wave of great tech deals, perhaps as a sign of even greater things to come later in the month with Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Google has marked down many of its latest Nest smart home and audio devices to their all-time low prices, and generally, good deals can be had on a multitude of devices from other companies, including Eero, Sony, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6KSkJ"&gt;The most eye-popping deal of the day is on Google’s Nest Audio smart speaker. This cloth-covered device is Google’s latest model, and normally it costs $99.99. We’ve seen it drop by around $20 before, but this week’s $40 price drop is unprecedented. At $60, it outperforms other smart speakers in that price range, which normally includes devices like Amazon’s Echo Dot (fourth gen) and Google’s own Nest Mini when they aren’t on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woA6Az"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;My colleague Dan Seifert praised the Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt; for being a marked improvement over the original Google Home in every way. It touts improved audio quality, it’s faster at registering Google Assistant queries, and you can easily pair two of them together for stereo sound. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N3nOww"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503894"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DYp6Yc"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro that include a new MagSafe charging case were $30 off the original $249 price all of last week, and now the price has gotten better. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUupipgHTH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are offering them for $60 off the original price, currently sitting at $190. &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro%2F-%2FA-84852592%3Fpreselect%3D77603773%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDealRoundup11012021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; is now offering them for just $200. Mind you, that’s still a little pricey compared to the previous iteration’s usual price of around $180, which didn’t include the MagSafe compatibility. But, if you were holding steady until a discount brought them below the $200 mark, today might be the day you’ve been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UwyMEc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10826178"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Rzws1p"&gt;Continuing with Google’s streak of excellent deals, the second-generation Nest Hub that can offer sleep tracking by way of its Soli radar sensor is just $50, down from $100. This is the biggest price drop yet on the newer model, and like the Nest Audio, you can find this deal at a few retailers, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUtxztgIkl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-2nd-gen-smart-display%2F-%2FA-82678346%3Fpreselect%3D79796810%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeDealRoundup11012021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-2nd-Gen-Smart-Home-Display-with-Google-Assistant-Chalk%2F169438279&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDealRoundup11012021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvwPxl"&gt;The second-gen Nest Hub is just as good at serving as a digital photo frame as the first-gen model, thanks to its ambient display that’s always bright enough, yet never too bright. Its sleep tracking feature is interesting, and it works just about as well as a Fitbit Inspire HR, according to Dan Seifert’s findings &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6N7XWu"&gt;You just place it on your nightstand about an arm’s length or less away from your bed, and point the screen towards where you sleep. Its radar sensors are sensitive enough to track your breathing and movement, so the Nest Hub can tell when you’re moving, when you’ve fallen asleep, and when you’ve woken up. Its microphone records how often you cough and snore during the night, which might put an end to many spousal arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="u8JgSC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625445"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8vsnMN"&gt;Stay tuned for later in the day when we’ll post several more deals that Google is hosting this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbUDEB"&gt;If you’re into video chatting, Facebook’s 10-inch Portal smart display that can follow your movements with its Smart Camera feature is just $79, matching the price of the smaller &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Portal-Facebook-Hands-Free-Calling-Built-pc/dp/B07XY7HL93/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eight-inch Portal Mini&lt;/a&gt;. The Portal looks like a photo frame when it’s not in use, and you can also use it with apps like Zoom, Plex, Spotify, and more. In terms of smart assistants, it has Alexa integration. This Portal display has a switch on its top that lets you toggle its camera and microphone to off. It’s available at this price in white or black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3HTTlY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10594754"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6YTReK"&gt;Other deals you might be interested in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1BJqEz"&gt;Usually $400, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Facebook-Portal-Calling-Screen-Display/dp/B07XPDYRRJ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a two-pack of Eero Pro 6 tri-band mesh Wi-Fi routers&lt;/a&gt; with Zigbee are just $299 at Amazon (previous best deal was at $320). If you just want one of them, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085VNCZHL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $171&lt;/a&gt;, down from $229.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UtIZ6V"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Unlocked-256GB-Camera-Solor/dp/B08B9SGGRS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Motorola Edge is $400 at Amazon today&lt;/a&gt;. The phone released in 2020 and features a 6.7-inch OLED screen with a 90Hz refresh rate, the Snapdragon 765 chipset, 6GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. It’s compatible with all carriers via 4G and with 5G on T-Mobile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="P9MiR2"&gt;The excellent Logitech G502 Lightspeed wireless gaming mouse is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-PowerPlay-Compatible-Lightsync/dp/B07L4BM851?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to $100 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (originally $150). Despite having tested dozens of other mice since it released in 2019, I still think this is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt; you can buy if you have the money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1nguU3"&gt;Sony’s stellar WH-1000XM4 over-ear, wireless headphones are back down to their lowest price yet. You can snag them for $248 (originally $350) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUubRmTcIr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Illustrator Micha Huigen on creating a multifaceted collage for The Verge’s 10th anniversary</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XbReKXGxToV4GgBNl-zPrbrzCbo=/0x2937:2700x4737/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073984/background_2x.bfb428b2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Micha Huigen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XCwJXi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verg&lt;/em&gt;e is turning 10, and a look back at the last decade’s worth of stories provides not just an encapsulation of what &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has covered but also a snapshot of how quickly the tech that informs our lives transforms. And since we’re &lt;em&gt;The Verg&lt;/em&gt;e, we can’t just look behind us. Celebrating the last 10 years is also about examining what might come next. Micha Huigen is the perfect artist to distill this intersection into a single image because Micha’s images never actually confine themselves to one space. His surreal illustrations function like scenescapes within which we get to explore close-ups of tiny modular worlds and expansive reimagined realities at once. Though he inks and colors digitally, his art maintains an analog quality, filled with halftones that suggest DIY lithography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V34kVz"&gt;The 25 editorial illustrations, each of which represents one feature in our &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; 10 package, link together into a seamless infinite grid, filled with Easter eggs and precise linework that offer something new with each viewing. (We also think it makes a great pattern for any of your home wallpapering needs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrzLco"&gt;I spoke with Micha about dropping out of art school, the evolution of his illustration style, and why urban exploring was pivotal to his development as an artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kN2NbA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCXufi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you make your illustrations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dWojo"&gt;I used to always do the sketching and the linework on paper, then scan the linework and color it digitally. But I recently bought myself a drawing tablet with a screen, which makes working digitally feel way more natural. Nowadays, I only do the rough sketch on paper, but I wouldn’t be surprised if I’ll be doing that digitally soon as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJFzNN"&gt;For my personal work, I sometimes like to go fully analog, often with acrylic paint and markers. I like the way digital illustration is so efficient and that there’s an infinite amount of options within reach. That used to be a bit overwhelming, but now it feels like an advantage. I really enjoy the freedom it offers me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnW253"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you approach this project for Verge 10? Was the scale of it overwhelming?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDH8Et"&gt;When I read that I was going to make over 25 illustrations that had to be linked perfectly together, I was honestly a little overwhelmed for a bit. But once I let it sink in, and figured how I was going to approach it, I was just excited. I use different frames within one illustration, with things going in and out of those frames, allowing me to make objects go from one frame into another illustration that is linked next to it. Once I did four or five illustrations for this project and saw that they linked together nicely, I knew it was going to work out, which was very relieving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7g90d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you first approach a drawing? How does your process of sketching work — do you start with an idea, or just see what comes out when you sit down to work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouduES"&gt;The first thing I do is make a little summary of the article to have an idea of what the subject is and how I can represent it. Then I start thinking about objects that have to be in there and how to make that look interesting, or how I can turn them into more than just a literal depiction of those elements. Take the illustration for the article about electric vehicles, for instance. The main idea of the article is that Tesla batteries died too quickly to be used as racing cars. A battery and an EV were things that, realistically, had to be in the image. So then I started thinking about how I could make those objects speak to the imagination. I started looking up what electric motors and the interior of Tesla’s cars look like. Tesla’s dashboard screens gave me the idea to create a frame with the arms of a race driver holding a steering wheel, going into a frame with a dashboard, and out of that screen comes another frame with an image of a battery that’s nearly empty.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pp8LjdIWgrF_RYZnP3iRA-aj-GI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/csk/d39f026b-1891-4f75-a516-5cfb97108fad/40a4c6f7-5005-468e-926c-072fbd96a896/images/background_2x.bfb428b2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustration by Micha Huigen&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oxjGc4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you begin your career as an illustrator? Were there any pivotal moments that made you the artist you are?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQ7YJP"&gt;I have been drawing my whole life. I was that typical dreamy kid who always filled the pages of his notebooks with doodles in class. When I graduated from high school, I went to an art school specifically to become an art teacher. But I was way too young in my mind back then and I didn’t really take it seriously. After half a year there, I quit. The future was not on my mind at all. I spent a while doing side jobs, and finally, I decided to  go to ArtEZ to study illustration design. I guess I had to become a bit more mature first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndQzsK"&gt;My attitude completely changed. In the first year, I thought I already knew how to draw and that I already had my own style. I did every assignment and handed it in on time. Never missed a deadline. But in my mind, I did it just to get that paper. But by the end of the second year, I saw my classmates discovering new materials, new styles, and that made me realize that it was stupid not to try and explore new things as well. That’s when I started to figure out what I wanted to say with my illustrations and how to say it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5F0Eq"&gt;I graduated with a portfolio of work about urban exploring. I went to abandoned construction sites and demolished restaurants and tried to convey that sense of adventure in my drawings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqLdYW"&gt;After graduating, I had a variety of side jobs. I worked in a factory stacking boxes on assembly lines. Slowly but surely, I started to get more commissions, and about two years ago, I quit my daytime job and tried to make a living out of just illustration. Three months later COVID-19 hit, and a few big commissions got canceled. But luckily the government here in the Netherlands provided a subsidy to freelancers, which allowed me to continue working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjQsew"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What drew you to making illustrations about urban exploring? Is there something about abandoned places that’s particularly compelling to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7DsgU"&gt;As a kid, I used to roam around with friends in the industrial area in town. It was always really exciting. Just the general feeling I used to get when building stuff like huts and bridges to cross ditches or discovering cool places never really left me I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GALax4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did your style develop? Has it changed over time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOQsyY"&gt;My style has gone through a few changes over the years. Both in terms of subjects as well as the way I go about an illustration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSRBGC"&gt;I used to draw a lot of dusty attics, sheds, rusty factories, industrial areas filled with car tires, wooden pallets, and iron bars. After a while, I wanted to do something different. Then I started getting back into drawing more surreal, psychedelic things, which gives me the opportunity to come up with interesting compositions, switching perspectives and finding solutions to make objects morph into other things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kpoXL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your work is made up of a lot of modular, geographic elements — you zoom in on close-ups in a scene, you superimpose elements from elsewhere over the top of a landscape. How did this come about, and how do you create these compositions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSV9SI"&gt;I feel like this way of approaching illustration comes from two things. The first is from the way I drew as a teenager. I used to just grab a fine liner and start drawing, with pretty much no concept in mind. It often started out with just organic shapes and I built from there. It enabled me to look at a drawing with a kind of bird’s-eye view and to see multiple ways of going about drawing things. I also developed a good sense of spatial awareness, so I can kind of visualize an object from multiple angles. And the other thing is the discovery of adding frames, giving me the ability to play with size and perspective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ounIIW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you look at the work of other artists for inspiration? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbqooZ"&gt;I used to do that a lot, especially during and after graduation when I was really figuring out my style. I used to look at other works and try to pinpoint what it was that made that specific illustration look good. Nowadays, I don’t really look at other people’s work as far as inspiration in terms of style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cu27ix"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your working routine like? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oS1X5"&gt;I’m quite a chaotic person, so I really like having a bit of structure, which as a freelancer is something you really have to create yourself. So I try to have a five-day workweek from 9 ‘till 5. This past year, I’ve been renting a studio with another illustrator and an animator. It really helps me to keep my work and private life separated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6vIjJ"&gt;There are weeks when I’m very busy and work ten hours or more per day. Sometimes there are weeks where I don’t really have commissions to work on. That’s when I try to create personal work, of which I sometimes make prints for my webshop or just my portfolio. Only thing is that you can’t force inspiration and creativity. So there are days where I’m just staring at a blank piece of paper for hours, forcing myself to create stuff and do that until it’s 5:00. It often doesn’t work that way, so I’m still trying to figure out what to do in those moments because I don’t want to be doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z6Y0ya"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your dream commission? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="536Vq4"&gt;Apart from making art, I’m really into skateboarding. I’ve been doing that for about 17 years. And I also love making music, particularly playing electric guitar. I’m in a band, we play a combination of some indie / funk stuff. I’ve had some commissions where I got the chance to combine those passions. I’ve made some gig posters, done some EP and album covers and some merchandise design, and I designed a skateboard deck once for a small skateshop. I guess my dream commission would be to create art for a band I really love. I’d also love to make deck designs for a well-known skateboard brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U75gAR"&gt;But this commission for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was a dream commission as well. I really liked the challenge of making such a large number of illustrations and linking them together to make one big image. And it was quite an honor to get the opportunity to work together with such a big platform on a project that’s pretty huge for my standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fopst4"&gt;But I don’t really have specific dreams or plans, I just try to continue to grow as an artist because every commission has the possibility to lead to another one. The way this commission for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; came about is the perfect example. A year or two ago, I sent an email to bimonthly magazine &lt;em&gt;The Believer&lt;/em&gt; to ask for a collaboration. I didn’t hear from them for a while. But after a few months, I got a reaction and got asked to make a spread and two spot illustrations for the magazine about stolen relics from India. They appreciated my work at &lt;em&gt;The Believer&lt;/em&gt;, and I got a new commission to design one of their covers. I was pretty proud to design a cover in my little studio in Zwolle for a magazine all the way from America. When Kristen [who used to work at &lt;em&gt;The Believer&lt;/em&gt;] started working for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, she offered me the amazing chance to do the Verge 10 project. So cool how that all started with one email! That’s already an unexpected dream come true for me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next privacy crisis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UdTMv3oaNilc0FJjoMe7wjzzJlA=/41x0:2000x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073961/VRG_ILLO_4824_AR_Lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEbdd3"&gt;Imagine a world where you barely notice the barriers between digital and physical space. Instead of looking at a TV or phone, you have a pair of glasses that can project a screen anywhere. You can seamlessly pull up translations for any street sign or instructions for any task. You can amplify a difficult-to-hear conversation through an earpiece or highlight a hard-to-see detail in your surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2IIfK"&gt;Now imagine the same world — but your glasses scan every conversation to personalize a barrage of advertising. Some locations are replete with helpful holographic instructions, while in other places, neglect and poor connectivity make them few and far between. A sophisticated facial recognition system tracks every stranger you encounter... and, in turn, lets those strangers track your every move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIuATE"&gt;These are a few of the best- and worst-case scenarios for augmented reality, a technology that some of the world’s biggest tech companies are spending billions to promote as the future of computing. Over the last decade, AR hardware designers have laid the groundwork for a new generation of mass-market products, even as technical hangups still limit its viability. Over the next one, AR threatens to supercharge existing crises of privacy, trust, and consent. But it’s also a chance to deliberately reset how we approach computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAmYmW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="GFZ4B1"&gt;AR has populated science fiction, specialized industries, and high-tech experiments for decades. But in the 2010s, major companies — and countless startups — began treating AR headsets as a potential mass-market platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hWav7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/12/11415366/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-f8-virtual-augmented-reality-glasses"&gt;Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg predicted&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 that televisions and phones would be replaced by holographic glasses. Apple CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/10/14581428/apple-tim-cook-ar-vr-product-reveal-interview"&gt;called AR&lt;/a&gt; “a big idea, like the smartphone.” Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/2/10900132/microsoft-hololens-future-of-football-augmented-reality"&gt;envisioned people watching the Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; in its HoloLens headset. Google launched its ambitious Glass platform as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/27/4036366/sergey-brin-at-ted-the-cell-phone-is-a-nervous-habit"&gt;potential successor&lt;/a&gt; to phones, then helped propel the AR startup Magic Leap toward billions of dollars in investments. More recently, telecoms have partnered with AR companies like the Chinese startup Nreal, hoping high-bandwidth holograms will create a demand for 5G networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLe7kX"&gt;These companies’ products — as well as those of other major players, including Snap, Vuzix, and Niantic — often look very different. But most of them promise a uniquely powerful combination of three features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OaPUU2"&gt;Their hardware is wearable, hands-free, and potentially always on — you don’t have to grab a device and put it away when you’re done using it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wIAzIc"&gt;Their images and audio can blend with or compensate for normal sensory perception of the world, rather than being confined to a discrete, self-contained screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="G9sSiv"&gt;Their sensors and software can collect and analyze huge amounts of information about their surroundings — through geolocation and depth sensing, computer vision programs, or intimate biometric technology like eye-tracking cameras&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="FoGPWe"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bTstZi"&gt;Over the past decade, nobody has managed to merge these capabilities into a mainstream consumer device. Most glasses are bulky, and the images they produce are shaky, transparent, or cut off by a limited field of view. Nobody has developed a surefire way to interact with them either, despite experiments with voice controls, finger tracking, and handheld hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqZSpt"&gt;Despite this, we’ve gotten hints of the medium’s power and challenges — and even skeptics of the tech should pay attention to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qTGF7"&gt;In 2016, for instance, millions of people fell in love with the phone-based AR game &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;. When players logged on to catch virtual monsters, many discovered parts of their neighborhoods they’d never thought to visit. But they also found a world built on data that placed &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-05/why-it-sucks-to-play-pokemon-go-if-you-re-poor"&gt;more gyms and PokéStops&lt;/a&gt; in white and affluent neighborhoods. They forged in-person connections by sharing virtual experiences, but those connections could also allow for real-world harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3A6mkL"&gt;The effects went beyond people who played the game. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/12/12159422/pokemon-go-turned-house-into-gym-augmented-reality-privacy"&gt;owners of some homes&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; gyms experienced a sudden influx of trespassers, leading a few to sue its developer Niantic and secure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/15/18226604/niantic-pokemon-go-lawsuit-changes-settlement-private-property-pokestop-gym"&gt;tweaks to the game’s design&lt;/a&gt;. Public memorials like the US Holocaust Museum asked players to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/12/12166492/pokemon-go-sensitive-locations-arlington-cemetery-holocaust-museum"&gt;respect the space&lt;/a&gt; by not chasing virtual monsters in it. Even this early foray into augmented reality exported some of the internet’s biggest flaws — like its ability to collapse context and overwhelm individuals with its sheer scale — into physical space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RC6LHR"&gt;Writer and researcher Erica Neely says that laws and social norms aren’t prepared for how AR could affect physical space. “I think we’re kind of frantically running behind the technology,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. In 2019, Neely wrote about the issues that &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; had exposed around augmented locations. Those issues mostly haven’t been settled, she says. And dedicated AR hardware will only intensify them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nyjcEa"&gt;Smartphone cameras — along with &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/7/16/20689832/instagram-photo-editing-app-facetune"&gt;digital touchup apps&lt;/a&gt; like FaceTune and sophisticated image searches &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642017/snapchat-scan-feature-ar-camera-visual-search"&gt;like Snap Scan&lt;/a&gt; and Google Lens — have already complicated our relationships with the offline world. But AR glasses could add an ease and ubiquity that our phones can’t manage. “A phone-based app you have to actually &lt;em&gt;go&lt;/em&gt; to,” says Neely. “You are making a conscious choice to engage with it.” Glasses remove even the light friction of unlocking your screen and deliberately looking through a camera lens.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OGwwI4dvxvp2WKSAWMCft6ewz-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22955855/VRG_ILLO_4824_AR_Spot_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="46BZtJ"&gt;Augmentation also doesn’t just mean adding things to a wearer’s surroundings. It also means letting a computing platform capture and analyze them without other people’s consent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18Jfih"&gt;Take facial recognition — a looming crisis at the heart of AR. Smartphone apps have used facial recognition for years to tag and sort people, and one of the most intuitive AR glasses applications is simply getting reminded of people’s names (as well as other background information like where you met them). It’s also a potential privacy disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3Yqit"&gt;In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/augmented-reality-must-have-augmented-privacy"&gt;the Electronic Frontier Foundation sounded the alarm&lt;/a&gt; about AR glasses’ surveillance capabilities. Any company offering facial recognition through glasses, wrote Katitza Rodriguez and Kurt Opsahl, “could have a live audio/visual window into all corners of the world, with the ability to locate and identify anyone at any time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Y4R7V"&gt;So far, AR systems have mostly sidestepped facial recognition. Phone-based platforms like Snapchat, as well as Facebook’s Portal, use face identification — which can detect facial features to add special effects but not match them against a database of specific people. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/31/4385314/google-wont-approve-facial-recognition-glass-apps-until-it-has"&gt;refused to approve&lt;/a&gt; facial recognition apps in its 2013 Glass Explorer Edition headset, although &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/6/5385674/senator-al-franken-raises-concerns-over-google-glass-facial-recognition-app"&gt;one unofficial app&lt;/a&gt; raised lawmakers’ ire by trying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QGfc3Z"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H9Gmri"&gt;But the EFF’s concern wasn’t premature. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-considers-facial-recognition-smart-glasses"&gt;Andrew Bosworth, an executive at Facebook and Meta, reportedly told employees&lt;/a&gt; the company is weighing the costs and benefits of facial recognition for its Project Aria glasses, calling it possibly “the thorniest issue” in AR. And outside AR, some people are pushing for a near-total ban on the technology. &lt;a href="https://xrds.acm.org/article.cfm?aid=3313129"&gt;Researcher Luke Clark has likened facial recognition&lt;/a&gt; to “the plutonium of AI,” saying any potential upsides are far eclipsed by its social harms. AR is a ready-made testbed for the widespread public use of facial recognition, and by the time any potential harms are obvious, it might be too late to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="devTPq"&gt;It’s not clear how AR systems will make money either — and what kinds of behaviors the resulting business models will encourage. Some companies in the field, like Apple, are traditional hardware sellers. Others, like Facebook and Snap, made their names on ad-supported social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJZnqB"&gt;Facebook has claimed it’s not yet looking at business models for its glasses, and Snap says advertising isn’t the only option, promoting the value of experiences like AR-powered retail. But even companies with no advertising background see its power. In one patent filing from 2017, Magic Leap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/8/11389252/magic-leap-patent-application-augmented-reality-coffee"&gt;imagined Starbucks detecting&lt;/a&gt; when a headset wearer looked at a branded coffee cup, then offering a coupon for the nearest Starbucks store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwGEAS"&gt;Even basic AR applications, like mapping an apartment to place a virtual screen, could potentially gather a huge amount of information. (What’s the size of your living space? Which books are on your shelves? How healthy are the snacks on your kitchen counter?) Without robust privacy protections, it will be incredibly tempting to use that data for ads. And the more companies collect and store, the higher the odds you’ll see it used for something even more invasive — like setting your &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/11/19/668266197/as-insurers-offer-discounts-for-fitness-trackers-wearers-should-step-with-cautio"&gt;insurance premiums&lt;/a&gt; — or fall prey to a security breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ldyXZg"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eYRW5m"&gt;Some groups are trying to get the jump on broader AR policy issues. The nonprofit XR Safety Initiative offers policy frameworks for safety and privacy in the industry, drawing on existing laws like Europe’s General Data Protection Regulations. In the corporate space, Facebook Reality Labs announced a set of Responsible Innovation Principles designed to allay fears about trust, privacy, and consent that have dogged the company. It also &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/announcing-the-winners-of-the-2020-request-for-proposals-in-responsible-innovation/"&gt;awarded a series&lt;/a&gt; of academic grants to study specific issues in AR, selecting proposals like “Social Tensions with Always-available AR for Accessibility” and “Anticipating Virtual Gossip — What are (Un)Intentional Dark Patterns in a Ubiquitously Augmented Reality?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HnzKU"&gt;Early efforts at consumer hardware, though, haven’t navigated its pitfalls particularly well. Google found its 2013 Glass Explorer Edition headset banned from some bars and restaurants because the expensive device was seen as invasive and presumptuous, not futuristic and liberating. That shouldn’t have been surprising: around the same period, University of Washington researchers interviewed people in cafés where someone was wearing a mock AR headset, and the results were a roughly 50-50 mix of indifference and negativity. (Only a single person had a positive reaction.) But instead of planning around some very predictable anxieties, Google CEO Larry Page &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/7/4405326/google-ceo-larry-page-glass-privacy"&gt;called privacy fears&lt;/a&gt; “not that big a concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZRxmUkqRm4vmNGHhMcII169JwoE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22955856/VRG_ILLO_4824_AR_Spot_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="PudM6m"&gt;There’s been plenty of sci-fi speculation about AR, from the flashy gestural interfaces and personalized holographic ads of &lt;em&gt;Minority Report &lt;/em&gt;to the digital caste system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/20/15375694/facebook-augmented-reality-dystopian-future-f8-2017"&gt;predicted in &lt;em&gt;Super Sad True Love Story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But science fiction is notoriously bad at predicting how people will use technology, even when it gets the tech right. Companies have offered hypothetical scenarios that prove AR’s value — Zuckerberg says we’ll invite holographic friends over to sit on our real-world couches, for instance, and Cook imagines visiting live sporting events and seeing stats right on the field. But historically, revolutionary technologies also aren’t top-down systems imposed on perfectly pliant users. Their boundaries are constantly being negotiated in ways the original creators never expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhE2bE"&gt;“It’s very typical that developers of a technology have one kind of idea about what its uptake in society might be, and then the actual uptake turns out to be something quite different,” says University of Washington professor and human-computer interaction expert Batya Friedman. A good system is flexible enough to adapt to these unexpected uses. “We can make it harder or easier to go in and modify technology. So if we build our technologies from the beginning with the idea that as we understand them better, we may need to make modifications, we can build in those technical hooks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfL0ZV"&gt;AR technology also isn’t going to develop in a vacuum. Despite talking up AR glasses’ novelty, figures like Zuckerberg and Cook still describe people using them almost exactly the way they use smartphones: as devices they carry around casually all the time. But ubiquitous, short-lived electronics like smartphones have imposed a steep environmental cost on the planet, and rolling out AR could add billions more devices that are replaced as readily as phones and powered by vast amounts of cloud computing infrastructure. “What are the environmental implications? And do those make sense?” Friedman asks. “If not, I think really the question for us is, what are the really critical areas in which some kind of augmented reality technology really does bring a substantial benefit to people?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUmAtY"&gt;Either way, the past 10 years of tech have been a long struggle to manage crises once they’re already at a boiling point. Meanwhile, AR glasses’ status as a long-awaited, not-quite-there dream can buy us time to figure out what they can do for the world — and whether we actually want them.&lt;/p&gt;
