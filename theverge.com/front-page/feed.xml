    <title>Twitter’s ‘unofficial mayor’ Chrissy Teigen quits platform after years of harassment</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hgqRM5"&gt;Chrissy Teigen, a prolific tweeter the company once called the mayor of Twitter, quit the social media platform Wednesday night. In a series of &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210325015153/https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/1374898752545169409"&gt;now-deleted tweets&lt;/a&gt;, Teigen said Twitter “no longer serves me as positively as it serves me negatively, and I think that’s the right time to call something.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96AZxT"&gt;The model and media personality who is married to singer John Legend was a witty presence on Twitter, and she had 13.7 million followers on the platform, which she joined more than a decade ago. Teigen tweeted about everything from her kids to her &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cravings"&gt;cooking projects&lt;/a&gt; to personal challenges in her life, including a &lt;a href="https://chrissyteigen.medium.com/hi-2e45e6faf764"&gt;miscarriage she suffered last October&lt;/a&gt;. She was famously &lt;a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/07/165013/chrissy-teigen-donald-trump-twitter-fight"&gt;blocked on Twitter by former President Trump&lt;/a&gt; (who was himself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned from the platform&lt;/a&gt; in January) and was one of a handful of accounts followed by the &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/joe-biden-twitter-potus-follows-chrissy-teigen-1234889200/"&gt;official POTUS account&lt;/a&gt; when President Biden took office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIdBKT"&gt;Twitter even promoted her as its unofficial mayor, doing a “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/behindthetweets"&gt;behind the tweets&lt;/a&gt;” video segment in 2019 where she gave some backstory about several of her higher-profile tweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m3tCH1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Go &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BehindTheTweets?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#BehindTheTweets&lt;/a&gt; with the unofficial mayor of Twitter, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@chrissyteigen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/oCf9UMtL5O"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oCf9UMtL5O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter (@Twitter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1092845570694307842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 5, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DREi8v"&gt;But Teigen was also the target of vitriolic abuse and ongoing harassment both on and off of Twitter. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2018/01/01/chrissy-teigen-fights-back-after-twitter-user-drags-model-into-the-false-pizzagate-conspiracy-theory/"&gt;Pizzagate conspiracy theorists&lt;/a&gt; baselessly claimed Teigen and Legend were part of the nonexistent pedophile ring supposedly run out of a Washington, DC pizzeria. She said she &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/chrissy-teigen-blocked-million-twitter-accounts-deleted-tweets-epstein-1518008"&gt;deleted thousands of tweets&lt;/a&gt; and blocked more than a million Twitter accounts last July after ongoing harassment by QAnon followers. “For years I have taken so many small, 2-follower count punches that at this point, I am honestly deeply bruised,” she tweeted Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5H9bxv"&gt;This is a very bad look for Twitter, which despite all of its efforts to reduce harassment on its platform, was unable to protect a woman of color — and arguably one of its best-known personalities — from being targeted and harassed. The company declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="law1hn"&gt;Teigen herself said on Instagram Thursday that she doesn’t blame Twitter. “I believe they do all they can to combat relentless bullying,” she wrote. “It’s not the platform. It’s not the ‘bullying’. And it’s not the trolls. The trolls I can deal with, although it weighs on you. It’s just me. I have to come to terms with the fact some people aren’t gonna like me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="rWLhJv"&gt;Here’s the full statement from Teigen, which she tweeted out before deleting her account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RkzJps"&gt;Hey. For over 10 years, you guys have been my world. I honestly owe so much to this world we have created here. I truly consider so many of you my actual friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qtj7HO"&gt;But it’s time for me to say goodbye. This no longer serves me as positively as it serves me negatively, and I think that’s the right time to call something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1qhZM"&gt;My life goal is to make people happy. The pain I feel when I don’t is too much for me. I’ve always been portrayed as the strong clap back girl but I’m just not. My desire to be liked and fear of pissing people off has made me somebody you didn’t sign up for, and a different human than I started out here as! Live well, tweeters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvE4n5"&gt;I encourage you to know and never forget that your words matter. No matter what you see, what that person portrays, or your intention. For years I have taken so many small, 2-follower count punches that at this point, I am honestly deeply bruised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vz7PfY"&gt;I have made my mistakes, throughout years and in front of hundreds of thousands, and been held accountable for them. I’ve learned an incredible amount here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPGc9"&gt;God I have said fucked up shit and killed myself over it as much as you killed me. But one thing I haven’t learned is how to block out the negativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gL1Ces"&gt;I’m just a sensitive shit, okay!? I don’t wanna be this way! I just am! But I love you guys and I cherish our time together. I truly do. I also hate you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="38sFWX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: John Legend is on the board of directors for Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCPXWI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 25th 3:47PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adds remarks from Teigen’s Instagram account &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The New York Times just sold an NFT for more than half a million dollars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The New York Times hq (1020)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6m-94ifloMyeo3ur0vjoxkc5Z8E=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69026327/nytimes-logo-hq-stock_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBlptv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://foundation.app/kevinroose/the-new-york-times-x-nft-13129"&gt;has entered the NFT game&lt;/a&gt;, selling the chance to own “the first article in the almost 170-year history of &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt; to be distributed as an NFT” — and it’s sold for right around $560,000. While the Paper of Record &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319868/taco-bell-nfts-gif-tacos-sell"&gt;isn’t the first brand&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1984094/quartz-is-selling-the-first-ever-nft-news-article/"&gt;even the first&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/associated-press-nft-100k"&gt;news organization&lt;/a&gt;) to sell one of the digital tokens, it’s certainly been one of the more successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqWZGv"&gt;The auction for the NFT was announced &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/technology/nft-column-blockchain.html"&gt;in a column by Kevin Roose&lt;/a&gt;, which acts as both an NFT explainer and a sales pitch for why someone should buy the article. The author is also able to talk about what the process of actually minting an NFT and putting it up for auction is like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rBKrka"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The NYT made a NFT!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My new column is about NFTs, and I also turned the column into a NFT and put it up for auction on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/withFND?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@withFND&lt;/a&gt;, with proceeds going to charity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bid away, and you could own the first NFT in the paper's 170-year history. &lt;a href="https://t.co/9ItGZvID8B"&gt;https://t.co/9ItGZvID8B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kevin Roose (@kevinroose) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1374753980958437378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="cdrIdY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="COfsTH"&gt;Like other branded NFTs, the &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;added a few extras to sweeten the deal. Of course, there’s a PNG of the article that the NFT points to, but the buyer will also be sent a congratulatory voice memo from the host of &lt;em&gt;The Daily&lt;/em&gt; podcast and be featured in a follow-up article about the NFT’s sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6Pfql"&gt;As with many of the branded NFTs, the proceeds of the sale will be going to charity (specifically &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/neediest-cases/about-donate.html"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;’s Neediest Cases Fund&lt;/a&gt;). Which is great, because it’s a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1375121285181665283?s=20"&gt;mind-boggling amount of money&lt;/a&gt;: enough to buy two millennia’s worth of &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; digital subscriptions. The paper hasn’t yet said if or how it plans to offset the carbon emissions from the sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpEd4L"&gt;When asked for comment on the sale, Roose simply responded with “wow.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack wants the entire world to know he’s got a bitcoin clock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3BwBlNwcx6R3ZoVjQ5S6BDdIP8Y=/25x0:714x459/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69026183/jack_blockclock.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1TiSbJ"&gt;If you’re watching Thursday’s House hearing on misinformation, where Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai are testifying, you might have noticed a clock-like device prominently displayed over Dorsey’s right shoulder. (It’s hard to miss — besides Dorsey, a window, and some houseware, it’s basically the only other thing in frame.) But the device doesn’t seem to be showing the time — or at least, I haven’t seen that. So what is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrpIGQ"&gt;It’s a bitcoin clock. Specifically, &lt;a href="https://store.coinkite.com/store/block-clock"&gt;Coinkite’s $399 BlockCl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://blockclockmini.com/"&gt;o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.coinkite.com/store/block-clock"&gt;ck mini&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re even tangentially aware of Dorsey’s love of bitcoin, this will not come as a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vYRdCQweEdvjUGagw-4ryzCIo5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397379/blockclock_mini.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Coinkite&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BlockClock mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2xgKms"&gt;Dorsey is a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; fan of bitcoin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VCCtrB"&gt;The only thing in his Twitter profile description is “#bitcoin” with a Twitter emoji of the bitcoin logo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TZQ8wl"&gt;He said in 2018 that he believes bitcoin will become &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17147574/twitter-ceo-bitcoin-jack-dorsey-square-interview-currency-10-years"&gt;the world’s single currency within 10 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0akjYk"&gt;He partnered with Jay-Z on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280005/jack-dorsey-jay-z-bitcoin-development-fund-africa-india"&gt;$23 million bitcoin development fund&lt;/a&gt;, which was announced in February.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ii6Wnl"&gt;His other company, Square, invested $50 million in bitcoin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507533/square-50-million-bitcoin-dorsey-cryptocurrency"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt; and upped that soon after with &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; $170 million investment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297935/square-bitcoin-purchase-170-million-investment-cryptocurrency"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;. You can also buy bitcoin with Square’s Cash App.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="oB4epI"&gt;Dorsey just seems to be into blockchain-based things in general, having just auctioned off his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344937/jack-dorsey-nft-sold-first-tweet-ethereum-cryptocurrency-twitter"&gt;first tweet as an NFT for nearly $3 million&lt;/a&gt;. (He donated the proceeds to charity.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQA7hu"&gt;As for the BlockClock mini, &lt;a href="https://blockclockmini.com/docs.html"&gt;it can indeed show the time&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s also a Wi-Fi-enabled device that can also show you the current price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency-related data. “Track prices from exchanges, see blocks as they are published by miners and connect Opendime to display balance, fiat value, and deposit QR codes,” &lt;a href="https://store.coinkite.com/store/block-clock"&gt;reads a description on Coinkite’s store&lt;/a&gt;. (The current price of bitcoin is more than $52,000 as of this writing, if you were wondering.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fGfhG"&gt;If you’re enamored with the BlockClock mini after seeing it on Dorsey’s counter, you may not get it soon. Coinkite lists it as a “long lead item” and notes in the clock’s description that “lead times may vary — no delivery date guarantees due to high demand.” The device’s &lt;a href="https://blockclockmini.com/"&gt;main website&lt;/a&gt; also has a big button to “Reserve Now &amp;lt;3” that points to Coinkite’s store, which doesn’t fill me with confidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vnGVi"&gt;Also, it’s $399.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now subscribe to a Porsche Taycan for as little as $2,500 a month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BMGBCsUjDPA6y2KqvjTPYxtxxlc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69025882/sokane_191127_3819_5467.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q7i0bZ"&gt;Porsche is adding its all-electric Taycan sports car to its subscription service. For as little as $2,500 a month, you can burn rubber in a 522-horsepower, 390-kW Taycan 4S with rear-wheel drive. The 4S normally retails for around $103,800.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gc5yny"&gt;The German automaker’s subscription service, Porsche Drive, first launched in October 2017 as a pilot program in Atlanta, Georgia. It has since grown to eight other cities, including San Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles, Monterrey, Irvine, Houston, and Phoenix. As a subscriber, you can get access to up to seven different models for a month-to-month subscription or for as little as a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOehaY"&gt;“Think of Porsche Drive as sports car-as-a-service, a convenient digital way to access the Porsche experience,” said Kjell Gruner, president and CEO of Porsche Cars North America, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bVWfy2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Think of Porsche Drive as sports car-as-a-service, a convenient digital way to access the Porsche experience”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DKcswW"&gt;Porsche is only making the Taycan 4S available to subscribers initially. Customers can access it through the automaker’s Single-Vehicle subscriber plan, not as a swap in the multivehicle program. The fees are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="B4LSji"&gt;$3,250 per month for the Taycan 4S &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fduwdA"&gt;$2,500 per month for the Taycan with rear-wheel drive &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="e8Dh5x"&gt;$335 per day for daily rentals for three days or fewer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RISsR2"&gt;$295 per day for four-plus days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1sY5Nx"&gt;Porsche says its monthly subscription fees are about 20 percent more than the monthly fees associated with a two-year lease, but they come with the added flexibility of being able to cancel your subscription at any time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WACZWR"&gt;As part of the subscription, Porsche also covers vehicle tax and registration, insurance, maintenance, and detailing. There is a $500 activation fee at first and a credit check, but Apple iOS and Android users can then download the app and schedule same-day or future vehicle exchanges through the Porsche Passport app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkaLPE"&gt;Subscriptions have been a mixed bag for the auto industry. Ford walked away from its service last fall following low demand. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18050020/cadillacs-car-subscription-service-shutting-down"&gt;Cadillac shut down its service Book in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, only to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197772/cadillac-book-2-subscription-service-dealers"&gt;resurrect it&lt;/a&gt; several months later with fewer options. Last summer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21306823/mercedes-benz-collection-subscription-service-cancel-sales"&gt;Mercedes-Benz pulled the plug&lt;/a&gt; its Collection subscription service, citing mediocre sales. And most recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231451/bmw-access-subscription-shut-down-nashville-cancel"&gt;BMW suspended&lt;/a&gt; its two-year-old service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2i7XI"&gt;Other automakers have had some success. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/21/17888304/audi-subscription-service-monthly-fee-dallas"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/30/16720830/volvo-suv-subscription-plan-600-la-auto-show-2017"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143852/nissan-switch-subscription-service-price-model-vehicle"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/15/17464548/jaguar-land-rover-car-subscription-service-carpe-uk"&gt;Jaguar&lt;/a&gt; are still offering some variation of a subscription service. Even the big car rental companies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18652907/hertz-my-car-subscription-rental-terms-enterprise"&gt;Hertz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514404/enterprise-car-subscription-service-rental"&gt;Enterprise&lt;/a&gt;, are getting in on the action. Most of these subscriptions are only available in specific cities and are still in the pilot phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moKMs0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Take a trip back to 1997 with an incredibly rare, never-opened Nintendo 64 Disk Drive dev kit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IpS0uo8VXS839zpl_wGplqXlIZU=/0x216:5184x3672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69025594/Image_1___Inside_64DD_Development_Kit_Shipping_Box.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://archive.org/details/N64DD/Image%201%20-%20Inside%2064DD%20Development%20Kit%20Shipping%20Box.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;Shane Luis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LypKFq"&gt;YouTuber Shane Luis has tweeted some amazing photos of a new-in-box game development kit for the Nintendo 64’s Disk Drive (64DD), a very rare peripheral never released outside of Japan that played games off proprietary floppy disks. You can (and should!) read look through the whole thread &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RerezTV/status/1374818192305090560"&gt;starting with this tweet&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m going to share some of the photos here in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bw3SFg"&gt;Here’s what the box looks like — nothing flashy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3MLuQq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I was asked to verify and photograph a Nintendo 64 Disk Drive (64DD) Development Kit from a private video game collector. The system was new in box and needed to be carefully documented.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is what it looks like to unbox one. &lt;a href="https://t.co/X2PflhtemW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/X2PflhtemW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Shane Luis (@RerezTV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RerezTV/status/1374818192305090560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wyq6Ki"&gt;Inside that dark blue box on the top right were five 64DD Development Disks, which were a dark blue instead of the gray used for retail games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QRrCGj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;64DD Development Disks are blue unlike the retail games released in Japan that were grey. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Q6VFuCDnmn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Q6VFuCDnmn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Shane Luis (@RerezTV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RerezTV/status/1374818204703461378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fu3vl7"&gt;The development kit also included a special adapter to let developers plug in two N64 cartridges at once instead of just one. When everything was connected together, here’s what that looked like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DuTh8o"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;When attached together they mount directly on the top of a Nintendo 64 through the cartridge slot like this. &lt;a href="https://t.co/oCitZEqyUz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oCitZEqyUz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Shane Luis (@RerezTV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RerezTV/status/1374818244872261640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hBNzgQ"&gt;Here’s the 64DD itself, which has a blue trim around the disk slot used to signify it as a development device that matches the color used for the development disks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="enpLCB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The top of the unit is designed to sit directly under a Nintendo 64 console. They connect through the port you can see on the top. On the bottom you'll find a fastener designed to lock the two together. &lt;a href="https://t.co/792Vy8GYZY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/792Vy8GYZY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Shane Luis (@RerezTV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RerezTV/status/1374818277311049731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YAK8RJ"&gt;And here’s the whole 64DD development system connected together and attached to a Nintendo 64. It’s huge! (Though seemingly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21438782/sony-ps5-size-specs-dimensions-console-huge-large-big"&gt;not as huge as the PS5&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gxzMXK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;When combined all together you're ready to start developing 64DD games!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately this system was never used and the 64DD platform failed to take off. If the 64DD was a success who knows what might have happened! &lt;a href="https://t.co/GWDjC2J3GA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/GWDjC2J3GA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Shane Luis (@RerezTV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RerezTV/status/1374818287893233669?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ktuOSV"&gt;I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to see a 64DD myself since the peripheral wasn’t much of a success (only nine games were released for it), and it only came out in Japan. But these photos might be the next best thing and are just a plain interesting look at something from Nintendo’s past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jJWeG"&gt;Again, I strongly recommend scrolling through the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RerezTV/status/1374818192305090560"&gt;whole thread in full&lt;/a&gt; or checking out his album of photos &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/N64DD/Image%201%20-%20Inside%2064DD%20Development%20Kit%20Shipping%20Box.jpg"&gt;on the Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon denies stories of workers peeing in bottles, receives a flood of evidence in return</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wIfKSpSFTBlUNUCawvlpWqdt9JQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69025561/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ww33Tk"&gt;Amazon is trying a new tactic in its endless PR battle against stories of its exhausting and exploitative working conditions: outright denial. It’s not working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxI1Sh"&gt;When replying to a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/repmarkpocan/status/1374890264658120709"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) complaining about the company’s union-busting tactics and the fact that some of its workers are forced to “urinate in water bottles,” Amazon’s official Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonnews/status/1374911222361956359"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;: “You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJnAjf"&gt;But people do believe these stories and for a very simple reason: there are numerous accounts of it happening, documented by employees and journalists around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNGHcQ"&gt;Indeed, after Amazon sent out its ill-judged tweet, reporters who cover the company’s labor practices practically lined up to soak the firm with evidence. These included English journalist James Bloodworth, whose 2018 book &lt;em&gt;Hired: Six Months Undercover in Low-Wage Britain&lt;/em&gt; documented his experience of low-paid work for companies including Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IiZQoJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I was the person who found the pee in the bottle. Trust me, it happened. &lt;a href="https://t.co/U76UlDRWSO"&gt;https://t.co/U76UlDRWSO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— James Bloodworth (@J_Bloodworth) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/J_Bloodworth/status/1375005859013623808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WtCA9s"&gt;Bloodworth’s book led to some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17243026/amazon-warehouse-jobs-worker-conditions-bathroom-breaks"&gt;most widely shared stories&lt;/a&gt; about Amazon workers being forced to pee in bottles to save time while meeting the company’s targets, but he’s far from the only one to document this exact example of poor working conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvbRGQ"&gt;Here’s Will Evans from &lt;em&gt;The Center of Investigative Reporting&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Fx277c"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Peeing at Amazon - or not being able to - is an actual thing. Here's what workers told me. &lt;a href="https://t.co/D0lp4pdQ5D"&gt;https://t.co/D0lp4pdQ5D&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/eqFiS8WZbG"&gt;https://t.co/eqFiS8WZbG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/RVLOYezGvE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RVLOYezGvE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Will Evans (@willCIR) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/willCIR/status/1374956765297532928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B3mF7u"&gt;And Lauren Kaori Gurley from &lt;em&gt;Motherboard. &lt;/em&gt;(Gurley also &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;wrote a story&lt;/a&gt; with photographic evidence, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonDSPDrivers/comments/ma9jyk/dont_have_a_pee_bottle_desperate_times_call_for"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonDSPDrivers/comments/mbhn70/ive_found_piss_bottles_from_other_drivers_but_now/"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonDSPDrivers/comments/m7xh47/ive_been_saving_my_vitaminwater_to_repurpose_as/"&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; from the subreddit for Amazon delivery drivers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PFD6mX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As a labor reporter who covers Amazon extensively...I can say Amazon delivery drivers not having a time or place to pee is one of the most universal concerns I hear about &lt;a href="https://t.co/pG81MDf5TU"&gt;https://t.co/pG81MDf5TU&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/h3pGhOok1y"&gt;pic.twitter.com/h3pGhOok1y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lauren Kaori Gurley (@LaurenKGurley) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LaurenKGurley/status/1374920139116789763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pP5wbd"&gt;And Ken Bensinger from &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JdH97H"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Amazon claims its workers don't pee in bottles; defenders say it's an urban legend. But these photos sent to me by a former driver for a former &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@amazon&lt;/a&gt; contractor called Synctruck in a California facility suggest strongly otherwise. &lt;a href="https://t.co/hp4zCqOxRO"&gt;https://t.co/hp4zCqOxRO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/StHNvV9B1x"&gt;pic.twitter.com/StHNvV9B1x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ken Bensinger (@kenbensinger) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kenbensinger/status/1374969429386092551?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MrVdpe"&gt;And Alex Press from &lt;em&gt;Jacobin&lt;/em&gt;, who shares a much grimmer anecdote of an Amazon worker who suffered a seizure in one of the company’s facilities: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pVLgaB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;my first response to this was to laugh because it’s such a ridiculous tweet but honestly, this is infuriating. here are the type of texts Amazon workers send me &lt;a href="https://t.co/7hW5miBob8"&gt;https://t.co/7hW5miBob8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/bENxlqzsPa"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bENxlqzsPa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alex Press (@alexnpress) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexnpress/status/1374918270197895168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uogBK0"&gt;Indeed, although Amazon is trying to refute stories of “peeing in bottles” that have become shorthand for the company’s poor working conditions, they’re only the tip of the iceberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrNEGx"&gt;Other evidence includes the &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/amazon-reportedly-downplayed-rising-injury-rates-at-its-warehouses.html"&gt;high injury rates in Amazon warehouses&lt;/a&gt; (7.7 serious injuries per 100 employees); employees &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/an-eighth-amazon-warehouse-employee-has-died-from-covid-19/"&gt;dying from COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; after complaints the company wasn’t doing enough to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/29/21303643/amazon-coronavirus-warehouse-workers-protest-jeff-bezos-chris-smalls-boycott-pandemic"&gt;mitigate risks&lt;/a&gt; from the virus; widespread &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/technology/amazon-unions-virginia.html"&gt;union-busting&lt;/a&gt;; production targets that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/05/amazon-workers-protest-unsafe-grueling-conditions-warehouse"&gt;treat humans like robots&lt;/a&gt;; and gruesome anecdotes like the story of the Amazon worker who died from a heart attack and who, say colleagues, was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/17/amazon-warehouse-worker-deaths"&gt;left on the work floor for 20 minutes&lt;/a&gt; before receiving treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vahi9f"&gt;Amazon denied this last story, of course, saying it responded to the man’s collapse “within minutes.” But Amazon has proven its willingness to edit reality. And if the company is happy to suggest its workers never pee in bottles despite many accounts to the contrary, it’s hard to take the company’s “truth” seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to track the big stuck boat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XeKFCQNraKHBDb6OUpU1ht4LMvU=/0x0:4704x3136/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69025497/1__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Suez Canal Authority&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kqO7Mi"&gt;There’s a giant cargo ship stuck in the Suez Canal. I’m sure you’ve heard, but in case you haven’t, welcome to the first major spectacle the internet has collectively rubbernecked to this degree since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/26/8116693/live-the-internet-is-going-bananas-for-this-llama-chase"&gt;those llamas cavorted around an Arizona town&lt;/a&gt; in... 2015? Really? Woof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KALec0"&gt;Anyway, the whole internet loves the stuck boat, especially since it also appears to have charted a &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkdjzb/cargo-ship-suez-canal-dick-pic-ever-given"&gt;very phallic course into the canal&lt;/a&gt; before it drifted into its current position. Sure, it’s causing hundreds of other ships to bottleneck, and sure, that will probably inevitably cause some headaches for an already-strained global supply chain. Yes, &lt;a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/stuck-suez-canal-boat-raised-oil-prices-because-thats-1846543046"&gt;oil prices are up&lt;/a&gt;, and there may be another run on toilet paper &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-24/toilet-paper-is-next-likely-victim-of-world-s-container-crisis?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;as a result&lt;/a&gt;, but for now, let us just have this moment, okay? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Ko1k9"&gt;Stuck boat &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daniburgz/status/1375020558451113985"&gt;memes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hyenasandgin/status/1374834096938098690"&gt;abound&lt;/a&gt;, but if you want to keep the closest eye on the beached MV Ever Given, you have a few options. Incredibly, there is no live stream (or even an old-school webcam), so you’ll have to get a bit creative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X3wZ3N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Vessel tracking sites are the way to go&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wJ5nQ8"&gt;My go-to so far has been &lt;a href="https://www.myshiptracking.com/?mmsi=353136000"&gt;MyShipTracking&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically a version of FlightRadar24 for boats. You get a top-down interactive map to play around with that is updated in near real time, so you can watch all of the little tug and support boats helplessly swarm around the MV Ever Given or check out all of the other ships stuck waiting (or watch them finally decide to bail and go &lt;em&gt;around Africa instead&lt;/em&gt;). It also has the easiest access I’ve found to highlight a ship’s prior track, so you can quickly scour the different paths the various boats took to get to this new dead end.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ixJJMey_clNJ2mU7c8kePk0K7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397227/Screen_Shot_2021_03_25_at_11.44.21_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Suez Canal Authority&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You got this, little buddy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5M9tSw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vesselfinder.com/?imo=9811000"&gt;VesselFinder&lt;/a&gt; is another good option with similar capabilities. VesselFinder is also seizing its moment by creating stuck boat content on YouTube, where it has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5IKbYcLgQA"&gt;reanimated the cargo ship’s dick-drawing skills&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NbgLfyAGWU"&gt;its ill-fated passage through the canal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEKCh8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Suez Canal Authority hasn’t gotten the ship unstuck yet but they did make this great sizzle reel of them not getting the ship unstuck set to what sounds like a royalty-free version of the Tenet soundtrack &lt;a href="https://t.co/WEf27ekums"&gt;https://t.co/WEf27ekums&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZRTeO3m7yU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZRTeO3m7yU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Josh Billinson (@jbillinson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jbillinson/status/1375086575990751242?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GNP34j"&gt;The Suez Canal Authority has uploaded a few &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JMsAFR7GQ"&gt;incredibly dramatic videos&lt;/a&gt; of the big boat, and I applaud any effort by them to create more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvovK1"&gt;Then there are the satellite companies, which often take opportunities like this to show off what their tech is capable of, like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/capellaspace"&gt;Capella Space’s eerie radar images of the very stuck boat&lt;/a&gt; or Airbus Space’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AirbusSpace/status/1375078054884749318"&gt;incredible high-res shots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udZuYu"&gt;So buckle up, folks. The effort to float the big boat and get it moving again could take days, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/world/middleeast/suez-canal-ship.html?referringSource=articleShare"&gt;maybe even weeks&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy the memes while they last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pzjW63"&gt;

    <title>Google is testing Memory, an upgrade for Assistant to “save and find everything”</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BCcNiZjgY4ReSk4G0YYQqMxgodo=/40x0:1240x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69025443/png.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/24/google-assistant-memory-apk-insight-teardown/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DGqHZp"&gt;Google is reportedly working on a new feature for Assistant called Memory, a combination of a to-do list, a notes app, a Pocket-like reading list, and Pinterest-style collection board into a single overarching digital locker integrated into the broader Google Assistant app. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/24/google-assistant-memory-apk-insight-teardown/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; first revealed the feature&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently in “dogfood” testing for Google employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uv4HBG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;, Memory can save a huge variety of content, including “articles, books, contacts, events, flights, hotels, images, movies, music, notes, photos, places, playlists, products, recipes, reminders, restaurants, screenshots, shipments, TV shows, videos, and websites.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9j0dK"&gt;While Assistant &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7536723?hl=en"&gt;already has a Memory feature&lt;/a&gt; for saving information (like a bike lock combination or a favorite flavor of cake), the new iteration of Memory appears to be a major upgrade, one that seems to integrate the “Collections” feature that preceded it and be given top billing on the main menu bar alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21404244/google-assistant-snapshot-feature-birthday-reminders-recipe-recommendations"&gt;Assistant’s daily snapshot view&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mUXp3q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Save and find anything&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRS0Yc"&gt;The idea is that you’ll be able to save nearly anything, including links or screenshots, pictures of objects or handwritten notes, or digital to-do lists or reminders. Memory will then let you search, sort, and revisit everything you’ve saved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agWW2s"&gt;Depending on what you’re saving, Memory will also include contextual information: save a recipe, for instance, and it’ll show the cooking time. Save a movie you wanted to watch, and it’ll include a link to the trailer. And of course, Google-based items you save (like Google Docs or uploaded Drive files) will get customized preview cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20o8hB"&gt;To store things to Memory, users can either use a Google Assistant command or a newly added home screen shortcut. Once added to Memory, saved items can be tagged (with categories like “Important” or “Read Later”) as well as sorted or searched to find a specific item. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PiPDxQ"&gt;Memory is still being tested, and Google hasn’t announced any plans for when — or even if — it’ll receive a public debut. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Google spokesperson commented: “We are constantly iterating and experimenting with new ways to improve the user experience, but we have no further details to share at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YkuN69"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ghost of Tsushima is getting a movie adaptation from the director of John Wick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m1HPwMXjeylTetTMEFHZwsk6Ydg=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69025380/ghost_of_tsushima_screenshot_disclaimer_03_en_11oct20.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wr6rw9"&gt;Sony and Sucker Punch’s PlayStation 4 hit &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; is being adapted into a movie with John Wick director Chad Stahelski at the helm, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/sony-playstation-productions-ghost-of-tsushima-movie-john-wicks-chad-stahelski-directing-1234721342/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; first reported on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Sony confirmed the film’s development &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/03/25/a-ghost-of-tsushima-movie-is-in-the-works/#sf244299110"&gt;in a blog shortly after&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbXueC"&gt;The game, which stars samurai warrior Jin Sakai as he fights a huge Mongol army to protect the island of Tsushima, is heavily inspired by classic samurai films like those from Akira Kurosawa, so it seems like natural fit for the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4iYhvy"&gt;“We’re excited to be partnering with Chad and 87Eleven Entertainment, to bring their vision of Jin’s story to the big screen,” said Asad Qizilbash, head of PlayStation Productions, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;. “We love working with creative partners like Chad, who have a passion for our games, ensuring we can create rich adaptations that will excite our fans and new audiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruEndz"&gt;“We are happy to partner with Sony Pictures to make this happen,” Nate Fox, game director at Sucker Punch, said in a statement on the PlayStation blog. “And Jin is in very good hands with the film’s director. Chad Stahelski created something special with &lt;em&gt;John Wick&lt;/em&gt;. His vision for what could be, backed up by years of experience, combined to create some of the finest action scenes ever created. If anyone could bring to life the razor-sharp tension of Jin’s katana combat, it’s Chad Stahelski.” Fox also confirmed that the &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; game has sold 6.5 million copies since its release last July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcIDxW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; is Sony’s latest game franchise to be adapted into a movie. Tom Holland is starring as Nathan Drake in a movie adaption of the &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt;-like &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; series that’s &lt;a href="https://collider.com/uncharted-movie-release-date-2022/"&gt;set to release on February 11th, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Sony’s upcoming big-screen take on &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22153341/metal-gear-solid-movie-oscar-isaac-solid-snake"&gt;will star Oscar Isaac as Solid Snake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbbDJx"&gt;Sony is also working on a TV adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us &lt;/em&gt;for HBO, which will star &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277687/mandalorian-star-pedro-pascal-joel-hbo-the-last-of-us-tv-show"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian’s&lt;/em&gt; Pedro Pascal as Joel&lt;/a&gt; and Bella Ramsey, known for her role as Lyanna Mormont in &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277372/the-last-of-us-ellie-game-of-thrones-bella-ramsey-hbo-lyanna-mormont"&gt;as Ellie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Without maintenance, an NFT’s art could disappear&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="S0Au5z"&gt;Open up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;the $69 million NFT&lt;/a&gt; that Beeple sold at Christie’s, and you won’t find much. The name of the artwork isn’t there. The name of the artist is missing. And crucially, you won’t even find the actual piece of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEl9jj"&gt;That’s not a flaw in Beeple’s NFT — it’s just how the system works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCGdNm"&gt;It turns out, the house of cards that is the NFT system is even more precarious than it first appears. NFTs are fundamentally built on trust — trust that a seller won’t screw you over, trust that these tokens magically have value — and that holds true even at the deepest level of the system. Ultimately, you’re buying a collection of metadata defining what you own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="z2AoPw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s an awfully expensive 404 error for buyers of these NFTs.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aIlf3j"&gt;But there’s one significant gap in the system ensuring that an NFT is held together: NFTs use &lt;em&gt;links &lt;/em&gt;to direct you to somewhere else where the art and any details about it are being stored. And as anyone who has browsed the internet before should know, links can and do die. So what happens if your NFT breaks down and points to nothing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8IQUF"&gt;“That’s an awfully expensive 404 error for buyers of these NFTs,” Aaron Perzanowski, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University and co-author of&lt;em&gt; The End of Ownership&lt;/em&gt;, wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4M8SMt"&gt;NFTs are digital tokens used to buy and sell digital art. But unlike a painting, which can be placed in a buyer’s home, an NFT is more like a piece of paper saying you own something — generally, a digital illustration or a video. Sometimes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;a weird-looking cat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="Xq62cC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XeZqHb"&gt;The system usually relies on the Ethereum blockchain, which ensures a few things: it keeps an unalterable record of everyone who has owned the NFT, and it keeps the NFT from ever changing. That means someone who buys an NFT and then resells it can’t misrepresent what they own. It’s all there in the NFT, just how it was when they bought it. You can think of it like the papers that authenticate a thoroughbred: they’re not the horse, but they certify the provenance and history of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Seb2x8"&gt;Very little data is stored directly inside an NFT, though. The NFT includes information on where you can &lt;em&gt;find &lt;/em&gt;a description of the artist’s name and the title of the work, but that information is not typically on the blockchain itself. NFTs include information on where you can &lt;em&gt;find &lt;/em&gt;the artwork they represent, but the actual artwork is still a link away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="US3RZY"&gt;Traditional URLs pose real problems for NFTs. The owner of the domain could redirect the URL to point to something else (leaving you with, perhaps, a million-dollar Rickroll), or the owner of the domain could just forget to pay their hosting bill, and the whole thing disappears. The animation that Grimes sold for $389,000 is &lt;a href="https://api.niftygateway.com/warnymphvolume1/27300010001/"&gt;primarily sourced&lt;/a&gt; to a pair of traditional URLs, which could break down if either of the two different companies (Nifty Gateway, the auction site; or Cloudinary, the web host) went under. As the buyer, this is something you’d have no control over, unless you’re wealthy enough to buy out the entire domain and pay to keep it online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="us7vX5"&gt;To solve that problem, many NFTs turn to a system called IPFS, or InterPlanetary File System. Rather than identifying a specific file at a specific domain, IPFS addresses let you find a piece of content so long as &lt;em&gt;someone &lt;/em&gt;somewhere on the IPFS network is hosting it. Grimes’ NFT uses this as a backup, and &lt;a href="https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz"&gt;Beeple’s NFT&lt;/a&gt; uses this primarily. That means a multitude of hosts, rather than a single domain owner, could be ensuring these files remain online. This system also gives buyers control. They can pay to keep their NFT’s files online. They still have to remember to pay the hosting bill, but they can host it anywhere in the IPFS network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tC3jyu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“One hard drive crashing could lead to permanent loss of the assets.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kcx5Gv"&gt;Still, the system has flaws. The team behind Check My NFT has been looking inside of NFTs to see if their IPFS addresses actually work, and in several cases, they’ve found files that just won’t load. The team found artworks that were temporarily missing from major artists, including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CheckMyNFT/status/1369802069729812483"&gt;Grimes, deadmau5, and Steve Aoki&lt;/a&gt;. The files came back online eventually, but only after the team called attention to their absence. The files have to be actively available on the network for the system to work, and unlike with a domain owner, no host has a singular responsibility to do that for files on IPFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4njrj"&gt;“One hard drive crashing could lead to permanent loss of the assets,” the Check My NFT team warned in a message to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6dDlJ7"&gt;Like a painting, NFTs need to be maintained. If a buyer purchases an NFT that relies on IPFS, it’ll ultimately be on them to ensure the file continues to be hosted and available to the system. If the NFT relies on a traditional URL, then buyers would be in a more precarious position, having to hope that whatever third party currently hosts the file — often the auction site, like with Grimes’ NFT — stays online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpzeDx"&gt;So there’s a very real chance that, some years from now, an NFT will point to a missing file. If that’s the case, how do you prove what it is you actually own? “You’re still at this stage of evolution of blockchain where you need to have a traditional written contract that tells you what you are getting and that’s enforceable against the seller of that asset,” David Hoppe, managing partner at Gamma Law, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="tSco7t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even if the NFT falls apart, there could be value as long as the artwork still exists&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5hZGVa"&gt;But most buyers don’t exactly have that. Despite the buzz around Ethereum’s “smart contracts,” NFTs typically do not include the &lt;em&gt;literal contract &lt;/em&gt;a buyer agrees to with the seller of a work detailing what they’re getting and how they can use it. Those rights are typically just built into an auction site’s terms of service. “In many cases, NFTs offer very little beyond a bare claim of ownership of the NFT itself,” Perzanowski wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6vugi"&gt;Buyers could end up in one of two situations: in one case, they own an NFT with a broken link, but they and the rest of the world understand what artwork it used to represent — say, an extremely expensive collage. So long as that image exists &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; in the world, it’s possible the NFT would retain value as long as the artist, owner, and prospective buyers all agree on what the token is meant to represent. It is, after all, a system built on trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="8IRtga"&gt;In the other scenario, the image has gone missing, and no one can tell what artwork the NFT was originally tied to. If that’s the case, it’s hard to imagine the NFT would have had much value anyway. You can’t sell a painting that’s been burned or a statue that’s been lost. And an NFT with missing art is just that — nothing to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
