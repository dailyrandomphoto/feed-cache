    <title>What’s on your desk, Cameron Faulkner? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2bMPYgQqm8Zdcyd1KXq9tin8t2k=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767645/cfaulkner_210201_4392_0014.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How to share a workspace in a studio apartment&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="2zOZeT"&gt;It’s hard enough to be a writer, reviewer, and tech enthusiast for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; under normal circumstances. It’s even harder when you’re working out of a shared studio apartment during a pandemic. Cameron Faulkner, who not only handles our deals pages but also writes on a wide variety of topics, has somehow managed it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHQQmy"&gt;We asked him to explain how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MumhSN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1U46K"&gt;Hi! Tech has always been my passion, and I’ve been happily writing about tech professionally for about seven years, nearly three of those at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Before I got work in the field, I was employed at KFC, at a fulfillment center for school supplies, as a pharmacy technician, and as a cashier. I’m always oddly proud to share my strange brew of work experience with anyone who will listen. I grew up in the Midwest in Mansfield, Ohio, but I’ve lived in Brooklyn, New York, since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFHRmL"&gt;My primary focus at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is on Verge Deals, including daily deal roundups that my colleague Taylor Lyles and I hand-pick each day. That also includes helping to write content for the Verge Deals Twitter account, as well as publishing a weekly newsletter. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;You can sign up here&lt;/a&gt;!) Aside from that, I write about gaming peripherals, write reviews and how-tos, and help the news team cover pressing stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLUuXy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide where and how to set up your workspace?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntqjIj"&gt;Organizing distinct zones in a studio apartment is a challenge that I’ve yet to overcome. All of these zones sort of bleed into each other, and without having actual rooms with walls to get space from, say, pots banging in the kitchen, or other distractions, it can be incredibly difficult to stay focused. Though our latest arrangement is possibly the best that we’ll ever manage in this space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JQF0RYTMMxO8GSSUkoSXVo24594=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277287/cfaulkner_210201_4392_0023.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7aWcZG"&gt;My wife and I have our desks facing in opposite directions. Just out of frame, behind where I sit, is her desk. We’ve been forced to be very efficient with these space constraints, and it’s miles ahead of where we used to be. We actually used to share this one desk that’s pictured here, with my one monitor, keyboard, and mouse on the right and her setup on the left. The pandemic made us rethink this strategy. Suffice it to say, my current setup is a huge improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0SD7I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOAxEt"&gt;First off, I’d advise people to resist the temptation to buy a glass desk, good as they look. It’ll show dust after just a few days — even faster if you have cats who like to climb on it and nuzzle on the corners of your monitors. That said, I’ve had this one since 2008, so clearly, it’s a good product (or I’m just a good-enough owner).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hR0ECY"&gt;Secondly, my desk is never as clean as the picture above indicates. I usually have another mug or two on it and some errant review products strewn about. That said, I actually do prefer a minimalistic look (difficult as it is to maintain). No disrespect to my colleagues who have been featured in this series, but I don’t have many tchotchkes that I want to display at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bz2EQd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your desk chair?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3u48Ij"&gt;The desk chair that I use is the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hermanmiller.com%2Foffice%2Foffice-chairs%2Faeron-chair%2F2195348.html%3Flang%3Den_US%26&amp;amp;xcust=verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller Sayl&lt;/a&gt;, which usually sells for around $600 — the low-end of that company’s lineup, believe it or not. I almost purchased this chair in mid-2020 when the chair that I had was really causing me physical anguish, but Vox Media allowed me to borrow it from our NYC office. So I immediately drove there, stuffed it into my car, and brought it home. My cats and I really like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkOp4h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your tech. Let’s start with your computer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2TwJ2"&gt;I built that PC, and it’s filled with parts ranging from as far back as 2014 to recently. The case is the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fblack-silverstone-temjin-series-microatx-mini-tower%2Fp%2FN82E16811163182&amp;amp;u1=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SilverStone Temjin&lt;/a&gt;, built to accommodate small microATX motherboards. You might be able to see from the photos that it’s a little scratched and beat up. I love that this case size is small enough to fit on a monitor stand, so I can fit the head of my vacuum cleaner underneath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPc2Ma"&gt;Inside the case, I have an Intel Core i5-9600K processor, EVGA’s GeForce RTX 2070 graphics card, 16GB of RAM, and a 1GB NVMe SSD. My cable management isn’t great, but the case shuts and the wires are out of harm’s way, so I’m content with it. My goal is to keep the system fast enough to run any game near its highest graphical settings, but I don’t usually buy the latest components right when they release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d8GlZxwDQ1S3wGXtBAv_5sbzHVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277288/cfaulkner_210201_4392_0024.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ovDzLA7AN-NbKBuUorMAp1JmC0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277283/cfaulkner_210201_4392_0018.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oDZBCBHrnp7mgdsaekhRB1qE4eM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277282/cfaulkner_210201_4392_0017.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iqEPT8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see you have two displays. How do you use them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sePysG"&gt;I like to keep my static batch of Google Chrome tabs open on the left screen (apps like Gmail, Google Drive, Asana task management, etc.), along with any article I’m currently writing. On the right side is where I keep Slack, as well as tabs that are more temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aQPr2"&gt;Outside of work, I game on the left monitor (a 27-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Acer-XV272U-Pbmiiprzx-Technology-DisplayHDR400/dp/B07MQBPMJ2?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=f206e718f9ea664f49ee39125db521d3&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Acer Nitro XV272U&lt;/a&gt;) because it’s a QHD IPS panel with a fast refresh rate and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility.  Having a two-monitor setup was something that I got used to having in our work office, so I purchased a second one (a 27-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-27GL650F-B-Ultragear-Compatible-Monitor/dp/B07R7636MH?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b3c2a4268610cc93a0ce14b6ad545c34&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG 27GL650F-B&lt;/a&gt;) for myself a few months into the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vurGKV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10318357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lE2BTu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your other tech (headphones, speakers, etc.)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxYF4C"&gt;A few devices that always have a spot on my desk are a mouse (whichever one I’m testing at the moment) and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Ergonomic-Keyboard-Business-5KV-00001/dp/B00CYX26BC?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=449c04aa3e829f8e1b14a20ebf384f43&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Sculpt keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, along with my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Pebbles-Stereo-Computer-Speakers/dp/B00F8HRSN2?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=88b985f80f59c56abdd4025260c8dfe7&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;JBL Pebble desktop speakers&lt;/a&gt;. JBL doesn’t make these USB-powered speakers anymore, so they currently cost more than they originally sold for (and are worth), but I really enjoy their simplicity and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9V59w3"&gt;I keep my company &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacbook-pro%2F&amp;amp;xcust=verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro laptop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/dp/B07G4MNFS1?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=aa7faac466a0fb028a74ae84cbe3a61c&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt; headset (hanging on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Master-Dynamic-MP1000S-Headphone-Stand/dp/B00NGX45FE?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=498ff54d18479f9f2ad71d290c5e9aa9&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Master &amp;amp; Dynamic stand&lt;/a&gt;) on the top of my desk when I need to join a meeting at a moment’s notice. There’s also my phone, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;Google Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt;, sitting on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lamicall-Cell-Phone-Stand-Dock/dp/B014INJCT4?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=344bfc5337157eeb710daf632022e164&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;metal Lamicall stand&lt;/a&gt;. Under my desk, I have a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brainwavz-Headphone-Holder-Gaming-Headsets/dp/B07T1HBBSG?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=16de5af2010346a8b5cd20c4a1dd7d1f&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brainwavz BigT headphone hanger&lt;/a&gt; to keep an extra pair handy. I also like to hang a long USB-C cable on it that’s used for connecting to my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-2/dp/B08F7PTF53?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=05f9c17b334ce35602c9cbc4c6c384c8&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 headset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8jlVXz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10318379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wgOlLK"&gt;Tucked nearly out of sight on my desk is our Ethernet switch, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Nest-WiFi-Router-Generation/dp/B07YMKD6SM?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=eb3cb7d6fabdbaf93399c8f7c8c76794&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Wifi wireless router&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Stand-Alone-Bridge/dp/B016H0QZ7I?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=7c07c9c84f2796dd57e07804ad5220a8&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Philips Hue bridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIaqBV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really interesting keyboard. I’ve seen split keyboards like that, but never actually met somebody who uses one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MDDos"&gt;I didn’t think I’d be someone who would use one of these, but about a month into the pandemic, I was ending each day with sore wrists and forearms. There were plenty of pricier ergonomic keyboards out there, especially ones with mechanical keys, but the Microsoft Sculpt seemed like a good fit because it’s wireless and relatively affordable. It helps to orient my wrists in a more natural way while typing, and it makes a huge difference for me. The material used in the wrist rest actually gets kind of grimey after a few weeks of use, but dampening it with water and soap works well enough at restoring its original look.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qyuylS5RQ4xflwW_5vnv9guXlCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277278/cfaulkner_210128_4392_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="KfijqX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10318484"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="omoOuo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see that, like others here, you sometimes depend on an old-fashioned notebook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNjXsu"&gt;Yep! I used one in the office and like to keep one here with me at my desk. It’s all too easy for an important task to get buried in Chrome tabs, or to forget about a due date that’s coming up. It’s simply the best way I know how to stay on task for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVMEkR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything significant about your Dreamcast cup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8ymr9"&gt;I’m a big fan of the Sega Dreamcast console, but the cup itself is significant because I purchased it at Super Potato, a popular video game store in Tokyo’s Akihabara section. I’m not big on getting souvenirs from places, but I knew I had to bring this one back to the US. I don’t even drink from it. (I’m too scared to break it.) I just keep little things in it, like pens, portable hard drives, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>HP’s Spectre x360 14 review: the best 2-in-1 you can buy</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Perfection, for a price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ElfjNL"&gt;I have used a heck of a lot of laptops in the past year, and some of them are quite nice. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; have nailed the “premium” look and feel for years, and I’ll never waste an opportunity to gush about the build quality of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell’s XPS line&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9Bacy"&gt;But I’ve never touched a consumer laptop as gorgeous as the Spectre x360 14. The new Spectre’s sturdy black body, lustrous accents, and boldly sharp edges would make it a standout among convertible laptops across the board, even if it didn’t have a slew of other excellent qualities — which, from its 3:2 screen and packaged stylus to its stellar performance and battery life, it absolutely does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYsUFd"&gt;With a starting MSRP of $1,299.99 ($1,589.99 as tested) the Spectre x360 is easily my new favorite 2-in-1 laptop. Today’s market is full of capable convertibles that look good, work well, and do certain things really well. But while the Spectre x360 14 isn’t a perfect laptop, it tops the pack in almost every area. It’s a stylish chassis, premium panel options, stylus support, a powerful processor, and fantastic battery in one. It’s proof that you can have it all — for a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fzPwnD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10318703"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N83jRV"&gt;The HP Spectre line is second to none when it comes to design, and this latest model is no exception. Like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21022770/hp-spectre-x360-13-2019-laptop-2-in-1-convertible-review-price-specs-features"&gt;13-inch predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, the Spectre x360 14 is made of CNC-machined aluminum. Also like its siblings, you can get the 14 in “nightfall black,” “Poseidon blue,” or “natural silver.” Take a look at some pictures before selecting your color because they each have pretty different vibes. The nightfall black option has a sophisticated, svelte aesthetic that looks tailor-made for a boardroom. Poseidon blue is friendlier and probably the one I’d go for myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGxIXx"&gt;The accents, though, are what make the Spectre stand out from the legions of other black laptops out there. Lustrous trim borders the lid, the touchpad, and the deck. The hinges share its color, as does the HP logo on its lid. It’s bold without being obnoxious. The two rear corners are diamond-shaped, and one of them houses a Thunderbolt 4 port on its flat edge. (On the sides live an audio jack, a USB-A, a microSD slot, and an additional Thunderbolt 4, which is a decent selection — gone is the trapdoor that covered the USB-A port on the 13-inch model.) And the edges are all beveled, making the notebook appear thinner than it actually is (it’s 0.67 inches thick). Careful craftsmanship is evident here — I’m not exaggerating when I say this Spectre feels like artwork.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Spectre x360 14 sits open on top of a piano. The screen displays a blue and white background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oTaS3t8yz6f1jWxkUi2gr5y8Tl0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279294/mchin_190429_4395_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take it in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2n0E6h"&gt;And, as the “x360” moniker implies, the Spectre is a 2-in-1. At 2.95 pounds, it’s a bit heavy to use as a tablet for long periods, but it’s smooth and easy to fold and the hinges are quite sturdy. Unlike with many convertibles, there’s barely any wobble when you use the touchscreen. The display is also stylus-compatible; the Spectre ships with HP’s MPP2.0 pen, which attaches magnetically to the side of the chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9EH4T"&gt;Despite its design similarities, this Spectre looks noticeably different from its ancestors, and that’s because of the screen. The new model has a 3:2 display, which is 13 percent taller than the 16:9 panel on last year’s device. (It’s kept the same 90 percent screen-to-body ratio.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GZF6Sw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s barely any wobble when you use the touchscreen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zvqNLG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface devices&lt;/a&gt; have been using the 3:2 aspect ratio for years, and I’m glad that the Spectre line is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7"&gt;finally making the switch&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re used to using a 16:9 display (which many modern Windows laptops have) and you give a 3:2 a shot, you’ll see what I mean. You have significantly more vertical space, which means less scrolling up and down and less zooming out to fit everything you want to see. It makes multitasking significantly easier without adding much size to the chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMecpb"&gt;This 3:2 panel can come in a few different forms. My test unit has an FHD option that HP says should reach 400 nits of brightness. I measured it multiple times, but it only reached 285 in my testing — which is dimmer than I’d hope to see from a device at this price point. I’ve reached out to HP to see what’s up and will update this review if it turns out to be a bug. (Of course, 285 nits is still more than enough for indoor office work.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Spectre x360 keyboard angled to the right, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/01OVkXhSal0LsU_lQG4pIKRsUYw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279296/mchin_190429_4395_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OLED panel is certified for “low blue light.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I7vd1I"&gt;In addition to the FHD display, you can opt for a 3000 x 2000 OLED panel (HP didn’t provide a brightness estimate for this one; &lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/hp-spectre-x360-14"&gt;&lt;em&gt;LaptopMag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; measured it at 339 nits) or a 1,000-nit option with HP’s Sure View Reflect technology, which makes the screen difficult to read from the sides. This will mostly be a benefit for business users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKkQwp"&gt;In terms of other specs, the base model pairs the 400-nit screen with a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of memory, and 256GB of storage (plus 16GB of Intel Optane). Then, there are a few upgrades you can go for. My test unit, priced at $1,589.99, keeps the base model’s screen but has a heftier processor (the quad-core Core i7-1165G7) and double its RAM and storage. I think this model is a good option for most people — it gets you a top processor and a good amount of storage without too stratospheric of a price tag. If you want to get fancier, you can get the OLED screen and 1TB of storage (plus 32GB of Intel Optane) for $1,699, or the Sure View screen and 2TB of storage for $1,959.99.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3DMar"&gt;Of course, laptops aren’t just for looking at, but you’re not compromising on performance to get this build quality. The Spectre is verified through Intel’s Evo platform, which means that it offers a number of Intel-selected benefits including Thunderbolt 4, Wi-Fi 6, all-day battery life, quick boot time, fast charging, and reliable performance. In my testing, it more than surpassed those standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The back left corner of HP Spectre x360 14 up close." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/66wdDIYOi3WwYN_8IbNURb4V5fc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279300/mchin_190429_4395_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a single USB 3.2 Type-A port on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The back right corner of the HP Spectre x360 14, up close." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hm0woa6hJr_GN4cqGgrDa6-4t-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279299/mchin_190429_4395_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the right: two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports, one audio jack, one microSD card slot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SryCPQ"&gt;The system handled my heavy workload of Chrome tabs, downloads, and streams speedily with no issues. Battery life was excellent; I averaged 10 hours of continuous use with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. That means if your daily tasks are similar to mine, the Spectre should make it through your workday with no problem. (You’ll likely get less if you opt for the OLED panel.) The processor also includes Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics. While you wouldn’t want to use those for serious gaming, they’re capable of running lighter fare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Vz9Eg"&gt;Elsewhere, I have almost no complaints. The backlit keyboard is snappy with a solid click — it’s easily one of my favorites. The speakers sound good, with very audible bass and percussion. There’s a fingerprint sensor to the left of the arrow keys and a Windows Hello camera, neither of which gave me any trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VXGHdZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I have almost no complaints&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eSETcC"&gt;Apart from the dimness, there are only two things about this laptop that I’m not in love with. They’re both minor; the fact that I’m even mentioning either of them in this review is a testament to how excellent this device is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Do3FEc"&gt;The first is the touchpad. It’s quite smooth and roomy (16.6 percent larger than that of last year’s Spectre x360 13) and handles scrolling and gestures just fine. But it’s noticeably stiffer than some of the best touchpads on the market. The press required to physically click is firm enough that I ended up doing it with my thumb most of the time. On the likes of the Dell XPS 13 and the MacBook, clicking with a finger is much less of a chore. When I first clicked with the integrated buttons, I also had to overcome some initial resistance to hit the actuation point (put plainly, every click felt like two clicks). This issue resolved itself during my second day of testing, but it’s still a hiccup I generally only see with cheaper items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Spectre x360 angled to the right, seen from above, with the lid half closed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/77sw6GQXcjmTzkSaF1zs8RkSGAQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279298/mchin_190429_4395_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My complaints are minor — this is almost perfect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tPmvWG"&gt;Secondly, bloatware. There are a number of junk programs preloaded onto the Spectre and several pinned to the taskbar. Dropbox, ExpressVPN, McAfee, and Netflix are all on here, and I got all kinds of notifications from them. This is an oddity at this price point, and seeing cheap McAfee alerts popping up on the Spectre is like seeing really ugly bumper stickers on a Ferrari. This software doesn’t take too long to uninstall, but I’m disappointed to see it nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPccJl"&gt;But those are really the only two complaints I have, and neither of them should stop you from buying this laptop. It’s beautiful to look at and a dream to use. I found myself using it in my free time instead of my personal device (which almost never happens with review units — I really like my products). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="kSk2vo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10318535"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rca27c"&gt;When we’re evaluating a convertible laptop at the Spectre’s price point, the big question is how it compares to the gold standard of Windows convertibles, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;. The XPS has a few advantages: it’s a bit thinner and lighter, its touchpad is less stiff, and it has a more modest look that some users might prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I1Or3b"&gt;But for me, the ball game is close but clear. The Spectre x360’s meticulous craftsmanship, classy aesthetic, and 3:2 screen put it over the top. It also edges out the XPS in a few key areas: the keyboard is more comfortable, the battery life is better, and Dell’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fnew-xps-13-2-in-1-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-2-in-1-laptop%2Fx29310ekfkh%3Fview%3Dconfigurations&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22264792%2Fhp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;closest-priced configuration&lt;/a&gt; to this unit only has half its storage. The Spectre’s smaller amenities that the XPS lacks — like the bundled stylus, the USB-A port, the blue color, and the OLED option — are icing on the cake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="o0mWjO"&gt;If you’re looking for a premium Windows convertible with a classy aesthetic, that makes the Spectre a no-brainer purchase. This is HP at its best; it’s a luxury laptop in pretty much every area. I can’t imagine that it won’t be the next laptop I buy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I love my weird Belkin wireless charging tree thing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDB-gpLkUEmu3lrdmAmosYNnh4E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767462/DSCF7493.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qxoDeO"&gt;A $139.95 wireless charger that looks like a cross between a bonsai tree and the decor from 2001: A Space Odyssey might seem like a niche product. But if you have an iPhone 12 and an Apple Watch, Belkin’s ridiculously named &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHPGA2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-boost%25E2%2586%2591charge-pro-3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-magsafe-white&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22265910%2Fbelkin-magsafe-3-in-1-wireless-charger-hands-on-iphone-12-watch#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Boost↑Charge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charger with MagSafe&lt;/a&gt; is actually great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHeoqa"&gt;Charging Apple devices has gotten more complicated recently, at least for me. Now that the Apple Watch tracks sleep, I’ve been charging it with a messy cable at my desk for an hour or so when I start the day, instead of overnight. And while I prefer to use vertical wireless chargers so I can read notifications as they come in, the iPhone 12 mini turns out to be too small for most stands — the charging coil isn’t high enough on the back of the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tN13sD"&gt;Belkin’s new charger not only solves both of those problems, it makes wireless charging a better experience than ever before. The tree-like design has two stainless steel “branches” — one on the left with a 15W MagSafe puck for the iPhone, and one on the right with an Apple Watch charger. There’s also a 5W Qi charger embedded in the base, which should work with pretty much any Qi device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="E175fr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Apple MagSafe Duo charger is overpriced and under-delivers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="69eALR"&gt;This is the first official third-party MagSafe charger, and I find it far more useful than either of Apple’s own options. It props the phone up at the perfect height for quick glances when you’re at your desk, and the charger’s base is sturdy enough that you can attach and detach the phone one-handed without the base moving around. The phone feels very secure either by itself or in Apple’s MagSafe-compatible leather case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xCbdZPmuI9xcJD6JpD91HKuWEY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280659/DSCF7495.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZL1ffo"&gt;The Apple Watch charger works equally well, and I’m glad that something like this ended up on my desk instead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;Apple’s ill-fated AirPower universal charger&lt;/a&gt;. That device was supposed to charge the Watch as well as the iPhone, but it probably wouldn’t have worked with the loop-style bands I usually wear as they’d get in the way of the watch’s charging element. This solution works with all watch bands, and it’s much more convenient than fiddling with a cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="treFM4"&gt;The Qi charger on the base does what you’d expect it to. It’s ideal for low-powered Qi devices like AirPods that only charge at up to 5W, but it’s fine for Android phones too as long as you’re not in need of a fast charge. The base is big enough to fit larger phones without the steel stand getting in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQvjKo"&gt;My biggest complaint with this charger is that the power supply uses a barrel jack instead of USB-C, but it’s not a big deal for something that will never leave my desk. It’s still not for everyone, of course. You might reasonably think the design is too weird or the price too steep. I personally like the way it looks, though, and while it’s certainly not cheap, I think it’s better value than either of Apple’s MagSafe chargers so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKp3Nb"&gt;Belkin also makes a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219529/belkin-magsafe-dock-charging-wireless-ces-2021-earbuds"&gt;similar MagSafe dock without an Apple Watch charger&lt;/a&gt; for $100, which is probably a better option for most people. If you’ve found yourself with my specific charging dilemmas of late, however, I can recommend the 3-in-1 version pretty highly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube ends support for old 2012 Apple TV, but you can still use AirPlay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CYs8_m4v-W895j4klNtUj3zRFh8=/0x0:1037x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767426/appletv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-generation Apple TV was first released in 2012. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EILhF7"&gt;Starting next month, YouTube will no longer be natively available to stream on the third-generation Apple TV, first released in 2012. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/03/older-apple-tv-will-require-airplay-for-youtube-video-playback-starting-next-month/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9To5Mac-MacAllDay+%289+to+5+Mac+-+Apple+Intelligence%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that a message is being displayed to users warning them of the upcoming change. The fourth-gen Apple TV HD  and fifth-gen Apple TV 4K, the two streaming boxes Apple currently sells, are unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBrOF4"&gt;Here’s the full message being shown to users (via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XD67VZ"&gt;Starting early March, the YouTube app will no longer be available on Apple TV (3rd generation). You can still watch YouTube on Apple TV 4K, Apple TV HD, iPhone, or iPad. With AirPlay, you can also stream YouTube from your iOS device directly to any Apple TV (3rd generation or later).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Vf39WS"&gt;While it will soon no longer be possible to natively run YouTube on the third-generation Apple TV itself, owners will still be able to stream the service from an iPhone or iPad using AirPlay. We’ve got a guide on how to do so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21248047/airplay-apple-tv-how-to-stream-iphone-macbook-watch-video"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mh9Ikh"&gt;Other streaming services have also gradually been dropping support for older Apple TV models. Last year, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/05/17/hbo-now-app-removed-from-2nd-and-3rd-gen-apple-tv-as-hbo-ends-support/"&gt;HBO pulled its HBO Now app&lt;/a&gt; from second- and third-generation Apple TV boxes, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216451/hbo-go-max-apple-tv-third-gen-support-extended-april"&gt;initially delaying the move&lt;/a&gt; due to the pandemic. These apps won’t be the last, either. While its newer devices run tvOS and feature a built-in App Store, the built-in apps on Apple’s old TV boxes relied on streaming services working directly with Apple to offer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s44vlE"&gt;If you own an old Apple TV and simply can’t live without the YouTube app, then it might be time to replace your streaming device. Our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"&gt;current top picks&lt;/a&gt; for the job are the Roku Streaming Stick Plus and Roku Premiere, which are both more affordable than Apple’s current lineup of streaming devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new CEO says it’s not done making video games, despite problems</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VpZKxCXHnWSfbBrex_Q-Uf09VCQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767228/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lNyzLd"&gt;Amazon’s incoming CEO, Andy Jassy, says he’s committed to Amazon’s video game development efforts, in response to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-29/amazon-game-studios-struggles-to-find-a-hit?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;damning report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week about the problems facing the team. “Some businesses take off in the first year, and others take many years,” Jassy wrote in a staff email &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/andy-jassy-next-amazon-ceo-says-he-s-committed-to-making-video-games?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Though we haven’t consistently succeeded yet in AGS [Amazon Game Studios], I believe we will if we hang in there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQoXul"&gt;“Being successful right away is obviously less stressful, but when it takes longer, it’s often sweeter,” Jassy continued. “I believe this team will get there if we stay focused on what matters most.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KaoMsI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Being successful right away is obviously less stressful, but when it takes longer, it’s often sweeter”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AKpYBO"&gt;The message comes at a critical time for Amazon Game Studios, the e-commerce giant’s video game development arm. The decision to set up the division reportedly came directly from outgoing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who recently announced he is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;stepping down from the position later this year&lt;/a&gt; to be replaced by current Amazon Web Services head Andy Jassy. With the company reportedly spending almost $500 million a year on its as-yet unsuccessful video game division, it’s important that it has the support of the incoming CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fgh2ND"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s previous report alleged that Amazon Game Studios has faced a host of problems including a studio head who lacks experience in video games, a “painfully slow” in-house game engine, and a “bro culture” that doesn’t give women the same opportunities as men. In response to the report, studio head Mike Frazzini has reportedly emailed the team, saying that there’s “zero tolerance” for “anything less than a fully equitable and inclusive environment.” In his email this week, Jassy expressed support for Frazzini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSQujC"&gt;Despite Jassy’s support, Amazon Game Studios is still facing challenges. Last year it released, and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;pulled and cancelled&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crucible&lt;/em&gt;, a hero shooter that drew inspiration from &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;. Another of its tentpole games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320325/amazon-new-world-delayed-spring-2021-crucible"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New World,&lt;/em&gt; was also delayed&lt;/a&gt;, while a video game adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Grand Tour&lt;/em&gt; was released to such poor reviews in 2019 that it was later &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/support/the-grand-tour-game/contact-us?selectedCategory=knvoHwbjb7jhI9UTc7Bwc&amp;amp;selectedIssue=6mv76MwH3RghqKo988Cl14"&gt;removed from storefronts&lt;/a&gt;. AGS might have the support of Amazon’s next CEO, but it’s got a long way to go if it wants to earn the support of players.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bang &amp; Olufsen wants its new Beosound Level to outlast your average connected speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2UmWk02WaWaQ-89lSjQS0waIcmw=/1x0:1600x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767124/CS_Level__wood__5.tif.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beosound Level is available with wood or fabric finishes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pd7iNU"&gt;Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen’s Beosound Level is the Danish brand’s latest battery-powered connected speaker. It supports voice controls via Google Assistant, Bluetooth, and you can also stream to it via the AirPlay 2, Chromecast, and Spotify Connect standards. B&amp;amp;O says the Beosound Level uses a modular construction that it claims will make it usable far into the future. It’s a welcome feature, considering the speaker’s high $1,499 (£1,099) starting price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPdH9g"&gt;While many stereos and amplifiers from the middle of the last century can still be used today, the average lifespan of modern integrated audio systems is far shorter. If your music system contains a computer, then it’s inevitable that it’ll eventually become outdated. B&amp;amp;O’s hope is that the modular design it’s using for the Beosound Level will help the company keep it supported for longer, as well as making it easier to repair when components fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u9NQ4JyqbVwWT8bWUztyLLCT1es=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278651/CS_Level__fabric__1.tif.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beosound Level can be wall mounted...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4j8gJmwmZVFV6VQU8juXJL8YFC4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278652/CS_Level__wood__1.tif.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...or used as a freestanding speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YNmd68"&gt;Central to this modularity is the Beosound Level’s streaming module, which houses the speaker’s digital signal processing (DSP) chip, wireless connectivity tech, and antenna array. It’s B&amp;amp;O’s first speaker to use it, but the company says it won’t be the last; it’ll be standardized across its future lineup of home speakers. B&amp;amp;O says there’s enough processing headroom in the hardware that ships with the Beosound Level that it should be able to handle updates in the immediate future. But when the hardware reaches its limit, the company plans to offer an upgrade service for users who are prepared to send their device in to the company to have the streaming module replaced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFPNXQ"&gt;The Beosound Level’s battery is also modular, and unlike the streaming module, it’s user-replaceable. However, its form factor won’t be standardized across B&amp;amp;O’s speaker lineup, so replacing it will require a battery made specifically for the Beosound Level. Battery life is rated at up to 16 hours with volumes at moderate levels, dropping to four hours at max volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5aUz6zQbX6ew7-7-1Z4uyJ9cmQ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278655/CS_Level__wood__4.tif.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A magnetically attaching disc can be used to charge the speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xL3roo0AwpHZtJ02PwzutPz_u5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278845/BangOlufsen_BeoSoundLevel_MeroxCMA_Warm_14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang and Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beosound Level’s modular components.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LI9Qhi"&gt;Other features include a built-in accelerometer that allows the Beosound Level to adjust its sound depending on whether it’s standing vertically, horizontally, or hanging on a wall. (A wall bracket is available separately for $119, or £89.) Internally, the speaker has five drivers: two 4-inch woofers, one 2-inch full-range driver, and two 0.8-inch tweeters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9a8D90"&gt;Charging is either handled via a USB-C port on the speaker itself or by attaching a small magnetic plug (which is powered over USB). The speaker has an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance, touch controls, and it’s available with wood or fabric finishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Z6XQv"&gt;We’ve seen companies try to take modular approaches with their devices before, but success has been elusive so far. Modular smartphones have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14172070/lg-next-flagship-g6-smartphone-friends-modules-ces-2017"&gt;never&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12775922/google-project-ara-modular-phone-suspended-confirm"&gt;really&lt;/a&gt; gotten off the ground, and Alienware’s promises about a modular future-proof laptop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;fell apart after just one year&lt;/a&gt;. Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen tells me it hopes to support the Beosound Level for years after it eventually stops producing the speaker, so it might be some time before we see if it’s able to deliver on its goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDgIa3"&gt;The Beosound Level is available starting today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If Twitter’s dark mode has recently changed for you, you’re not alone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/md38uSlRwmgL0w4XB5xw0uWS4xo=/0x93:1376x1010/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68766315/Screen_Shot_2021_02_03_at_3.53.27_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not the familiar dark blue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0UeeSN"&gt;The feeling of opening Twitter and noticing that something’s &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; probably isn’t a new one, but it usually isn’t related to the site’s color scheme. Yet some users (and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff) are now seeing that Twitter’s desktop dark mode has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/johncoryk/status/1357003602842292225"&gt;gotten darker&lt;/a&gt;, or worse, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GarbageApe/status/1357074376953323521"&gt;been changed to light mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xe92UL"&gt;Twitter tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the change from blue to black was intentional — it’s part of an update to make the Twitter website respond to the light and dark modes on your OS. Of course, if you miss the dark blue, you can bring it back by going to Twitter’s display settings and choosing Dim mode (instead of the inky black Lights Out or the bright Default), and the site should remember that preference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Nye0M"&gt;If your Twitter switched from dark mode to light, though, the company says that wasn’t supposed to happen. That was caused by a bug, and could’ve happened to you if you had Twitter set to Dim or Lights Out mode but had your OS in light mode. Head to your display settings to change that back, if you want. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of Twitter’s accent and background color settings" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-LvZe-3xmBSYfj5R4pGqTPsMMlg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280097/Screen_Shot_2021_02_03_at_5.09.16_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter should remember your color and background settings after you choose one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xpVeYb"&gt;While you’re there, you can also choose an accent color, if you’re tired of blue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Alexa can now help find a COVID test or ruin your morning with Minions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ig-JGJFUKULDO-b4P6X_qcvrLBs=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68766104/dseifert_201025_4263_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EzzUls"&gt;Amazon added a few abilities to Alexa last month, introducing a variety of Super Bowl-related skills and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249044/amazon-alexa-update-proactive-hunches-guard-plus-subscription"&gt;the ability to do home automation on its own&lt;/a&gt;, but today the company’s telling us about some new alarm and COVID skills that snuck under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VA0GnI"&gt;You’ve been able to set custom alarms and alarm sounds using Alexa devices for a while now, but now you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NBCUniversal-Media-LLC-Minions-Alarm/dp/B08R978HDV/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=minion&amp;amp;qid=1612394275&amp;amp;s=digital-skills&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;do it with Minion sounds&lt;/a&gt;, if you just haven’t been waking up angry enough. The sounds include such classics as “Peep Peep Peep”, “Banana,” or “Boing Boing Boing!” Lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rp4Rg5"&gt;There are now a variety of branded alarms available for Alexa, including sounds from Disney, Spongebob, Jurassic World, and Harry Potter. They can be set by saying “Alexa, wake me up to Minions/Jurassic World/Spongebob/etc alarm tone.” Some of the alarm tones are free, some can be expanded with in-skill purchases, and some cost money, starting at $1.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCmtbg"&gt;The alarm sounds can be added by asking your Alexa device for them, and you can also browse and add them in the Android version of the Alexa app. If you’re using the iOS version of the app, you’ll just have to read the list and ask your smart speaker to install them. It seems Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers"&gt;was able to work out a deal with Apple to get Prime video rentals working&lt;/a&gt;, but not Alexa skill payment processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lICnS2"&gt;Turning to skills that could be slightly more useful, Alexa can now help you find the nearest COVID testing site, or help you find vaccine trials. Asking Alexa “where can I get tested for COVID” will make it read out a list of the nearby places you can get tested at. You can then have Alexa call one of the locations if you want more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QscwZE"&gt;If you’re looking for vaccine trials, you can also ask “Alexa find a COVID trial”, and it’ll look for any within 30 miles of you, using research organization IQVIA to search for trials. Of course, this is information that you could find on the internet yourself, but it might be a convenient option if you don’t mind Amazon knowing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Don’t buy Teslas during a production ramp, Elon Musk says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h4psoip0hoqOweF9LfHc97V-k0I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68766096/sokane_181116_3101_fremont_0053.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qkcit7"&gt;The quality of Tesla’s cars suffers any time the company dramatically scales up production, CEO Elon Musk admitted in a February 2nd interview. Musk also said that Tesla was making cars so fast near the end of 2020 that it was messing up the paint jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xenZiH"&gt;Tesla has gotten a lot of criticism for the quality of its cars, especially after it started making them at relatively high volumes with the Model 3 and Model Y. But in the interview with industry analyst Sandy Munro, Musk was unusually candid about quality control problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBnWih"&gt;“It took us a while to kind of iron out the production process. Friends ask me: ‘When should I buy a Tesla?’ And I’m like: ‘Well, either buy it right at the beginning, or when the production reaches a steady state,’” Musk said in the interview. “But during that production ramp, it’s super hard to be in vertical climb mode and get everything right on the little details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xHCbJG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YAtLTLiqNwg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQJKVX"&gt;Munro then asked why his brand new Model 3 sedan had paint issues, when another one built a month later that he saw was “spectacular.” Musk replied that Tesla had improved its paint quality “toward the end of last year, even in the course of December.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thYxfT"&gt;While the Model 3 is now more than three years old, Tesla spent much of 2020 trying to hit an ambitious target set by Musk of selling 500,000 vehicles. That push apparently led to more quality problems with the paint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tPGfo"&gt;“One of the things that was happening when we were ramping production was the paint wasn’t necessarily drying enough,” Musk said. “So, it’s like, if you go faster... it’s like, you just discover these things. Like, If we knew them in advance, we would fix them in advance,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mf3BeD"&gt;Munro is well known for tearing down cars of all types, but his critiques of Tesla’s vehicles are especially popular. His examination of a Model 3 in 2018 was particularly tough, &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/tesla-model-3-teardown-by-engineering-firm-reveals-qual-1822678045"&gt;comparing the quality to a Kia from the 1990s&lt;/a&gt;. “I cant imagine how they released this,” Munro said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxwZVK"&gt;“I thought your criticisms were accurate,” Musk said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lKrKx"&gt;It’s one of the more illuminating interviews Musk has granted in a long while. He and Munro also &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/in-epically-nerdy-interview-elon-musk-discusses-build-1846181756"&gt;went deep&lt;/a&gt; on a number of other Tesla topics, like the company’s custom seats, how it’s trying to avoid similar quality problems with the Model Y SUV, Autopilot, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="u2As8L"&gt;Parler, of course, is the social network that found itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"&gt;wholly deplatformed&lt;/a&gt; after its role in the January 6th riots at the US Capitol. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Both Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; removed the app from their app stores after being unsatisfied with the company’s attempts to moderate the spread of calls for violence. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;Amazon decided&lt;/a&gt; to terminate the company’s AWS website hosting completely. And though Parler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225072/parler-amazon-web-services-lawsuit-antitrust-twitter-capitol-riot-incitement-moderation"&gt;did try to sue Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22231457/parler-amazon-web-services-lawsuit-judge-preliminary-injunction-denied"&gt;denied a demand&lt;/a&gt; for its website hosting to be reinstated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIwp1a"&gt;On January 10th, Matze told Fox News that all the company’s vendors — and even its lawyers — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223956/parler-ceo-john-matze-lawyers-vendors-abandoning"&gt;had abandoned him.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZyYgKS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"These are the violent threats that made Amazon drop Parler","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"},{"title":"Why platforms had to cut off Trump and Parler","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EUsa7Z"&gt;Today, Matze claims he was terminated by a board led by Rebekah Mercer (of the Mercer family, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/14/21565344/parler-funding-conservative-mercer-app-trump-twitter-facebook"&gt;who are prominent conservative donors&lt;/a&gt;), and suggested he was fired due to his “strong belief in free speech” and his product vision, including “what I believe is a more effective approach to content moderation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sp0M7X"&gt;It might also have something to do with the company getting run into the ground under his watch. In addition to the difficulties of simply staying up on the internet, it came to light that Parler may have had some privacy issues. Researchers were able to scrape a tremendous amount of users’ content, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224689/parler-posts-gps-data-archived-independent-researchers-amazon-apple-google-capitol"&gt;including their geotagged locations and videos&lt;/a&gt;, which were later converted into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231749/parler-interactive-map-video-gps-capitol-attack"&gt;interactive maps of the Capitol building attack&lt;/a&gt; that proved many Parler users were involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZPwVp"&gt;The House Oversight Committee even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242595/house-oversight-parler-fbi-investigation-carolyn-maloney-chris-wray"&gt;called for an FBI investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Parler’s involvement in the attack on the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyCPib"&gt;Parler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22236178/parler-resurfaces-sunday-app-banned"&gt;does currently have a website again&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the hosting services of Epik, a company that also supports controversial websites like Gab and 8chan, and Parler suggested on January 17th that it hoped “to welcome all of you back soon.” But that was over two weeks ago, and the website is mostly a timeline of grievances about how the company has been treated unjustly. Matze hasn’t posted there since Monday, January 26th. His last post was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241049/bernie-sanders-inauguration-sitting-meme"&gt;a Bernie Sanders meme&lt;/a&gt; with the text “I wish that John guy would hurry up already.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Iub5X2"&gt;Apparently, Rebekah Mercer agreed with that sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUACSk"&gt;Parler didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
