    <title>Elon Musk demos Cyberpunk 2077 on new Tesla infotainment system with ‘PS5-level performance’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csMQtv3bmEp0pLecqSiFsaA5H7w=/47x0:554x338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69438425/ezgif.com_gif_maker__1_.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9fuyjF"&gt;Elon Musk teased that Tesla’s new Model S Plaid would be capable of running &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253258/tesla-model-s-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-10-teraflop"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, and he’s now demonstrated the car’s “PS5-level performance.” The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528963/tesla-model-s-plaid-ev-price-specs-range-speed"&gt;refreshed Model S&lt;/a&gt; includes a new Tesla infotainment system, powered by AMD’s Ryzen processor and a discrete AMD RDNA 2 GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dp6EmB"&gt;“There’s never been a car that has state of the art computing technology, state of the art infotainment where this is literally at the level of a PlayStation 5,” said Tesla CEO Elon Musk during a demo event last night. “This is actual PlayStation 5-level performance… yes it can run Cyberpunk. It’s high frame rate, it will do 60fps with state of the art games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="69lohi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kUmkbzQ-BS0?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1402&amp;amp;start=1402" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sge1cB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462660/amd-tesla-model-x-s-plaid-ryzen-radeon-rdna-2"&gt;AMD revealed last week&lt;/a&gt; that it’s powering this new infotainment system in both the new Model S and Model X, with 10 teraflops of compute power. That in itself is nearly identical to the 10.28 teraflops found on Sony’s PlayStation 5, although Tesla’s total compute includes both the integrated and discrete GPUs so it won’t be a full 10 teraflops for gaming alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQIlk8"&gt;We only saw a brief demo of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; running at high frame rates on the $130,000 Model S Plaid during Tesla’s event, alongside a closer look at the updated UI on the infotainment system. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Tesla-branded controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UlEpZm"&gt;In separate demonstrations after the event, some Tesla fans were able to get pictures of what appears to be a Tesla-branded game controller. It’s not clear if the controller, which mimics the shape of the car’s steering wheel, is a dummy unit or not. It appears alongside an Xbox controller in a photo published by &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/nx7ccw/cyberpunk_2077_running_on_the_model_s_plaid/"&gt;Reddit users&lt;/a&gt; (above), and videos seem to show the Xbox controller being used to play Cyberpunk 2077.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORNRf5"&gt;You might be wondering why you’d need PS5-level gaming performance in your car, which the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331315/elon-musk-tesla-technoking-title-ceo"&gt;Technoking&lt;/a&gt; is happy to answer. “If you think about the future of where the car is often in autopilot or full self-driving mode, then entertainment is going to become increasing important,” said Musk. Until that’s a reality, we’re hoping to see the folks at &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt; benchmark a car running the latest AAA games against powerful PCs, the PS5, and the Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The red PS5 controller is a different red to the red Xbox Series X controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZqL86okr8EMhPXuMmqHVBAPeIsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69438344/DSCF7709.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S4I2TZ"&gt;While the PS5’s divisive two-tone design has led some to swap out large pieces of plastic for a more unified look, this month did at least see Sony release some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22433966/sony-black-red-dualsense-controllers-playstation-5-ps5"&gt;official new color options&lt;/a&gt; for the excellent DualSense controller. There are now “cosmic red” and “midnight black” models that might appeal to you more than the black and white default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BuG4t5"&gt;The black controller doesn’t seem all that interesting, but as a fan of red objects I ordered the red one in to see how it looks in person. The color is actually quite unusual — Sony’s marketing info places the controller in front of a bright red nebula, in keeping with the “cosmic red” name, and it’s a pretty good match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geLs7i"&gt;Basically, it’s a little pinker than you might expect, falling somewhere between crimson, ruby, and raspberry. I think it looks good with the black trim and manages to feel appropriate for the PS5’s aesthetic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6nkqh"&gt;And yes, the tiny PlayStation symbols microtexture is back, though it’s still pretty much impossible to see with the naked eye:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F2QWKjpISx1Wjn5fBwP0DUWtvnM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652298/IMG20210611164840.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A close-up of the new PS5 controller’s microtexture.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="K0u2eI"&gt;Sony is quite slow to release its first PS5 controller color variations. Microsoft had black, white, and blue options available at the launch of the Xbox Series X and Series S, and soon followed up with red, yellow, and camo options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EM1dRK"&gt;I have the red Series X controller too, and it’s a much more straightforward, primary-color shade than the PS5. The difference is clear when they’re next to each other. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oQVtruKBOj--ZMrveuNpVcsCLys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652295/DSCF7709.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The red PS5 controller next to its Xbox Series equivalent.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ppi3gH"&gt;The red and black PS5 controllers are out this week in Japan and should be available next week in North America, though like the PS5 itself it’ll probably be difficult to find stock. The black version costs $69.99, while the red version is for some inexplicable reason $5 more expensive at $74.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 developer says its hacked data is circulating online </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B4POanqtWdnI9ZaoYb2jqClQUvQ=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69438271/cyberpunk_2077_800.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iwJqMy"&gt;Hacked data stolen from CD Projekt is circulating online, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1403059158065295361"&gt;the company says&lt;/a&gt;. The studio behind &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; says it can not confirm the exact contents of the data being circulated, but believes it relates to its games, contractors, and both current and former employees. It also warned that the data may have been manipulated or tampered with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErOFdx"&gt;The disclosure comes four months after the studio first announced that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274035/cd-projekt-hack-source-code-cyberpunk-2077-witcher-3-encrypt-data-ransom"&gt;fallen victim to a ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt;. It initially said hackers had managed to access “certain data” from the company. CD Projekt posted the ransom note it received in which the hackers claimed to have access to source code from its games including &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Gwent&lt;/em&gt;. The note also said the hacked data included details relating to its HR, accounting, and other internal operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0szLFs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;IMPORTANT UPDATE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read more: &lt;a href="https://t.co/qd6sc5VF3I"&gt;https://t.co/qd6sc5VF3I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/kKi1GkIaLO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kKi1GkIaLO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— CD PROJEKT RED (@CDPROJEKTRED) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1403059158065295361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1hWTb9"&gt;The company said it would not give in to the hackers’ demands, and days later the attackers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278121/cd-projekt-red-ransomware-hack-cyberpunk-2077-the-witcher-3-auction-sale"&gt;claimed to have sold the data&lt;/a&gt; online. However the nature of the sale, in which the hackers claimed to have found a buyer outside of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276664/cyberpunk-witcher-hackers-auction-source-code-ransomware-attack"&gt;hacking forum auction&lt;/a&gt;, raised questions about whether they were able to find a buyer at all. Writing in a &lt;a href="https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/37783/hellokitty-ransomware-group-likely-responsible-for-cd-projekt-attack-heres-why/#:~:text=There%20is,sold%20it"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow said he thought it was “likely” that the hackers were just claiming to have found a buyer to “save face” after having failed to monetize the hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdkMkD"&gt;CD Projekt has &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/information-regarding-data-security/"&gt;previously admitted&lt;/a&gt; that hackers were able to encrypt some of its employee data on its network. But the company said its investigation had found no evidence that the data had been transferred out of the company’s systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GF9w5K"&gt;The hack followed the troubled launch of the studio’s latest blockbuster title, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. Although it &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/11/22170468/cyberpunk-2077-sales-revenue-cd-projekt"&gt;sold well&lt;/a&gt; and was initially well-received by critics, players quickly discovered that the game was riddled with bugs, and almost unplayable on older consoles. The situation was so bad that the game was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;pulled from the PlayStation Store&lt;/a&gt;. As of this writing, it is &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-my/concept/234567"&gt;yet to return&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hukrxM"&gt;CD Projekt says it’s continuing to work with law enforcement and outside experts as it responds to the hack, and said it is “committed and prepared” to take action against anyone sharing the stolen data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla delivers the first 25 Model S Plaid sedans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tOByZZhkKDdhrCf6BX62Yj4rXQk=/451x72:2692x1566/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69437984/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_10.47.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DxmNkb"&gt;A lucky 25 customers received Tesla’s redesigned Model S “Plaid” at an event hosted by CEO Elon Musk in Fremont, California on Thursday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZrJDH"&gt;The Silicon Valley automaker has billed this new $130,000 version of the Model S — first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh"&gt;announced in January&lt;/a&gt; and originally slated to ship in March — as the “quickest production vehicle ever made,” with the ability to go from 0-60mph in under 2 seconds. Its name is a reference to the unthinkable speed beyond “Ludicrous” in the comedy classic &lt;em&gt;Spaceballs&lt;/em&gt;. It’s also expected to get around 390 miles of range. (Tesla is selling a less powerful version of the redesigned Model S with more range — 412 miles — that starts at just a hair under $80,000. Deliveries of those start later this year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyejPR"&gt;Why so fast?  “We’ve got to show that an electric car is the best car, hands down,” Musk said at Thursday night’s event. “It’s got to be clear [that] sustainable energy cars can be the fastest cars, the safest cars, [and] can be the most kick-ass cars in every way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wX59Ym"&gt;“This car crushes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5V1UGU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’ve got to show that an electric car is the best car, hands down.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m9Vp9t"&gt;On June 6, Musk announced Tesla had canceled the most expensive version of the new Model S, which was called Plaid Plus. That version, which had a starting price of around $150,000, was supposed to go 520 miles on a full battery. It was also supposed to be powered by the new 4680 lithium-ion battery cells &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22521769/elon-musk-tweets-tesla-plaid-plus-canceled"&gt;that Tesla is developing&lt;/a&gt;. A redesigned Model X was also announced in January, but deliveries of that new SUV have been pushed back months, and Musk didn’t mention the updated SUV Thursday night.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hShn2AyQriLR8iArroyFYXNP6JU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652103/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_8.51.33_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nYTayf"&gt;Musk once shot down rumors of a Model S and Model X redesign in 2019, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/tesla-will-not-refresh-its-model-s-or-model-x-electric-vehicles/"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; there was “no ‘refreshed’ Model X or Model S coming.” Instead, Musk said Tesla was always making minor improvements to both vehicles. But sales of both vehicles have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404198/tesla-q1-results-earnings-profit-model-s-x-y-3-bitcoin-delay"&gt;stagnated in recent years&lt;/a&gt; as Tesla focused on the more affordable Model 3 sedan and Model Y compact SUV. The redesigned versions are a chance to boost sales of these older cars. The company seems confident enough in the new Model S Plaid that it &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/10/tesla-increases-model-s-plaid-price/"&gt;raised the starting price by $10,000 earlier today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBuf3o"&gt;Musk got deep into the weeds about Tesla’s “practically alien” engineering, but he was also light on details about execution. Musk said that Tesla plans to deliver “several hundred [Model S Plaids] per week soon,” and will “probably” ramp up to around 1,000 per week next quarter. But he made almost no mention of the Model X Plaid, the dual-motor “long range” Model S, and he didn’t expand on his reasoning for canceling the 520-mile Plaid Plus. Earlier this week, he simply &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/06/elon-musk-tesla-canceling-model-s-plaid-need-400-mile-range/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that “more range doesn’t really matter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WNLtD"&gt;“There are essentially zero trips above 400 miles where the driver doesn’t need to stop for restroom, food, coffee, etc. anyway,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5u6MRHZMTBUZHbumrJ5KP6Z-DXc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652101/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_11.52.10_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AuJc59"&gt;The new Model S is the first major overhaul for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh"&gt;sedan since it launched in 2012&lt;/a&gt; and set Tesla on its path to its current status as the world’s top electric vehicle company. The exterior design is largely unchanged (though it has a super low drag coefficient of 0.208) and the interior has received a big facelift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="mb1s7n"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the first major overhaul for the electric sedan, which launched in 2012&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yQ5EYQ"&gt;The Model S now has a horizontal touchscreen like the one found in the Model 3 and Model Y, but with a bigger 17-inch version with smaller bezels. Unlike the Model 3 and Model Y, there’s a digital instrument cluster behind the steering wheel. A third screen is found behind the center console for rear passengers. Tesla showed off a new UI for the screens on Thursday night, which features drag-and-drop elements and other refinements. Musk even capitulated to shouts from the crowd of fans at one point and agreed to finally add &lt;a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-navigation-waypoints-spotted-elon-musk/"&gt;a waypoint feature to Tesla’s navigation system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ES2xT"&gt;There are other upgrades, too, such as more room for rear passengers, as well as rear-seat wireless phone chargers. “The current Model S, the backseat is not amazing. But the new one — it’s actually a legit backseat,” Musk said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWprv0"&gt;The Model S Plaid has extremely powerful processing that can run AAA games on the car’s screens at 60 frames per second, in addition to powering all of the other services Tesla allows, such as Netflix, Spotify. “Really, it’s like a home theater experience,” Musk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PM4nR"&gt;Tesla has also changed a lot under the proverbial hood. The Model S Plaid is powered by a new tri-motor drivetrain that Tesla originally started developing for the forthcoming second-generation Roadster. (The company tested the Plaid powertrain in a Model S sedan at famous racetracks: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20862105/tesla-model-s-plaid-laguna-seca-nurburgring-porsche-taycan"&gt;Laguna Seca and the Nurburgring&lt;/a&gt;.) Those three motors collectively put down around 1,000 horsepower, and the car can reach a top speed of 200 miles per hour — though only when outfitted certain wheels and tires &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/10/tesla-warns-new-model-s-plaid-advertised-200-mph-tire-wheel-upgrade/"&gt;that won’t be available until later this year&lt;/a&gt;. “It hits you right in the limbic system,” Musk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imnpcg"&gt;Earlier Model S sedans weren’t exactly slow, but the new one will be more capable of repeating that performance thanks to some new tech Tesla developed. The company has been working on new heat pumps starting with the Model Y, and in the Model S Plaid Tesla says the pump improves cold-weather range by 30 percent and reduces the energy consumption of running the HVAC system by 50 percent. The radiator is also much bigger in order to help cool the battery pack during demanding drives. Tesla even developed new carbon-wrapped rotors in the electric motors that power the Plaid system in order to keep them from breaking apart at high RPM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="esFten"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Similar exterior, but a radical new interior&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I7PX53"&gt;Repeating high performance runs was a tricky prospect in older Model S sedans, so much so that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/10/20799221/porsche-taycan-fully-charged-mission-e-electric-car"&gt;Porsche made sure to market the Taycan’s ability&lt;/a&gt; to make lots of fast runs without losing performance when that EV launched. All of those changes should help Tesla  answer Porsche. Musk claims the new Model S will be safer than most other cars on the road based on Tesla’s internal data. The car has not yet been tested by safety regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOwbLP"&gt;One possible hiccup in safety: the striking, U-shaped “yoke” steering wheel. It &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-model-s-yoke-steering-wheel-regulations-nhtsa/"&gt;was reportedly a surprise to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&lt;/a&gt;. When Musk was asked by Joe Rogan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278792/elon-musk-joe-rogan-tesla-roadster-spacex-hover-thrusters"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt; whether he thought the new steering wheel was legal, the CEO said “they use a yoke in Formula One.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApqppD"&gt;“Yeah, but you’re not on the highway in a Formula One car,” Rogan responded. Musk answered that he believed Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistance system “is getting good enough that you won’t need to drive most of the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ja4im"&gt;Tesla not only changed up the steering wheel design, but it also got rid of all of the stalks on the steering column. There will be an option on the touchscreen to select drive modes, but Tesla sees that as a backup. Instead, the car will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256504/teslas-model-s-x-redesign-automatic-shifting-prnd-gears"&gt;default to automatically shifting between park, reverse, and drive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9E3osX"&gt;“I think, generally, all input is error,” Musk said Thursday night. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Frontier Communications is getting sued by record labels for not disconnecting pirates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-zu0Rw5dBUp_wW1wpnmc509MjdY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69437241/VRG_ILLO_4341_American_Ethernet.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4BqURN"&gt;Frontier Communications, an ISP that serves around 3 million subscribers, has been sued by Warner, Sony, and Universal’s record labels for allegedly not taking action against its users who pirate music (&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/record-labels-sue-another-isp-demanding-mass-disconnections-of-internet-users/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFUBGQ"&gt;The record labels &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.561609/gov.uscourts.nysd.561609.1.0.pdf"&gt;allege in their complaint&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) that not only did Frontier fail to disconnect people who repeatedly pirated, but it even encouraged them by advertising the ability to “download 10 songs in 3.5 seconds” and profited from the result. The labels also allege that Frontier ignored its subscribers’ piracy so it could keep collecting subscription fees, saying that the ISP valued profit over legal responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSzyeQ"&gt;Frontier denies wrongdoing, telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it has terminated customers when copyright holders complain. The ISP plans to “vigorously defend itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfKlMH"&gt;The suit, which was filed in the state of New York, seeks damages from Frontier for its subscribers who have infringed on almost 3,000 copyrighted works after the ISP was repeatedly told about their infringement. &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.561609/gov.uscourts.nysd.561609.1.1.pdf"&gt;A list of pirated songs&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) includes &lt;em&gt;Thank U, Next&lt;/em&gt; by Ariana Grande, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;(no relation to this publication) by Owl City, and &lt;em&gt;Rich as Fuck&lt;/em&gt; by Lil Wayne featuring 2 Chainz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M8kOko"&gt;The labels are seeking $300,000 per infringement, which would put the ISP on the hook for over $850 million. It’s worth noting that Frontier Communications &lt;a href="https://www.nhregister.com/business/article/As-it-emerges-from-bankruptcy-Frontier-16142938.php"&gt;emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; last month — having to pay that much in damages wouldn’t be good for any company, but especially not one that’s just getting out of that situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f1lXJf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to foresee suing ISPs working to stopping music piracy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LsMHZt"&gt;Warner, Sony, and Universal have also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282679/riaa-sony-universal-umg-lawsuit-charter-music-piracy-high-speed-internet"&gt;sued other ISPs like Charter&lt;/a&gt; and Cox on similar grounds, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21030812/cox-communications-record-labels-lawsuit-appeal-1-billion-piracy-isp-charter"&gt;winning a $1 billion award&lt;/a&gt; from the latter (though that case is &lt;a href="https://www.law360.com/cases/5b622655a811114362b330b2/articles"&gt;still going through the appeals process&lt;/a&gt;). And over the past 20 years, the music industry has tried different approaches to curb online piracy, from &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122966038836021137"&gt;suing individuals&lt;/a&gt; to working with ISPs to set up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/25/4026194/infamous-six-strike-anti-piracy-program-barks-harder-than-it-bites"&gt;a strike system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N73VaS"&gt;The approaches haven’t been particularly effective and have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/30/14445596/six-strikes-piracy-system-failed-ending"&gt;largely been abandoned&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s hard to foresee the tactic of suing ISPs working to stop music piracy. And, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/record-labels-sue-another-isp-demanding-mass-disconnections-of-internet-users/?comments=1"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, ISPs being forced to cut off pirates could affect other people living with them as well, denying entire households access to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;fundamental part of modern day life.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Trump administration forced Apple to secretly reveal at least two Democrats’ data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WSVa_cXg4VFv_3-L4qCAJ-jDyNw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69437174/acastro_180130_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fXiNUu"&gt;By now, you may have heard that Trump’s Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/us/trump-administration-phone-records-times-reporters.html"&gt;secretly seized the phone records&lt;/a&gt; of journalists working for &lt;em&gt;The New York Time&lt;/em&gt;s, &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, in the hopes of revealing their sources and stopping leaks to the press. But &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/10/us/politics/justice-department-leaks-trump-administration.html?referringSource=articleShare"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;is now reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Trump didn’t stop at journalists — in 2017 and 2018, it forced Apple to cough up metadata on at least two Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee, including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1403151148786278403"&gt;current chairman Adam Schiff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/10/politics/house-intelligence-committee-apple-data-trump-justice-department-doj/index.html"&gt;representative Eric Swalwell&lt;/a&gt;, and as many as a dozen people tied to that committee in total, including family members and at least one child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2dDle2"&gt;Like the media outlets, Apple was under a gag order and unable to tell anyone until it expired this year — the only reason we’re learning about this now is because the new administration’s Justice Department decided to reveal the subpoenas and gag orders to the press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L9gNMV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Metadata is powerful&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8SasHu"&gt;While one of the &lt;em&gt;NYT’s&lt;/em&gt; sources insist that Apple only provided metadata, not photos or the contents of emails, it’s been well-established for years that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/16/4336994/metadata-matters-how-phone-records-and-obsolete-laws-harm-privacy"&gt;metadata is data&lt;/a&gt;: you can learn a lot if you know where, when, and who a given person is talking to, particularly if you combine that with other insights. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21029992/smartphone-location-tracking-legal-technology-privacy-new-york-times"&gt;An earlier &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; showed that the amount of location data smartphones already reveal to data brokers is enough to identify someone personally.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0XgPq"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wO9lQi"&gt;Last Saturday, the Justice Department &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/05/1003616525/doj-says-it-will-no-longer-seize-reporters-records-in-investigating-leaks"&gt;promised it would no longer secretly subpeona records from journalists&lt;/a&gt; to root out leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSZO70"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, June 10th, 11PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added confirmation that Swalwell was part of the probe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VfQnBwLbLIeiZEVOPMuNUumuNok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/akrales_190723_3560_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MyfWR7"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, having helped pioneer the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of three unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products. In those instances, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know what a good Kindle deal looks like when you see one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyFx7Z"&gt;Thankfully, there’s often a promotion going on, which will almost certainly be the case when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;Amazon Prime Day arrives&lt;/a&gt; on June 21st. Until then, these are the best Kindle deals available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LiuVH6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle (10th Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $90. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has a slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07978J597?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a 10th-gen Kindle with lockscreen ads&lt;/a&gt; for $90, which is the usual price. If you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1ccac7c6dd4bb605e9b24952e83a00de&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab it for $110. If you buy either Kindle model, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $120 ($15 off its usual price); it includes one of three printed covers and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Kids Edition (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $110 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost. Right now, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab one for $110&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7AYlh"&gt;Amazon is also currently offering the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Essentials-including-Protector-Adapter/dp/B07XW24MVK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition Essentials Bundle for $128&lt;/a&gt;, which includes all of the things mentioned above, plus a screen protector and power adapter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (Fourth Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P1C5xu"&gt;The fourth-gen Kindle Paperwhite, released in 2018, starts at $130 and comes in three different configurations: an 8GB Wi-Fi model, a 32GB Wi-Fi model, and a second 32GB model that drops the ads from the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qneu65"&gt;The Paperwhite features a six-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get the Paperwhite over the base Kindle. The 2018 model also added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;No deals are currently available for the Paperwhite, but you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB model with ad support&lt;/a&gt; for $130 or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTCW9G7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free edition for $150&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PP49ZDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Paperwhite with ads for $160&lt;/a&gt;; if you want the ad-free model, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PT96B3T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $180&lt;/a&gt;. Just like the base Kindle, Amazon currently running a promotion where you can grab the e-reader plus three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;Amazon has discounted its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HL49FCK/ref=mako_bundletwister_mt1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader bundle for $170&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKT4M5K/ref=mako_bundletwister_mt1?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 if you buy the 32GB&lt;/a&gt; (with ads). If you’re a fan of Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy, Amazon also offers a bundle that includes a Kindle Paperwhite, a power adapter, and a Mockingjay-emblazoned cover. It’s currently available in two ad-supported configurations and colors: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB version for $160&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $190&lt;/a&gt;, both of which save you $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Oasis (Third Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, seven-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. Unlike previous models, however, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the 32GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $200, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $250 and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $250 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $270&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $280 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 without&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal list price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RNPKRKW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported configuration for as low as $280&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RW2K1MD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $310&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney and Starz are in a slap fight over the launch of Star+</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eRHm8UO7J3bRudSBnLOolIuYOnQ=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69437050/Disney.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fzm7vK"&gt;Disney is set to launch its standalone Star+ streaming service in Latin America in August, but Starz has filed complaints in Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina alleging Disney is infringing on its brand identity and that the soon-to-launch service will only confuse consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7gmVJ"&gt;In an English language translation of the complaints seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/starz-disney-copyright-suit-star-streaming-service-name-latin-america/"&gt;previously reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wrap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Starz argues that Disney’s “Star Plus” service — which will host content from Disney, FX, 20th Century Studios and National Geographic, as well as Star originals — sounds too phonetically similar to its own StarzPlay offering also available in the regions where it filed its complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohwAQu"&gt;Starz, a premium cable offering and streaming app, has been operating under the name since the mid-1990s and now has a presence in 58 countries. Its own service, StarzPlay, has been available in Latin America since 2019. Disney’s Star — a service offered in international markets and nested within Disney Plus — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165950/disney-star-streaming-service-hotstar-international-movies-tv"&gt;officially launched&lt;/a&gt; in December. Star+, meanwhile, is &lt;a href="https://dmedmedia.disney.com/news/star-plus-arrives-in-latin-america-august-2021"&gt;set to launch&lt;/a&gt; as a single service offering in Latin America on August 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zf1RJA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Starz claims Disney’s “Star Plus” sounds too similar to its own StarzPlay service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qwfw3b"&gt;“Both companies are currently direct competitors in the Mexican market, which causes an unfair competition to materialize, especially if it is considered that we are talking about the same services,” the complaint filed in Mexico states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAa0QQ"&gt;Reached for comment, a spokesperson for Starz said the company “had no choice but to defend its rights and attempt to forestall any further customer confusion by filing trademark infringement suits” in Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina against Disney for its use of “Star” and various iterations of the service title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePzdhD"&gt;Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPeJDl"&gt;The company announced in May that its Star+ service would officially roll out to consumers at the end of August. At the time, Diego Lerner, president of The Walt Disney Company Latin America, said in a statement that the service would deliver “a never-before-seen customized experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wy8Ry"&gt;“The strength of the content, that will include all of ESPN, makes Star+ a unique and relevant offering with its own identity that will become a recognized digital service, independent from Disney Plus,” Lerner said. “Having said that, its arrival will represent a service that is complementary to Disney Plus and it will consolidate The Walt Disney Company’s presence in Latin America’s streaming market.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox’s Summer Game Fest event featuring more than 40 demos starts June 15th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z3SkyiTN6SI2ermjfznMD_k0nuw=/211x0:1350x759/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69436931/5bbcebe0_c405_46cb_bc6b_2eae469211ed.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Sable&lt;em&gt;, launching September 23rd.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Shedworks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hlRSw2"&gt;Microsoft is hosting another Summer Game Fest event to give you a chance to play demos of some unreleased Xbox Series X / S and Xbox One games. This year’s event is coming up soon, running from June 15th through June 21st, and there will be more than 40 demos to check out, &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/06/10/our-second-summer-game-fest-demo-event-coming-june-15-to-an-xbox-near-you/"&gt;the company said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. While Microsoft hasn’t released the full list of games just yet, it has shared a few that you can look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dqBBO"&gt;One that I have my eye on is &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;, which looks like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/14/17462494/sable-xbox-preview-moebius-zelda-e3-2018"&gt;a comic from Jean “Moebius” Giraud come to life&lt;/a&gt; and takes inspiration from &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. &lt;/em&gt;After years in development, &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; is set to release on September 23rd, and you can see some footage from it in this performance from Thursday’s Summer Game Fest Kickoff live event &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest/status/1403055279357370369"&gt;by Japanese Breakfast&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote a song for the game: &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WeXuhD"&gt;When it comes to true wireless earbuds, there are a ton of brands and products to choose from. Whether you enjoy the unconventional design of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live or prefer Jabra’s compact Elite 75t, there’s a pair of wireless earbuds for just about everyone. Fortunately, many of the best wireless earbuds go on sale on a regular occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsWVXq"&gt;Regardless of which brand you prefer, we have compiled some of the best deals on wireless earbuds available right now, some of which may be further discounted on June 21nd and June 22nd as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;Amazon Prime Day&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;APPLE AIRPODS DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the Pro variant offer better sound quality and feature active noise cancellation, not to mention seamless integration with iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;Apple’s flagship Pro wireless earbuds tend to go on sale frequently, and we often see them drop as low as $200. Right now, you can get a new pair for $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div id="kPY6Vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, which include either a wired or wireless charging case. Although they normally retail for $160, you can get the version with the wired charging case for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/994132/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$129 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1003525/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740939592542498948" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DcXNMK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;If you prefer a little more convenience, you can also get a new pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods with a wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt; for a few dollars more. At their regular price of $200, they aren’t as good of a value, but you’ll rarely find yourself paying the usual price. At the moment, you can get them for $146 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;SAMSUNG GALAXY BUDS DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and the best sound quality yet for Samsung earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;There are a couple of deals going on right now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08MWZHHKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-pro-earbuds-black%2F-%2FA-82026965&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeTrueWirelessHeadphones042921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740939849926817180" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, all of which are offering the Galaxy Buds Pro for $30 off, bringing the price down to $170.&lt;/p&gt;

A successor to the original Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in an assortment of colors. Right now, you can buy the Galaxy Buds Plus for $100 at places such as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739163658038651288#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/3Pk6Pr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest price we’ve seen in the last several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c8pRgb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mPBmzD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; are some of the more unconventional wireless earbuds on the market right now, but don’t let their bean-shaped design fool you. The Buds Live are a good option if you want earbuds that produce powerful sound and showcase marathon battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52C6bu"&gt;Right now, you can purchase a pair of the Galaxy Buds Live for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/samsung-galaxy-buds-live/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$130 at Verizon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B658NP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$140 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, more than 20 percent off the initial MSRP. If you prefer a different retailer, they’re also discounted to $150 at both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743073079812628934" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/zazZNG" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="i2Ah0B"&gt;SONY WF-1000XM3 DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HggHzb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; are the true wireless headphones to beat, but they haven’t been discounted yet given how recently they launched. Their predecessor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt;, however, remain an excellent pair of headphones that do routinely go on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haWqZJ"&gt;Like the most recent model, the WF-1000XM3 feature phenomenal sound quality and considerable battery life, a small feat for true wireless earbuds. They also manage to deliver noise cancellation in a sleek, copper-adorned package, one that’s both attractive and professional. Typically $230, Sony’s last-gen WF-1000XM3 are currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM3-Industry-Canceling-Wireless/dp/B07T81554H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743073395263197000" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1495319-REG%2Fsony_wf1000xm3_b_wf1000xm3_wireless_noise_canceling_headphones.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22307388%2Fwireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; for $178.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8F3h1H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563643"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1TXXf4"&gt;OTHER TRUE WIRELESS EARBUD DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;Last year, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s lineup. They have more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t, however, they also feature less bass and an inferior fit. If you can live with those compromises, however, you can buy the Jabra Elite 85t for $230—the standard list price—at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740940140202691153" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-85t?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_source=cj&amp;amp;utm_campaign=100084481&amp;amp;cjevent=d1b5f6f7b81f11eb80a000a90a1c0e0c#/donotlink#100-99190700-98" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jabra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LacpUE"&gt;If the standard retail price on the Elite 85t is intimidating but you want a pair of Jabra earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt; are also a good option, and they see regular price cuts. We consider the Jabra 75t— currently on sale in gold for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-75t-Earbuds-Comfortable/dp/B082Y256ZV/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$131 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;—the best true wireless earbuds for multitaskers, and they remain a solid alternative if you don’t want to buy AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvElfP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqq7gj"&gt;The unannounced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455747/beats-studio-buds-apple-lebron-james-instagram-photos" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt; might be just on the horizon, but if you’re currently in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you can’t go wrong with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place during intense exercises. They’re also IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;There are a few different discounts available right now for the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest we currently see is for the red model, which is available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733773029374008951" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $160&lt;/a&gt;. If you prefer a different color, most configurations are currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B07R5QD598/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/AogxKN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $170, an $80 discount and more than 30 percent off the initial retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0RcdxX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11vDvx"&gt;The 2021 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; are a tremendous value at $120, however, if the price remains a factor and you don’t mind opting for their last-gen counterpart, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1512892-REG%2Famazon_b07f6vm1s3_echo_buds.html%3Fap%3Dy%26smp%3Dy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22307388%2Fwireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; is currently offering the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937559/amazon-echo-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-features-bose-noise-reduction-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Buds for $100&lt;/a&gt;. They don’t sound as satisfying, nor are they as comfortable, but they still provide effective noise reduction and easy access to Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
