    <title>Overwatch’s cowboy hero is now named Cole Cassidy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/--h6enPf4ea6E-awxW5sfmnQRP8=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70032775/cole_cassidy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TqBZ1Y"&gt;Jesse McCree, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s cowboy hero, has been renamed Cole Cassidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9NcNaw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Meet Cole Cassidy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rides into Overwatch October 26. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CT6PmaNXNs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CT6PmaNXNs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1451624387732512770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lxGpiQ"&gt;The name change is part of a number of updates Blizzard is making to its games to remove references to problematic people or themes that have come to light in the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;several discrimination and harassment suits&lt;/a&gt; filed against the company.  Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597006/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-activision-remove-references-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; removed NPCs&lt;/a&gt; that referenced former senior creative director Alex Afrasiabi, who was named in the harassment suit as participating in the infamous “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598508/activision-blizzard-cosby-suite-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;Cosby Suite&lt;/a&gt;” incident. Jesse McCree — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620800/activision-blizzard-departures-lawsuit-diablo-4-director"&gt;a former lead designer&lt;/a&gt; — was also a part of that incident and for whom &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s cowboy character was named.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5nUeU"&gt;When these allegations were publicized, casters refused to say the character’s name during &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League matches. The &lt;em&gt;Overwatch &lt;/em&gt;team later stated they were in the process of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22638947/blizzard-overwatch-mccree-name-change-lawsuit"&gt;changing McCree’s name&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBBPLy"&gt;In a tweet, the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; team framed the name change as Cassidy coming to terms with his checkered past and giving up his outlaw name, providing a clever in-game explanation for a change that was because of real-world forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkTlky"&gt;“To make this new Overwatch better — to make things right — he has to be honest with his team and himself,” the announcement tweet says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAIqWH"&gt;The name change goes live October 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bO832x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to stop annoying robocalls on your iPhone or Android phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="robocall" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ifKkE4MxbKXxLOul3EzAq-RBaSI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67382107/DSCF2964.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K0LsOJ"&gt;Mobile spam calls have been a nuisance for years. I get between four and six robocalls daily, and a quick survey of friends shows that I’m not alone. Every waking day brings with it a new barrage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDh4m1"&gt;Robocallers have upped their game by masking their spam with local, genuine-looking phone numbers. Sometimes their nonsense is amusing — like when you get a threatening voicemail about your impending arrest over owed back taxes — but the vast majority of the time, it’s an unwelcome distraction. It’s all too easy for these scammers to wield the power of the internet and fire off countless calls with ease. And once even just a few people fall for a scam, they’ve made enough profit to cover their trivial expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRGgSZ"&gt;Estimates put the number of robocalls in 2019 at over 50 billion. Both the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission say they’re doing their best to get a handle on the situation, and yes, there have been significant crackdowns. But real-world feedback indicates that things are getting worse — not better — and it can often feel out of control. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201140/fcc-stir-shaken-approved-june-2021-deadline-robocalls"&gt;The FCC has required that US carriers adopt a technology&lt;/a&gt; that will go a long way toward combatting spam calls. But we’re not quite there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nxu3tDtXZw3gxqt9gLDtlbqFqaY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10355789/akrales_180305_2355_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rVf4pk"&gt;So if you’re as sick as I am of pulling a vibrating phone out of your pocket only to see a random, suspicious number, let’s go over the options for fighting back and restoring some sense of peace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fW6Fa"&gt;First, I’ll review some definitions since the carriers make important distinctions between these calls — even if they’re all unwelcome and annoying. Here’s how Verizon looks at things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7v0EJZ"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Robocallers&lt;/strong&gt;: Automated, prerecorded phone messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gbn800"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Spammers&lt;/strong&gt;: Unwanted callers that may be calling indiscriminately to a large number of recipients; sometimes includes callers to whom you’ve given consent to contact you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="p5FXjM"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fraud calls&lt;/strong&gt;: An entity likely pretending to be someone they’re not with malicious intent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3u4VE9"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Option A&lt;/strong&gt;: Block individual numbers one by one&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uP22n2"&gt;This is probably a hopeless endeavor if you’re aiming to completely eradicate robocalls, but if there’s a particular number that keeps calling, it’s fairly easy to block it forever from your iPhone or Android phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ocFu4"&gt;On iOS, just go to the Phone app, then your Recents, tap the blue information icon to the right of the number you want to block, and select “Block this Caller.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeQtPq"&gt;For Android, the process isn’t much different: go to the Recents section of the Phone app, long press on the bothersome number, and choose “Block.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkuaeK"&gt;Again, this will take a lot of persistent work on your part to keep the spammers away — and it does no good against blocked or private callers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kt8cHd"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Option B&lt;/strong&gt;: Trust (or pay) your carrier to protect you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RT4nE6"&gt;Most of the major mobile providers have taken steps to insert themselves as a barrier between you and these annoying callers. They’ve done this through behind-the-scenes network improvements, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201140/fcc-stir-shaken-approved-june-2021-deadline-robocalls"&gt;SHAKEN/STIR technology&lt;/a&gt; that has started making it possible for carriers to verify when a call is legitimate and weed out the many spoofed numbers you’re probably getting from your own local area code. In reality, those calls are probably coming from across the globe, but it’s easy for robocallers to impersonate local numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Oqx9w"&gt;All of the major US carriers offer some level of spam blocking for free as part of your wireless plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luQmc1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT&amp;amp;T: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/features/security-apps.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call Protect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available for free for all postpaid customers. $3.99 / month for the Plus version&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NIOIuAjtiLTfYFbGY1TYSy_DcB4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21866449/Screen_Shot_2020_09_09_at_11.55.47_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7ApA4Y"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has a free service, Call Protect, that’s designed to block fraudulent robocalls and likely spam risks before they reach you, and you won’t have to do anything besides install the software on your phone. Call Protect won’t completely stop telemarketer calls, but it will at least display a “nuisance warning” when you receive those. The service also makes it easy to permanently block callers, and you can build a personal block list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOPiBs"&gt;There is also a Call Protect Plus service that offers caller ID, reverse number lookup, and the ability to block or send calls to voicemail by category. These added features cost $3.99 per month, but the main Call Protect service comes free as part of your plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pAJJt"&gt;Call Protect is also available to prepaid customers if they own an AT&amp;amp;T HD Voice-capable phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sJfB6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/at-t-call-protect/id1181632589"&gt;Download for iPhone&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.att.callprotect&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Download for Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgfzS9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T-Mobile: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fplans-features%2Fblock-unwanted-calls&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21327304%2Fspam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scam Shield and Scam Block&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available for free for all postpaid customers. $4 / month for Scam Shield Premium.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qrYkOLJIb_Cz70nj7RID312AZY4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21866327/Screen_Shot_2020_09_09_at_11.17.54_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: T-Mobile&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FJ7j6w"&gt;T-Mobile’s effort to combat annoying robocalls is called &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcustomers%2Fscam-shield&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21327304%2Fspam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Scam Shield&lt;/a&gt;. The free-to-download Scam Shield app bundles all of T-Mobile’s various tools — Scam ID, Scam Block, and Caller ID — so you can easily configure whatever level of protection is right for you. By default, suspicious calls are always flagged. Enabling Scam Block will prevent many of them from ever ringing your phone. And T-Mobile’s Caller ID service will frequently show the information for whoever’s calling you, even if they’re not in your contacts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoOUyp"&gt;You can always turn on Scam Block without the Scam Shield app. To do so, dial #662# from your T-Mobile phone. To disable it, just dial #632#. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2jABw"&gt;Scam Shield goes beyond just blocking bad calls: you can also request a secondary “proxy” number that you can use in instances where you don’t want to share your private phone number. And if you find yourself hopelessly inundated, T-Mobile will let you change your actual number once per year for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A8wyqM"&gt;For an added $4 per month per line, you can upgrade to Scam Shield Premium, which lets you “send entire categories of unwanted robocalls directly to voicemail, like telemarketers; create ‘always block’ lists; and get voicemail-to-text for at-a-glance access to your voicemails.” (Customers with Magenta Max plans get Scam Shield Premium for free.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sEtWl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon Wireless: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizonwireless.com%2Fsolutions-and-services%2Fcall-filter%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21327304%2Fspam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;l Filter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available free for all postpaid customers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eurjIJRnBSx_H_bute7qt9rVYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10348535/Screen_Shot_2018_03_05_at_2.27.22_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NuHL4X"&gt;Verizon’s Call Filter service, free for postpaid lines, allows customers to “get alerts when a call is likely spam, report unsolicited numbers, and automatically block robocalls based on their preferred level of risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTOAfR"&gt;For no charge, you can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizonwireless.com%2Fsupport%2Fblock-numbers%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21327304%2Fspam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;block up to five phone numbers&lt;/a&gt; that you want to prevent from contacting you. However, blocks expire after 90 days and aren’t very helpful against robocallers with numbers that change every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6Vb1n"&gt;You can get more features, such as the ability to create a personal block list, for $2.99 a month per line. The Verizon Smart Family plan offers additional features, including parental controls and the ability to permanently block as many as ten numbers, for $4.99 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HbQb9f"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Option C&lt;/strong&gt;: Protect yourself with third-party apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="K5ADcW"&gt;There are a number of services, such as Nomorobo, RoboKiller, and Hiya, that are designed to prevent robocalls from ever ringing your phone. Most of them require a monthly (or annual) subscription. At their core, these services rely on a constantly updating list of robocallers, spammers, and fraudsters and use that database to stop nuisance calls. (When I say “constantly updating,” I mean they’re identifying thousands of bad numbers every day.) A call comes in, and the service runs it against that huge list of scam numbers. If it finds a match, the incoming call gets shut down before it reaches you. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LbTGHUlqcfFdpZbdA4n1UKLmtVQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10357151/Screen_Shot_2018_03_06_at_2.50.48_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QohVLJ"&gt;All of them allow you to maintain your own personal blacklist of numbers that might be bothering you and whitelist those you want to get through. Some work by downloading a dedicated contacts list — separate from your regular contacts — to your phone. But both iOS and Android have recently given these services more leeway in taking control over your phone app and stopping the jerks from ever reaching you. On iPhone, you’ll have to enable them in the Settings app and give them caller ID permissions before they can start working. Apple shows you how to do that &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099"&gt;step-by-step right here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVpXNO"&gt;I’d recommend looking into each of these services to see which one you like best. All of them are largely well-reviewed by customers, and all offer free trials to get started. One of these will ultimately be what you need to really fight back against the robocalls. It’s just a matter of finding your favorite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="qsjgjK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.nomorobo.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nomorobo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;14-day free trial. After that, $1.99 / month. Free for landlines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="8Q4UUQ"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Option D:&lt;/strong&gt; Depend on your mobile OS to protect you&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ya016nQKUOe0-yNZtWWEUQ-lrGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10357035/apps_smart_call_kv_pc.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A6tyvX"&gt;Many Android phones — including those from Samsung and Google — have built-in options for flagging suspected spam calls. If you’ve got a Google Pixel device, the entire screen will turn red when a spammer rings you, which is an easy way of knowing to ignore the call if you’re across the room from your phone. On Pixel phones, you can also tap the three dots in the upper right corner of the Phone app and then go to Settings &amp;gt; Caller ID &amp;amp; spam; you can then see spam IDs and filter spam calls. Other phones will have similar features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZ8pDN"&gt;iOS 13 introduced its own app called Silence Unknown Callers, which blocks any callers that aren’t in your contact list, haven’t been in contact with, or haven’t texted. Instead, those calls will go straight to voicemail. You can enable it by selecting Settings &amp;gt; Phone &amp;gt; Silence Unknown Callers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Sk8sol"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Nuclear Option:&lt;/strong&gt; Use Do Not Disturb to only allow calls from your contacts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Jy7xYw"&gt;On both Android and iOS, you can set each operating system’s Do Not Disturb mode to allow phone calls from only those people and businesses in your contacts list. This is a pretty drastic, sledgehammer solution to the problem of robocalls, and you’re almost certain to miss calls that you would’ve liked to have answered. But those calls will go through to voicemail, and then you can add that number to your contacts for the future. I’d still only recommend this option if you’re &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; fed up, and only if you’re very good and meticulous about keeping contacts up to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WAranM"&gt;Why do more and more spam calls look like they’re coming from a local number?!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3z8si2"&gt;It’s super annoying, isn't it? It’s a trick called neighborhood spoofing, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.robokiller.com%2Fblog%2Flocal-call%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21327304%2Fspam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RoboKiller has a good explainer on it here&lt;/a&gt;. In short, scammers think that a number matching your area code (and maybe even the first digits of your own number) will trick your brain and make you more likely to answer. And it makes their deception feel even more nefarious. What if it’s a family emergency? Maybe it’s your doctor’s office or the pharmacy? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EyjcD"&gt;Thankfully, the robocall blocker apps have gotten better at spotting neighborhood spoofing. RoboKiller claims it’s been good at doing so since the beginning, and Nomorobo has also made detecting neighborhood spoofing a major focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cXa47e"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Don’t forget to add yourself to the Do Not Call Registry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="slsnjn"&gt;In theory, telemarketers are supposed to be honoring the &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0108-national-do-not-call-registry"&gt;National Do Not Call Registry&lt;/a&gt;. You can add yourself to the list by visiting &lt;a href="http://www.donotcall.gov"&gt;www.donotcall.gov&lt;/a&gt;. The FTC says to allow 31 days for legitimate telemarketer sales calls to stop. Once you’ve signed up, your presence on the Do Not Call Registry never lapses or expires, contrary to some recent rumors. There’s no reason to renew or re-add your number to the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hHGVI"&gt;The Do Not Call Registry only covers &lt;em&gt;sales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;calls. Charities, political groups, debt collectors, and surveys are still allowed to call you once you’ve signed up. The same goes for companies that you might’ve recently done business with. (You might be able to stop this specific type by verbally telling them to stop calling you.) Unfortunately, scammers / robocallers don’t pay the DNC Registry any mind and just ignore the thing entirely. These robots answer to no one, so you’re better off circling back to one of the solutions earlier in this article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BpDOis"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Never let the robots know you’re a real human&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CTiJtD"&gt;Tempting as it might be to swear up and down at a robocaller or scammer, your best course of action is to leave them unsure as to whether they connected with an actual person. Don’t say anything. Don’t push buttons — even if the robotic voice says doing so will prevent further calls. Put no faith or trust in the robot voice. Either just let it go through to voicemail or hang up immediately if you mistakenly picked up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QCE5gr"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Complain to the FTC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wZrSyK"&gt;When all else fails and you’re consumed by despair and anger over the never-ending interruptions, you can always report callers to the FTC. They’re not going to pursue every individual complaint, but it’s certainly important to keep the commission aware of the magnitude of this problem. And as I said earlier, sometimes the FTC &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/01/ftc-announces-crackdown-two-massive-illegal-robocall-operations"&gt;does actually take down&lt;/a&gt; some of these scammers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mC8bMy"&gt;Even with all of these tools in place, it’s unlikely you’ll avoid every robocall or spammer. But it should help ease the avalanche you’re probably experiencing right now. And hopefully, when all carriers get call verification up and running, you’ll be able to start trusting your caller ID again and actually answer calls more often than not. But at least in 2021, that’s still wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet hosts will be able to keep participant mics and cameras off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CSXo57cea5VjdYd5tVXQQPPqMD0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70032665/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UY0yFV"&gt;Google Meet hosts will soon be able to turn off participants’ microphones or cameras and prevent them from turning them back on, the company &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/10/google-meet-meeting-hosts-now-have-more.html"&gt;announced in a Workspace blog&lt;/a&gt;. The feature could be a useful way for hosts to keep noisy or rowdy attendees from continually interrupting meetings even after they have already been muted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xIYbn"&gt;The microphone and camera lock feature will be off by default; hosts will have to turn it on during meetings if they want to use it. If your meeting has breakout rooms, any audio and / or video locks made in the main will apply in those, too. The opposite isn’t true, though, meaning that locks applied in individual breakout rooms won’t apply to other breakout rooms or the main room.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ql6okBRHmkdmrAK0UD_kIz4WpLw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948278/pasted_image_0.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The host controls screen in Google Meet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zoGK5r"&gt;If you’re using older versions of the apps on iOS and Android that don’t support the feature, you’ll be kicked from the meeting if the hosts turns on the locks; if they’re turned on ahead of the meeting and you’re on one of those older apps, you won’t be able to join the meeting at all. Google says that turning off the locks will let people using older apps participate in a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEYzLK"&gt;All Google Workspace customers will have access to the feature, which began rolling out for users on the Rapid Release tracks on Thursday. It will start rolling out for those on the Scheduled Release track on November 1st. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Satechi’s USB-C hub can hold an SSD if you have more money than ports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CNyGLvuCbYIME_EU8Wv9X42pDm8=/0x50:1200x850/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70032438/1fb91ac1c1df__Hybrid_SSD_Still_1200x900_0002_333828_1280x.png.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2HeEbk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/6/1/17413728/the-best-usb-c-hub-for-laptops-macbook-pro"&gt;Noted hub-maker Satechi&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsatechi.net%2Fproducts%2Fusb-c-hybrid-multiport-adapter%3Fvariant%3D39673064325208&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F22%2F22740468%2Fsatechi-usb-c-hub-sata-ssd-ports-speed-flexibility" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;come out with a new dongle&lt;/a&gt; that combines extra ports and a slot for an M.2 SATA SSD for expanding both your computer’s IO and storage while only taking up one of your precious ports. It doesn’t come with an SSD, but it does have a catchy name: the Satechi USB-C Hybrid Multiport Adapter. The concept has been done before by &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JYTSHX5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lesser-known brands&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re considering it now that Satechi is making one, maybe hold off for just a moment while we break down the caveats and the potentially better options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tuPcqe"&gt;As a hub, it’s pretty standard and unobjectionable: it has 100W USB-C PD passthrough (that will supply your computer with around 85W after it takes the energy it needs to operate), two USB-A 3.0 ports, and an HDMI port capable of driving a 4K screen at 60Hz. Then, of course, there’s the M.2 port for adding a SATA SSD of almost any size.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uu4tUlkxLQUKGdMBG86GKt5weq0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948118/usb_c_hybrid_multiport_adapter_hubs_adapters_hubs_satechi_483270_1024x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Satechi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hub has a reasonably standard port selection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6Jlex"&gt;The main issue with Satechi’s new hub is the value proposition: at $90, it’s an expensive hub (though I’ve found Satechi’s aluminum designs to be very nice, if that’s the sort of thing you like to spend money on). But even at that price, it doesn’t come with an M.2 SSD. Unless you’ve got one of those floating around, you’re going to have to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Silicon-Power-256GB-Internal-SU256GBSS3A55M28AB/dp/B079X7LMLY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shell out even more money&lt;/a&gt; to make use of this hub’s defining feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bJiYSw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are cheaper and more performant options if all-in-one isn’t an absolute must&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ikXqXE"&gt;For just $10 more, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerExpand-Storage-Delivery-MacBook/dp/B08NDC4VKB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s PowerExpand&lt;/a&gt;, which includes USB-A ports, an HDMI port, a USB-C PD passthrough, and 256GB of built-in storage. Sure, you don’t get the option to put a bigger SSD in, but it’s significantly cheaper than Satechi’s option once you factor in the added cost of buying a separate M.2 SSD. You could also just buy &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsatechi.net%2Fproducts%2Fslim-aluminum-type-c-multi-port-adapter-v2%3Fvariant%3D12604200812632&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F22%2F22740468%2Fsatechi-usb-c-hub-sata-ssd-ports-speed-flexibility" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one of Satechi’s other hubs&lt;/a&gt; (which adds SD and microSD card slots) and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-Ultra-Flash-Drive/dp/B07857Y17V/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB flash drive&lt;/a&gt;, and you’d be pretty close to the price of the USB-C Hybrid Multiport Adapter alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gPYOG"&gt;Of course, a flash drive will be much slower than an SSD — at least, it would be under ordinary circumstances. That’s the second big caveat of Satechi’s new hub, though: you’re only able to access the SSD at USB 3.0 speeds, meaning 5 Gbps. That’s going to severely limit the performance of even the SATA SSDs that the hub supports. (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsatechi.net%2Fproducts%2Fusb-c-hybrid-multiport-adapter%3Fvariant%3D39673064325208&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F22%2F22740468%2Fsatechi-usb-c-hub-sata-ssd-ports-speed-flexibility" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Satechi’s site&lt;/a&gt; says that you can’t use NVMe drives.) If you need a fast external SSD, you should probably just go with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-500GB-Portable-Solid-State/dp/B074WZJ4MF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a dedicated external SSD&lt;/a&gt; — and if you don’t, you should probably just get a cheaper flash drive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hlRkSgLxZP-VbigRJihVAYmdYXw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948071/Hybrid_SSD_Still_0001.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Satechi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hybrid multiport adapter seems best-suited to those with extremely limited ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HdPgC5"&gt;It seems like this product would be hard to recommend unless you’ve got absolutely no ports — perhaps if you own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/9/8372335/12-inch-macbook-review"&gt;that MacBook that rocked only a single USB-C port&lt;/a&gt; (or, more realistically, an iPad Pro or Air), and you need to expand your storage, this is for you. It could also be useful if you’re an IT tech who spends all day popping drives out of laptops, and you want to have an all-in-one solution for reading those and plugging things in. For everyone else, though, it’s a hard product to recommend. Hopefully, some of our other suggestions will suit you well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford nabs $884 million incentive package for EV ‘mega campus’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VQrvjkvvdTQkfUAJbHUfQB2I1i4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70032392/akrales_20210526_4595_0223.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bKdQEm"&gt;Tennessee lawmakers have approved an $884 million incentive package for the “mega campus” near Memphis where Ford plans to make batteries and electric vehicles, &lt;a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2021/10/20/tennessee-legislature-gives-final-approval-884-m-ford-deal/8538425002/"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Tennessean&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uyNaG"&gt;The money — which is coming from Tennessee’s current $2.1 billion budget surplus — is the single largest investment in the history of the state. It comes at a time when many major automakers are looking to build new facilities in the US dedicated to EVs, batteries, or other supply chain components necessary for electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBN2MT"&gt;Ford itself has committed to spending more than $5 billion on the Tennessee project with South Korean battery company SK Innovation, which it calls “Blue Oval City.” Ford is also simultaneously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696427/ford-ev-battery-factory-tennessee-kentucky-investment"&gt;spinning up battery factories in Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L3kO2T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A $500 million grant, plus hundreds of millions more marked for construction costs &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xGBTI1"&gt;Ford will get $500 million in the form of a grant. The rest is being allocated in a few different ways — the result of a special session held this week where &lt;a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2021/10/20/tennessee-legislature-gives-final-approval-884-m-ford-deal/8538425002/"&gt;state legislators haggled for three days&lt;/a&gt;. The state will commit $200 million for road construction around the site and $138.2 million for other infrastructure and demolition work. Another $40 million will go to building a Tennessee College of Applied Technology site near the campus, and $5 million is being offered up for legal services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vLA4ud"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ford reveals plans for massive EV and battery factories in the US","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696427/ford-ev-battery-factory-tennessee-kentucky-investment"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Xa5HRr"&gt;Lastly, $745,100 will go toward starting a governing body called the “Megasite Authority of West Tennessee.” It will consist of 11 members, including Gov. Bill Lee, the state’s House Speaker, and the lieutenant governor. This board will be able to guide land acquisitions, including the ability to use seize private land using eminent domain, though owners have to be fairly compensated. The board will also oversee water management and other contracts related to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSZSG0"&gt;Ford has said the Tennessee campus will stretch nine square miles and will be the biggest facility it has ever built — far eclipsing even its historic River Rouge complex in Michigan (where Ford plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21441276/ford-electric-f150-truck-factory-break-ground-michigan"&gt;build the F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt;). The company claims Blue Oval City will create 6,000 new jobs, though Gov. Lee’s office said this week that the state expects 27,000 jobs to be created when counting “direct, indirect, and induced” roles. Tennessee says it expects the project to generate $22.4 million per year in state tax revenue but $1 billion in annual earnings for the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mT49mR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An 11-person board will oversee the project&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gdYdNl"&gt;Ford evaluated a few different sites before landing on Tennessee earlier this year. CEO Jim Farley said two main reasons were the low cost of energy in the state and the availability of an undeveloped site with no environmental problems. (Officials in Ford’s home state of Michigan have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChadLivengood/status/1443250252929196032"&gt;not been too happy with the decision&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="W7IXWm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The epic campaign to win Elon Musk’s Tesla factory with memes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21375891/tesla-tulsa-cybertruck-factory-elon-musk-statue-memes"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vdGsBg"&gt;Tesla helped supercharge the trend of big incentive packages for EV plants in 2014 when it pitted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/8/10937076/tesla-gigafactory-battery-factory-nevada-tax-deal-elon-musk"&gt;multiple states against each other&lt;/a&gt; as it searched for a home for the original Gigafactory. The gambit worked, as Tesla netted a $1.3 billion incentive package from Nevada — the largest that state had ever given out at the time. More recently, though, Tesla turned down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375891/tesla-tulsa-cybertruck-factory-elon-musk-statue-memes"&gt;a potentially massive incentive package from Tulsa, Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, in favor of building its newest factory in Austin, Texas, where it received just a few million dollars in tax breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Pt4ml"&gt;Ford is not alone in this effort, as there are a handful of similar factory projects underway as automakers spend billions to create new electric vehicle lineups. GM has announced plans for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313251/gm-ev-second-battery-factory-lg-chem-tennessee"&gt;multiple battery factories in the works with LG Chem&lt;/a&gt; (one was even rumored to be in Tennessee at one point), and both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588587/mercedes-benz-electric-ev-2030-caveat"&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt; and Toyota have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732641/toyota-ev-battery-factory-us-investment-spend-amount"&gt;recently said they will build battery factories, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Micro Center leaks specs and pricing for Intel’s new Alder Lake Core i9 CPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GbnQ7ZT3x9qEJ5z1MgF3c8N6zZQ=/186x0:1482x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70030545/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_8.16.23_AM.5.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jFFOdK"&gt;Even though someone managed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740060/intel-core-i9-12900k-sold-early"&gt;secure early purchases of a couple of Core i9-12900K CPUs&lt;/a&gt;, we still didn’t have detailed information about Intel’s upcoming line of Alder Lake chips. A (now-removed, but shown below) sale page &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/641915/intel-core-i9-12900k-alder-lake-32ghz-sixteen-core-lga-1700-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included#tab-specs"&gt;popped up on Micro Center&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting the chips will be available for $669.99 when they launch on November 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h2SzPgorpUvfSf9Bbp3A1MNKE7c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948094/micro_center_alder_lake_core_i9_12900k_specs.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LQMLKq"&gt;The spec sheet reveals this chip will have a 3.2GHz operating frequency, capable of 5.2GHz in Turbo Mode, with 16 cores and 30MB of L3 cache. As expected, the specs reveal it also supports DDR5 memory, PCIe Gen 5, and the Intel Z690 chipset motherboards that should go on sale at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMzMGu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22631059/intel-alder-lake-chip-hybrid-architecture-day-2021-desktop-laptop-preview-cores"&gt;During its Architecture Day 2021 event in August&lt;/a&gt;, Intel promised Alder Lake chips with 16 cores using eight performance cores and eight efficient ones. This leak lines up with the top-end promises, right down to listed support for 24 concurrent threads (two each on performance cores, one thread at a time on the efficient cores) and 125W thermal power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXfDQQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 21st, 2:07PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Noted listing on Micro Center has been removed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lyft’s first-ever safety report reveals over 4,000 assaults between 2017-2019</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Uber and Lyft sign in windshield of car, Queens, New York" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SqmU7DMUEzuTLUM1emhIlPou8To=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70032145/1310967778.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by: Lindsey Nicholson/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jq4R3r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: this story contains descriptions of sexual assault that some readers may find disturbing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BH0kb6"&gt;Ten people were killed in physical altercations and over 4,000 people were assaulted during Lyft rides from 2017-2019, the company revealed in its &lt;a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/q8mvene1wzq4/4jxkFTH5YCQK8T96STULMd/4269e14dbcb8578ff64da45df08b8147/Community_Safety_Report.pdf"&gt;first-ever safety report&lt;/a&gt;. Also during that period, 105 people died in fatal vehicle crashes involving a Lyft car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9bUOq"&gt;The report was long overdue, coming at least two years after Lyft originally said that it would be published. It represents the first set of publicly available data regarding the safety of Lyft’s ride-hailing platform and how it compares to national US averages. The company is currently facing multiple lawsuits from victims of sexual assault and rape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zSGt6q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the numbers appear to paint a dark picture of the ride-hailing industry&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I147le"&gt;While the numbers appear to paint a dark picture of the ride-hailing industry, Lyft insists that serious incidents are “statistically rare” in its vehicles. “The type of safety incidents detailed in this report occurred on 0.0002 percent of rides,” Jennifer Brandenburger, Head of Policy Development and Research, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyft.com%2Fblog%2Fposts%2Flyfts-community-safety-report&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F22%2F22740609%2Flyft-safety-report-2017-2019-physical-sexual-assault-death" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, “and well over 99 percent of all rides occur without any safety report at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRqZAl"&gt;Reports of sexual assault in a Lyft ride increased from 1,096 in 2017 to 1,807 in 2019. But the company said bookings increased at a higher rate during that time, resulting in a 19 percent drop in the overall incident rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGTGx6"&gt;“While safety incidents on our platform are incredibly rare, we realize that even one is too many,” Brandenburger said. “Behind every report is a real person and real experience, and our goal is to make each Lyft ride as safe as we possibly can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3zA4N"&gt;Ride-hailing companies have long struggled to keep riders and drivers safe from one another. In its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt;safety reports&lt;/a&gt;, Uber disclosed that 3,045 sexual assaults occurred on Uber trips in 2018 and &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/12/6/20999399/uber-2019-safety-report"&gt;another 3,000 in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, nine people were murdered during Uber rides, and 58 people died in auto-related crashes. Uber said that drivers reported being victims of assaults at roughly the same rate as riders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2VpYO3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ride-hailing companies have long struggled to keep riders and drivers safe from one another&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wWGYFv"&gt;Lyft’s spin on the report, grim as the numbers may be, is similar to Uber’s take on its own data. Lyft, which services fewer trips than Uber, did not disclose the total number of rides represented in its report, but at 0.0002 percent, the incident rate was the same as Uber’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qh9RsO"&gt;Driver groups criticized Lyft for a lack of attention to safety, especially as it relates to drivers. The report reveals that 10 drivers were killed in fatal assaults. “Lyft frames these fatalities as anomalies,” the group Gig Workers Rising said in a statement. “The truth is ten people are dead. Their families are left with no support from Lyft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dph4tj"&gt;In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/business/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit.html"&gt;19 women sued Lyft&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly failing to prevent sexual assault perpetrated by drivers and for doing little to investigate the complaints. A California woman who says she was raped by a Lyft driver in 2017 also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20870765/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit-alison-turkos-safety-complaints"&gt;sued the company in September&lt;/a&gt; over failing to keep riders safe, while 14 additional women &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/tech/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit/index.html"&gt;sued Lyft earlier in September&lt;/a&gt; over its handling of sexual assault complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXNwwZ"&gt;Uber and Lyft both conduct background checks and say passenger safety is their top priority. They also have largely attempted to tackle this issue through technology updates, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17402172/uber-911-panic-button-app-live-us"&gt;in-app “panic buttons,”&lt;/a&gt; which let riders instantly dial 911, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143679/uber-rider-reporting-safety-issue-driver-trip"&gt;ways to report a driver for unsafe activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6VguE"&gt;Earlier this year, the companies joined together &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325675/uber-lyft-driver-deactivate-assault-murder-share-safety"&gt;to announce a “first-of-its-kind” effort &lt;/a&gt;to share information about drivers who were deactivated for committing serious offenses, including physical and sexual assault and murder. Drivers are classified as independent contractors, not employees, meaning they can — and frequently do — drive for both companies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Feds reportedly take down top ransomware hacker group REvil with a hack of their own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eFikt-oGQcQ2TmMUeWPEsOl9Qtc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70032139/acastro_170621_1777_0001_fin.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dUXHdA"&gt;The government has successfully hacked the hacking group REvil, the entity behind the ransomware that’s been linked to leaked Apple leaks, attacks on enterprise software vendors, and more, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-governments-turn-tables-ransomware-gang-revil-by-pushing-it-offline-2021-10-21/"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The outlet’s sources tell it that the FBI, Secret Service, Cyber Command, and organizations from other countries have worked together to take the group’s operations offline this month. The group’s dark web blog, which exposed information gleaned from its targets, is also reportedly offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGeZwj"&gt;Reports about the group going offline started surfacing earlier this week, with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; writing that &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/revil-ransomware-group-goes-dark-after-its-tor-sites-were-hijacked/"&gt;its Tor website was no longer available on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. There was speculation of a hack, fueled by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ddd1ms/status/1449865145308651528"&gt;a forum post from one of the group’s suspected leaders&lt;/a&gt; saying that its server was “compromised,” but at the time, it was unclear who was responsible. &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; cites sources that say the government’s operation against ransomware hackers, including REvil, is still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mdNhsh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US has been turning the screws on ransomware groups&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pSpqwi"&gt;The US is slowly turning the screws on groups associated with ransomware, as the attacks become more and more costly for companies (one company reportedly paid a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446388/cna-insurance-ransomware-attack-40-million-dollar-ransom"&gt;$40 million ransom&lt;/a&gt; to restore its operations). The Treasury pushed sanctions that make it harder to turn hacked machines into cash, and the Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714241/us-justice-department-cryptocurrency-enforcement-unit"&gt;created a team&lt;/a&gt; for investigating crimes committed by cryptocurrency exchanges, citing the impact of ransomware several times in &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/7ab719c2-7813-4131-96cd-10ccb7e93dc3"&gt;its announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lU4E3J"&gt;REvil has had plenty of heat on it due to the high-profile or high-impact nature of the attacks it’s linked to. It’s blamed for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396283/apple-schematics-leak-ransomware-quanta-supplier-leak"&gt;an attack on an Apple supplier&lt;/a&gt; that leaked schematics of the MacBooks that launched this week, as well as attacks on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466003/jbs-cyberattack-fbi-revil-sodinokibi-criminal-group"&gt;massive meat processor JBS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22561252/revil-ransomware-attacks-systems-using-kaseyas-remote-it-management-software"&gt;IT management software developer Kaseya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054951/travelex-currency-exchange-offline-malware-attack-ransom"&gt;Travelex&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341642/acer-ransomware-microsoft-exchange-revil-security"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt;. The group was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728765/us-treasury-ransomware-payout-numbers-reports-2021-first-half-cybercrime"&gt;named by the US Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network&lt;/a&gt; as one of the biggest ransomware groups in terms of reported payouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BAbf3O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;REvil is one of the largest ransomware groups, according to the Treasury&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IsfDM7"&gt;REvil has gone offline before —  &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57826851"&gt;its site disappeared from the dark web&lt;/a&gt; in July, just a month after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466003/jbs-cyberattack-fbi-revil-sodinokibi-criminal-group"&gt;FBI said the group was responsible&lt;/a&gt; for bringing down JBS, a company responsible for a fifth of the world’s meat supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kt6kr"&gt;It’s always possible that the group could come back, though trying to recover from going down in July is reportedly what opened it up to attacks from the US in the first place.  &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-governments-turn-tables-ransomware-gang-revil-by-pushing-it-offline-2021-10-21/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters’&lt;/em&gt; sources&lt;/a&gt;, one of the group’s members restored a backup and unwittingly included systems compromised by law enforcement. A Russian security expert tells &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that infecting backups is a tactic commonly used by REvil itself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will let you subscribe to a newsletter right from a tweet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5NQVVfnKb-3gHf77QCoUWxrDld8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70032116/acastro_170726_1777_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8kE6IY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250156/twitter-revue-newsletter-acquisition-email-service"&gt;Twitter bought out the email newsletter service, Revue&lt;/a&gt;, earlier this year, hoping to engage journalists and writers who want to share long-form content without feeling limited by Twitter’s 280 character limit. Now, the newly integrated service is getting an update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NFKuQz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  We’ve got big news. (You’re really going to like this.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting today, your followers can subscribe to Revue newsletters directly from Tweets in their timeline. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is already enabled for all Revue writers on desktop and mobile web, with iOS and Android to follow soon. ✨ &lt;a href="https://t.co/6eBxvGWyxH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6eBxvGWyxH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Revue (@revue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/revue/status/1451564116007657472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5GAMDf"&gt;In a tweet, Revue revealed that users can now subscribe to a newsletter just by clicking on a link in a Tweet. And if a user’s email address is linked to their Twitter account, they can now subscribe with a single click, with no email verification required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQRggG"&gt;Revue notes that while the feature is currently available to Revue users on desktop and web, it’s set to arrive on Android and iOS in the near future. This comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632414/twitter-newsletter-subscription-button-revue-profile"&gt;Twitter tested out a newsletter subscription button on users’ profiles&lt;/a&gt; in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8QbJH"&gt;Twitter’s acquisition of Revue puts it head-to-head with Substack, a paid newsletter service that helps users establish a following of readers. As Casey Newton notes in &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/what-i-learned-from-a-year-on-substack"&gt;his article on &lt;em&gt;The Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, popularity on Substack largely depends on your audience on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kuUuqt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The only way a Substack grows is through tweets”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J5Jxuo"&gt;“The only way a Substack grows is through tweets,” Newton said after using the service for a year. “I wish I had other obvious avenues for growth, but to date, it really feels like it’s Twitter or nothing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZEnNd"&gt;With Revue becoming even more ingrained in Twitter’s interface, one can only imagine the effect this might have on Substack users. Creators may feel more inclined to use Revue instead, thanks to its convenience and the fact that it seamlessly integrates into their tweets and profiles. While you can point readers to your Substack via social media, it may need better promotion options — perhaps some that are built into certain networks. Otherwise, Revue could begin to outpace it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s latest sci-fi drama Invasion starts out too dang slow</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0cD52c"&gt;For a show about an alien invasion,&lt;em&gt; Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is decidedly lacking in aliens thus far. The latest sci-fi drama on Apple TV Plus, the series debuts with three episodes, which, theoretically, should give viewers a good sense of what to expect. Instead, those episodes oh-so-slowly introduce you to characters and stories without giving much of a hint as to how it all connects aside from the teaseist of teases. Three hours in, and I’m still not even sure what it’s about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYfhd0"&gt;The big hook of &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is that it’s a global story. The idea is that you’ll be able to see the impact of this event from a bunch of different perspectives, and at the very least, it succeeds at that (albeit with the expected American-centric viewpoint). Over the first few episodes, you’re introduced to a sheriff in Oklahoma, a housewife in Long Island, a US soldier stationed in Afghanistan, a teen in London, and an expert in Tokyo working with the International Space Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4v9II"&gt;And the show’s creators &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want you to know each of these individuals. The first three episodes are spent almost entirely on setting up their lives and circumstances. You’ll see a marriage slowly unravel (with some help from Find My iPhone, in one of the more obvious bits of product placement on Apple TV Plus) and watch a boy’s struggles with an almost pathological bully at school. I was particularly drawn into a secretive relationship between two women at the Japanese space agency that’s tragically cut short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bULNKY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2xFrbVNx0U?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R2oUYZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ratio of human drama and sci-fi storytelling is completely out of whack&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2LBsGJ"&gt;Many of these stories are interesting, even if they often delve into cliche; the sheriff, of course, is one day away from retirement before the invasion starts to happen. The problem is that the ratio of human drama and sci-fi storytelling is completely out of whack. Across the first three hours, there are only hints of alien elements. There’s the usual like crop circles and fleeing animals, as well as some more unsettling moments like when an entire music class simultaneously gets a nosebleed. Eventually, things start crashing into the planet, causing havoc while TV news reports blame it on terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7X1WI"&gt;I’m all for a slow burn, but after three episodes, I should have some clearer sense of the titular&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;invasion. (Apple’s other big sci-fi drama, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, is similarly slow, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"&gt;but at least it’s pretty to look at&lt;/a&gt;.) Here the pacing feels like it's stopping this invasion dead in its tracks. It's great meeting the characters and having a strong sense of their lives before aliens blow it up, but I am also here to see actual aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOc8VT"&gt;It’s entirely plausible that things pick up soon, and the sci-fi elements are actually interesting. We still have seven episodes to go. (New episodes will release every Friday, like most series on Apple.) But early on, &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; demands far too much of viewers, expecting them to stick around without giving much assurance of an eventual payoff. Please, just show me an alien already.&lt;/p&gt;
