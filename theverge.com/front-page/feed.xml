    <title>Comcast is yet again delaying its data cap rollout to 12 states, this time until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="comcast" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fIQ2AX3FefKjXP_KWVvr2TemivI=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68843765/comcast.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tApHeS"&gt;If you live in one of the last states where Comcast hasn’t rolled out its data caps, you’re getting another reprieve: &lt;a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/stories/were-giving-our-northeast-customers-more-time"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s now pushing back the rollout to some time in 2022 (&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/comcast-responds-to-pressure-cancels-data-cap-in-northeast-us-until-2022/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The 1.2TB data caps, which incur extra charges if users go over them, were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591420/comcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity"&gt;originally slated to roll out in March&lt;/a&gt; but were then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264430/comcast-data-cap-rollout-delayed-twelve-us-states-isp-bills"&gt;delayed until July&lt;/a&gt;. Comcast hasn’t said specifically when next year the rollout would occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q016nB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are providing them with more time to become familiar with the new plan.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jMBt9u"&gt;These caps will be familiar if you don’t live in Comcast’s Northeast region, which consists of Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Vermont, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, (along with parts of North Carolina and Ohio). Most of Comcast’s customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/6/13192832/comcast-xfinity-home-internet-data-caps-one-terabyte"&gt;have dealt with them for years&lt;/a&gt;, and that won’t be changing. Even though the new rollout is delayed, Comcast told &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; that its customers in 27 other states wouldn’t be getting a break from the caps and overage fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDTb0k"&gt;The ISP’s reasoning for the delay, according to the announcement, is that the company realizes that the “data plan was new for [its] customers in the Northeast,” and it wanted to “provid[e] them with more time to become familiar with the new plan.” This isn’t a courtesy the company extended to other states when it expanded the data caps to them (apart from the one or two “free” overage months). But to be fair, there also wasn’t a global pandemic going on during those rollouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8s1iCS"&gt;However, it seems obvious that Comcast doesn’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to implement data caps in order to provide service — otherwise, it wouldn’t be able to keep delaying the rollout, nor would it have been able to keep the region data-cap free for years. It’s unclear whether the company will use the added delay to reconsider its planned rollout, despite the lack of popularity of the plan with both customers and lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple lawyers are fighting for Steam sales data on hundreds of games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZytTFHv0B1xloUU2ZOllZQTC2dg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68843694/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AhyRCz"&gt;Apple subpoenaed Valve in November as part of its ongoing litigation with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;developer Epic Games, and it’s demanding that Valve provide extensive sales data for more than 400 games, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.346.0.pdf"&gt;new filing&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/apple-subpoenas-valve-as-part-of-its-legal-battle-with-epic-valve-fights-back/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSU7P8"&gt;The move comes amid Apple’s ongoing fight over Epic’s efforts to avoid paying iOS App Store fees. Apple argues that Valve’s data is necessary to calculate the size of the market of Epic’s “available distribution channels,” as Epic could theoretically offer its games through Steam in addition to other digital marketplaces. But the data is also immensely valuable in assessing the marketplace for games and apps — a space in which Apple’s iOS App Store continues to compete with Valve’s Steam marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNayho"&gt;Valve contends that Apple’s demands are extraordinary and is contesting the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ClS0x"&gt;In one request, Apple calls on Valve to procure documents that show the company’s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="P9LoK1"&gt;(a) total yearly sales of apps and in-app products; (b) annual advertising revenues from Steam; (c) annual sales of external products attributable to Steam; (d) annual revenues from Steam; and (e) annual earnings (whether gross or net) from Steam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="L1Vjcl"&gt;Apple argues that this data is “crucial” to help it determine “the total size of the market for Epic’s available digital distribution channels.” The courts have already asked Samsung to provide “almost identical” information, Apple said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="df5Ni3"&gt;In addition, Apple &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; demands that Valve procure documents that show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6Zp6Fl"&gt;(a) the name of each App on Steam; (b) the date range when the App was available on Steam; and (c) the price of the App and any in-app product available on Steam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GWQb3Z"&gt;Valve argues that the requests are overly broad. According to Valve’s position statement in the filing, “Apple gave Valve a list of 436 video games it says are available on the Epic Game Store and Steam, and (a) demanded Valve identify, from 2015 to the present, every version and all digital content or items for each of these games on Steam, then (b) provide exhaustive information about all of them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWZ132"&gt;The requested information includes dates on sale, price changes, gross revenues for “game version and item, broken down individually,” and Valve’s revenues “related to these versions, content and items.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxB5sP"&gt;Valve argues these demands would “impose an extraordinary burden on Valve to query, process and combine a massive amount of to create the documents Apple seeks” and that it does not keep this data as part of the “ordinary course of business.” (The filing also notes that Apple had reduced its request for data from “all 30,000+ games on Steam over ten years” to “436 games over six years.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibrLaX"&gt;Valve also argues that “much of what Apple seeks is sales and pricing information for third party games,” but that the company is taking a “shortcut” by subpoenaing Valve instead of getting the information directly from third-party developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMd1qW"&gt;On Wednesday, Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286998/epic-games-apple-european-comission-antitrust-complaint-app-store-fortnite"&gt;filed a formal antitrust complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Apple with the European Commission, arguing that Apple has “not just harmed but completely eliminated competition in app distribution and payment processes.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stacked widgets and a new look for the lock screen may be coming to Android 12</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sKTaK2xko0YaLwiANpl4EEMIyQo=/0x8:1586x1065/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68843530/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_9.09.19_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The lock screen and always on display may be getting a redesign in Android 12. | Images: XDA-Developers&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mxWIyo"&gt;It’s been a big couple of weeks for Android fans. First came &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274071/google-android-12-ui-screenshots-privacy-indicator-conversations-widget-leak-rumor"&gt;the leaks&lt;/a&gt;. Then Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;officially made its Android 12 developer preview available&lt;/a&gt;, allowing curious folks to dig in and see what the company has actually been working on. The past couple of days have brought &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289976/android-12-developer-preview-roundup-notifications-redesign-tweaks-emergency-sos"&gt;many discoveries&lt;/a&gt; of tweaks and features that Android 12 will offer, including some hints at what UI changes may be on the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNjLxY"&gt;First up: &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/19/android-12-dp1-has-its-own-hidden-take-on-widget-stacks/"&gt;stacked widgets&lt;/a&gt;, similar to iOS. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1362543670050881543"&gt;Mishaal Rahman identified&lt;/a&gt; the “expanded smart space” feature, which appears to let users scroll between widgets occupying the same space on the home screen. It’s similar to the Smart Stacks feature introduced in iOS 14, which allows you to “stack” widgets of the same size and scroll between them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fYbFvC29DBitTsjiSQG1iULmtOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315345/widget_stack.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Mishaal Rahman&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new feature may allow you to swipe across the screen to scroll between widgets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fdjZQT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; has also &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-new-lockscreen-notifications-design-leak/"&gt;been able to confirm&lt;/a&gt; some of the previously leaked UI changes. It’s been able to enable a new lock screen and always-on display, with larger clock text that’s stacked with the hours on top of minutes. On the lock screen, it floats to the right when notifications come in. The always-on display also shows a new placement of notification icons in the upper left of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPNVnv"&gt;It’s hard to know what these UI changes will look like in their final form (if they even make it to the customer-ready version of Android 12), but we do know that Google is planning to change certain aspects of its UI like notification appearance. These developer preview hints give an interesting look at what other changes might be in store.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Linux has made it to Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ow2e44Wh4dnBnYJ1Q1tGPAllY2s=/78x0:909x554/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68843411/pia23720_1041.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5iFo8Z"&gt;Yesterday, NASA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;landed a rover named Perseverance on Mars&lt;/a&gt;. I, along with 2 million other people, watched the landing happen live on YouTube. It was beautiful. I mean, here’s this little robot dude that’s traveled millions and millions of miles through the barrenness of space, and now it’s just hanging out on Mars taking pics and scientific samples! (Perseverance&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;joins older sibling Curiosity&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on the surface of the Red Planet. Hope they have a nice time together!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqjvQI"&gt;In any case, Perseverance&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;didn’t traverse the vastness of space alone. &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/6-things-to-know-about-nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter"&gt;Ingenuity&lt;/a&gt;, a tiny helicopter, tagged along for the ride. As it’s primarily a technology demonstration, Ingenuity’s destiny is to attempt the first powered flight on any planet other than Earth and to hopefully be the blueprint for future Mars missions. It’s also running on Linux. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CXwCTjcQg7wqGuWwzKyooy6HFPk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315240/1280px_PIA23882_MarsHelicopterIngenuity_20200429__trsp_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wikipedia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s Ingenuity!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AAAtWt"&gt;“This the first time we’ll be flying Linux on Mars,” NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) senior engineer Tim Canham &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/aerospace/robotic-exploration/nasa-designed-perseverance-helicopter-rover-fly-autonomously-mars"&gt;said in an interview with the the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers&lt;/a&gt; (IEEE). “The software framework that we’re using is one that we developed at JPL for cubesats and instruments, and we &lt;a href="https://github.com/nasa/fprime"&gt;open-sourced&lt;/a&gt; it a few years ago.” It’s called &lt;a href="https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/handle/2014/48425"&gt;F’&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced “F prime”). The fact that it’s open source means if you want to fly with Linux here on Earth using the same software JPL does, you absolutely can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2O1CCV"&gt;“It’s kind of an open-source victory, because we’re flying an open-source operating system and an open-source flight software framework and flying commercial parts that you can buy off the shelf if you wanted to do this yourself someday,” Canham said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WNzGqc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Breaking: Mars becomes the second planet that has more computers running Linux than Windows. &lt;a href="https://t.co/bsx0HukK9P"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bsx0HukK9P&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— @mikko (@mikko) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikko/status/1362763793042972673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5NQWCw"&gt;Great stuff. It’s cool that Perseverance, Curiosity, and Ingenuity have all found a new home on the surface Mars. Though I still think it’s cooler that space is pretty obviously inhospitable to human life, and yet we still put people up there anyway.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 vaccines are starting to work in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TOPSHOT-US-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qZPIDMAtU63GAhS0ywjk4QbR7FI=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68843276/1231207404.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Registered Nurse Ebony Thomas (L) administers a Moderna Covid-19 vaccine to Cecilia Onwytalu, 89, at Kedren Community Health Center, in South Central Los Angeles, California on February 16, 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Apu Gomes/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DIv2s7"&gt;If you know where to look, you can see COVID-19 vaccines starting to save lives in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tx1ynf"&gt;It’s not in the overall case numbers, though those &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been steadily dropping across the United States for weeks. Epidemiologists say there could be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nataliexdean/status/1362100680492601350"&gt;a few reasons&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/02/why-covid-19-cases-are-falling-so-fast/618041/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; that decline: we’re past the holiday seasons surge and people changed their behavior in response to the winter spikes. And by now, many people have antibodies against the virus because of a previous infection. But vaccines probably aren’t a driving factor in that drop — not enough people had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 when the decline started, and vaccination rates are still relatively low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZnMZk"&gt;Some groups of people, though, have high enough rates of vaccination that the benefits are starting to show. Connecticut was one of the first states to finish vaccinations in long-term care facilities and nursing homes. All residents who wanted a vaccine got their first dose by January 8th, and most were fully vaccinated by the end of January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvCqdF"&gt;The impact was &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-news-coronavirus-nursing-home-deaths-cases-covid-20210204-m6mwvhuguzfphpbv2bcwfqtq4m-story.html"&gt;dramatic&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of 2020, around 400 nursing home residents in Connecticut&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;were testing positive each week, and around 100 were dying. In the week ending February 2nd, when most were fully vaccinated, there were 101 cases and 35 deaths — down nearly 80 percent from the month before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPA3zT"&gt;“I have to believe it’s having an impact,” Keith Grant, senior system director for infection prevention at Hartford HealthCare, &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-news-coronavirus-nursing-home-deaths-cases-covid-20210204-m6mwvhuguzfphpbv2bcwfqtq4m-story.html"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Hartford Courant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the start of February. At that time, trends were just starting to show declines in nursing home cases and deaths. Since then, things have continued to improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYBVBg"&gt;Overall case trends in Connecticut are going down as well, which contributes to the decline in nursing homes. But the drop is steeper for that group than for the state as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FFazee"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Worth noting that COVID-19 cases have declined significantly across the state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the slope has been particularly sharp in nursing homes, where more than 90% of residents are vaccinated. &lt;a href="https://t.co/nxGvrSxD0l"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nxGvrSxD0l&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alex Putterman (@AlexPutterman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlexPutterman/status/1362518746162745348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHiaR9"&gt;Other groups of people in the US, including health care workers and other essential workers, are also starting to be fully vaccinated. The shots are already protecting them, as well. A team of researchers looked at &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.15.21251623v1.full.pdf"&gt;around 30,000 vaccinated people&lt;/a&gt; with health records with the Mayo Clinic Health System, who the researchers noted should mostly be health care workers and residents in long-term care facilities. The rates of COVID-19 in that group started to flatten a few weeks after their first doses, while rates in a group of similar but unvaccinated people continued to climb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pRgl6k"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;More promising real-world data on the mRNA vaccines, this time from the USA. Still not tired of seeing gaping chasms in Kaplan-Meier curves&lt;a href="https://t.co/3oRJ6l1cLm"&gt;https://t.co/3oRJ6l1cLm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/s609i5RULl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/s609i5RULl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dylan Morris (@dylanhmorris) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dylanhmorris/status/1362536708013756417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="prGM5q"&gt;These victories are still only in subsets of the population. But even though vaccinations may not be driving down overall case numbers quite yet, we could start to see their impacts on hospitalizations and deaths soon. Older adults, who are the most likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID-19, are among the first groups getting vaccinated across the country. Higher percentages of that group have received shots than in the population at large. As that number ticks up, hospitalizations could start to fall, even if younger people are still getting sick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyNxbY"&gt;Experts point to the 75 to 80 percent threshold as the point when enough people would be vaccinated that the spread of COVID-19 would start to stall out. Still, the vaccines could start flattening overall trends in the US much sooner than that. &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab079/6124429"&gt;One modeling study&lt;/a&gt; found that if even just 40 percent of the population is vaccinated, cases would fall and hospitalizations and deaths would drop by between 60 and 70 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBhCQw"&gt;That isn’t showing up in the data quite yet, and it’s still critical to stick to the COVID-19 prevention measures that are actually driving the US case numbers down: masks, avoiding gatherings, and so on. But there are flickers of hope from the pockets where most people are vaccinated, and eventually, those will start to expand. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok’s latest hit is an accidental upload from a government office in rural Indiana</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TikToks from the Orange County, Indiana County Clerk’s office" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FJrmCdBPCyYWR81gsOlGwoVNQ6A=/8x0:2033x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68843266/Bye_Connie.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alex Parkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6uiiWb"&gt;A series of accidentally posted office videos has become an unexpected viral hit on TikTok. The most popular shows a series of municipal employees bidding farewell to their colleague, Connie, against the backdrop of a prairie-hued office space straight out of &lt;em&gt;Parks &amp;amp; Rec&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZogBe"&gt;“Congratulations from the Orange County clerk’s office,” says the male deputy clerk, before stepping off to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwSDxx"&gt;County Clerk Elizabeth Jones steps into the frame: “We wish you the best in your future endeavors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISQZ2a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ag9wuJ"&gt;“We appreciate the good job that you have done for the state of Indiana,” says another, before making room for a fourth. “Goodbye, Connie!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6CLEe"&gt;As of press time, more than 40,000 users have liked the video, and it has been viewed more than 300,000 times. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@deputyclerk"&gt;The @deputyclerk account&lt;/a&gt;, which was only launched yesterday, has already amassed nearly 3,000 followers, despite having only eight videos, all of which are variations on the same goodbye message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cY4f6I"&gt;The videos have inspired a wave of spinoff content, as users look to put their own spin on the burgeoning meme. In most cases, users take on the role of Connie, imagining themselves to be as loved and appreciated as her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Tla0Jo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@christynics/video/6930815416541515014" data-video-id="6930815416541515014" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@christynics" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@christynics"&gt;@christynics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="duet" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/duet"&gt;#duet&lt;/a&gt; with @deputyclerk &lt;a title="iamconnie" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/iamconnie"&gt;#iamconnie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="BoseAllOut" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/BoseAllOut"&gt;#BoseAllOut&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="greenscreenvideo" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/greenscreenvideo"&gt;#greenscreenvideo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="driverslicense" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/driverslicense"&gt;#driverslicense&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Deputy Clerk" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6930623471508572933"&gt;♬ original sound - Deputy Clerk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="Oy5XdX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@knockoutkaius/video/6930826324323994885" data-video-id="6930826324323994885" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@knockoutkaius" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@knockoutkaius"&gt;@knockoutkaius&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="duet" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/duet"&gt;#duet&lt;/a&gt; with @deputyclerk I’ll miss my work fam     &lt;a title="froppycosplay" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/froppycosplay"&gt;#froppycosplay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="mhacosplay" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/mhacosplay"&gt;#mhacosplay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Deputy Clerk" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6930622731847305989"&gt;♬ original sound - Deputy Clerk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GH2K4p"&gt;
&lt;p id="zZKGL7"&gt;In other cases, users have lip-synced over the audio. “New Trend alert: which voice fits u best,” &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@elizard_beth/video/6930776801908215046"&gt;asks one such video&lt;/a&gt;. “Charli u have 24 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAWHON"&gt;The sudden internet fame has been a whirlwind for the clerk’s office, which was not even aware the videos were being posted online. Based in Paoli, Indiana (population 3,677), the clerk’s team is still unsure why the videos have attracted so much attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpoIxY"&gt;“We didn’t know that it was on TikTok,” says Elizabeth Jones, who leads the clerk’s office for Orange County Clerk. “Somehow it got in the for you page, and it got send to a lot of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPqwTW"&gt;“People were like, why did I get this,” Jones continued. “It was really meant just to be her goodbye video.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJh7tq"&gt;The videos begin on Thursday morning, when the office heard news that beloved Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson was retiring. A number of state employees were recording farewell videos for Lawson, and the Orange County office decided to record its version using TikTok to take advantage of the app’s native filter capabilities. But while several clerks were TikTok users, none had ever made a video using the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhTbte"&gt;“We all had issues with one or the other so we just did it seven or eight times,” says Deputy Clerk Olivia Griffith, the last woman to speak in the video. “It said ‘save to my device,’ so I thought it was just going to the photo gallery on my phone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3NkyZ"&gt;Many had assumed that the rejected videos would disappear entirely. “The one where I’m singing…that definitely wasn’t supposed to be seen by anybody else,” says Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHQ6Eu"&gt;With 3,000 followers, the office now has a surprising level of TikTok clout, although they’re still undecided on whether they will try to expand on their newfound fame with more videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDfXsu"&gt;“I don’t know,” says Griffith. “We haven’t thought about it. We may.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus went down for some subscribers right when WandaVision’s new episode hit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LRI9hz7RlQPDfytfa-1gn8gVszA=/70x0:1690x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68843171/wandavision.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VZ0cVw"&gt;Some Disney Plus users trying to watch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291176/wandavision-episode-7-explainer-agatha-harkness-agnes-monica-rambeau"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the minute it landed were met with loading issues as outage problems affected the streaming platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrRiwS"&gt;A number of accounts mostly located on the West Coast of the United States were affected by a surge in traffic on the platform that caused an outage of roughly 10 minutes, according to the company. Reports about the length of the outage ranged on Twitter, with some people experiencing problems for closer to 30 minutes, leading to trending topics with names like “NOT DISNEY” and “DISNEY+ DOWN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ej0Ybi"&gt;Other reports from people on the East Coast and in the UK also made rounds. Concerns about issues with the specific episode, like encoding problems, are false, according to the company. A screenshot of Down Detector for Disney Plus can be seen below. The outage peaked around 3:05AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KM528ylPE8HzeALPjdsMpVExywA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315198/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_3.35.52_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Down Detector&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshot of Disney Plus going down, via Down Detector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5SF0mR"&gt;This is not the first time that Disney Plus has faced loading issues. When the service launched, alongside the premiere of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/19/20973340/disney-plus-first-day-outages-app-amazon-bamtech-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s first episode&lt;/a&gt;, reports of Disney Plus not loading circulated social media. Since then, the app has remained mostly fine, with few reports of widespread outages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iF30Ye"&gt;Other Disney streaming platforms, however, have faced outage issues. Most recently, a number of customers using ESPN Plus to watch UFC 257 faced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/24/22247257/espn-plus-technical-issue-ufc-pay-per-view-mcgregor-poirier"&gt;ongoing outage issues&lt;/a&gt; leading up to the main title fight. A Disney spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on January 24th that teams were “aware that a technical issue prevented a portion of users from accessing the early part of the ESPN+ pay-per-view event, and we apologize for that experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmggRI"&gt;“We worked as quickly as possible to identify and resolve the issue,” the spokesperson added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TyIjue"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;isn’t the same thing as a Conor McGregor vs. Dustin Poirier fight, the show is one of the most popular series around the world, according to data from Parrot Analytics supplied to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Over the last couple of weeks, the show has become 90.9x as popular (or more in-demand) than the average show globally, analyst Wade Payson-Denney told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. It is a top show in 10 different countries on five different continents. So, yes — &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;is popular. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ihUDwqb4J0x9W60iSRHhCGGx-Yg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315224/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_11.34.08_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Parrot Analytics&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4YTc57"&gt;The show has also landed on Nielsen’s most-watched list of streaming originals, seeing millions of streams between the first and second week of the show’s debut. While Nielsen ratings aren’t perfect (they only measure viewership in the United States and don’t count certain methods of watching like on tablets), it goes to show that &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s weekly release strategy is working. The first two episodes averaged between 6.5 million and 8.5 million streams, depending on how many people watched the end credits all the way through, according to Nielsen data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oUqm5"&gt;This doesn’t fully explain why &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;went down this week and not in other weeks prior, or why &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s season 2 finale didn’t cause the streaming platform to stutter. It’s possible Disney ensured that servers were better prepared for the finale because of expected viewership, and it could be that &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s weekly viewing at exactly 12AM PT / 3AM ET was unexpected, even by Marvel’s standards. What we do know from the House of Mouse is that it mainly affected West Coast accounts for a short period of time. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch BlizzCon 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BlizzCon 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7I-R9yizCKHBuPZuLtqkSmgfYRg=/0x0:2025x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68843008/blizzcon2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PySwen"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271059/blizzcon-2020-canceled-blizzard-entertainment"&gt;canceling BlizzCon 2020 due to the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard is back — earlier than usual in the year — for BlizzCon 2021. Blizzard is actually calling it “BlizzConline 2021.” Expect to hear updates on anticipated titles, including &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/em&gt;, and perhaps a sneak peek at the rumored &lt;em&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/em&gt; remaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u97fng"&gt;Activision, Blizzard’s parent company, announced during a recent earnings call that both &lt;em&gt;Diablo 4&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; wouldn’t see a 2021 release. And while that’s disappointing, there will likely be some news on games releasing this year. A likely candidate is the &lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt; game for iOS and Android phones, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22180377/diablo-immortal-iphone-android-technical-alpha-preview"&gt;my colleague Andrew Webster got to experience hands-on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0e2QmI"&gt;If you want to watch the festivities (which should still be plenty festive even if they won’t be replete with the usual amount of in-person cosplay), here’s how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="48AXhs"&gt;When is BlizzCon 2021 happening?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IBAToo"&gt;BlizzCon will start with the usual opening ceremony at 5PM ET / 2PM PT on Friday, February 19th, and it’s slated to last for an hour and 10 minutes. From then, the convention splits off into five different broadcasts, each focusing on a different game. &lt;a href="https://blizzcon.com/en-us/schedule"&gt;Here’s the full schedule&lt;/a&gt;. All broadcasts are scheduled to wrap up by 8:40PM ET / 5:40PM PT. If you’re looking for news on games, it’ll likely happen on day one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpmEFx"&gt;However, it’ll start up again on Saturday, February 20th, at 3PM ET / 12PM PT. The day two schedule consists of Q&amp;amp;A sessions, community showcases, and additional entertainment, like a &lt;em&gt;Diablo &lt;/em&gt;tabletop campaign hosted by the &lt;em&gt;Critical Role&lt;/em&gt; crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EIjr67"&gt;Does it cost anything to attend BlizzCon 2021?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lCUgG5"&gt;Nope. It’s free to attend, unlike previous in-person BlizzCon events that required tickets. If you want some of the goodies that usually came with a ticket, you can buy a BlizzCon bundle of &lt;a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/celebration-collection"&gt;in-game items and cosmetics right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DiN5Ym"&gt;Where can I watch BlizzCon 2021?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BKpSNg"&gt;Blizzard is hosting its online convention at &lt;a href="http://BlizzCon.com"&gt;BlizzCon.com&lt;/a&gt;, or through &lt;a href="http://Battle.net"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt;, Activision Blizzard’s game launcher on desktop and mobile. It’s also going to stream live from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/blizzard"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/blizzard"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VW’s next electric SUV, the ID 5 coupe, will go into production in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vNpyltLz_q-SW_ia-mXOYPAmUyg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68842984/akrales_200915_4161_0361.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LDwQl2"&gt;Volkswagen confirmed that its next electric vehicle, the ID 5, will start production in Germany in the second half of 2021. The first pilot series of the ID 5 has already started production, the automaker confirmed in a recent tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJf1sw"&gt;The ID 5 will be a coupe version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21444141/volkswagen-vw-id4-electric-suv-price-range-specs"&gt;the ID 4 compact SUV&lt;/a&gt;, which went on sale in Europe, China, and North America in late 2020. The ID 4 is the first vehicle built on VW’s modular MEB electric architecture to be available in North America. Its predecessor, the hatchback ID 3, is only being sold in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5DkR6"&gt;The ID 5 may also fail to reach this side of the Atlantic Ocean. A VW spokesperson said, “There are no plans to bring the car to the US at the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="45XwS4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="de" dir="ltr"&gt;Es ist offiziell: Auf den &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID3?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#VWID3&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID4?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#VWID4&lt;/a&gt; folgt der &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID5?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#VWID5&lt;/a&gt;!

Die ersten Vorserien laufen bereits…  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/emobility?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#emobility&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/c9W5hxnE7E"&gt;pic.twitter.com/c9W5hxnE7E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— vwsachsen_de (@vwsachsen_de) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vwsachsen_de/status/1359873451285184512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P3YeW2"&gt;A rough translation of that tweet reads, “It’s official: on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID3?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#VWID3&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID4?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#VWID4&lt;/a&gt; follows the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID5?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#VWID5&lt;/a&gt; ! As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VW?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#VW&lt;/a&gt; -Mark boss Ralf Brandstätter in conversation with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WN_Wolfsburg"&gt;@WN_Wolfsburg&lt;/a&gt; announced, the coupé SUV will be sold in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Zwickau?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#Zwickau&lt;/a&gt; built. Market launch: 2nd half of 2021! The first pilot series are already running ...&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/emobility?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#emobility&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boooF8"&gt;VW’s ID electric lineup also includes concept versions of a large SUV (&lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-volkswagen-i-d-roomzz-concept-has-room-for-days-an-1834048772"&gt;ID Roomzz&lt;/a&gt;), a dune buggy (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254329/volkswagen-id-buggy-electric-concept-car-geneva-motor-show-2019"&gt;ID Buggy&lt;/a&gt;), and a revamped version of its iconic microbus (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/19/16173938/volkswagen-microbus-i-d-buzz-concept-production-nostalgia"&gt;ID Buzz&lt;/a&gt;), for which VW has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882400/vw-volkswagen-id-buzz-cargo-van-concept-electric"&gt;promised a delivery variant&lt;/a&gt;. All are being built on Volkswagen’s modular electric vehicle platform known as MEB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QEOAGa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The first pilot series are already running”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bo5mmt"&gt;The ID family of vehicles won’t be VW’s first foray into battery-powered drivetrains. The e-Golf was first launched in 2012 but was discontinued in 2020 as the automaker shifts focus to its MEB-built vehicles. VW subsidiary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"&gt;Porsche’s first all-electric sports car, the Taycan&lt;/a&gt;, went on sale in 2019. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17876012/dieselgate-volkswagen-vw-diesel-emissions-test-epa-german-auto-industry-mercedes-benz-bmw"&gt;The E-Tron&lt;/a&gt;, the first battery-electric SUV from Volkswagen Group-owned Audi, debuted in 2018. Together, these vehicles represent the tip of the spear in VW’s effort to dominate the emerging EV market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipYYGi"&gt;They’re also crucial in helping VW turn the page on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17876012/dieselgate-volkswagen-vw-diesel-emissions-test-epa-german-auto-industry-mercedes-benz-bmw"&gt;now six-year-old Dieselgate scandal&lt;/a&gt;, in which VW was accused of installing illegal software in 11 million diesel cars in order to trick emissions tests.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are preowned or refurbished — will likely continue to sell out quickly during the pandemic. But we’ll do our best to keep this article up to date with the latest in-stock offers, and we’ll tell you when each offer was posted. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="D0nXc0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 8 best games for your new Nintendo Switch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/25/21012569/nintendo-switch-best-games-2019-pokemon-zelda"},{"title":"The best games of 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21126558/best-games-2020-ps4-ps5-xbox-nintendo-switch-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch Lite is the smaller, portable-only version of the console that comes in a few different color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="guePeD"&gt;Currently, you can buy the Nintendo Switch Monster Hunter Rise Deluxe Edition for $370 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-monster-hunter-rise-deluxe-edition-console%2F-%2FA-82493733%3Fclkid&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. The console is bundled with a special-edition Switch, as well as a digital code for &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; along with some DLC. Compared to other special edition consoles, this is one of the few Switch bundles that include a game with the console. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gG8y3P"&gt;You can buy the limited-edition &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; Nintendo Switch at &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-animal-crossing-new-horizons-edition%2F11100143.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-animal-crossing-new-horizons-edition%2F-%2FA-79494599%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

You can also get a similar bundle, but with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YBVJRD7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB MicroSD card for $327 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o2G175"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-gray-joy-con%2F206007.html%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-HzeKt4-dsaWdi9G9SGmxFTUUEAxrCA4NxZS0xEWCkIacwTZ_cUKPRoCEYUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html"&gt;Nintendo’s own online store where it sells refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Those have been sold out recently, but there’s no telling when it will restock the page with some repaired, refreshed consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/veAGHSQdVpomFEThPomQmjmS1bQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8070145/jbareham_1492_170228_0275.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can buy games on Switch cartridges or store several digital downloads purchased through the eShop on a microSD card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SC7BZHR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=d9d13492d7a2383ae455b1e464853cbe&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $70&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=ebcbe0aae0692190d419f2c892d31718&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A 400GB microSD card will cost you around $40&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6yrravQwglpzWOC1tZVT479bwzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8028811/jbareham_170221_1475_0010.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch does not include a Pro Controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, Walmart also has the normal &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Switch Pro controller for $59&lt;/a&gt;, knockings $11 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zmgu8T"&gt;If you are looking to use your Nintendo Switch to also g&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2BZPIqmUqpLcZoV5GVxdxMULT3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9537475/akrales_171025_2091_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ulULMw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3ASPNV/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=03e07706174eba9d98e121bd33c717da&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A two-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Nintendo Switch is $8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l1NCcr"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2YZPQpf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TCPVHTM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=40eaf677c94a1341b4ed7beb385dbb06&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; three-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Switch Lite is $6&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=e9815cab861c6f59255b7b948189eef3&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728487093072266361" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
