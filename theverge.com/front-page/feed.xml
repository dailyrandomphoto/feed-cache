    <title>Facebook is secretly building a smartwatch and planning to sell it next year</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PnVUrK"&gt;Facebook is building a smartwatch as part of its ongoing hardware efforts, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-plans-smartwatch-with-focus-on-messaging-health?utm_source=ti_app"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The device is said to be an Android-based smartwatch, though the report does not say Facebook intends for the device to run Google’s Wear OS. It also says Facebook is working on building its own operating system for hardware devices and that future iterations of the wearable may run that software instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNzUm6"&gt;The smartwatch would have messaging, health, and fitness features, the report says, and would join Facebook’s Oculus virtual reality headsets and Portal video chat devices as part of the social network’s growing hardware ecosystem. Facebook is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;branded Ray-Ban smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; to come out later this year as part of its ongoing Project Aria initiative, an augmented reality project the company has been working on for some time now. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6O3hp"&gt;The social networking giant’s hardware ambitions are no secret. The company has more than 6,000 employees working on various augmented and virtual reality projects and as part of existing hardware divisions like Oculus and Portal, as well as on experimental initiatives under its Facebook Reality Labs division, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/facebook-smart-glasses-coming-sooner-than-later-without-ar?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported last month&lt;/a&gt;. And although Facebook has not expressed a strong interest in health and fitness devices in the past, the company does have a track record in wearables with its Oculus headsets and its forthcoming smart glasses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KUrLI"&gt;Facebook also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20881032/facebook-ctrl-labs-acquisition-neural-interface-armband-ar-vr-deal"&gt;acquired the neural interface startup CTRL-Labs&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. CTRL-Labs specialized in building wireless input mechanisms, including devices that could transmit electrical signals from the brain to computing devices without the need for traditional touchscreen or physical button inputs. The startup’s intellectual property and ongoing research may factor into whatever wearables Facebook builds in the future — including a smartwatch, smart glasses, or future Oculus headsets. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Jon Porter?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uH1JQEHPiR5CdIdiAeow4cz8DDA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512316/jporter_201208_4323_0017.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Fitting a lot of tech into a small space&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="gBdQ3J"&gt;Working from home has its advantages, but one of the problems that many people have to face is trying to find enough space in a crowded environment. Jon Porter, who is the London-based news reporter for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, has had to be especially resourceful in putting together a place where he could report, write, and review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1FcUQ"&gt;We talked to Jon to find out how he’s managed to do such great reporting out of a small space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2qSlJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdG2ny"&gt;I’m &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s UK-based news reporter. I’ve lived in London basically my entire life, and I’ve been with the site for a little over two years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BwWlGG"&gt;Day-to-day, I’m responsible for covering any tech news that breaks during UK hours before the US wakes up. But once the East Coast is awake, I can get down to business &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36QUbG5nPDk&amp;amp;t=97s"&gt;reviewing phones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c8UdKX6GBA"&gt;building keyboards&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522980/apple-iphone-12-pro-usb-c-lightning-environment-charger-box-electronic-waste"&gt;complaining about the iPhone’s lack of USB-C&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFXAFp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks like you really had to get a lot of workspace into a relatively small area. How did you manage it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEmUES"&gt;That’s putting it lightly. I share my flat in London with three other people, so a corner of my bedroom is about as much space as I can spare for a home office. I honestly don’t think I’d manage it if I hadn’t lucked out and found this desk being given away for free on the weekend I moved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E_vvFBYtuLs0xpj0G4wkSU1Vfq4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158036/jporter_201208_4323_0019.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kwYkh6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you manage that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMPZ9y"&gt;When we moved in, the flat was completely unfurnished, and we spent the first few months frantically scouring through services like &lt;a href="https://www.freecycle.org"&gt;Freecycle&lt;/a&gt; for any furniture people were giving away. Long story short, we met some people who were leaving the country and had a flat full of stuff to get rid of, so we rented a van and carted it all home. The van broke down en-route (don’t ask), but most of the furniture has served us well ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9UwEu"&gt;All of which is to say that I have absolutely no idea where the desk is from, who made it, or how much it would cost to buy new. But it’s very good at packing in a lot of stuff. There’s a little shelf under the monitor where I have a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-4-pro-black-1tb%2F10134659.html&amp;amp;u1=vergewhatsonyourdeskjonporterFeb2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 4 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and an Arcam irDAC stashed, and the keyboard tray lets me keep the desk surface itself clear-ish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ShiGy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that a wrist rest you have in front of your keyboard?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RM3U28"&gt;Absolutely! I love mechanical keyboards, but their keys are so tall compared to laptop-style keys that I find I need a rest to keep my wrists at a comfortable angle. I know you’re technically supposed to keep your hands raised while you type, but honestly that’s just so exhausting on my arms that I’ve never been able to stick with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDuWdk"&gt;The keyboard itself is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Filco-Majestouch-2-Tenkeyless-FKBN87M-EB2/dp/B004WOF7QM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b7e79c45caf9815118023c76fc3a2e2a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Filco Majestouch 2 Tenkeyless with Cherry MX Brown&lt;/a&gt; switches. I firmly believe that Filco makes the keyboards that feel the best to type on, and they’re what I’d recommend to anyone looking for a keyboard. The only problem is that the lettering on their keycaps can wear out a little quickly, so I swapped out the stock caps for a set manufactured by GMK. Oh, and I also installed a programmable keyboard controller in there so I could add some keyboard shortcuts for turning the volume up and down and whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jxHK7zIUKVyNvUU7G3O5F3-PyUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158042/jporter_201208_4323_0010.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wArvXR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looks like you’ve got a classy desk chair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0J1M5"&gt;This Herman Miller Aeron was the main investment I made this year after I’d been working from home full time for a few months. I bought it after I got tired of having to sit with a pillow supporting my lower back to stop it from hurting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCFDdM"&gt;In normal times I probably would have actually gone into a store and tried out a bunch of chairs in person, but unfortunately that wasn’t really possible. Instead I played it safe, and bought the chair that always seems to come up whenever people online talk about the best office chairs. I got my Aeron secondhand off eBay from a company that was clearly selling leftovers from office clearouts, but it’s treated me well so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PjMlQa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226965"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y0WqRz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your tech. Let’s start with your computer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jWYqV"&gt;Alrighty! It’s a bit of a work-in-progress at the moment while I wait for AMD’s new CPUs and Nvidia’s new graphics cards to come down in price, but for the time being I’m running an &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-3600"&gt;AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU&lt;/a&gt; paired with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17877968/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-review-benchmarks-performance-features"&gt;Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card&lt;/a&gt; and 16GB of RAM. That’s all packed into a &lt;a href="https://www.silverstonetek.com/product.php?pid=522&amp;amp;area=en"&gt;Silverstone FT05 case&lt;/a&gt; which, much like my keyboard, I like because it’s incredibly understated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iATjCQ"&gt;One day I want to upgrade that GPU to an &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726553874957965631" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt;, slap a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5600X-12-Thread-Processor/dp/B08166SLDF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ryzen 5600X&lt;/a&gt; in there, and downsize the whole machine into a small form-factor case, but who knows when that’ll happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XVhCx9sSAagAn8noTcUN1wDNul8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158038/jporter_201208_4323_0016.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZaMdR4s9AbPw39CWImLx9mU14Aw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158040/jporter_201208_4323_0012.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hefi-igiQlWja18O51fvV1JPIXU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158035/jporter_201208_4323_0021.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3HrpsS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve got an interesting arrangement of displays. You’ve got one hanging off the wall, and the other is, well, impressively big. How did you come up with this arrangement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdqI7r"&gt;I have to confess this isn’t how I’d have things set up if I had the choice. My main monitor is an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/AOC-AG352UCG6-Monitor-3440x1440-DisplayPort/dp/B07BMVNJZP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AOC AG352UCG 1440p ultrawide&lt;/a&gt; which would normally be out of my price range, but I got a deal on it because it’s a little… well… broken. Its DisplayPort works perfectly, and it supports G-Sync to keep games running smoothly, but unfortunately the HDMI port seems to be busted, so I can’t use it with the PS4 Pro I’ve got sitting underneath it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiFoZu"&gt;That’s why I have the second monitor sitting in landscape orientation to the left of it, for the PlayStation. Otherwise I’d have it in portrait and use it to read Twitter or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAlm3V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your other tech (headphones, speakers, etc.)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yN25ln"&gt;From left to right there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Snowball-Microphone-Textured-White/dp/B000EOPQ7E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=polygon05-20&amp;amp;linkId=7d9858b9243b3e5ec844044ebc69beb4&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blue Snowball microphone&lt;/a&gt;, which does exactly what I need it to and means I can get away with wearing normal headphones on calls. Then we’ve got my &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726554111787728059" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech Z200 speakers&lt;/a&gt;, which were just the cheapest I could find. They’re fine, but whenever I’m listening to something that matters I’m using headphones or streaming to an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-table-lamp-with-wifi-speaker-black-00464617%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22165831%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-jon-porter-nvidia-ps4-tech#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ikea Symfonisk Sonos speaker lamp&lt;/a&gt; I have on the other side of the room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F6y9Df"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10227163"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LzfHjp"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBXNV58/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=polygon05-20&amp;amp;linkId=fa544d7577613f1571bfde2ea745914c&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; stand on my desk for when my phone needs extra juice during the day, which rarely happens now that I’m at home all the time but it’s nice to know it’s there. The PS4 Pro sitting to the right of it needs no introduction. That little bar sitting on top of it is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mayflash-W010-Wireless-Sensor-DolphinBar/dp/B00HZWEB74/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=75a36df2d93c99d0fded1ce39e3c96ff&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mayflash W010 USB sensor bar&lt;/a&gt;, like the Nintendo Wii console used to have. I bought one for my PC so I could use it to emulate Wii games, and hopefully get around to completing &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime 3&lt;/em&gt; one of these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoybT3"&gt;Next up is the Arcam irDAC which handles audio for both the PS4 and my PC, and those accessories on top of it are an Anker SD card reader and a pair of Samsung’s Galaxy Beans, ahem sorry, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Widescreen-Calling-Recording-Desktop/dp/B006JH8T3S?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech C920 webcam&lt;/a&gt; on top of my monitor with a privacy shutter, and I have a bunch of USB cables hanging off of what’s supposed to be a headphone hook to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F9v8i2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oyxbRJ"&gt;Phew, that sounds like a lot! But remember that I live in a flatshare, so I basically have one room that all my tech lives in. One day all this stuff will spread out when I have the space for it, but for now it’s all here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mZv_Aun3vNC1Ea3nH3824TetVSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158041/jporter_201208_4323_0011.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q5iSzhzRpOtl2LBQUs14HHwUM60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158033/jporter_201208_4323_0024.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yR7QFz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a relatively clean desk — is that how you like to work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jp037d"&gt;In my ideal world, this would be how tidy I keep it all of the time. But the reality is that when review season hits and the devices start rolling in, I quickly end up with piles of phones, headphones, coffee cups, and whatever else on my desk. Thankfully we’re in a bit of a quieter period at the moment so I can keep things a little more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSeQdT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see there’s a notebook front and center.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfgPGD"&gt;It’s the only way I can stay organized. I know there are lots of good to-do list apps out there, but for me nothing beats keeping track of work using a physical notepad. Every day I force myself to write out what needs to be done, and the manual process helps me to remember each task. I also just find it much more convenient to quickly note down something on a physical pad while I’m on the phone, rather than trying to do everything from the same device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSr9zz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that a pint glass I see?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBwJ7H"&gt;Gotta keep hydrated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXi6DJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about your guitar. Do you keep it nearby for occasional breaks, or is that just a handy place to store it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YULd6c"&gt;Oh, it’s totally just a musical fidget spinner. Whenever I’m stuck, I pick up the guitar, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fender-Player-Stratocaster-Electric-Guitar/dp/B07CTYNK7C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ccf904b38de122cfc30f90e8f67d7bbf&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mexican-made Fender Stratocaster&lt;/a&gt;, and play a couple of chords while I think. I also used to play a lot while I waited for things to load, but SSDs put an end to that. I must have had it for 15 years or so, and although I rarely get around to playing seriously anymore, I could never bring myself to part with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKNo8C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 12th, 2021, 4PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on December 14th, 2020; links to and prices of various products have been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon delivery app Mentor tracks drivers’ locations and measures their performance </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6pz0yk"&gt;Amazon built its own in-house mobile app called Mentor that it uses to track the location and rate the performance of third-party delivery drivers, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/amazon-mentor-app-tracks-and-disciplines-delivery-drivers.html"&gt;new report from CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. The app tracks a driver’s location at all times and also generates a daily score that factors into performance evaluations, with low scores potentially harming a third-party delivery company’s relationship with Amazon for future contracts, the report states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQo9fB"&gt;Amazon bills the app as a tool for improving safety, but both drivers and privacy proponents cited by CNBC worry the Mentor software is also a tool for surveillance of drivers and as another form of pressure applied on the workers to ensure they’re delivering packages as fast as possible. Earlier this month, an Amazon promotional video posted online &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"&gt;revealed a new initiative&lt;/a&gt; involving always-on security cameras from a firm called Netradyne that are similarly used to monitor and measure a driver’s performance, causing alarm among privacy advocates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzUrvQ"&gt;“Safety is Amazon’s top priority. Whether it’s state-of-the art telemetrics and advanced safety technology in last-mile vans, driver-safety training programs, or continuous improvements within our mapping and routing technology, we have invested tens of millions of dollars in safety mechanisms across our network, and regularly communicate safety best practices to drivers,” an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5VtXw0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon says its monitoring measures are designed to improve safety&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xXQjYB"&gt;As its operations have expanded, Amazon has increasingly built out its own delivery infrastructure, part of which is the delivery service program (DPS). This program contracts third-party companies to help with the last-mile delivery that, until a few years ago, was mostly handled by companies like FedEx and UPS. Amazon uses its own drivers to help with cost-cutting measures and to increase the speed and efficiency of deliveries, as part of its broader effort to own and operate more of its logistics chain with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215279/amazon-buys-boeing-jets-planes-delta-westjet"&gt;purchases and leases of cargo freighters and airplanes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWM1gx"&gt;There have, however, been issues regarding driver and pedestrian safety. Amazon has, in some cases, skirted direct accountability for crashes, injuries, and even deaths at the hands of drivers delivering its packages to customers’ homes because of the contract nature of the work, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/us/amazon-delivery-drivers-accidents.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the company has come under fire for using software and other tools to prioritize the speed of deliveries over potential safety concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmzL6J"&gt;As a result, Amazon has reportedly begun exercising increasing control over its drivers by managing their routes and monitoring their behavior at all times with the goal of improving safety. The Monitor app and always-on surveillance cameras are part of those measures, though some drivers are concerned about how invasive these methods are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEe9pY"&gt;CNBC says drivers congregate online and discuss ways to try to game the system. For instance, drivers have tried wrapping their phones in sweaters and storing them in the glove box of delivery vans because of how unfairly they’re dinged for standard procedures on the job that the Monitor app mistakes for reckless driving, like marking a delivery as completed by picking the phone up. “If your device moves at all, it’s going to count against you,” one driver told CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pFUrw"&gt;There are also concerns about the location sharing permissions. Drivers are asked to download the app on their personal devices and to enable “always allow” location sharing, which has some drivers concerned Amazon is overstepping its boundary with regard to driver privacy, CNBC reported. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Taylor Lyles? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQXNtIAn-pH83zaecuXCC5kB97k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67851875/tlyles_201113_4294_0017.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An enthusiastic gamer creates her workspace&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="uJLbW5"&gt;Moving to a home office sometimes means making the most of a little space. Taylor Lyles, a writer at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, is one of those who has used imagination and tech know-how to create a great working area out of a small part of her room. Here’s how she did it. (And if you’re curious, a list of her tech is at the end of this article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xvUDW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, tell us a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9mT50"&gt;I’m from Maryland, born and raised. I live outside of Annapolis, which is the capital of the state. I joined &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year as a news writer and my one-year anniversary is coming up in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CejAAW"&gt;I am currently listed as a writer. “News” was dropped from my title, which primarily means that I place a lot more emphasis on service journalism. Basically, I find a lot of good deals for our readers so they can best spend the money that’s burning a hole in their pockets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfaTko"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks like you really had to get a lot of workspace into a relatively small area. How did you manage it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qb4Jca"&gt;Yeah! My desk is in the same room as my bed, and it is close to my two-door closet. I previously had two other smaller desks instead of the one I currently have, but when it came to finding a new desk, I wanted something that was spacious yet also fit in the parameters I designated. A measuring tape was my best friend for sure! Funnily enough, I now have a 45-inch desk, but I could put a larger one in the space, and it wouldn’t feel cramped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AlNgyqS9wvGUYCXjWGv8D01PshE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054931/tlyles_201111_4294_0003.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nyPcxU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qkUXHH"&gt;It’s a gaming desk by this company called Mr. Ironstone. In case it’s not obvious, I am a huge gamer, and I’ve always wanted to have a desk that was considered a “gaming desk.” I spent a few weeks researching a few different types of gaming desks, and eventually, I went with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mr-IRONSTONE-Computer-Headphone-Workstation/dp/B07HYTWJ6Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=12&amp;amp;imprToken=f2bbc3cd-6179-dec4-42c&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp=&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=3ddff728b756455213eb9564624e2d93&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ascsubtag=203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mr. Ironstone Gaming Desk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbgoyO"&gt;A few people have said it’s minimal, but I am a very simple woman, and to be quite honest, a minimalist desk is the best because it provides you with more freedom and a ton of real estate to allow you to decorate your desk how you like. Shockingly, this is one of the cheapest desks I have used; it cost only $126 when I ordered it on Amazon. Ultimately, I decided to buy this desk because it came with a few neat things on the side (a cupholder and a headset hook). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fDLJBG"&gt;
&lt;div id="g6i8oF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10334240" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PFVwWH"&gt;
&lt;p id="3QMl94"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love the cupholder. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsmjIm"&gt;The cupholder is one of my favorite parts of this desk! I did have a coaster and a headset mount on my old desk, but I did not like how they took up space on what was already a small desk to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l3LZKb"&gt;The best part is that you can choose which side you put your headset hook and cupholder on. I chose to put the cupholder to my left because I am a lefty and my headset hook on the right because it is closer to my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AzS4tkUmNAaVLG0LxITuPhoAXh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054937/tlyles_201111_4294_0006.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xZcz_K4B2ydL9xRiRjqYYSGYrdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054901/tlyles_201113_4294_0032.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BmLrJD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really great-looking chair. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91lqvl"&gt;It’s a Techni Sport TS-5000, and although it looks comfy, it’s actually very uncomfortable. I had to purchase a seat cushion because sitting on the chair for more than two hours made my butt hurt. I also have a weak back so, thankfully, I have cushions that provide extra comfort for my back and my butt, allowing me to work (or game) comfortably at my desk. I am planning to get a &lt;a href="https://secretlab.co/collections/titan-series"&gt;Secretlab Titan gaming chair&lt;/a&gt; soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PJ7Oyu"&gt;
&lt;div id="Mz1Qek"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10334250" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EX3iY6"&gt;
&lt;p id="WSzKt3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your tech. Let’s start with your computer. That’s quite a system you have there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjDPHQ"&gt;This is my gaming PC! Someone I knew gave me the case, and I bought and built the PC myself. I am currently in the process of upgrading my rig, but I want to point out a few things: the GPU I am using is an Asus RTX 3070, and my processor is an Intel Core i7-7700K. But within the next few months, I plan to switch my CPU and motherboard to AMD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfFCzz"&gt;The biggest focus I had for my gaming PC was I wanted to make sure I could play the newest titles without having to sacrifice performance or graphics. I also try to plan 10 steps ahead in future-proofing my PC, especially with the new generation of gaming underway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6GkkRgYngyLbbLV0oxOMAGHn1R8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22055628/tlyles_201113_4294_0012.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0BciK0VTCzVIEd7OF3Si9SJBugU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054904/tlyles_201113_4294_0027.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qf0oAH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your displays? How did you decide on two, and how do you use them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyWgRV"&gt;The gamer in me always wanted two displays. It also makes multitasking easier. Both monitors are 24 inches. The one on the right is an &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FASUS-MG248QR-24-Full-HD-1ms-144Hz-DP-HDMI-FreeSync-Adaptive-Sync-Eye-Care-eSports-Gaming-Monitor%2F284736115%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0X7xzm1dZxyOWU6wUx0Mo38XUkEWe6V5W3bDTg0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0X7xzm1dZxyOWU6wUx0Mo38XUkEWe6V5W3bDTg0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;sharedid=vergewhatsonyourdesktaylorlyle02122021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus MG248QR&lt;/a&gt;, the original one for my gaming PC, and the one on the left is newer, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1545194-REG%2Fasus_vg258qr_24_5_wide_16_9_tn.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21572162%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-writer-gamer-logitech-asus#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus VG258QR&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, I will upgrade to 4K monitors, but for now, these get the job done just fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yZw48"&gt;My left monitor is the one I work on the most. The second one is what I use to keep my Slack app open. I split reading material on the right between two windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fvAKjj"&gt;
&lt;div id="pUynqv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9585116" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="g79X0e"&gt;
&lt;p id="PP4mIJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve admired your microphone setup ever since the first time I saw it. Tell us about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neY5Jy"&gt;Thank you! The microphone I am using is called the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-QuadCast-Condenser-Microphone-Anti-Vibration/dp/B07NZZZ746?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=14&amp;amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HyperX QuadCast&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s amazing! Previously, I had a few other mics, including a Blue Yeti. I chose the HyperX QuadCast as my new mic because I heard great things about the sound quality, and the design was also really intriguing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YoAWa"&gt;The QuadCast has a lot of bang for the buck, and I like how it comes with a stand for your mic and a shock mount in case you decide to place it on a boom arm, which is what I did. And it comes with a nice long cable, so you have more leverage for where to place it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yWVlT0"&gt;
&lt;div id="bob765"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10306468" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="NJOvOA"&gt;
&lt;p id="6No8CQ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-TONOR-Adjustable-Suspension-T20/dp/B082W4B7SX?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=15&amp;amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;boom arm I am using is from TONOR&lt;/a&gt;, and it is an adjustable suspension boom scissor mic stand that costs about $30. What’s great about this boom arm is that it includes a durable clamp, so if you have a heavier mic like, say, a Blue Yeti, it will be compatible with the boom arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1OEhl"&gt;You’ll also notice I have a pop filter on my mic. The QuadCast does have a built-in bright red pop filter, but unfortunately, it is not very good at stopping plosive speech sound. I didn’t want to use the “normal” pop filter, which came with the boom arm I bought, so I bought this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PEMOTech-Microphone-Windscreen-Recording-Streaming/dp/B01J5OTVTC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=16&amp;amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=7bb6a56a87881b7dcbad0f42f71b18fa&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PEMOTech tri-layered pop filter&lt;/a&gt;. I bought it for $8, and aside from looking cool, it does help with the plosives. It gives off such a very professional look in my opinion that it makes me want to have a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNMmW-O6etQiEFpY9wxcWi5raf4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054922/tlyles_201113_4294_0014.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EjdXWm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your other tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r28hpT"&gt;Most of the tech I use for my computer is from Logitech.

&lt;p id="yg3RLz"&gt;I received the Rubik’s Cube as a gift from a friend a few years ago for my birthday. I know how to solve it, but I simply have not had the time. The fidget spinner is neat, too. Usually when I need a screen break, I just play with the fidget spinner a bit to relax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8eXfR1"&gt;I purchased the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/elago-AirPods-Compatible-Keychain-Registered/dp/B083LXTFXS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elago AW4 AirPods case&lt;/a&gt; because I was afraid I would misplace my pair of earbuds.

&lt;p id="nHB9Bb"&gt;Aw, shucks. This was the thing I was really excited to share with you. I love collecting flags. I have about nine or 10 right now, but only four of them are hanging up at the moment. The one you see above my desk is the Maryland flag (aka the best state flag &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;). In case it’s not clear, I have a lot of state pride. I actually asked my mom to give me a Maryland flag as a high school graduation gift back in 2013, and it’s one of the handful of things that I consider my most prized possessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOt6L5"&gt;I am sure you can see the American flag above my bed, too. I bought that one a year later when I was looking to redesign my room. I know some people will have their critiques of America as a whole, but I love being American, and I think our country has an incredible flag. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft, Google, and Qualcomm are reportedly nervous about Nvidia acquiring Arm</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="nvidia, nvidiastock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/95lKGTM1NsAMMuSY_WW5UmI8LgU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68811401/DSC00697.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kZVmi9"&gt;Microsoft, Google, and Qualcomm have been raising concerns to regulators about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;Nvidia’s Arm acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, according to reports by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/qualcomm-objects-to-nvidias-40-billion-arm-acquisition.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-12/google-microsoft-qualcomm-protest-nvidia-s-arm-acquisition-kl2laz51?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The companies have approached regulators in the US, EU, UK, and China, reportedly with concerns that Nvidia could change how Arm licenses out its chipmaking technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qQhLk"&gt;Nvidia has pledged that it won’t use its control over the company to change how it interacts with other businesses. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a3adccc9-678e-44ef-bdb5-e847ecb7de8c"&gt;Writing to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he could “unequivocally state that Nvidia will maintain Arm’s open licensing model. We have no intention to ‘throttle’ or ‘deny’ Arm’s supply to any customer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJiFld"&gt;Nvidia’s rivals argue, however, that keeping Arm neutral and not using its tech to Nvidia’s own gains isn’t what the company would be incentivized to do — especially not after paying $40 billion for it. Restrictions on licensing, however, would hurt the companies that benefit from having the ability to license Arm’s technology. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21221062/google-processor-pixels-chromebooks-whitechapel-samsung-qualcomm"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; are reportedly working on their own Arm-based chips, and Qualcomm’s processors are based on the architecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgnJuX"&gt;For its part, Nvidia has argued that the acquisition is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435890/nvidia-arm-acquisition-40-billion-ai-cloud-edge-why"&gt;about driving AI forward&lt;/a&gt;, which is an area Nvidia has focused on heavily, from its machine learning-powered upscaling on its graphics cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300614/mercedes-benz-nvidia-computer-orin-self-driving-adas-ota"&gt;to its work in self-driving cars&lt;/a&gt;. Arm’s low-power technology could help Nvidia spread AI into more places, but the company will also have to figure out what to do with everything else Arm does — mainly, powering almost every cellphone in existence as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;holding the key to computer companies moving away from Intel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwKARN"&gt;Regulators are also apparently looking closely at the deal to determine whether it would give Nvidia too much power in the chipmaking business: according to CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the Federal Trade Commission has asked Nvidia and Arm to give it more information, and it could be talking to “other companies who may have relevant information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6IT6z"&gt;Meanwhile, UK and EU officials &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a3adccc9-678e-44ef-bdb5-e847ecb7de8c"&gt;have promised to “thoroughly investigate”&lt;/a&gt; the deal. It’s very likely that they will hear many objections, not just from Google, Microsoft, and Qualcomm, but from others in the chipmaking industry who are concerned about their open-licensing agreement with Arm being affected by the merger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLffgW"&gt;These companies have experience with regulators and anti-competitive behavior. Qualcomm has had to pay several fines in the hundreds of millions and sometimes billions of dollars to authorities in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/9/8009589/qualcomm-fined-975-million-by-chinese-anti-monopoly-regulators"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-antitrust/south-korea-fines-qualcomm-854-million-for-violating-competition-laws-idUSKBN14H062"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16927042/qualcomm-apple-antitrust-chip-deal-eu-fine"&gt;the EU&lt;/a&gt; for anti-competitive licensing policies. Microsoft, of course, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17827042/antitrust-1990s-microsoft-google-aol-monopoly-lawsuits-history"&gt;had its big monopoly case in the ‘90s&lt;/a&gt;, where it went up against the US government, and Google has recently been the focus of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506682/google-apple-amazon-facebook-antitrust-report-house-judiciary"&gt;growing antitrust sentiment in the US&lt;/a&gt; and EU.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says the Biden administration shot down his carbon tax pitch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elon Musk visits construction site of the Tesla Giga Factory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rHAe1mcHFt5URE24swmS4Uj0NhI=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68811124/1228323129.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Patrick Pleul / picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TMg73D"&gt;Elon Musk says he pitched the Biden administration on instituting a carbon tax as a way to encourage a faster shift to renewable energy, but he was told the idea was essentially “too politically difficult.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4j7v3"&gt;Musk described the conversation with the Biden administration during &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2aB2swgyXqbFA06AxPlFmr?si=_8doDtUvSn-kkUNFE9Kp7w&amp;amp;nd=1"&gt;a new podcast with Joe Rogan that was released Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuMIU5"&gt;Rogan had asked Musk whether a new technological breakthrough is needed to increase the adoption of battery-powered vehicles. Musk argued the bigger issue is that “a hell of a lot of batteries [are] needed” in order to shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy. The best way to encourage that shift, in Musk’s view, is to “put a price on carbon.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="06as2e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Why don’t you just fight for that?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Zm0D4"&gt;“My top recommendation honestly would be just to have a carbon tax,” Musk said. “Because we’re not paying for the CO2 capacity of the oceans and atmosphere, we have what in economics is called an unpriced externality. The market is unable to respond to an unpriced externality. If we just put a price on it, the market will react in a sensible way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i53Q57"&gt;Musk suggested that consumers should pay the tax, and rebates could be offered to people who make lower incomes. A carbon tax could help further even the playing field for Tesla’s electric vehicles, though Musk said SpaceX (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22245363/spacex-texas-oil-company-drill-natural-gas-lone-star"&gt;currently trying to acquire natural gas wells in Texas to fuel its rockets&lt;/a&gt;) would have to pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41WwFE"&gt;“I talked to the Biden administration, the incoming administration, and they were like, ‘Well, this seems too politically difficult,’” he said. Musk said he remembers thinking, “That’s at least half the reason you go elected, so why don’t you just fight for that?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDlexr"&gt;This isn’t the first time the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has agitated for a carbon tax. Musk reportedly floated the idea during early meetings with the Trump administration but got “little or no support,” &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-26/tesla-s-musk-said-to-float-idea-of-a-carbon-tax-to-trump-ceos"&gt;according to a 2017 report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjijUN"&gt;Musk has even &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/05/elon-musk-we-need-a-revolt-against-the-fossil-fuel-industry"&gt;previously called for a “revolt” against the fossil fuel industry&lt;/a&gt; while making the case for a carbon tax, and he &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-23/musk-suggests-big-oil-is-behind-critical-media-coverage-of-tesla"&gt;accused big oil companies of conspiring against Tesla&lt;/a&gt;. But he said on Rogan’s podcast that he is “not in favor of demonizing the oil and gas industry” because it would upset the people working in it, and also stopping its operations completely would mean everyone would “die of starvation, basically.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOKstJ"&gt;“We’re gonna need to burn fossil fuels for a long time. The question is just at what rate do we move to a sustainable energy future?” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="yC1Vhs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk said he’s “not in favor of demonizing the oil and gas industry” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RqOrwW"&gt;“There are people who have spent their whole career in oil, and gas and they started out in that career when it didn’t seem like that bad of a thing to do. So then they’re like, ‘Hey man, I just spent my whole career working hard to do useful things, and now you’re telling me I’m the devil.’ That’s gonna make them pretty upset,” he said, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-elon-musk-oil-and-gas-industry-2020-9"&gt;echoing remarks from late last year&lt;/a&gt;. “Honestly the smartest thing the oil and gas industry could do is say, ‘Let’s do a carbon tax. We’ll just do a carbon tax, and it will make us not the devil.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwY20t"&gt;One of Biden’s main campaign planks was his support for an aggressive clean energy strategy. He committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;eliminating carbon pollution from the power sector by 2035&lt;/a&gt; and reaching a “100 percent clean energy economy” no later than 2050. He even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;voiced support for ending fossil fuel subsidies&lt;/a&gt;. And since taking office, he has recommitted the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22239441/us-paris-agreement-rejoin-climate-change-joe-biden"&gt;to the Paris climate accord&lt;/a&gt;. But he has not committed to a carbon tax, despite agitation from &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/21/biden-infrastructure-plan-carbon-tax.html"&gt;other business leaders close to the administration&lt;/a&gt; and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who said &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/yellen-biden-carbon-pricing-energy-emissions-eee629c7-b4db-4f95-9d98-874269efdddd.html"&gt;the climate crisis can’t be solved without carbon pricing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra might have a tiny rear-facing display as a treat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rzry1JyEJDhay7pYddsSyxQ1QF4=/233x0:2633x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810744/screen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A YouTuber claims to have the unannounced Mi 11 Ultra featuring a 1-inch rear-facing screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXm4cCkjikHqZYY5YUVY_GQ" target="_blank"&gt;Tech Buff PH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0lkk74"&gt;A YouTuber has posted a video featuring what he claims are two prototype Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra devices, suggesting the phone might have an unusual feature: a 1-inch rear-facing screen right next to the cameras. The video shows this small screen displaying what looks like an image of the phone’s home screen, only... you know, microscopic. A more practical application might be for selfies using the rear-facing camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIr9WI"&gt;The video, since taken down, comes from a little-known Filipino vlogger who goes by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXm4cCkjikHqZYY5YUVY_GQ"&gt;Tech Buff PH&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-11-ultra-leak-120x-zoom-secondary-screen/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; the device model number checks out, and certain details align with previous leaks. Other details from this alleged leak include 67W fast wireless charging, a 6.8-inch curved OLED with an adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz, a 5,000mAh battery, and IP68 water and dust resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The device shows three cameras, including a periscope-style lens with 120x hybrid zoom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7iJtUE"&gt;The alleged devices include a huge camera bump with a 120x hybrid zoom camera, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;last year’s Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a 50-megapixel main camera. If this phone is indeed the Mi 11 Ultra, then it looks like Xiaomi ditched the 2x telephoto lens on the previous model, offering just the longer periscope-style zoom lens instead. There’s also a 12mm ultrawide, which Tech Buff PH claims has a 48-megapixel sensor, upgraded from 12 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bseVcE"&gt;Xiaomi announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202973/xiaomi-mi-11-flagship-announced-chinese-variant"&gt;Chinese variant&lt;/a&gt; of the standard Mi 11 at the end of 2020, and more recently, it unveiled an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272003/xiaomi-mi-11-international-price-release-date-announcement"&gt;international version&lt;/a&gt;. Both feature a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 888 processor offering 5G connectivity. With those versions announced, Xiaomi will likely follow with other variants such as the alleged Ultra version featured here. Whether this device will shape up to be the real deal remains to be seen, but it’s an interesting concept to consider in either case.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s $329 RTX 3060 graphics card is launching on February 25th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fHFJDDfAxVVuOMjFuruygt6xecM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810679/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S1ooUb"&gt;We already knew &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226546/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Nvidia was making a $329 RTX 3060 graphics card&lt;/a&gt;, and today, the company announced that it will make its most affordable GPU in the RTX 3000 series available at retailers beginning on February 25th. Retailers will open orders for the RTX 3060 starting at 9AM PT / 12PM ET. Nvidia tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it will not be creating a Founder’s Edition of the RTX 3060 graphics card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fstpRG"&gt;Designed to succeed the aging GeForce GTX 1060 Pascal cards, the RTX 3060 features 12GB of GDDR6 memory. Like the other products featured in the RTX 3000 series, the RTX 3060 will also support DLSS and Nvidia’s suite of RTX applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qXPsa"&gt;With a new RTX 30 card coming later this month, we anticipate that the RTX 3060 GPU will sell out &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt;. These cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228470/nvidia-evga-zotac-raise-prices-rtx-3080-3070-3060-3090"&gt;have been difficult to purchase&lt;/a&gt; since last fall when the RTX 30 series first debuted. In January, Nvidia said it anticipates supply for its GPUs to both consumers and partners “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;will likely remain lean through Q1&lt;/a&gt;,” which doesn’t end until late April. To alleviate the short supply and sky-high prices, Nvidia confirmed yesterday that it plans to bring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278562/nvidia-rtx-2060-gtx-1050-ti-gpu-shortage-global-chip"&gt;back its older RTX 2060 and GTX 1050 Ti graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches an augmented reality app to promote For All Mankind on Apple TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PRlv6-X2STPR9kjJD-TEpNuZrJg=/167x0:2066x1266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810589/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_11.53.08_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wzhgrz"&gt;Apple is gearing up for the release of &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt; season 2 on Apple TV Plus. It’s kicking things off with a new augmented reality app, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F02%2Ffor-all-mankind-time-capsule-a-new-augmented-reality-experience-based-on-the-apple-tv-space-drama-is-available-today-in-the-app-store%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F12%2F22278780%2Fapple-augmented-reality-ar-app-for-all-mankind-tv-plus#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;: Time Capsule&lt;/a&gt;, that looks to fill in the gap between the two seasons using AR artifacts from the world of the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYaejE"&gt;The app itself is a fun promotional gimmick to help promote the second season of one of Apple’s higher-profile original shows. It’s the broader strategy at play that’s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-A2SPv3VJ5iEzKRt16P48rg6ZY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22300211/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_11.53.26_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JJNJeK"&gt;It’s no secret that Apple is interested in AR. The recurring AR demos at the last several iPhone and iPad product announcements, the addition of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21185200/apple-ipad-pro-lidar-sensor-ar-hardware-solution-software-apps-augmented-reality"&gt;AR-focused LIDAR cameras&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;latest iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro devices&lt;/a&gt;, and the persistent rumors of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;pending VR / AR headsets&lt;/a&gt; are all clear evidence of that. And Apple has been &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-26/apple-plans-augmented-reality-content-to-boost-tv-video-service?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;rumored to be working&lt;/a&gt; on the tie-in app for a while now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bcDepD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s rumored VR headset could cost $3,000, feature 8K displays and over a dozen cameras","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7Jd0Y0"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;: Time Capsule is one of the first indications of Apple tying all of its hardware, content, and service ambitions together. It’s an augmented reality app downloaded from the App Store that prompts users to subscribe to Apple TV Plus to watch &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;, with additional content for LIDAR-equipped Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ChQU3"&gt;It’s the kind of cross-promotional content that spans Apple’s wide array of businesses. It could also offer a glimpse at the kind of integrated hardware, software, and service bundle that Apple could be considering for any future AR devices. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sex and the City is now available in HD for the first time on HBO Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mAnpitTvj8WmQx7KLbDDvFRfW-8=/60x0:708x432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810387/cq5dam.web.768.432.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: HBO&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v5P22e"&gt;A newly remastered version of &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; is now available to stream on &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=SexCityHD021221"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, WarnerMedia announced on Friday. Thanks to the remaster, you can watch the hit show in a high-definition 16:9 aspect ratio for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enIPUF"&gt;“The series was originally shot on film and mastered in standard definition as high definition capabilities were unavailable at the time of filming,” &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/media-release/newly-remastered-hd-version-sex-and-city-now-available-hbo-max"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Over the past year, the series was updated from scratch as film negatives from the show were meticulously scanned at 4K to create HD masters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EIPndy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wQN-uyEyuwY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JfZzgH"&gt;The new HD remasters arrive ahead of a “new chapter” of &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; coming to &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=SexCityHD021221"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, called “And Just Like That...” Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, and Kristin Davis are set to reprise their roles as Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte, but playing the characters in their 50s. WarnerMedia has already given the series a &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/sarah-jessica-parker-cynthia-nixon-and-kristin-davis-star-max-original-series-and?language_content_entity=en"&gt;10-episode order&lt;/a&gt; and says it will begin production in New York City this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
