    <title>Nintendo Switch Online is getting an ‘expansion pack’ with N64 and Genesis games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TojyjK"&gt;Nintendo is adding a new membership tier to Nintendo Switch Online that lets you play Nintendo 64 games and Sega Genesis games. The new tier, called Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, will be officially released in late October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDoOyn"&gt;Nintendo didn’t share pricing, and promised it will share more news ahead of the official launch date. But the company did share the games you’ll be able to play when it launches, which include some of the biggest hits across both of the classic consoles, including &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Golden Axe&lt;/em&gt;. And Nintendo promised to continue to add new games to the new tier, teasing that &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;F-Zero X&lt;/em&gt;, and others were on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NGMjXj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Play a selection of Nintendo 64 and SEGA Genesis games with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitchOnline?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NintendoSwitchOnline&lt;/a&gt; + Expansion Pack!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This new membership plan launches late October and includes all features of the base Nintendo Switch Online membership. Details on pricing, timing, and more will be shared soon. &lt;a href="https://t.co/BMArRe5Vg6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BMArRe5Vg6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1441166635801346049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1gmLEA"&gt;Nintendo is also releasing Switch versions of the Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis controllers, like it did with the NES and SNES controllers. Each of them will be available for $49.99 for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yiswjp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The original Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is coming to the Switch on November 11th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tKiwyG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&lt;/em&gt; may be getting an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665460/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-ps5-darth-revan"&gt;exciting new remake for the PlayStation 5 and PC sometime in the future&lt;/a&gt;, but for fans looking to revisit the original, the classic RPG is making its way to the Nintendo Switch on November 11th, Nintendo announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2LnqQB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is getting a remake for the PS5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665460/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-ps5-darth-revan"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TvxcyM"&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;Knights of the Old Republic&lt;/em&gt; was first released for the Xbox in 2003, but it’s since been ported to a variety of other platforms, including PC, macOS, and even iOS and 	Android phones. It’s also the latest in a series of classic Star Wars games that have made their way to the Switch in recent years, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301436/star-wars-episode-1-racer-ps4-switch-release-price"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars Episode 1: Racer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297939/star-wars-republic-commando-hd-remaster-ps4-switch-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Republic Commando&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fgames%2Fdetail%2Fstar-wars-jedi-knight-jedi-academy-switch%2F&amp;amp;esheet=52194732&amp;amp;newsitemid=20200326005200&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=Star+Wars+Jedi+Knight%3A+Jedi+Academy&amp;amp;index=20&amp;amp;md5=616a6e5ca0d870c981f17b71c171ecee"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kirby and the Forgotten Land is coming to the Switch next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SkDNdv2_E4E66RpFM62ZnXzsdss=/128x0:965x558/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69900701/Screen_Shot_2021_09_23_at_6.14.27_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vgd0wE"&gt;One of the bigger surprises of Nintendo’s latest Direct was a brand-new &lt;em&gt;Kirby&lt;/em&gt; game — one that throws the cute pink ball into a post-apocalyptic world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkc5QU"&gt;It’s called &lt;em&gt;Kirby and the Forgotten Land&lt;/em&gt;, and it looks to be a 3D exploration title about a world that’s been largely abandoned. Nintendo describes is as “a mysterious world full of abandoned structures from a past civilization.” It certainly looks less bright and cheerful compared to his previous adventures, though Kirby still has the ability to absorb other’s powers and wear cute outfits, and is fighting some familiar foes along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4hBEeM"&gt;News of the game actually &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22689856/kirby-nintendo-switch-direct-leak-discovery-stars"&gt;leaked out a bit earlier in the day&lt;/a&gt;. When it debuts, the game will join a growing list of Kirby titles on the Switch including &lt;em&gt;Kirby Star Allies&lt;/em&gt;, Super Kirby Clash, and &lt;em&gt;Kirby Fighters 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BY449"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kirby and the Forgotten Land&lt;/em&gt; is coming to the Switch in Spring 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You’re not allowed to use the Apple Watch Series 7’s secret wireless dock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mrspCCQMkptU4dH4HNr5f2VCuoo=/74x0:820x497/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69900466/Capto_Capture_2021_09_14_01_24_25_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VvQLwt"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 has a new 60.5GHz module that works with a secret, corresponding dock, &lt;a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;amp;calledFromFrame=Y&amp;amp;application_id=HHHbKs1F5u4RgO0KGUvULQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;fcc_id=BCG-A2476"&gt;according to FCC filings&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/apple-watch-60-5-ghz-wireless-data-transfer/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The new wireless data transfer feature is designed to pair with a corresponding dock that Apple will use for currently unknown internal purposes. When the Series 7 watch is placed on that pad, it’ll activate the module — customers won’t actually be able to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RenDoU"&gt;Now, this is technically nothing new for the Apple Watch, which has included a hidden physical diagnostic port since its inception. Without actually seeing an Apple Watch Series 7 in person (and checking to see if Apple is removing the physical port), it’s hard to say whether this is some new, nascent Apple technology or just a more convenient method for running hardware diagnostics for Genius Bar employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gZFTW5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"EU proposes mandatory USB-C on all devices, including iPhones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6FlYkw"&gt;But the news comes just as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"&gt;European Commission has announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to require all smartphone manufacturers to exclusively use USB-C ports on their devices in an effort to reduce e-waste. Combined with existing rumors that Apple has plans to remove all the ports on its iPhones — something that would be a more pressing concern if Apple was looking to sidestep the new EU proposal — and there’s been a lot of theorizing around the new 60.5GHz tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9zREm"&gt;The argument is that Apple could potentially be looking to incorporate the new wireless data transfer technology into its existing charging standards, like MagSafe, on a future iPhone, selling a proprietary dock that enables wireless data transfer to a linked computer to replace a physical Lightning cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i3WYQp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pretty timely piece of news! To me, this pretty much confirms 1) future iPhones will be port-less, and 2) that Lightning will be replaced with a 60.5GHz wireless USB-substitute through a MagSafe-like attachment. I’m surprised this was added to Apple Watch first? iPhone teardown? &lt;a href="https://t.co/vqqMIEx0yW"&gt;https://t.co/vqqMIEx0yW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1441087270627336196?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fSZpvx"&gt;It’s a theory that has some merit; the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/5/20997166/apple-iphone-no-ports-2021-oled-rumors-2020-se-kuo-research"&gt; port-less iPhone rumors&lt;/a&gt; have been around for a while, and they come from the generally accurate analyst &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307716/apple-lightning-portless-iphone-usb-c-magsafe-charging-kuo-rumor"&gt;Ming-Chi Kuo&lt;/a&gt;. It’s hard to imagine Apple giving in and suddenly offering a USB-C iPhone that would circumvent both its MFi licensing fees and its control over its most important (and lucrative) devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyItQa"&gt;That said, the timing is probably a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; convenient here; it seems highly unlikely that Apple was working to lay the groundwork for a replacement standard that would slot neatly into a port-less iPhone, revealed on the exact day that the EU standard was announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDQYqH"&gt;There are also plenty of past internal Apple features that have similarly never come to fruition for any compelling consumer use. There’s the aforementioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/4/8543033/apple-watch-hidden-port-charging-battery-strap"&gt;Apple Watch diagnostic port&lt;/a&gt;, which has lain dormant for half a decade now despite dreams of battery life-extending bands and other accessories. Or, consider the Apple TV’s hidden USB-C or &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/17/apple-tv-4k-lightning-port/"&gt;Lightning ports&lt;/a&gt;, which can’t even accomplish a task as simple as charging an Apple TV remote after all these years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKlxHf"&gt;Then again, one never does know with Apple. If the company &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;looking to ditch charging ports — due to EU rules or its own whims — then it’s possible the new 60.5GHz module is a first look at how Apple will attempt to accomplish it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94SLKe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If audio is missing from your Instagram Stories, a fix is on the way</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CwWIgZEdR_WxjciZ0JSrDh4SL40=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69900354/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="naTnU7"&gt;Following the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 update&lt;/a&gt;, some users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/psjmqp/anyone_facing_audio_issue_when_phone_is_on_mute/"&gt;have reported strange behavior on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; — when an iPhone’s ringer switch is set to silent mode, stories play without audio. Currently, you can even silence a video while it’s still playing by flipping the switch, even though the switch shouldn’t mute the rest of an iPhone’s sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVHNp9"&gt;Silent videos might sound like a blessing for friends who love to put every new song Spotify suggests to them in their Instagram Story, but that’s not exactly how the switch is supposed to work. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/psjmqp/anyone_facing_audio_issue_when_phone_is_on_mute/"&gt;Silent mode is primarily meant to control system sounds&lt;/a&gt; like ringtones and text tones, not the audio you hear inside apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fYb3oH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook is working on a fix&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cpFWyN"&gt;I was able to recreate the behavior on my own iPhone running iOS 15. For some users, the issue popped up even earlier during the public beta of Apple’s software update. It’s not clear if this issue is impacting other users running older versions of iOS, and Facebook didn’t confirm if the issue was specifically related to iOS 15. The company did provide the following statement promising a fix, however:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="dRYHtH"&gt;We’re aware that some people are having trouble hearing their audio in Instagram Stories. We’re working to fix this issue as quickly as possible and apologize for any inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8KO1BY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out for more information about the issue and to see if the company can share a timeline for when the fix could arrive. In the meantime, try and enjoy the peace and quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BChkja"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7SQeS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to pair Bluetooth headphones with your Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nintendo Switch with OLED screen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I5Ij1WF8ugksU6zSTiYlIPO2Gx0=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69900290/joy_con_02.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two controllers is the maximum amount you’ll be able to use while Bluetooth headphones are connected.&lt;/em&gt; | Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kVEfGJ"&gt;Setting up a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones with a Nintendo Switch used to be a multistep — and somewhat costly — process. First, you needed headphones, then you needed a Bluetooth audio transmitter that’d either plug into your Switch’s headphone jack or its bottom-facing USB-C port. Well, after about four years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674704/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-audio-software-update"&gt;Nintendo surprised us with a system update&lt;/a&gt; that finally enables said feature natively — no accessories required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MA6x6s"&gt;Some Bluetooth transmitters, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/7/13/17570350/nintendo-switch-wireless-headphones-bluetooth-audio-support-adapter"&gt;Genki’s Switch adapter&lt;/a&gt;, may still be worth investing in if you want to be able to connect multiple headphones simultaneously (the Switch only allows one set of headphones to be paired at once). But if it’s just you and your Switch, the newer process is no more complicated than pairing headphones with your smartphone. That said, there are still a few steps involved, which we’re going to run through below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="11PjQY"&gt;Put your headphones into pairing mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="moC1ww"&gt;On most pairs of Bluetooth headphones, you can enter pairing mode by pressing and holding the power button down for longer than it takes to turn them on. Most models will make a distinct chime or have LEDs that flash at a faster pace to indicate that pairing mode is active.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pdyKxh9VnW4Z_YhEsN_8TIiLaY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360993/bfarsace_4467_20210310_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x2Apdr"&gt;This feature isn’t limited to big over-ear or on-ear headphones, either. You can pair wireless earbuds, too, but the pairing process might be a little different for those. You can easily pair Apple’s AirPods with the Switch, for example, but you’ll need to open the case with the AirPods inside of them and press the pairing button on the side of the case. If all else fails, check your headphones’ instruction manual or look up the process online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Owx0op"&gt;Find the Bluetooth audio setting on your Switch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XNPDTv"&gt;From there, go to the Switch’s main menu where you can select a game and click on the settings icon located beneath the game library. It looks like a gear.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8sKjaBX8x6AX4yv0V97YYrijxvk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872751/IMG_1032.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iD58mK"&gt;In the next window, scroll down the left-hand pane until you see “Bluetooth Audio.” Click that, at which point your only option will be to click “Pair Device.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6LDO6U"&gt;Register your headphones with your Switch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8wqKDM"&gt;With your headphones in pairing mode (and your Switch now actively looking for them), their model name should populate on the Switch’s screen. When it does, click the model name to begin pairing your headphones or earbuds with your Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWJhs8"&gt;When it’s successful, a window will pop up saying “Connected to Bluetooth audio.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Wcv3x5"&gt;If you run into issues — like if your Switch suddenly takes 30 seconds or so to wake up from sleep — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675831/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-issue-problem-fix-wake-sleep"&gt;my colleague Sean Hollister has the solution&lt;/a&gt; for you. &lt;a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55973"&gt;Nintendo has also noted&lt;/a&gt; that by connecting headphones via Bluetooth, your Switch will be able to connect to just two wireless controllers, as opposed to several more under circumstances when you’re not paired. There might also be some audio latency, so what’s happening in the game might not totally line up with what you’re hearing. In my brief experience trying it out, however, it didn’t seem noticeably worse than when I relied on third-party Bluetooth transmitters.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Babies’ poop has way higher levels of microplastic than adults’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Baby with cloth diapers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xF2qG3NdARoDbULZ_Zj5IfESD7c=/83x0:3917x2556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69900284/1228455901.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gFsoEu"&gt;When it comes to babies, a considerable amount of plastic appears to be both going in one end and out the other, according to new research that involved spatulas, diapers, and poop. In particular, the average&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;concentration of one pervasive type of microplastic in baby stool was a whopping ten times higher than that in adult stool in a small pilot study published this week. The plastic, called&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;PET, or polyethylene terephthalate, is widely used in bottles and polyester textiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NHLWa"&gt;The results suggest that infants could be exposed to even higher levels of microplastics than adults, the study authors say. When babies shove toys or clothing in their mouths, they might end up ingesting tiny fibers or pieces of plastic. Then there are plastic food containers, sippy cups, and baby bottles, which can also shed pieces of PET smaller than the diameter of a pencil eraser.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Mixing hot water and formula in a plastic bottle can weaken the plastic and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-020-00171-y"&gt;unleash even more tiny pieces &lt;/a&gt;of it. Crawling babies are also much more likely than walking adults to get a face full of microfibers from polyester carpeting, which they might ingest or inhale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jl8Ryx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Something needs to be done.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7u7p1S"&gt;Scientists are still &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01143-3"&gt;trying to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;figure out&lt;/a&gt; what that all means for babies’ health. There’s not a lot of research on how the microplastics all around us — and in our bodies — affect human health. But the new study on baby poop, published yesterday in the &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.estlett.1c00559"&gt;journal &lt;em&gt;Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has some&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;researchers worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rs2JDz"&gt;“Babies are exposed to high levels of plastics, something needs to be done,” says Kurunthachalam Kannan, co-author and professor of environmental medicine and pediatrics at the New York University School of Medicine. “Early life stages are very vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="smMB1j"&gt;Scientists used to think that ingested plastics would simply come out the other end, much like other things kids might eat that they shouldn’t have. But &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30641374/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published in 2019 suggests that very small pieces of plastic might actually be able to pass through cell membranes to infiltrate the body’s circulatory system. If that’s the case, microplastics could cause more problems. There’s evidence that microplastics in blood circulation could lead to inflammation and cell death, affecting the immune system, Kannan says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MCkEy"&gt;Plastics also contain myriad chemicals, including &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2021.724989/full"&gt;endocrine disruptors&lt;/a&gt; that could mess with the body’s hormones and have been linked to adverse effects on metabolism and reproductive and neurological health. Babies can be more vulnerable to those effects than adults since their bodies are still growing and developing, and Kannan says the impact could linger into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcEzTZ"&gt;Kannan and his colleagues studied stool samples from six different one-year-olds in New York City. They also looked at three newborns’ very first poop. To do that, they scraped samples from diapers using spatulas — careful to avoid anything that was in direct contact with the diaper to avoid counting microplastics that might have come from the diaper and not from the baby. The researchers also decided not to test for plastic typically used in diapers, called polypropylene. Instead, they looked for PET and polycarbonate (another type of plastic commonly used in phone cases) in the poop. They found both types of plastic, but only saw a meaningful difference in PET concentrations between babies and adults. They took stool samples from 10 adults in Albany, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7u5tm"&gt;There’s not a lot known about how exposure to microplastics varies across places and populations. So this new study adds to the call for more research. “Our data provide baseline evidence for [microplastic] exposure doses in infants and adults and support the need for further studies with a larger sample size to corroborate and extend our findings,” the study says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ezahKb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a very interesting paper with some very worrying numbers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DfBZ7d"&gt;“This is a very interesting paper with some very worrying numbers,” University of Strathclyde research fellow Deonie Allen, who wasn’t involved in the study, told &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/baby-poop-is-loaded-with-microplastics/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We need to look at everything a child is exposed to, not just their bottles and toys.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gkmydh"&gt;The prevailing wisdom from twenty or thirty years ago that plastics are harmless is one reason why there hasn’t been much study on the matter since, Kannan says. For that to change, he says, there will need to be more federal support for research because studies that would look at an even wider population are often prohibitively expensive to perform. “You need millions of dollars to conduct a study like that with 1,000 samples,” he says. “Of course it will be a great study, but it needs a lot of resources.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New FTC memo calls for a focus on ‘structural dominance’ from big companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Commerce, Science And Transportation Committee Holds Confirmation Hearing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LFBuOoXZPoUtmQmWyBJKbgcIGCo=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69900193/1232440380.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;In a memo to staff, Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan outlined issues she wants to prioritize at the agency | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JNcm5K"&gt;In a memo to staff this week, FTC Chair Lina Khan outlined her new priorities for the agency: to focus on power imbalance, reduce harms to consumers, and address “rampant consolidation.” Khan wrote that the agency should focus its efforts and adjust its strategic approach to deal with the issues created by “next-generation technologies, innovations, and nascent industries across sectors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdvsmY"&gt;And without mentioning Amazon, Apple, or Facebook by name, Khan’s list of priorities for the FTC signals that the tech giants are likely to face much closer scrutiny from the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6ZJ2o"&gt;First, Khan said, the FTC should take a “holistic” approach to how it considers antitrust violations, which can prove harmful to independent businesses and workers as well as consumers. “Business models that centralize control and profits while outsourcing risk, liability, and costs also warrant particular scrutiny, given that deeply asymmetric relationships between the controlling firm and dependent entities can be ripe for abuse,” Khan wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XOsEL"&gt;Khan wants the agency’s enforcement efforts focused on root causes of and incentives for unlawful conduct, such as “conflicts of interest, business models, or structural dominance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8u1paP"&gt;The concept of structural dominance is a familiar theme for Khan. She wrote about it while she was a student at Yale Law School, &lt;a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox"&gt;in a now-famous paper where she argued&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon had managed to skirt monopoly laws to the point that its structural power gives it vast influence across the economy. In that paper, Khan also excoriated the way investors “are willing to fund predatory growth,” citing Uber as an example of a company whose investors braced to endure significant losses with the belief that they would one day recover their losses and then some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45iDQy"&gt;Khan’s memo this week echoes her earlier argument, calling out “the growing role of private equity and other investment vehicles” in ways that “may distort ordinary incentives” and fuel unfair competition. “Research documents how gatekeepers and dominant middlemen across the economy have been able to use their critical market position to hike fees, dictate terms, and protect and extend their market power,” she writes, adding that “deeply asymmetric relationships between the controlling firm and dependent entities can be ripe for abuse.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MSVqC"&gt;In addition, Khan wants to find ways for the FTC to strengthen its merger enforcement, “to address rampant consolidation and the dominance that it has enabled across markets,” and examine how contracts can perpetuate “unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive practices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mole2"&gt;She also named noncompete agreements that can restrict workers from which jobs they can take, and right-to-repair restrictions as examples of unfair contracts. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302664/apple-france-repairability-scores-index-law-right-to-repair"&gt;Apple in particular has been criticized&lt;/a&gt; for the way it limits how much users can repair Apple devices they own, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587331/right-to-repair-apple-iphone-ftc-lina-khan-open-meeting"&gt;FTC said earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that it would fight such restrictions. “Consumers, workers, franchisees, and other market participants are at a significant disadvantage when they are unable to negotiate freely over terms and conditions,” Khan wrote in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York City passes new protections for delivery workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A black-and-white image of three delivery workers dressed in casual clothing, their bikes visible in the background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KDg55SZjRemXt3JnEv74_y22J-c=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69899816/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photograph by Philip Montgomery&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wwy31Q"&gt;On Thursday, New York’s city council passed a package of six bills establishing new rights and protections for delivery workers, making it the first major city to address the intense working conditions associated with food delivery. Mayor DeBlasio has previously expressed support for the provisions and is expected to sign them into law without delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQVPFH"&gt;Passage of the bills was &lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/work/2021/9/22/22687983/nyc-landmark-food-delivery-worker-pay-bathrooms"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a local non-profit newsroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4GCtO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; feature earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; detailed the intense conditions faced by delivery drivers who serve apps like Grubhub and Uber Eats. Wage theft is common, as is physical assault, and pay can fluctuate wildly. Because of the gig work model, there is little security against on-the-job injuries or earnings shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1l7CAX"&gt;The measures passed today don’t address every danger faced by those workers, but they establish many long-sought protections. One measure requires most restaurants to let delivery workers use their bathrooms and institutes fines for bars and restaurants that refuse access. Another will establish minimum per-trip payments, similar to existing protections for Uber and Lyft drivers. Other measures would block apps from charging fees to deliver tips to workers (seen by labor advocates as a form of wage theft) and institute limits on how far a worker can be asked to travel for a delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65KcXV"&gt;The bills are the result of sustained organizing by Los Deliveristas Unidos, a group organizing delivery workers as part of the Worker’s Justice Project. The group rallied at City Hall in April and has been pushing the mayor and city council for months to take action on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kf9tT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse launches ‘Wave,’ a new way to pull friends into audio chats</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H0B6hqXjfCL3dctunmC-NBn8kQE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69899782/clubhousenewlogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bFc0AK"&gt;After the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679897/clubhouse-waves-invites-audio-rooms"&gt;was leaked last week&lt;/a&gt;, Clubhouse is officially launching a new way to invite people to audio chats called “Wave.” The company &lt;a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/wave-clubhouse-new-feature/"&gt;announced the news&lt;/a&gt; at a surprise town hall on Thursday and is enabling the feature today for all users on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAJUJg"&gt;With Wave, you can invite friends to a live audio room just by tapping a waving hand emoji. Once they receive their invitation, they can choose to join your call and immediately get added to an audio room. The company’s blog explains in a bit more detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YTPZJd"&gt;To send a Wave, swipe right on the Hallway or tap the dots icon at the bottom left of the screen. Then tape the wave button next to the person you’d like to chat with. They’ll get a notification that you said hello, and know that you’re open to chatting. If they are too, they can join a private room with you — open just to the people you waved at. You can keep it to one social circle, introduce friends from different groups to each other, or open the room up more broadly and make it for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f3JyxGcw78sU5mwxmePOw8IpUDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872988/Wave_Infographics__4_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Clubhouse&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each Wave will send a notification that your friends can respond to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PqGeD0"&gt;If someone doesn’t immediately respond, you can continue to use Clubhouse as you normally would. The company also says, to avoid confusion, if you have the app on in the background, you won’t immediately be pulled into a room if someone responds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErBo5P"&gt;Clubhouse seems to want to encourage more causal, social, small moments in its app, which as of late has seemed to become associated with professional, appointment-based experiences. The company brought its app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22424399/clubhouse-android-app-release-date-news-features"&gt;to Android in May&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586845/clubhouse-open-beta-invite-access-android-ios"&gt;removed its waitlist in July&lt;/a&gt;, which means there might be more people to casually talk to than when the app first launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zezSxa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 9/23 3:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added image from Clubhouse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
