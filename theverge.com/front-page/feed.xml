    <title>Netflix brings parental guilt to the world of superheroes with the first Jupiter’s Legacy trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PsCPunXg9BWHtWekkI5IBh2o7_Y=/315x0:1052x491/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69090401/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_9.24.13_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KwShBS"&gt;Netflix just showed off the first fruits of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/17/17581978/netflix-nx-social-media-sci-fi-fantasy-mark-millar"&gt;its deal&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Wanted&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Kick-Ass&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; a&lt;/em&gt;nd &lt;em&gt;Kingsman: The Secret Service &lt;/em&gt;co&lt;em&gt;-&lt;/em&gt;creator Mark Millar. &lt;em&gt;Jupiter’s Legacy&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1379781007272906752?s=20"&gt;a new live-action TV series&lt;/a&gt; based on Millar’s comics of the same name, which seems to be setting up an intergenerational conflict between a team of superheroes and their potentially less heroic children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuREUu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jupiter’s Legacy&lt;/em&gt; is an original concept from Millar, but it does seem to be playing on some classic superhero imagery. (Note Josh Duhamel’s The Utopian pulling a tractor by hand in what could only be described as a classic Superman move.) The main thrust, though, is the tension between an older generation’s pulpier idea of superheroics and a younger generation who might be more interested in the fame that comes along with it. In Netflix’s words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OzOcmW"&gt;They’re the first generation of superheroes. But as they pass the torch to their children, tensions are rising — and the old rules no longer apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="GcvmwU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TY3IAqm-gpE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X3Ulsa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jupiter’s Legacy&lt;/em&gt; is just the first of several planned Netflix projects from Millar, the result of the streamer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/7/16106574/netflix-comic-book-publisher-millarworld-first-acquisition-kick-ass-kingsman"&gt;purchasing his publishing house Millarworld &lt;/a&gt;in 2017. Along with &lt;em&gt;Jupiter’s Legacy&lt;/em&gt;, Netflix also plans to debut other Millar originals covering everything from &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BlVq-33DgPm/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"&gt;space bounty hunters to Spanish-language telenovelas&lt;/a&gt;. With this Millar series, Netflix seems poised to carry on the recent trend of &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/22364450/superdads-the-boys-invincible-superman-and-lois"&gt;daddy issues in superhero stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iwm9bB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jupiter’s Legacy &lt;/em&gt;is set to premiere on May 7th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The French army is testing Boston Dynamics’ robot dog Spot in combat scenarios</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H2KMwgQmLrvVXRBt_Zs-SUYANG4=/0x2:4096x2733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69090257/EySrwjgWYAQMtCC.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spot was apparently being tested for reconaissance. | Image: Saint-Cyr Coëtquidan / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/SaintCyrCoet" target="_blank"&gt;@SaintCyrCoet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KrYpy6"&gt;Spot, the quadruped robot built by US firm Boston Dynamics, has appeared alongside soldiers during military exercises carried out by the French army. The robot was apparently being used for reconnaissance during a two-day training exercise, but the deployment raises questions about how and where Boston Dynamics’ machines will be used in future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8obyY"&gt;Pictures of the exercises were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SaintCyrCoet/status/1379457690020294665"&gt;shared on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; by France’s foremost military school, the École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr. It described the tests as “raising students’ awareness of the challenges of tomorrow,” which include the “robotization of the battlefield.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBZnks"&gt;A &lt;a href="http://lignesdedefense.blogs.ouest-france.fr/archive/2021/03/31/quand-emia-part-au-combat-avec-des-robots-terrestres-22012.html"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by French newspaper &lt;em&gt;Ouest-France &lt;/em&gt;offers more detail, saying that Spot was one of a number of robots being tested by students from France’s École Militaire Interarmes (Combined Arms School), with the intention of assessing the usefulness of robots on future battlefields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrRfTy"&gt;Boston Dynamics’ vice president of business development Michael Perry told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the robot had been supplied by a European distributor, Shark Robotics, and that the US firm had not been notified in advance about its use. “We’re learning about it as you are,” says Perry. “We’re not clear on the exact scope of this engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VO5Stn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;"Quand l'EMIA part au combat avec des robots terrestres"&lt;a href="https://t.co/q6MNhCdr5C"&gt;https://t.co/q6MNhCdr5C&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/CTHDpI1Lun"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CTHDpI1Lun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Saint-Cyr Coëtquidan (@SaintCyrCoet) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SaintCyrCoet/status/1377313223045746692?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cXP7LR"&gt;During the two-day deployment, &lt;em&gt;Ouest-France &lt;/em&gt;says soldiers ran a number of scenarios, including an offensive action capturing a crossroads, defensive actions during night and day, and an urban combat test. Each scenario was performed using just humans and then using humans and robots together to see what difference the machines made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KonYpT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“During the urban combat phase where we weren’t using robots, I died.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVFKup"&gt;Sources quoted in the article say that the robots slowed down operations but helped keep troops safe. “During the urban combat phase where we weren’t using robots, I died. But I didn’t die when we had the robot do a recce first,” one soldier is quoted as saying. They added that one problem was Spot’s battery life: it apparently ran out of juice during an exercise and had to be carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6XDON"&gt;It’s not clear what role Spot was playing (neither Shark Robotics nor the École de Saint-Cyr had replied to requests for comment at the time of writing), but &lt;em&gt;Ouest-France&lt;/em&gt; suggests it was being used for reconnaissance. The 70lb Spot (31kg) is equipped with cameras and can be remote controlled, with its four legs allowing it to navigate terrain that would challenge wheeled or treaded robots. To date, it’s been used to remotely survey a number of environments, from construction sites to factories and underground mines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nM2gGE"&gt;In addition to Spot, other machines being tested by the French military included &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1182409418567063"&gt;OPTIO-X20&lt;/a&gt;, a remote-controlled vehicle with tank treads and auto cannon built by Estonian firm Milrem Robotics; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelanieRovery/status/1377194883136552962"&gt;ULTRO&lt;/a&gt;, a wheeled “robot mule” made for carrying equipment built by French state military firm Nexter; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sharkrobotics/status/1115541272306094080"&gt;Barakuda&lt;/a&gt;, a multipurpose wheeled drone that can provide mobile cover to soldiers with attached armored plating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tw6O7E"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="ro" dir="ltr"&gt;Boston Dynamics quadruped UGV Spot and Shark Robotics electric Barakuda UGV participate in exercises at the French military research school Centre de recherche des écoles de &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SaintCyrCoet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SaintCyrCoet&lt;/a&gt; (CREC)&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ugv?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ugv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/unmanned?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#unmanned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/unmannedvehicles?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#unmannedvehicles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/robotics?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#robotics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/military?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#military&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/research?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/training?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#training&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/france?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#france&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1WCASPmdA4"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1WCASPmdA4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Melanie Rovery (@MelanieRovery) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelanieRovery/status/1379720473416720385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5J6kDb"&gt;Spot’s appearance on simulated battlefields raises questions about where the robot will be deployed in future. Boston Dynamics has a long history of developing robots for the US army, but as it’s moved into commercial markets it’s distanced itself from military connections. Spot is still being tested by a number of US police forces, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299140/nypd-boston-dynamics-spot-robot-dog"&gt;including by the NYPD&lt;/a&gt;, but Boston Dynamics has always stressed that its machines will never be armed. “We unequivocally do not want any customer using the robot to harm people,” says Perry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fhA6p"&gt;Spot’s &lt;a href="https://www.bostondynamics.com/sites/default/files/inline-files/spot-terms-and-conditions-of-sale.pdf"&gt;terms and conditions&lt;/a&gt; forbid it from being used “to harm or intimidate any person or animal, as a weapon, or to enable any weapon,” and it’s possible to argue that a robot helping to scout buildings for soldiers is not technically harming or intimidating anyone. But if that recon is the prelude to a military engagement it seems like a flimsy distinction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iint80"&gt;Boston Dynamics’ Perry told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company had clear policies forbidding suppliers or customers from weaponizing the robot, but that the firm is “still evaluating” whether or not to ban non-weaponized deployments by military customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ywakBQ"&gt;“We think that the military, to the extent that they do use robotics to take people out of harm’s way, we think that’s a perfectly valid use of the technology,” says Perry. “With this forward-deployment model that you’re discussing, it’s something we need to better understand to determine whether or not it’s actively being used to harm people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2OwSI"&gt;Despite worries from researchers and advocates, militaries around the world are increasingly pushing robots &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/oct/15/dangerous-rise-of-military-ai-drone-swarm-autonomous-weapons"&gt;onto the battlefield&lt;/a&gt;. Remotely operated drones have been the most significant deployment to date, but other use cases — including robots that can scout, survey, and patrol — are also being tested. Robotic quadrupeds similar to Spot built by rival firm Ghost Robotics are currently being &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/07/robit-dogs-patrol-tyndall/"&gt;tested by the US Air Force&lt;/a&gt; as replacements for stationary surveillance cameras. If robots prove reliable as roaming CCTV, it’s only a matter of time before those capabilities are introduced to active combat zones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The wastewater disaster in Florida is a symptom of how we grow our food </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Operations At The Mosaic Co. Phosphate Mine" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zrxy-2iscHE_EPHfZMjfI_nePZ4=/98x0:5999x3934/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69090255/481497560.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The bucket of a drag line unearths phosphate at the Mosaic Co. South Fort Meade phosphate mine in Fort Meade, Florida, U.S., on Thursday, July 9, 2015.&amp;nbsp; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=editorial&amp;amp;photographer=Bloomberg" target="_blank"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Contributor via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Fertilizer’s messy legacy spreads far beyond the disaster at Piney Point&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="doubcm"&gt;Fearing a 20-foot “tidal wave” of contaminated wastewater breaking free from a giant industrial waste pile, Florida officials told hundreds of residents to evacuate their homes in Manatee County over Easter weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zN4jbj"&gt;Since then, authorities have furiously drained more than a 170 million gallons of wastewater to alleviate the pressure that might have otherwise overwhelmed containment walls. The most dangerous water (which picked up contaminants as it leaked through the breach) was trucked away to be processed — but the rest has been intentionally drained into Tampa Bay, where it could cause more problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zVqAKm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Disasters that can be traced back to the area’s legacy of mining phosphate rock&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xXczhj"&gt;It’s a string of potential disasters that can be traced back to the &lt;a href="https://thecounter.org/earth-day-mosaic-phosphate-fertilizer-louisiana-mississippi/"&gt;area’s legacy of mining&lt;/a&gt; phosphate rock, which the agricultural industry relies on for fertilizer. The crisis is unfolding at the former Piney Point phosphate plant, where phosphate was mined and then turned into fertilizer for decades until the site was abandoned in 2001. What’s left in its wake are three towering phosphogypsum “stacks” — flat-topped hills of &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/radtown/radioactive-material-fertilizer-production"&gt;radioactive industrial waste&lt;/a&gt; with wastewater ponds at the center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vYqvW"&gt;This isn’t the first time phosphogypsum stacks have suddenly released slurries of water and waste — and it probably won’t be the last. Another crisis like the one at Piney Point could easily happen again unless we rethink the way we grow our food, some environmental advocates say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmTEcK"&gt;“The damage that occurs from just producing fertilizer — not even using it, but just producing fertilizer — is profound,” says Rachael Curran, an environmental attorney in Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bfWTFV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A big mess&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="fTpGyW"&gt;Florida supplies a &lt;a href="https://fipr.floridapoly.edu/about-us/phosphate-primer/phosphate-and-how-florida-was-formed.php"&gt;quarter of the world’s phosphate&lt;/a&gt; and 80 percent of all the phosphate used in the US. Most of it goes into fertilizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lO3DiM"&gt;But before it can be used to help crops grow, the phosphate goes through a chemical process that leaves behind a big mess. Once phosphate ore is dug up, sulfuric acid dissolves it into a “slurry.” The stuff used in fertilizer is separated out from the slurry, leaving behind phosphogypsum as a byproduct. For every ton of desirable phosphoric acid produced for fertilizer, more than &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/radiation/tenorm-fertilizer-and-fertilizer-production-wastes"&gt;five tons of phosphogypsum waste remains&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1HI0z"&gt;Phosphogypsum has been used as a construction material in other countries, like China, which produces &lt;a href="https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/agriculture-investing/phosphate-investing/top-phosphate-countries-by-production/"&gt;the most phosphate&lt;/a&gt; in the world (the US ranks third). But in the US, the Environmental Protection Agency banned using the material in construction in 1989 because of its radioactivity, albeit at relatively low levels. (Phosphate ore contains some uranium, thorium, and radium.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGmR2d"&gt;Last year, the EPA &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-approves-use-phosphogypsum-road-construction"&gt;gave the greenlight&lt;/a&gt; to use phosphogypsum with low levels of radioactivity to build roads (it followed a landslide of environmental rollbacks under the Trump administration). But Curran still worries about that — instead of piling the risk all in one place, she worries, that’s just spreading it around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkq5AI"&gt;Since it isn’t typically used for anything, the phosphate industry pumps its leftover “slurry” into phosphogypsum stacks. Water pools on the top while solids settle and are used to form the containment walls. These “stacks” grow into mountains over time — with some reaching nearly as tall as a 20-story building and as wide as 600 football fields. There are more than two dozen phosphogypsum stacks strewn across Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="83HW02"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These giants are vulnerable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="svZ84c"&gt;These giants are vulnerable. Much of Florida is built on porous rock, which makes it susceptible to sinkholes. In &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/29/495936718/giant-sinkhole-at-florida-plant-leaks-polluted-water-into-state-aquifer"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;, one opened up underneath a 120-foot tall phosphogypsum stack, sending contaminated water and waste into a major drinking water aquifer. Another sinkhole did something similar to another stack in &lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/archive/1995/07/18/the-hole-under-the-mountain/"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;. And in &lt;a href="https://www.theledger.com/article/LK/20071209/News/608133314/LL"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;, the wall of another stack collapsed and sent more than 50 million gallons of contaminated water into the Alafia River. Piney Point itself spilled 170 million gallons of wastewater when the lining of its stacks ripped in &lt;a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/article/LK/20130903/News/605206452/SH"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wslQJ3"&gt;Luckily, there’s little risk that the waste from Piney Point will reach the aquifer and affect drinking water this time, officials say — although they’ve provided bottled water to affected residents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCvyHq"&gt;The slight radioactivity of wastewater in phosphogypsum stacks isn’t likely to cause major problems for wildlife or people, according to Matt Pasek, a geoscience professor at the University of South Florida. “It won’t kill you to get splashed with it,” Pasek says. “But it’s not something you would want to swim in or drink.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rmfsuY"&gt;Still, there are other problems at Piney Point. The stacks are the highest point in the area, which is one reason why a cascade of wastewater from the site threatened to wipe out homes this week. Officials decided that the potential “tidal wave” posed a greater threat than letting water drain into Tampa Bay. But environmentalists and people in the fishing industry are worried that the wastewater, laced with nitrogen and phosphorous, could trigger harmful algae blooms that use up much of the oxygen in the water, choking local marine life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hnb9hP"&gt;Florida lawmakers have &lt;a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Media/PressReleases/show/3949#:~:text=The%20amendment%20will%20add%20Senator,22%20budget%20later%20this%20month."&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; spending $200 million on “the complete cleanup and closure” of Piney Point. The state senate will consider the budget amendment today. “When it’s all said and done, those stacks will be emptied and sealed. So I’m thrilled about that,” Manatee County Commission Chair Vanessa Baugh &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=679851752723106&amp;amp;ref=watch_permalink"&gt;said during a briefing &lt;/a&gt;on Piney Point yesterday. The county board of commissioners authorized the use of a deep injection well to store the remaining wastewater from Piney Point once it’s been treated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqT4IV"&gt;Curran still worries that those actions won’t prevent another phosphogypsum stack collapse or leak in the state. Heavier rainfall and more intense storms as a result of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/06/climate/florida-ponds-toxic-waste.html?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=120059140&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_6S5pTAgNolvrS1xF0ogG8w29tj1ZXcIftqJCiPi_KjLefg0Vt4ADccdXYgpfuSGvC53kfz0_pR_OEZmdjvlcRRROcCdDScaqRfL33RsQXp2h1-iM&amp;amp;utm_content=120059140&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;climate change are putting already vulnerable stacks in an even more precarious&lt;/a&gt; situation, she adds. A 2004 hurricane caused another breach at another stack that spilled 65 million gallons of wastewater into Tampa Bay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azLe8q"&gt;“There is no safe way to manage these stacks, that’s been made clear so the solution is really to stop generating the waste in the first place,” says Curran. “That ultimately means we need to change the way we grow food.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OyV0cg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new landscape? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sncGE4"&gt;Changing our agricultural system is a tall order. Phosphate is, after all, a building block for life. It forms the “&lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Phosphate-Backbone"&gt;backbone&lt;/a&gt;” of DNA strands. Phosphorous is one of the three primary nutrients plants need to grow, along with potassium and nitrogen. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Mosaic Co. dragline carves out phosphate matrix in Tampa, Florida, US, on Friday, Dec. 2nd, 2011. Mosaic Co. is the world’s largest producer of phosphate and second-largest producer of potash — two crop nutrients which are primary ingredients in producing fertilizer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="flz9pU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fipr.floridapoly.edu/about-us/phosphate-primer/history-of-phosphate-fertilizer-production.php"&gt;After World War II&lt;/a&gt; devastated agriculture and industry across much of Europe and Asia, demand for these nutrients in fertilizer grew (there were also &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/food/2013/04/history-nitrogen-fertilizer-ammonium-nitrate/"&gt;nitrate factories&lt;/a&gt; readily available that had previously been used to make munitions). Fertilizers increased crop yields as the population of Earth grew, and they became an integral part of industrialized agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PxyvJ"&gt;“Phosphate is not a sort of vanity mining industry, something that you want for jewelry or things like that,” says Pasek. Because of its important role in agriculture, Pasek says an end to phosphate mining “is not feasible, let’s put it that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nSQDWs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A growing movement toward “regenerative” farming&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pt1Lgj"&gt;Some farmers, however, are putting that to the test. They’re doing things differently by returning to some of the ways farming was done before there were industrial fertilizers. There’s a growing movement toward so-called “regenerative” farming. Instead of applying fertilizer and tilling soil — breaking it up — between cash crops, they’re planting other crops that replenish nutrients in the soil. &lt;a href="https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2010.0095"&gt;Radishes&lt;/a&gt;, for example, have been shown to increase phosphorus in soil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBekLH"&gt;“There are a lot of farmers out there that have completely done away with synthetic fertilizer, and are doing fine,” says Rick Haney, a soil scientist with the USDA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5y59N6"&gt;Even if it’s too soon to throw out synthetic fertilizers altogether, there are opportunities to use a lot less of it. Some &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/farmers-are-facing-a-phosphorus-crisis-the-solution-starts-with-soil"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; are trying to tap into the legacy of phosphate fertilizers that’s already trapped in soil. Sometimes phosphorus reacts with other minerals in soil to form compounds that modern crops have a harder time soaking up. Farmers traditionally solved this dilemma by turning to more phosphate fertilizer. As an alternative, crops can be bred to become better at making use of those trapped nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aow0AW"&gt;And while phosphorus might be a building block for life, phosphate rock used to make synthetic fertilizer is a finite resource that &lt;a href="https://fipr.floridapoly.edu/about-us/phosphate-primer/how-long-will-florida-phosphate-mining-go-on.php"&gt;could one day be depleted&lt;/a&gt;. That’s adding to the growing momentum for regenerative farming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPE3ql"&gt;“In 20 years it’s going to be a very different farming system. I think that we’re going to have to move in that direction because it just makes more sense,” says Haney. “Why would you work against nature when you can work with it?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6c4cE"&gt;But changing people’s mindset when it comes to fertilizer is still slow-going. “It’s like trying to turn the Titanic with a tugboat,” Haney says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcKpfo"&gt;In the meantime, residents like those evacuated down the hill from Piney Point will keep shouldering the risks posed by industrial fertilizers. Mountainous piles of waste from phosphate mining will keep growing because no one really knows what else to do with it except put it into piles or bury it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GpRZ0b"&gt;People who evacuated were allowed to return to their homes last night. The risk of an imminent catastrophic phosphogypsum stack collapse has passed, at least for now. The stacks still loom in the distance, dominating the landscape.   &lt;/p&gt;

Now, any hardware manufacturer can add software-side support for Apple’s localized network to track missing items — so long as they play by Apple’s Made for iPhone (MFi) accessory rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3KKTk"&gt;The first wave of items that can now be tracked starting today include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof’s S3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22162936/vanmoof-x3-long-term-review"&gt;X3 e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219529/belkin-magsafe-dock-charging-wireless-ces-2021-earbuds"&gt;Belkin’s SoundForm Freedom True Wireless Earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, and the Chipolo One Spot tracking tag — all of which can now rely on Apple’s crowdsourced Bluetooth network (which encompasses millions of iPhones, iPads, and Macs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oBlSj"&gt;Users will be able to add those devices to the updated Find My app starting today and can track them through that app much in the same way that they’d track any missing Apple product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="HAu2KR"&gt;Apple says that third-party devices looking to add support will have to apply through the company’s MFi program for authorized accessories and “adhere to all the privacy protections of the Find My network that Apple customers rely on.” Approved products will sport a new “Works with Apple Find My” badge to let customers know that they’re compatible with Apple’s network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oc3g2t"&gt;Additionally, Apple announced that it’d be offering a chipset specification for third-party hardware companies to integrate with the Ultra-Wideband systems in Apple’s more recent phones for even more precise tracking in the future.

    <title>MSI Prestige 14 Evo review: fast but flawed</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Good isn’t quite good enough&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="X4bbCc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136283/msi-prestige-14-review-laptop-specs-price-pink-content-creator"&gt;MSI’s Prestige 14&lt;/a&gt; laptop line is traditionally marketed to content creators. But the Prestige 14 Evo is in a bit of a murkier spot. It’s priced below the Prestige 14, starting at $1,099, and it doesn’t have the discrete GPU or high-resolution screen that would render it a compelling content-creation machine. Despite its name, the Prestige 14 Evo is an everyday productivity laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tL85H2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10430763"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H1UNnX"&gt;Unfortunately, that makes it a tougher sell. The 14-inch consumer laptop space at this price point is absolutely stuffed; there are multiple machines at comparable prices that do just about everything very, very well. A laptop with even one significant drawback is going to have trouble rising to the top of the pack. Unfortunately, the Prestige 14 Evo has a number of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZI4UC"&gt;That doesn’t mean there’s nothing exceptional about the device. The Prestige is one of the few 14-inch laptops you can buy that includes the Core i7-1185G7, Intel’s most powerful chip for ultraportables. This review is my first look at the flagship processor (outside of a reference design that I had for a few days last year) — most of the top laptops that I’ve reviewed recently include the Core i7-1165G7, which is a step down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="T8uP9Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Prestige 14 Evo is one of the most powerful 14-inch Intel laptops you can buy at its price point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PDj0Gw"&gt;That undoubtedly makes the Prestige 14 Evo one of the most powerful 14-inch Intel laptops you can buy at its price point. But does the 1185G7 offer significantly better performance than other Intel systems, or Apple’s M1 MacBooks, to outweigh shortcomings in the chassis? For the majority of users, the answer is going to be no. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyuzKK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22327287/msi-summit-series-b15-review-chassis-build-keyboard-speakers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MSI Summit B15 review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136283/msi-prestige-14-review-laptop-specs-price-pink-content-creator"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MSI Prestige 14 review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Prestige 14 Evo from the front, open. The screen displays The Verge homepage. A mug is on its right and a ball and a mason jar half filled with water are on its left. In the background are plants." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-M-tJ3UkHy228Njiot5WABpPOhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395382/akrales_20210323_4482_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is from the front.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RYGspV"&gt;If you’ve seen or used last year’s Prestige 14, the chassis isn’t massively different. The Evo has the same lightweight build with a fold-under hinge, a fingerprint sensor in the top-left corner of the touchpad, and a decent keyboard that’s plasticky but comfortable overall. My model is “carbon gray,” but the finish also comes in “rose pink” and “pure white.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YIbP2"&gt;One update you’ll probably notice is that there’s a new logo. MSI’s classic dragon has been confined to its gaming models; the Prestige now has the same plain-old MSI letters as the business-chic Summit Series. The ports have also been rearranged. The Evo includes two USB-C ports on the left as well as a USB-A, a microSD, and a headphone jack on the right; last year’s Prestige had the microSD on the left and an additional USB-A on the right. I’m sad to lose the additional USB-A (and the one that’s there is only USB 2.0, which is an old standard at this point), but it’s an okay port selection either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The back right corner of the MSI Prestige 14." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I8IiNKXJVGylPZaMCxEfLr9nJzI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395390/akrales_20210323_4482_0115.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The chassis has a touch of blue around the edges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Prestige 14 Evo keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/odRgM1InLV-yVcoCbj7JCfi7gtk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395392/akrales_20210323_4482_0183.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not visible here, but the keyboard’s backlit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1FVEjT"&gt;I have several issues with the chassis, though. First, it’s quite a fingerprint magnet, and the lid was covered in visible smudges after just a few days of use. It also has a bit of a plasticky feel, with some flex in both the screen and the deck. Second, not only does the 1920 x 1080 display have a cramped 16:9 aspect ratio, but it’s also dim, maxing out at 248 nits in my testing. That means it won’t be a great choice for use outdoors or in other bright settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdBtZX"&gt;Third, the touchpad had some palm-rejection issues: my right hand rested naturally on the right half of the touchpad while I was typing, and the cursor was constantly jumping around on my screen. (MSI says they haven’t heard this complaint about the Evo’s touchpad before.) Finally, the audio isn’t great — it’s tinny, bass is almost nonexistent, and there’s not enough volume to fill a room. You can check out my review of last year’s Prestige 14 for a more in-depth discussion of all these features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="FuWwkW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I have several issues with the chassis&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The fingerprint sensor on the MSI Prestige 14 Evo." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FoT9x6PsH7SgajbHGv6-ocngdRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395386/akrales_20210323_4482_0080.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This isn’t my favorite location for a fingerprint sensor, as a righty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="REdaGa"&gt;The biggest upgrades are on the inside — the Evo is powered by Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors. The base Prestige 14 includes a Core i5-1135G7, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. (RAM is soldered and there aren’t extra storage slots, but you can swap out the SSD.) The $1,149 model I’m using bumps that up to a Core i7-1185G7. Both processors come with Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIrCfE"&gt;Setting aside the chassis, $1,149 is an okay deal for that system. For price comparisons, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21494523/asus-zenbook-14-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus’ Zenbook 14&lt;/a&gt; with 512GB of storage, a Core i7-1165G7, and 8GB of RAM is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Ultra-Slim-i7-1065G7-Thunderbolt-UX425JA-EB71/dp/B08KH9SX3G?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$899.99&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-air%2Fspace-gray-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-512gb%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22368806%2Fmsi-prestige-14-evo-review-price-specs-features-intel-1185g7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1 MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is $1,449 for the same specs. If you want something with a GPU, the regular Prestige 14 with a GTX 1650 Max-Q and 1TB of storage is $1,549.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0sMK6"&gt;The Prestige 14 Evo is certified through Intel’s Evo platform, which means Intel has verified that it meets a number of performance benchmarks (including “all-day” battery life and one-second boot time) and includes modern amenities like Thunderbolt 4 and Wi-Fi 6 (Gig+). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Prestige 14 Evo keyboard from the left side seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s29bJVQSuPNJ-zQsVBmPJ89oVCE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395391/akrales_20210323_4482_0137.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some models come bundled with a sleeve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VaCHRh"&gt;The 1185G7 did a fine job with my standard workload of apps, dozens of Chrome tabs, Zoom calls, light photo editing, and the like. I never had to think twice about loading more tasks on — not only did the fans not freak out during my regular workday, but I never even heard them spin up. (I did occasionally hear some coil whine, which was annoying.) The keyboard and the bottom of the chassis remained cool as well. The experience was pretty comparable to that of using an M1 Macbook Air or any other top ultraportable as a daily driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3r3d1"&gt;To more directly compare the 1185G7 to other chips (primarily Apple’s M1), I ran a number of synthetic benchmarks. The results were a mixed bag — you can see them in the chart below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5uMXZF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10430868"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P448eu"&gt;In our testing, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; beat the Prestige 14 Evo on every benchmark here except for Geekbench 5.3 OpenCL / Compute and the 30-minute Cinebench loop (which makes sense, since the MacBook Air doesn’t have a fan). It’s particularly notable that the 1185G7 loses to the M1 on both single-core benchmarks; single-core performance is typically Intel’s strength, but not here.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fold-under hinge lifts the deck a bit off the table.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="osboW9"&gt;I also put the Prestige 14 Evo through two demanding real-world tasks: the &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; benchmark and a five-minute, 33-second 4K video export in Premiere Pro. The Evo’s results here were quite comparable to those of the MacBook Air. The Evo ran &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; (lowest settings, native resolution) at 38fps, which is identical to what the Air got in our testing. The Asus Zenbook 14 with a Core i7-1165G7 put up 29fps on the same title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3ESwq"&gt;The Prestige completed the export in eight minutes and nine seconds. That’s the fastest time I’ve ever seen from a mass-production Iris Xe machine; the Zenbook took 11 minutes and 28 seconds. That said, it’s literally only a few seconds faster than the MacBook Air, which clocked in at eight minutes and 15 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RtfHBa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 1185G7 is a clear improvement over lower-clocked Tiger Lake chips&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ELgLAv"&gt;Overall, the 1185G7 is a clear improvement over lower-clocked Tiger Lake chips (but the 1165G7 is good enough that you likely won’t notice the difference outside of demanding tasks). Its integrated graphics seem to be neck and neck with those of the M1. (Intel’s Quick Sync is also likely a factor in that speedy export time.) But the synthetic benchmarks, which are more of a rough approximation of CPU capability, indicate that the Prestige might fall behind on other tasks, depending on your workload. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ2Gjt"&gt;I did see some battery drain during the export, despite the laptop being plugged in. It turns out that the Prestige comes with overcharge protection that keeps it from charging if it’s plugged in above a certain percentage. You can swap between battery-capacity profiles in MSI’s Center for Business and Productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tfV5l3"&gt;The laptop seemed to struggle to cool the chip, as did last year’s Prestige 14 (though that model also had a discrete GPU to worry about). Throughout all of my testing, the CPU was consistently in the mid-90s (Celsius) — and that was with the fans audibly blasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drlIJu"&gt;Battery life is okay, but not the best. I averaged six hours and 12 minutes of continuous sustained work, with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. That’s not a disaster, but it’s only a bit ahead of the previous Prestige 14, which had discrete graphics and a smaller battery. (I got about six hours, with the same workload, out of that machine.) And it’s significantly worse than the MacBook Air, which gave my colleague Dieter Bohn up to 10 hours to a charge. I even got over an hour more out of the Zenbook 14. Compared to both systems, that’s a heck of a lot of battery life to give up for a nonexistent-to-small gain in real-world performance. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Prestige 14 Evo open, seen from the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZjcH-wUiYMMF5YcMuKxvpGRk1wI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395383/akrales_20210323_4482_0043.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Prestige 14 Evo weighs 2.84 pounds and is 0.63 inches thick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="p3X9Dq"&gt;Finally, the Prestige comes preloaded with some junk, including Norton, which sent me annoying pop-ups until I uninstalled it. This isn’t the end of the world, but it’s still a bit irritating to see on a laptop that costs over $1,000. I also found MSI’s Center for Business and Productivity to be a bit of a pain to use — my clicks were somewhat slow to register, and the software occasionally froze or crashed. (It does have useful features, though, including the Application Optimizer which allows you to manually distribute CPU power between programs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HpTnHI"&gt;The Prestige 14 Evo is a functional, portable device with a heck of a processor inside. It’s always impressive to see so much power in such a thin chassis. That said, the Evo doesn’t seem quite ready to accommodate the chip, or the demanding tasks that you might want to do if you’re looking for a 1185G7. It’s able to game, and it’s able to export, but I can tell that the fans are struggling to keep up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4nhky"&gt;For that reason, I have trouble seeing a case for the Prestige 14 Evo over competitors. The laptop is fine, functional, and impressive on the inside — but from the dim screen and outdated port to the thin audio and coil whine, there are too many compromises for which a hefty chip has to make up. For the majority of laptop buyers who don’t need a slightly better screen or discrete graphics, more affordable 1165G7 systems like the Zenbook 14 come without these kinks but with better battery life and close to the same performance and portability benefits. If you’re willing to pay just a bit more, the MacBook Air performs just as well if not better in most tasks and is a significant step up in almost every other area. The Prestige 14 Evo is in a weird place in the middle, and it doesn’t quite fit. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gimlet and Ringer unions detail their first historic contracts with Spotify</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-w6n8dwOalH2R2nXSypi8KARe_M=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089935/VRG_ILLO_1777_Gimlet_Ringer_Spotify.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gsFVDs"&gt;Gimlet Media and &lt;em&gt;The Ringer&lt;/em&gt; agreed on a three-year union employment contract with Spotify, marking a historic moment for both the tech giant and the podcasting industry. The contracts cover diversity at the company, salary bases, annual raises, and titles. It’s a big step — not just for unionization in podcasting, but also for the tech industry overall, which has been slow to take up unionization and faced union-busting tactics when they do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWR5mD"&gt;The Writers Guild of America, East, which represents Gimlet and &lt;em&gt;The Ringer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.wgaeast.org/gimlet-media-and-the-ringer-ratify-first-podcast-contracts-at-spotify"&gt;publicized the contract details today&lt;/a&gt;. (Disclosure: Vox Media’s editorial staff, which includes &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, is also unionized with WGAE.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DUD5p"&gt;Salary minimums begin at $57,000 plus overtime for &lt;em&gt;The Ringer&lt;/em&gt; staff and $73,000 for Gimlet Media associate producers. All union members are guaranteed at least a 2 percent annual increase, and if they’re laid off, they’ll receive at least 11 weeks of severance. Management also guarantees that at least 50 percent of candidates for open unit positions after the phone interview stage will be from underrepresented backgrounds, including BIPOC, LGBTQ+, people with disabilities, and military veterans. Contractors also must either be offered a full-time job after 10 months, or the companies must let them know 30 days in advance that they will not be brought on full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rPLQgp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This contract agreement lasts for three years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NsOPNb"&gt;Notably missing from the contract, however, is any clause about intellectual property, a sticking point that union members tweeted about and said was a difficult agreement to reach. The union members wanted to own their work and control what happened to it after its creation. This would also mean profiting from that work and sharing in the revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCCmYq"&gt;“As it stands, that is where we are — we do not have control over intellectual property in our contract, we do not have control over derivative works in our contract,” says Dan Devine, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The Ringer&lt;/em&gt;. “That’s certainly something to keep working on as we go forward and other media shops do as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdyjrM"&gt;Of course, intellectual property was always something Spotify would be hard-pressed to cede control or revenue over. It’s a big part of its podcast strategy — building shows that could be turned into movies or TV shows in the future. Other WGAE contracts, including Vox Media’s, do account for IP. Vox’s, for example, pays union members up to $100,000 in some instances for derivative works based on their reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="INot7d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spotify still needs to reach an agreement with Parcast&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dPioV0"&gt;Spotify still needs to reach one more contract agreement with its Parcast podcast network,  but presumably, the Gimlet and &lt;em&gt;Ringer&lt;/em&gt; contracts will serve as a reference point for those future conversations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcHP5b"&gt;The agreements were reached last month, during a particularly dicey time for &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/gimlet-reply-all-controversy-spotify-test-kitchen.html"&gt;Gimlet Media&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Reply All &lt;/em&gt;miniseries &lt;em&gt;The Test Kitchen&lt;/em&gt;, which delved into the allegedly toxic and racist culture at &lt;em&gt;Bon Appétit&lt;/em&gt;, was canceled because former Gimlet employee Eric Eddings accused two hosts, PJ Vogt and Sruthi Pinnamaneni, of creating a “near-identical toxic environment at Gimlet.” Vogt stepped away from the show after the allegations surfaced, as did Pinnamaneni. The allegations focus on Gimlet prior to its Spotify acquisition and also touch on how the company treated contract workers, like stringing them along without ever offering full-time work. The union contract looks to prevent some of those issues, like contract workers being undervalued, moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDHkdg"&gt;This represents a landmark deal for both the podcasting and tech industry. Longtime podcasting and radio organization NPR has been unionized under SAG-AFTRA for years, as have digital media companies with podcasting efforts, but individual networks, like Gimlet, haven’t been widely represented through unions yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RmlaUd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spotify will eventually house three separate unions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OsuTYl"&gt;Meanwhile, tech giants, like Amazon, have resisted recognizing or supporting their workers’ unions. Its Alabama warehouse workers voted last week on the decision to unionize, and the world is still awaiting the results. This doesn’t mean tech employees aren’t trying to unionize, however. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html"&gt;Google employees and contractors announced the Alphabet Workers Union&lt;/a&gt; (AWU), a group affiliated with Communications Workers of America, in January, but AWU is a solidarity union, meaning it’s not recognized by the National Labor Relations Board and can’t force Google management to negotiate a contract for its members. Employees at Medium also tried to unionize but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307415/medium-union-effort-stalls-one-vote-short-majority-cwa"&gt;fell one vote short&lt;/a&gt;. The company then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22349175/medium-layoffs-union-evan-williams-blogger-twitter-subscription"&gt;offered buyouts&lt;/a&gt; to its entire editorial team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RfjOis"&gt;Kickstarter employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/18/21142308/kickstarter-employee-vote-union-unionize"&gt;unionized last year&lt;/a&gt;, making them the first major tech-oriented union, but they have yet to reach a deal with the company. Employees at Glitch have also unionized, with Glitch reaching a contract agreement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22307671/glitch-workers-sign-historic-collective-bargaining-agreement-cwa"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch will ban people for harassment, even when it doesn’t happen on the site</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L1kt2QTjmAW0uaHCNpupcoE-oXY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089931/acastro_200901_1777_twitch_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vufwr7"&gt;Twitch will now ban users who harass members of its community — even when that harassment takes place off Twitch. The streaming platform announced a &lt;a href="http://static-development.twitch.tv.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/p/en/legal/community-guidelines/off-service-conduct-policy/"&gt;major expansion of its off-service misconduct policy today&lt;/a&gt; that allows it to take action against users who mistreat people regardless of where it happens, whether it’s offline or on another social platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJNYOz"&gt;The new policy splits misconduct into two categories: category one, which applies to harassment that takes place on &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; off Twitch, and category two, which applies only to harassment off Twitch. The first category hasn’t changed. If Twitch is reviewing a harassment report about something that happened on-stream, it will take into account related harassment on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nt8SK7"&gt;The second category,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;however,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is new. Now, if Twitch finds out about “serious offenses that pose a substantial safety risk to the Twitch community,” it’ll take action, even when those offenses took place entirely off the platform. The company is currently defining “serious offenses” as incidents of violent extremism, credible threats of mass violence, membership in a known hate group, sexual exploitation of children, and nonconsensual sexual activities, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGlFFI"&gt;Twitch is bringing on a third-party law firm to assist with off-platform investigations. “These investigations are vastly more complex and can take significant time and resources to resolve,” &lt;a href="http://blog-bucket-b58e0ubcuamv.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/en/2021/04/07/our-plan-for-addressing-severe-off-service-misconduct/"&gt;the company wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “For behaviors that take place off Twitch, we must rely more heavily on law enforcement and other services to share relevant evidence before we can move forward.” A spokesperson for the company declined to give the name of the law firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9181F"&gt;The move comes after Twitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165342/twitch-hateful-conduct-harassment-policy-update"&gt;overhauled its harassment policy last December&lt;/a&gt;. The changes included stricter rules around sexual harassment and a ban on promoting hateful opinions under the pretense of comedy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOJAxV"&gt;In June 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303185/twitch-sexual-harassment-assault-permanent-bans-streamers"&gt;the company faced a reckoning around sexual harassment and assault&lt;/a&gt;, with multiple women coming forward to say it hadn’t done enough to protect them. While some of those incidents took place on the streaming platform, others happened off-site but involved members of the Twitch community. One streamer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that an adult began sending them sexual messages on Twitch when they were 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRpLQS"&gt;In its announcement today, Twitch said it is focusing on “the most egregious types of physical and psychological harm” to start but implied it could expand the off-service harassment policy later on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJwyOO"&gt;The company also said it will suspend users who submit a large number of fake reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePL0YZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQhgQi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Hey Spotify’ is another hands-free way to control your music, rolling out now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kl7xJi5_OwkKoi3zYf8_x0keld4=/0x0:828x552/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089913/hey_spotify.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Disclaimer: John Legend is a Vox Media board member.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hkV8Cp"&gt;If you want to pull up your favorite Spotify track or playlist without pressing buttons, there is no shortage of voice assistants to help you get those jams, including &lt;a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/listen_everywhere/voice_assistants/"&gt;Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana, and even Bixby&lt;/a&gt;. But now, Spotify has its own hands-free wake word: “Hey Spotify” appears to be rolling out on Android and iOS, as tested by &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/handsfree_hey_spotify_wake_word_rolls_out-news-48521.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSM Arena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/07/hey-spotify-starts-roll-out-iphone/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBA4oK"&gt;Frankly, it’s a little less handy than some of the native voice assistants built into your phone because you need to &lt;em&gt;leave the app open&lt;/em&gt; for it to work — it’s not something you’ll launch with your phone asleep or with Spotify simply running in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47OKtQ"&gt;But if you have the app open, you can just say “Hey Spotify” and ask it to play a song; pull up a playlist; launch a radio station; and skip, pause, or play. We also found the “Play something I like” command would pull up a random one of our Daily Mix playlists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wARZwodzNDY_yR3IzI5TLorUuTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427128/spotify_hey_pano.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0iRPOM"&gt;The phone version of the feature’s been in the works for at least a year, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1235350117802283011"&gt;as app researcher Jane Manchun Wong discovered last March&lt;/a&gt;. The app should prompt you to get started if the feature’s rolled out to you by now, but you might be able to find the toggle manually under Settings &amp;gt; Microphone permissions &amp;gt; “Hey Spotify.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M8X621"&gt;Why now? Why bother when other voice assistants can do this without launching an app? I imagine that’s because Spotify is tracking toward its &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; hardware, where its voice assistant &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;be always on and always ready. Specifically, Spotify appears to be tracking toward the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364630/spotify-car-thing-renders-app-leak-music-player-hardware-product"&gt;its Car Thing&lt;/a&gt;, a dedicated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/17/18628772/spotify-car-thing-audio-experience-data-premium-assistant"&gt;Spotify smart assistant for your vehicle&lt;/a&gt; that  was reported to include a “Hey Spotify” voice command &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/18/18188523/spotify-in-car-music-player-release-date-price"&gt;way back in January 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2N9sX"&gt;Having the same voice command on your phone makes sense; users might get used to it, and start looking for it, after they exit their vehicles. And while they’re at it, I also wouldn’t be surprised if we see some “Hey Spotify” headphones or earbuds sometime in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is upgrading all monthly subscribers to unlimited plans for free</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MVkFA8"&gt;T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Ft-mobiles-next-un-carrier-move-5gforall&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F7%2F22371868%2Ftmobile-unlimited-plans-postpaid-upgrade-automatically-offer-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday that it will upgrade all existing postpaid phone plan customers to unlimited plans for free. It’s also announcing a promotion for customers of competing carriers interested in switching to T-Mobile, so AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon plan owners on fixed data plans can trade in their phones for a free Samsung Galaxy A32 5G smartphone and a T-Mobile unlimited plan with 5G access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6dYpG"&gt;“Today, 60 million Americans are stuck on limited data plans from Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T … most with limited or no 5G access. With the Great Unlimited Trade-Up, those people can trade up to both unlimited data and full access to T-Mobile’s expansive 5G network — including Ultra Capacity and Extended Range — all at the same or better price than the Carriers’ offer for limited data plans today,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Ft-mobiles-next-un-carrier-move-5gforall&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F7%2F22371868%2Ftmobile-unlimited-plans-postpaid-upgrade-automatically-offer-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reads a press release&lt;/a&gt; the company put out this morning in connection with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;5G home internet service announcement&lt;/a&gt;. “And if you’re an existing T-Mobile postpaid customer — including all former Sprint customers — still on a limited data plan, you’re covered, too. You’re getting an upgrade to unlimited. For free,” reads the announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DfngR1"&gt;T-Mobile is making a substantial push to sign up new subscribers and get more existing ones onto its 5G network, and today’s announcements mark some of its most aggressive marketing yet with its offer of free phones and free unlimited plan upgrades. Of course, as with many carrier deals like these, there’s the fine print. For the trade-up promotion to the Samsung A32 5G, for example, T-Mobile says “you get a free 5G smartphone after 24 monthly bill credits and pay only the sales tax,” so it’s important to keep that in mind when considering a promotion to switch networks and trade in an old device. &lt;/p&gt;
