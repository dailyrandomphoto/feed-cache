    <title>Dear wireless carriers: the 5G hype needs to stop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kf0ie2OmFi9vJERCQ2Xnrr77vzc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69206320/VRG_ILLO_4037_5G_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4yHhZ4"&gt;Just stop. Stop telling us why your 5G network is the very best and fastest and most reliable. Stop running commercials about how life-changing your 5G network is. Definitely stop telling us why your 5G network is better than the other guy’s 5G network because can you &lt;em&gt;even imagine&lt;/em&gt; building a 5G network the way they have? Please stop with all of this, it’s been a very long year and we’re tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsUxd7"&gt;It would be one thing to make all of these fantastical claims like you do if any of them reflected any real person’s experience. They don’t. Your 5G networks are just not that good yet. They’ll get better, and that’s nice! But please stop pretending like the 5G train has pulled into the station and all we have to do is get on board to be whisked away to the low-latency, Gigabit future when you’re still building the tracks. And the train station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZrRbfP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;please stop pretending like the 5G train has pulled into the station&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9NUTGe"&gt;We’re tired of false starts. First there was 5G Evolution, which sounds exciting. It rhymes with revolution! But then it turned out to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277484/att-fake-5g-e-network-lte-study"&gt;just another name for LTE&lt;/a&gt;, which was a bummer. Then there was mmWave, which you called Ultra Wideband because it sounds cooler. It will drive cars, do surgeries, fly drones, you said. You’ll experience download speeds on your phone so astoundingly fast that your sunglasses will fly off your face just being so close. And sure enough, the speed was impressive, that one time we were on the right street corner trying to download a whole movie. But then the crosswalk signal turned green and we kept walking, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326857/verizon-5g-ads-coverage-speeds-nationwide-misleading-nad-tv"&gt;we lost the signal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNpLJv"&gt;Now we learn that Ultra Wideband suddenly means mmWave &lt;em&gt;and C-band&lt;/em&gt;, and that C-band will actually change everything and we’ll &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324345/verizon-c-band-5g-unlimited-plans"&gt;have to pay more if we want to use it&lt;/a&gt;. This is confusing, we’re tired, and now we have to go look for our sunglasses. So please let us know when you’ve settled on whatever frequencies will actually change our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="cDCA3F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Just build the network and we’ll see for ourselves if it really is great&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ngHBpI"&gt;We know you’re excited about how you’re building your 5G network, but please don’t explain to us in detail &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fthe-current-state-of-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F29%2F22409675%2Fverizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;why your spectrum is the best spectrum&lt;/a&gt; and the other guy’s spectrum is garbage. You sound like a kid who wrote a PowerPoint presentation for her parents with a point-by-point argument for why she deserves a later bedtime. We, the general phone-using population, do not care to be dragged into these details. Just build the network and we’ll see for ourselves if it really is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="721s6X"&gt;You’ve spent a lot of time recently &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-reports-strong-start-2021-company-accelerates-5g-growth" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;breathlessly telling your shareholders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Ft-mobile-further-solidifies-5g-leadership-position-with-successful-c-band-auction&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F29%2F22409675%2Fverizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;why you won the C-band auction&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve been scraping the bottom of the barrel on live sports entertainment over the last year, but last time we checked, a federal spectrum auction is not the Super Bowl! Nobody’s keeping score! Unless you’re playing &lt;a href="https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Calvinball"&gt;Calvinball&lt;/a&gt;, you can’t declare something to be a sport, run around the field, then put on a referee uniform and say that you won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="XR5TIx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We all just want our phone service to work when we need it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSNlN9"&gt;This may come as a shock, but we don’t cheer for our wireless carriers as if they were baseball teams. We don’t trash-talk our friends about how our carrier’s 5G network is &lt;em&gt;absolutely crushing&lt;/em&gt; their carrier’s 5G network. We don’t ask them how they can live with themselves knowing that their carrier is building their 5G network the &lt;em&gt;wrong way&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2GP4x8"&gt;We all just want our phone service to work when we need it. We want to tweet our stupid tweets, share our dumb pet photos, follow our actual baseball teams, and do so with as little inconvenience as possible. Sure, we want faster service! But we don’t want to know how the sausage is made. Please stop for now and let us know when you’re ready to serve it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUhMa5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEAu9i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish chairman calls T-Mobile the ‘Grinch’ for going back on merger promises</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XcfFIuBT76j5-Jaypf0loEG6YDM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69206248/acastro_200804_1777_dish_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HgTetD"&gt;Today’s Dish Network Q1 earnings call took an unexpected turn into Whoville when chairman Charlie Ergen compared T-Mobile to the Grinch. The comparison came up when discussing the “Uncarrier’s” decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;go ahead with its CDMA shutdown&lt;/a&gt;, a move that will potentially see millions of Dish’s Boost Mobile customers losing service at the beginning of next year. Ergen made no secret what he thinks of the move: “They’ve become the Grinch.” He went on to add, “the Uncarrier’s become the uncaring carrier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1NEEk"&gt;Dish Network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;acquired Boost as a condition of the Sprint / T-Mobile merger&lt;/a&gt; with the intention of positioning Dish to take Sprint’s place as the US’s fourth wireless carrier. A year later, the company faces a major setback following T-Mobile’s announcement that it plans to shut down the CDMA network many Boost customers use by the beginning of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OD6CX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Uncarrier’s become the uncaring carrier”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XKmjWh"&gt;Dish has issued statements warning that the consequences to its business would be dire, and &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/dish-california-regulators-t-mobile-inquiry-reopen-9d87c61c-8349-440c-97eb-8cde807ba9bf.html"&gt;recently asked&lt;/a&gt; the California Public Utilities Commission reopen its investigation of the merger. The company’s wireless business hasn’t been looking rosy even without considering the impending shutdown; it continued to lose subscribers with a net decrease of 161,000 last quarter, which is around half of the 363,000 it lost in the previous quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kP87p"&gt;Ergen has previously voiced his disappointment in the timing of the shutdown, calling it anti-competitive, but he went a step further on this morning’s investor call with his Grinch metaphor, describing T-Mobile’s move as “heartless.” But he puts a hopeful spin on the metaphor, noting that the Grinch ended up giving back all of the toys he took from the Whos, and his heart grew three sizes that day. Ergen says the comparison was inspired by recently reading the book to his granddaughter, and that rather than the character’s trademark green color, he “kept seeing a magenta Grinch.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen is being investigated for its ‘Voltswagen’ stunt</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/glcWStUI1bVPrTL-W7Lqz6Ga8Y0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69206181/acastro_200406_1777_volkswagen_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLYDFx"&gt;The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating Volkswagen’s “Voltswagen” debacle to see how the stunt affected the automaker’s stock price, and whether it broke any securities laws, &lt;a href="https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/volkswagen-und-voltswagen-us-boersenaufsicht-prueftaprilscherz-a-9feeafe6-0002-0001-0000-000177330665"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Der Spiegel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCyuYD"&gt;The faux rebranding took place on March 29th, when Volkswagen’s American subsidiary “accidentally” published a draft press release about changing its name to Voltswagen in a nod to the larger company’s push into electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7EcfO"&gt;After some news outlets reported on that apparently errant admission, the company followed up with an official press release on March 30th, which included quotes from Volkswagen of America CEO Scott Keogh claiming the change was really happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHLA10"&gt;Ultimately, the stunt turned out to be a poorly telegraphed (and early) April Fools’ joke, and multiple news outlets — including the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; — said that Volkswagen of America representatives lied and told them the name change was really happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Af4ux"&gt;Volkswagen’s stock price increased &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-31/volkswagen-should-leave-the-jokes-to-someone-funny"&gt;as much as 12.5 percent at one point&lt;/a&gt;, the equivalent of billions of dollars of market value. It’s unclear what the SEC is specifically interested in learning about, or what laws VW could have even broken in the first place. But the agency has previously come after Tesla CEO Elon Musk for tweeting things that turned out not to be true about his company, and Volkswagen has &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/volkswagen-ag-agrees-plead-guilty-and-pay-43-billion-criminal-and-civil-penalties-six"&gt;a well-documented history of lying to regulators in the US&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia has reinstated its RTX 3060 Ethereum cryptocurrency mining limit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LMtZfFyNiohdNqB3M4DVDTqQdx8=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69206014/shollister_200224_4441_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bV5wpZ"&gt;Nvidia is trying again to limit the use of its RTX 3060 graphics cards for mining Ethereum, with a new update once again adding a hash limiter to the GPU, &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-reintroduces-geforce-rtx-3060-cryptomining-hash-limiter"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;VideoCardz.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwzCfR"&gt;If that sounds familiar to you, that’s because it’s not the first time that Nvidia has tried to nerf mining performance on the RTX 3060 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289154/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;the company first rolled out&lt;/a&gt; new drivers that were intended to limit the hash rate of Ethereum mining by around 50 percent in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LF1CeQ"&gt;“We designed GeForce GPUs for gamers, and gamers are clamoring for more,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/02/18/geforce-cmp/"&gt;says Matt Wuebbling&lt;/a&gt;, head of global GeForce marketing at Nvidia, in a blog post announcing the change. The company also announced a new product, the Nvidia CMP (Cryptocurrency Mining Processor), a dedicated GPU meant specifically for cryptocurrency mining. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkaBpr"&gt;However, that update was short-lived, with Nvidia managing to accidentally unlock its own limit in a beta driver released in March, undoing its previous work. Nvidia would go on to confirm that the new driver was a mistake, but it was already too late — the updated driver was out in the wild, and RTX 3060 owners were able to download it and avoid the new restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRs1TT"&gt;The new GeForce 466.27 driver, though, brings back the original limit and notes that it’ll be required for all future RTX 3060 cards starting in May. Nvidia may be looking to add hash rate limits to other cards, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkcSPH"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-geforce-rtx-30-lite-hash-rate-series-to-begin-shipping-mid-may"&gt;separate &lt;em&gt;VideoCardz.com&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; notes that the company is working on an updated version of “LHR” (Lite Hash Rate) GPUs across the other RTX 30-series cards (including the RTX 3060 Ti, 3070, and 3080 models), in order to help discourage cryptocurrency miners from snapping up the limited stock before gaming-focused customers can. Only the top-of-the-line RTX 3090 may be exempt, as the $1,500 price tag already makes it of limited value for mining tasks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the video game S.T.A.L.K.E.R. inspired a wave of real-world Chernobyl tourists</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XkIigzUvekYJZB_wHXGa1bpgbNM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69205864/acastro_210427_4562_0001_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A virtual world leads to IRL excursions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="iCS23u"&gt;At the entrance to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in Ukraine, 35 years on from the worst nuclear disaster in history, a yellow souvenir van sells T-shirts, key rings, and glow-in-the-dark “Chernobyl condoms,” all branded with gas mask symbols or stylized radiation warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVnELa"&gt;They sell hot dogs and coffee. There’s “Chernobyl ice cream,” advertised by colorful signs reminiscent of the Raygun Gothic style of atomic-era Americana. As I join the other tourists and queue for a coffee, speakers play “I Don’t Want To Set The World On Fire” by The Ink Spots, a track lifted straight from the soundtrack of &lt;em&gt;Fallout 3&lt;/em&gt;. By the time I finish my drink I’m listening to Doris Day croon: “Again… this couldn’t happen again / This is that once in a lifetime / This is the thrill divine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCtajD"&gt;In May 2019, HBO’s miniseries &lt;em&gt;Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; became an unprecedented hit. The real Chernobyl Zone saw a record number of 124,000 visitors that year, and many commentators suggested the HBO show had caused a sudden Chernobyl tourism boom. In reality, though, queues at the Chernobyl checkpoint had been growing at a consistent rate for a decade prior — and the touristification of Chernobyl owed at least as much to video games as it did to television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgWFlA"&gt;In 2007, two games were released that imprinted Chernobyl into the minds of a whole generation of gamers. In the West, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare &lt;/em&gt;was a blockbuster. It featured a stealth mission titled “All Ghillied Up,” which was set in Pripyat, the abandoned workers’ city that stands alongside the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. The mission opens with panoramic shots of Pripyat’s deserted housing blocks, while a voiceover intones: “50,000 people used to live here. Now it’s a ghost town.” This Chernobyl setting lent &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; a new dimension of danger and intrigue; it created a strong visual impression, although, really, the gameplay that followed could have been located practically anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oA6Uec"&gt;The same cannot be said for &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qvO1cgY0hmNBD8ekW4-xNFZuCKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475149/0000002184.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ShTgvD"&gt;Ukrainian studio GSC Game World released &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R&lt;/em&gt;.: &lt;em&gt;Shadow of Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; the same year &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty 4&lt;/em&gt; came out, but while both featured first-person shooter gameplay set in Chernobyl, in &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&lt;/em&gt;’s case it was more than just stage dressing. &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R&lt;/em&gt;. introduced players to a world in which the landscape — the mysterious “Zone” — became a character in its own right. This was partly the result of an innovative global AI system that created the sense of a living, breathing world: non-player characters would interact, fight, strum guitars, or fend off packs of rabid dogs, with or without the player being present. Immersion was heightened by the lack of a fast travel option, forcing players to spend an awful lot of time looking at the ever-changing scenery. But the personification of &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&lt;/em&gt;’s terrain ran deeper still, as it was rooted in the game’s mythos, which tapped into older ideas from Soviet-era science fiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnfS4V"&gt;Andrei Tarkovsky’s 1979 film &lt;em&gt;Stalker&lt;/em&gt; was a dreamlike meditation on desire and ruination, in which an almost shamanic figure, known as “Stalker,” leads two tourists through the post-industrial landscapes of a mysterious, sentient Zone to find the Room at its center where a visitor’s wishes could be granted. However, &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&lt;/em&gt; shares more DNA with &lt;em&gt;Roadside Picnic&lt;/em&gt;, the 1972 novel by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky, which inspired Tarkovsky’s film. The protagonist of &lt;em&gt;Roadside Picnic &lt;/em&gt;is just one of many stalkers. In the wake of some unexplained extraterrestrial event, areas of the Earth’s surface have been contaminated by alien energies. These areas are evacuated to form military-guarded “Zones,” and the “stalkers” are the scavengers who venture illegally inside to hunt for valuable alien artifacts left scattered across this strange and toxic landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QgMdhv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Chernobyl gave us that rich atmosphere, and huge lore possibilities.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uBlVSj"&gt;To adapt this world for the medium of games, GSC Game World gave their stalkers assault rifles, created rival factions, and populated the wasteland with corrupted wildlife: mutated dogs, boars, and worse. The Zone of the game borrows the novel’s alien “anomalies” — invisible traps that shoot jets of flame or catapult unwary travelers into the sky — and at the center, as in both the book and the film, lies the mysterious promise of a “Wish Granter.” But the developers also made the bold decision of placing this literary Zone inside Ukraine’s own real-life Exclusion Zone: the 1,000-square mile region of evacuated farms and villages that surrounds the Chernobyl Plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqdFsL"&gt;I asked GSC Game World’s PR manager, Zakhar Bocharov, how that decision came about. “Several locations were considered for the game,” he explains, “but Chernobyl just clicked at a certain point as the perfect setting for this story. It was the decision of Sergiy Grygorovych, the game’s director, and then everything came together around that idea. Chernobyl gave us that rich atmosphere, and huge lore possibilities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzbPBc"&gt;Long before the game, the fictional works of Tarkovsky and the Strugatskys had sometimes been described as seeming almost prophetic of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, and the real-life Zone that was established in its wake. &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&lt;/em&gt; was born into a narrative space already carved out by urban myths and conspiracy theories. “Our core team is Ukrainian, so everything that happened at Chernobyl was very familiar and personal for us,” says Bocharov. “The idea of telling a story in this space came organically — just with certain tweaks, like an altered history and sci-fi elements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWqy9x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; was a phenomenal success: it earned critical acclaim around the world and sold a reported 2 million copies in its first year. A prequel (&lt;em&gt;Clear Sky&lt;/em&gt;) and sequel (&lt;em&gt;Call of Pripyat&lt;/em&gt;) soon followed. These games built a cult following, particularly in Eastern Europe. They inspired live-action roleplay events, themed airsoft tournaments, and festivals such as the &lt;a href="http://stalker-fest.com/photo.php?fbclid=IwAR2HacGIJGZj2mu3QJA4YVs-rg5IK0YHa9izoNXQO069Lw4_OJYuqqo3vL4"&gt;2009 &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&lt;/em&gt; Fest&lt;/a&gt; in Kyiv. It was only a matter of time before the game’s influence reached Chernobyl itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dmum1H-_8muT169TQNCAQwXSEPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475153/0000002185.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S34Rkh"&gt;In 2019, I interviewed Yaroslav Yemelianenko, the co-founder of Chernobyl Tour, one of the dozen or so companies that offer trips inside the Chernobyl Zone. He told me how his own interest in Chernobyl started with &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.…&lt;/em&gt; and then, realizing that the “real Zone” could be visited just nearby, he joined a tour to Pripyat. By 2008, he had established his own company, and one of their early offerings was a &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&lt;/em&gt;-themed tour visiting locations from the game. The souvenir van at the entrance to the Zone belongs to Chernobyl Tour, too. Whereas the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was once exclusively controlled by Soviet-style bureaucrats, there is a sense now that a new generation is taking over — and increasingly, they offer a Chernobyl experience that delivers on expectations set by pop culture references. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYPhjl"&gt;However, not all &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&lt;/em&gt; fans are looking for that group tour experience. Stepan (who, for privacy, prefers not to use his full name) is one of a growing number of young Ukrainians who visit the Chernobyl Zone illegally. Many call themselves “stalkers.” On his trips, Stepan carries food and water, a first-aid kit, and a cheap radiation meter he purchased online. He says it takes him three days to hike from the Zone’s perimeter fence to Pripyat, a journey that mirrors the player’s progress through the game world of &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.. &lt;/em&gt;Just like Yemelianenko, Stepan’s interest in the real Zone started with the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fwz4hv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It felt more real than other games I had played.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8XE09w"&gt;“When &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&lt;/em&gt; came out, it was something really new and exciting for me. Not just because it was set in my country… but also because it felt more real than other games I had played. I wasn’t some magical hero, or ‘chosen one,’ you know? Just some random guy, taking on a big hostile world. I could relate to that.” Stepan adds, however, that he abandoned the game after becoming a real stalker. “Playing &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&lt;/em&gt; made me curious to see these places in real life. But now that I know the real Zone, I can’t imagine going back to the game’s version.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qlv7ml"&gt;Chernobyl Tour believes that with the right marketing and itineraries, it can tempt &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&lt;/em&gt; fans to join its groups instead. Its chief deputy Kateryna Aslamova explains: “In many cases, people enter illegally to visit places they can’t see on regular tours. Occasionally, I have ex-stalkers on my tours ... now, with all the choice we offer, they realize there’s no longer a reason to go illegally.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DdkjYn"&gt;But Stepan is not convinced. “Firstly, the legal entry fees are a little more difficult when you’re earning Ukrainian wages,” he says. “But mainstream tourism will never capture the feeling of exploring the wild Zone. When I go there, I want to hear the forest … to be alone with my thoughts in a place beyond the noise and rules of normal life. To be completely responsible for my own fate. This is a really unique and special experience … you would never get this on a legal tour, surrounded by people, buses, guides, and souvenir shops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRiXRi"&gt;Other guides take a more agnostic approach toward the activities of illegal tourists, believing there’s space for stalkers and tour companies to coexist in the Zone. Yevhen Chkalov was a junior game designer on &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&lt;/em&gt;, whose responsibilities included developing and scripting some of the game’s side missions. Nowadays he leads tours in the real Chernobyl Zone and runs the online fan community Bar Apocalypse, which caters to &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&lt;/em&gt; and two of its offspring, the &lt;em&gt;Metro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Survarium &lt;/em&gt;franchises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYRHIy"&gt;“Stalking and tourism are two sides of the same coin,” Chkalov tells me. “Some visitors want the extreme experience and full atmosphere … others just want to see the Zone without all the hard work. I used to be a stalker myself, just like many other legal guides were. I have a good relationship with the stalkers now. They recommend my services to those who can’t manage the long hike. And I send them the people who don’t feel satisfied by what’s offered on the legal experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hBsfz-rOgK-3pN18sCFdN3cJZ2U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475156/0000002189.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6Osh5J"&gt;There were stalkers in the Zone before 2007, but &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&lt;/em&gt; gave them a shared identity — the basis of a subculture — and Chkalov says the majority of stalkers today were inspired by the games. Though some are in for a surprise: “They play some games and decide they want to try this experience in real life … but then they find out that hiking for days and days is a little harder than just pressing the ‘W’ button. It’s serious physical activity. That’s why so many stalkers surrender themselves to the police.” At present, the penalty for being caught in the Zone illegally is the equivalent of a $20 fine, after which the authorities typically drive the trespassers back to the police station in Ivankiv, a town outside the perimeter fence. “In the Zone, we call this ‘the taxi to Ivankiv,’” Chkalov jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBAPmf"&gt;In 2018, I decided to join one of these stalker trips. A Ukrainian guide led us chest-deep through a river to enter the Zone, then for four days we hiked through wild, wooded landscapes between run-down villages and the shells of former farms and factories. The parallels to &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. &lt;/em&gt;were&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;occasionally quite surreal. Inventory management was a serious issue, our backpacks stuffed with first-aid kits, bread and salamis, just like in the game. We couldn’t carry all the water we’d need, but our stalker guide had his friends hide supply stashes ahead of us, for which they shared a list of coordinates. It became a kind of orienteering mission, always hiking toward the next stash pinned on our electronic maps. When we finally reached Pripyat on the fourth night; the experience of stepping out of forest and into a whole deserted city was just as exhilarating and cathartic a reward as it was to reach the virtual Pripyat after hours of wandering through &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&lt;/em&gt;’s version of this Zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p4Y8MyAE7ZIvIgwu7V9ekR6PT5o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475158/stalker2_conceptart_verge_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Concept art for &lt;/em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2NwpwK"&gt;It is easy to see why so many former gamers have joined the ranks of the real-life stalkers since 2007: this feels like the ultimate live-action roleplay experience, a true physical immersion into the game’s world, complete with many of the dangers that entails. Zakhar Bocharov tells me that while GSC Game World appreciates &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&lt;/em&gt;’s passionate fan base, the developers themselves do not endorse illegal tourism in the real Zone. He stresses the many dangers and says the company would always recommend visitors to join a legal tour instead. Though he also acknowledges, “our words would hardly change anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Up6X9h"&gt;With &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&lt;/em&gt; scheduled to release in 2021, the developers have lately been spending more time in Chernobyl themselves. “The Zone is changing constantly,” says Bocharov. “Our core team visits every couple of months, or even more often. Sometimes it’s for photogrammetry work, and sometimes just for inspiration. &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&lt;/em&gt; will include new locations along with the old ones — in a seamless open world for the first time in the series.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fcOZ6q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Zone is changing constantly.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L6x0qI"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&lt;/em&gt; came out in 2007, Ukraine didn’t even recognize Chernobyl as a tourism destination. Security was far less stringent than it is today, and the Zone was a playground for looters and poachers, stalkers and bandits — “a symbol of corruption,” &lt;a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/glava-derzhavi-pidpisav-ukaz-shodo-rozvitku-chornobilskoyi-z-56321"&gt;according to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&lt;/a&gt;. But the real and virtual Zones are gradually diverging and in 2019, Zelenskyy signed a decree for the development of the territory, promising to create “a green corridor for tourists,” while stamping out corruption. “We must give this territory of Ukraine a new life,” he stated, during a visit to the Zone. “Until now, Chernobyl was a negative part of Ukraine’s brand. It’s time to change it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9wwcX"&gt;From the state’s perspective, the stalkers are very much a part of that old image. In September 2020, the Verkhovna Rada — Ukraine’s parliament — was presented &lt;a href="http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?pf3511=70061"&gt;a proposal for amendments to the law concerning trespassing in the Chernobyl Zone&lt;/a&gt;. If passed, this bill would upgrade stalking from an administrative offense to a criminal offense under Ukrainian law. The current $20 fee for a “taxi to Ivankiv” would increase by a factor of a hundred and be backed by the threat of jail time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xzxjt2"&gt;Sitting at the Chernobyl checkpoint with my coffee, I watch five minibuses and two coaches roll past into the Zone. The recent upgrade from analog printed checklists to a digital barcoded ticketing system has dramatically increased the rate at which visitors can be admitted. As video game soundtracks play in the background, one group stops to shop for souvenirs; they’re Polish tourists, and four of them are wearing &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&lt;/em&gt; T-shirts. This regulated, streamlined new version of Chernobyl tourism is better for business, it’s better for Ukraine, and it means that by the time &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&lt;/em&gt; arrives, any would-be trespassers are going to find it harder than ever to access the Zone. Nevertheless, Yevhen Chkalov predicts that the stalkers won’t be giving up anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="9wC3vP"&gt;“There was an illegal tourism boom directly after the success of the first game,” he points out. “When &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 &lt;/em&gt;releases, you can expect another wave.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first trailer for Netflix’s Sweet Tooth introduces a post-apocalyptic fairytale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WDXj1uYSWl55YPchPQw03s6kbXI=/0x0:1298x865/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69205660/Screen_Shot_2021_04_29_at_8.49.30_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wcev64"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt;, a new Netflix series based on the DC comic, will debut on the streaming service on June 4th, according to a new teaser trailer that premiered Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTVjNM"&gt;Here’s a brief description of the show, &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81221380"&gt;from Netflix&lt;/a&gt;: “On a perilous adventure across a post-apocalyptic world, a lovable boy who’s half-human and half-deer searches for a new beginning with a gruff protector.” The trailer, which &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GrBw0pbF11s"&gt;you can watch here&lt;/a&gt; or at the top of this post, shows that Gus, the half-human / half-deer boy, isn’t the only human / animal hybrid in this world — I’m pretty sure I spotted a girl with a pig’s snout. And I have to say that by the end, I was already rooting hard for Gus and getting mad at anyone who would dare threaten him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2zsaT"&gt;The eight-episode series is based on a DC comic created by Jeff Lemire, which ran from 2009 through 2013. The show counts Susan Downey and Robert Downey Jr. among its executive producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTRfmJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will spend $5 million paying reporters to join its local news platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eUg5LU-hRSh_oIZOk0LzjIHnNrM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69205577/akrales_180614_1777_0121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7VKMzD"&gt;Facebook says it will spend $5 million paying local journalists on a new publishing platform. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-pay-5-mln-local-journalists-newsletter-push-2021-04-29/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported the news&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, saying independent journalists could begin applying for the program today. The company is prioritizing reporters in areas without an existing news source — sometimes called “news deserts” — who plan to cover “Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian or other audiences of color.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kmux53"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/formedia/supporting-independent-voices"&gt;announced its new local news platform&lt;/a&gt; last month. The platform includes a self-publishing tool that lets reporters launch newsletters and charge for subscriptions, as well as integration with existing features like Facebook pages and groups. &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports that Facebook will strike multiyear deals with selected journalists, who can earn more money through subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQn7uj"&gt;Last month, Facebook called the platform an option for “independent local journalists who are often the lone voice covering a given community.” It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255876/facebook-newsletter-tools-independent-journalists-writers-substack-revue"&gt;also competing&lt;/a&gt; with other self-publishing platforms — particularly newsletter provider Substack. Substack &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/substack-local/"&gt;launched a $1 million initiative&lt;/a&gt; called Substack Local in mid-April, saying it would select up to 30 local news reporters to receive one-year advances of up to $100,000. (Like higher-profile Substack Pro writers, these reporters will give up most of their subscription revenue for that year.) Applications for Substack Local close today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESagsn"&gt;Facebook announced &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/local-news-investment-diversity-entrepreneurship"&gt;a $5 million investment&lt;/a&gt; in local news programs last year. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20930664/facebook-news-tab-launch-united-states-test"&gt;paid national news outlets&lt;/a&gt; to publish content on its social network. But with this effort, it’s building something closer to an in-house news platform, rather than working with big outlets that have an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299229/facebook-one-billion-investment-news-industry-australia-google-regulation"&gt;often ambivalent relationship&lt;/a&gt; to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch Series 6 is $249 now at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The blood oxygen animation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dqFRVtWs7Wj7FD9DSYpZHaRqxcU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204449/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UXw07U"&gt;Best Buy &lt;s&gt;and Amazon are&lt;/s&gt; is offering the 40mm Apple Watch Series 6 (GPS) &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739141156798835428#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $249&lt;/a&gt;, smashing yesterday’s discounted price of $299. This model normally sold for $399, and today’s price drop makes it more affordable than — and superior to — the Apple Watch SE that costs $279. The one downside to this promo is that it only loops in the Product Red model that’s all red, which might not go with your look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RDawh"&gt;At this price, it’s currently about $80 more than 38mm-sized Apple Watch Series 3, yet it provides a sizable boost in power and capabilities. For one, the Series 6 has more internal storage. A few other perks of this discounted watch include its always-on display that’s surprisingly efficient, and its ability to take blood oxygen readings. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438413/apple-watch-series-6-se-5-3-comparison-smartwatch-models-versus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can see all of the differences here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNKVDl"&gt;This deal is lasting until later today, April 29th. A couple of &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffers noticed that Best Buy has stock available for pick-up at their local stores, but it’s no longer available for shipping. Since publishing this story earlier, Amazon has sold out of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rm1PYD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MVmcSY"&gt;Other deals you should know about today include Woot’s one-day sale on the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds. These keep dropping in price, and this deal is the best yet. If you use the Woot mobile app (&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/woot/id571457538?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;amp;itscg=30200&amp;amp;at=1001l7uV&amp;amp;ct=TheVerge&amp;amp;ls=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.woot.android.main&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;) to buy them and have Amazon Prime, you’ll get 10 percent off the order. So, instead of paying $170 (which matches the lowest price we’d seen up to this point), you’ll pay just $153 before tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sV9OOv"&gt;If you don’t want to jump through those hoops, here’s the link to its site where you can get them for $170.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J4tBBc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The NYPD is sending its controversial robot dog back to the pound</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hc68wL59t4pwcNQZJLJbYFUDf6k=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69205101/robot_dog.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NggoCE"&gt;The New York Police Department has canceled its trial of a robot dog made by US firm Boston Dynamics after receiving fierce criticism regarding the “dystopian” technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuLiFN"&gt;“The contract has been terminated and the dog will be returned,” a spokesperson for the NYPD &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/04/28/nypds-robot-dog-will-be-returned-after-outrage/"&gt;told&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;John Miller, the department’s deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/nyregion/nypd-robot-dog-backlash.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the machine was “a casualty of politics, bad information and cheap sound bytes.” Said Miller: “People had figured out the catchphrases and the language to somehow make this evil.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUltMn"&gt;The NYPD began leasing the machine nicknamed Digidog last year. “This dog is going to save lives, protect people, and protect officers and that’s our goal,” said the NYPD’s Frank Digiacomo in an interview &lt;a href="https://abc7ny.com/exclusive-nypds-new-robot-dog/8669769/"&gt;with ABC7&lt;/a&gt;. The robot was deployed roughly half a dozen times during its tenure, mostly acting as a mobile camera in potentially hostile environments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CcuUKE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The robot dog was deployed roughly half a dozen times, mostly as mobile surveillance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AB5BwH"&gt;“The NYPD has been using robots since the 1970s to save lives in hostage situations &amp;amp; hazmat incidents,” said the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NYPDnews/status/1365083501989609477"&gt;department&lt;/a&gt; in February. “This model of robot is being tested to evaluate its capabilities against other models in use by our emergency service unit and bomb squad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6z4wc"&gt;Many, though, saw the robot as a symbol of both wasteful police spending and increasingly aggressive tactics being deployed by law enforcement. “Now robotic surveillance ground drones are being deployed for testing on low-income communities of color with under-resourced schools,” tweeted NYC Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="htLtpk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Please ask yourself: when was the last time you saw next-generation, world class technology for education, healthcare, housing, etc consistently prioritized for underserved communities like this?&lt;/p&gt;— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1365023067769098245?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bFitD1"&gt;In response to outcry over the machine, New York City Council Member Ben Kallos proposed a law that would ban the police from owning or operating weaponized robots. “I don’t think anyone was anticipating that they’d actually be used by the NYPD right now,” Kallos &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/new-york-lawmaker-wants-ban-police-armed-robots/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. ”I have no problem with using a robot to defuse a bomb, but it has to be the right use of a tool and the right type of circumstance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jI85Wi"&gt;Kallos told the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;this week that deploying Digidog on the streets of New York City highlighted the ongoing “militarization of the police.” Said Kallos: “At a time where we should be having more beat cops on the street, building relationships with residents, they’re actually headed in another direction in trying to replace them with robots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MiQ0PH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Around 500 Spot units are in use, mainly in industrial settings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FlEYDW"&gt;Spot, as the machine is called by creators Boston Dynamics, has never been weaponized, and doing so would break the company’s terms of service. But it is being deployed in increasingly controversial situations. Although the company has currently sold or leases around 500 Spot units, with most of the robots being used in commercial and industrial settings, such machines are of increasing interest to both law enforcement and military users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oybyg"&gt;Earlier this month, it emerged that the French military has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371590/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-military-exercises-french-army"&gt;testing Spot in combat exercises&lt;/a&gt;. Boston Dynamics told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time that while it knew the robot was being leased to the army, it was unaware it was being used in these exact scenarios. Spot was not weaponized in these exercises but used by soldiers for forward surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KaqRGi"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, a spokesperson for Boston Dynamics said, “We support local communities reviewing the allocation of public funds, and believe Spot is a cost-effective tool comparable to historical robotic devices used by public safety to inspect hazardous environments.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘It’s time’: Blue Origin teases ticket sales for its New Shepard rocket  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos Introduces The Blue Origin&amp;amp;nbsp;New Shepard&amp;amp;nbsp;System" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QBHl44RVaL_FawJEFeDi6iy2UGk=/0x0:4908x3272/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204960/665033922.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tlKkr1"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is finally getting ready to sell tickets for seats on its suborbital New Shepard rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdhI71"&gt;No details on price or timelines yet, but the company tweeted a video on Thursday featuring a cowboy-hat-wearing Jeff Bezos driving an electric Rivian truck through the Texas desert right after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383407/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-new-shepard-launch-first-crewed-flight"&gt;Blue Origin’s 15th New Shepard test flight&lt;/a&gt; on April 14th. “Guys, how exciting is this, c’mon,” he said before stepping out to inspect the company’s crew capsule, which had just landed under parachutes (without a crew inside).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="siEv6i"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s time. You can buy the very first seat on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NewShepard?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NewShepard&lt;/a&gt;. Sign up to learn how at &lt;a href="https://t.co/XNq9WALA7u"&gt;https://t.co/XNq9WALA7u&lt;/a&gt;. Details coming May 5th. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GradatimFerociter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GradatimFerociter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/K9jugCs9yz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/K9jugCs9yz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Blue Origin (@blueorigin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1387763989917151234?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vYuYZo"&gt;Blue Origin’s tweet included a &lt;a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to an application on its website that urged visitors to “SIGN UP TO LEARN HOW YOU CAN BUY THE VERY FIRST SEAT ON NEW SHEPARD,” asking for a full name, email, and phone number. An announcement will come May 5th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FBXMo"&gt;The five-story-tall New Shepard rocket is designed to launch a crew capsule with seats for six roughly 340,000 feet into the sky toward the edge of space. Paying tourists can experience a few minutes of weightlessness in microgravity and witness super high-altitude views of Earth. After separating from the crew capsule midair, the rocket booster returns for a vertical landing, and minutes later the crew capsule also descends back to land under a set of parachutes for a soft touchdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwsxVu"&gt;New Shepard’s last uncrewed test flight was “a verification step for the vehicle and operations prior to flying astronauts,” Blue Origin said at the time, dropping subtle hints that its next flight might include astronauts. But very few details about the company’s commercial spaceflight plans — including cost and timing — are available to date.&lt;/p&gt;
