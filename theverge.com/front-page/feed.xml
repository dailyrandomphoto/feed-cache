    <title>Discord is making it easier to find interesting social audio rooms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RevZ9Rn5n57c_7sAEwc1NVymOZA=/188x0:1313x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69280669/Discord_IAP_KeyVisuals_Header_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uMAq3s"&gt;Thursday is Discord’s sixth birthday, and to celebrate, the company is announcing some new features — including one coming in June to help people discover its new Clubhouse-like social audio rooms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;called Stage Channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3fUSG"&gt;The new “Stage Discovery” feature will let you see a feed of public Stage Channels you might be interested in that’s curated using machine learning. You can listen to a Stage Channel’s audio right from the feed, and if you want, you can then hop into the room so that you can be part of the audience. While in a public room, you might also see a link to join the Discord server where the Stage Channel is being hosted if you want to join the community that’s hosting the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GrfZwl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10495334"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G3VME7"&gt;Once Stage Discovery has rolled out, which Discord tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will happen on June 1st, you’ll be able to access the feed via a new Stage Channels icon found on the main toolbar in the mobile app and in the Home menu on desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOtkgs"&gt;Discord says that Stage Channels can’t use profane language in their titles or descriptions, and explicit, graphic, or sexual content is prohibited. Users can report Stage Channels that violate the rules. And to help prevent bad stuff from bubbling up the feed, the company will also enforce its policies through technology, Discord’s own trust and safety team, and community moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAkEXD"&gt;The new discovery feed isn’t the only new Stage Channels feature on the way. Discord is also working on ticketed Stage Channels, meaning hosts will be able to charge for access to a Stage Channel. They’ll be rolling out this month, first in a pilot with fewer than 50 US-based creators. A Discord spokesperson wouldn’t say if it will take a cut of ticket sales, though they noted that the company is evaluating options during the experiment. Discord &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;follows Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in announcing ticketed social audio rooms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CBjeC"&gt;And for those of you who sometimes find following Discord conversations to be overwhelming (like me), you’ll be pleased to hear that the company plans to add the ability to make threads, which should make it easier to corral conversations. Discord says threads will start rolling out this summer and will be available to all servers before the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxxFp2"&gt;Alongside the new features announced today, Discord is unveiling a new brand identity with a slightly tweaked logo (which, if you didn’t know, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/discord/status/843764258810814465"&gt;is named Clyde&lt;/a&gt;). You can see the new logo at the top of this post or in this GIF.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AYyRafCiER5IuTA8EsBpcMU_5Y0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22508348/Discord_IAP_KeyVisuals_Header_01.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uL2ScF"&gt;Discord, which was originally built as a place for gamers to hang out and talk, has grown significantly during the pandemic, particularly as many non-gaming communities have started to use the service. The company revealed that it now has more than 150 million monthly active users, up from 140 million &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/17/discord-raises-100-million-as-its-social-hub-hits-140-million-users/"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to choose the right printer for your home office</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="hp deskjet printer-cb-HP" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fGt91yOtBxqZd21mak3jRxZoBOU=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66913848/DeskJet_3755_home_office.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fTZRSG"&gt;The need for a home / office printer has increased as more of us are working or schooling from home. You could be a parent who needs to print out workbooks for your child. Or you may find that it’s easier to make notes on a business report using a pen or pencil rather than a keyboard. Or you’ve suddenly discovered that a government office is demanding that you snail mail a form to them. Or you’re tired of trekking to your local office supply store for printing out occasional forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrULau"&gt;Whatever the reason, if you find yourself in need of a printer, it’s not difficult to find one. Printers have not changed a lot over the past few years; they’ve just become more efficient and less expensive. You will still be choosing between laser and inkjet printers, color and black-ink-only printers, and print-only and multifunction devices. Because of all these decisions that need to be made, it’s a good idea to figure out what you want before you click “buy” at your favorite shopping site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MeqcFN"&gt;In this article, I won’t be telling you which specific printer to buy. But I will go through some of the choices you are going to be faced with and some of the features you may want to make sure you’re getting, including inkjet versus laser, multifunction versus single function, and how to decide what to buy and where to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGVhWI"&gt;So let’s start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sTGRpk"&gt;Inkjet versus laser printers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6m8xC3"&gt;If you haven’t bought a printer lately — or if you haven’t needed a printer until now — you may want a quick refresher on the difference between inkjet and laser printers. What follows is a vast simplification, but it will give you a general idea of how they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="u4alml"&gt;Inkjet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n04fvi"&gt;Inkjet printers spray tiny droplets of liquid ink onto a page. There are several types of inkjet delivery systems, but most consumer systems use separate ink cartridges, each fitted with a printhead that separates the ink into the nearly microscopic droplets. (Professional-level inkjets will usually have separate printheads that can be replaced on their own.) Colors are created by combining different colored inks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qSJmQ"&gt;The number of ink cartridges that a color inkjet printer uses varies. The least expensive printers usually use only two cartridges — one with black ink and one that contains cyan, magenta, and yellow ink. Most lower- to medium-priced inkjet printers offer four separate cartridges — cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink. More upscale printers will have a different black cartridge for text; printers used by photographers or businesses will have a wider selection of colored inks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXxvrh"&gt;But even the least expensive inkjets can end up running into serious money. The printer itself may not cost more than $50 or $100, but a single set of cartridges can cost nearly as much. And because most color inkjets will not run at all if any one of the cartridges is out of ink (for example, you can’t just print in black if the cyan cartridge runs out), you’ll need to replace any spent cartridges. (We’ll deal more with ink costs later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6zK42"&gt;There are a few inkjet printers out there known as supertank printers, which have refillable tanks that offer a lower cost per page than the traditional ink cartridges. They are sold by a few manufacturers such as &lt;a href="https://www.brother-usa.com/inkvestment-tank"&gt;Brother&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.usa.canon.com%2Fshop%2Fen%2Fcatalog%2Fprinters-all-in-ones%2Fg-series-megatank-inkjet-printers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fepson.com%2Fecotank-ink-tank-printers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Epson&lt;/a&gt; and can be a consideration if you plan to do a lot of color printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="usxWmE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10496491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4a31bH"&gt;Laser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zKVgzp"&gt;These devices use lasers to create static electricity on a rolling drum inside the printer. The static electricity attracts toner (ink in the form of powder), which is melted onto the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fKVka"&gt;While toner cartridges initially cost more than ink cartridges, they also last far longer than liquid ink; as a result, your cost per page will be less. Laser printers also tend to initially cost more than inkjet printers — but they can save money over the long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjUPwf"&gt;Laser printers have several other advantages over inkjet printers — unless you need color. They are faster than inkjets (especially low-end inkjets, which can be very slow), and the quality of their text printing is more precise (although current inkjets are certainly precise enough to suit most documents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kda4sL"&gt;Color laser printers are also more available than they used to be. However, they are more pricey, and unless they are professional-level printers, the color will not be as good as an equivalently priced color inkjet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Mge797"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10496603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NgG53g"&gt;So which should I buy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hnIqxZ"&gt;There are several other factors that you should consider before purchasing a new printer. Here are some questions to ask yourself while deciding what to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qSaci3"&gt;What am I using it for?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PaBtGE"&gt;One way to decide whether to buy a laser or an inkjet printer is to look into what you want to do with it. If color is not important to you, then it’s a no-brainer. A laser printer will be more cost-efficient and faster. But if you want to print out your kids’ computer artwork in color or print the occasional photograph, then you’re probably in the market for an inkjet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Dzf4ZV"&gt;Multifunction printers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8EIF3S"&gt;If you see yourself working from home for the foreseeable future — or even if you don’t — you may want to consider a multifunction (also known as an all-in-one or AIO) printer. These devices don’t just print from your computer, but they allow you to scan existing documents and either copy them or save them as files. (Some also let you fax a scanned document, but since faxing has become much less necessary, this feature is quickly disappearing.) They are very handy for keeping the paperwork around your home to a minimum since you can save PDFs of most of your papers (especially the ones you’ve had sitting around for years) and then dispose of the actual hard copies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLosWg"&gt;(Yes, you can use your phone’s camera to scan and upload documents, and if you only occasionally need to scan a document, that could be enough for you. However, the quality of a phone-scanned document doesn’t come up to the quality of a good scanner.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EZELv"&gt;Most consumer-level multifunctions will let you copy anything up to an 8.5 x 11-inch paper (popularly known as letter-sized), but you can also buy printers that will let you handle an 8.5 x 14-inch (legal size) paper. If you see yourself doing a lot of copying or scanning, you should look for a multifunction with an automatic document feeder (usually referred to as an ADF) that lets you move a number of pages through the system quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="RcCw64"&gt;Input and output trays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lTJ3pa"&gt;Most current printers work by pulling paper in from the front, running it around the drum or roller, and then popping it out to the output tray. However, if you’re printing on heavier stock, you don’t want to bend the paper; in that case, you may want to look for a printer that has an input tray coming from the back of the printer, so that the paper is pushed through on a straight line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGyuHK"&gt;Some printers also allow you to have more than one paper tray in front, letting you choose different colored paper, for example, or having one tray hold letter-sized paper and the other hold legal-sized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8f6S3j"&gt;You also want to know how many sheets of paper your input and output trays are capable of holding. If you plan to, say, print out a 200-page manuscript, you don’t want an output tray that is only capable of handling 50 pages, or you could find 150 of your pages strewn over your floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qdzEPd"&gt;Duplexing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f2jCES"&gt;The ability to duplex — to print on both sides of a single page — is more common than it used to be, but not all lower-priced printers include this feature. It’s very useful, especially if you do a lot of printing and want to save on the cost of paper. Of course, most printers let you print on both sides of paper by manually re-feeding the paper into the printer after the first side has been printed — but it can be a real pain in the neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OLCqoS"&gt;Price per page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2HT7QU"&gt;Without a doubt, the biggest expense for a printer isn’t the printer itself or even the paper — it’s the ink. There is a way to figure out how much a printer will cost you over the long term: calculate the cost per page by dividing the price of an ink cartridge by the cartridge’s page yield or the number of pages you’re expected to get out of each cartridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrZqtr"&gt;You can usually find the page yield among the stats published by a printer manufacturer for that printer. For example, take two multifunction printers from the same manufacturer, one a color inkjet and one a black-only laser printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lCblbL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The biggest expense for a printer isn’t the printer itself or even the paper — it’s the ink&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e209CN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hp.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-photo-7155-all-in-one-printer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;yield of the HP Envy Photo 7155 All-in-One&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-7155-Printer-Wireless-Printing/dp/B074P4ZS68/ref=sr_1_3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sells for about $180&lt;/a&gt;, is about 200 pages for a standard black ink cartridge and about 165 for its standard tri-color ink cartridge. The standard black ink cartridge &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13048831?sid=VergeChooseRightPrinter051221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2FHP-64-Black-Original-Ink-Cartridge%2Fproduct_2730291" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs about $19&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13048831?sid=VergeChoosePrinter051221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2FHP-64-Tri-Color-Original-Ink-Cartridge%2Fproduct_2730292" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;tri-color about $25&lt;/a&gt;. So that’s about 10 cents a page for the black ink and about 15 cents for the color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iv1Aee"&gt;A similarly priced black-and-white laser printer, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Laserjet-Monochrome-Two-Sided-4PA41A/dp/B07HB18C2V/ref=sr_1_9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$169&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hp.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpdp%2Fhp-laserjet-pro-mfp-m148dw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP LaserJet Pro MFP M148dw&lt;/a&gt;, cites about 1,200 pages for a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-CF294A-Black-Cartridge-LaserJet/dp/B07J2LZCPF/ref=sr_1_3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standard toner cartridge&lt;/a&gt;, at a cost of about $47. That comes out to about 4 cents a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdJFfY"&gt;So assuming that you pump out about 1,200 text-only pages in a year (and excluding the cost of the paper), that means you’ll have paid a total of $47 more for the laser printer and $114 more for the inkjet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRWOaU"&gt;One more thing to throw into the mix: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-LC3037BK-High-Yield-INKvestment-Cartridge/dp/B07GBXZRJR/ref=sr_1_4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a black ink tank&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://www.brother-usa.com/products/mfcj6545dw"&gt;Brother MFCJ6545DW&lt;/a&gt;, which uses storage tanks instead of cartridges to deliver its ink, costs $33 for a yield of up to 3,000 pages, or about a penny a page. (Because these types of printers — there are several — tend to use a differing number of tanks for color printing, it’s difficult to figure out an equivalent comparison for color printing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwLnKS"&gt;There are, of course, a lot of “ifs” here. For example, when you’re looking at lower-cost printers, some major printer manufacturers don’t publish the page yield. In addition, even when the page yield is available, you have to keep in mind that it is being offered by the manufacturer — so the number of pages you get per cartridge is usually optimistic. Still, this can give you a fair idea of what you’re facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sZIvBr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10496628"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d3YstD"&gt;Wireless connectivity &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G2LxKG"&gt;When you’re purchasing a printer, make sure it is capable of wireless connectivity via Bluetooth, NFC, and / or Wi-Fi — and make sure it is compatible with whatever computer or mobile device you plan to use with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frZS7W"&gt;If you’ve got a Mac computer, an iPad and / or an iPhone, make sure your printer is compatible with &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201311"&gt;Apple AirPrint&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xn4DS0"&gt;If you’re using a Chromebook, make sure your printer is Chrome OS compatible by checking the manufacturer site. (For example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fepson.com%2FAccessories%2FPrinter-Accessories%2FChromebook-Printing%2Fp%2FCHROMEBOOKPRINT%23worksWithAccessories&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Epson has a page&lt;/a&gt; that lists all its Chrome OS-compatible printers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dYEKW"&gt;Until recently, another alternative was to use Google’s Cloud Print service, which let you easily print from computers and Android phones. Unfortunately, with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning"&gt;usual disregard for well-loved features&lt;/a&gt;, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20977888/google-cloud-print-shut-down-date-support"&gt;shut down its Cloud Print service&lt;/a&gt; as of December 31st, 2020. The company’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9633006"&gt;rather unsatisfactory advice&lt;/a&gt; (“we recommend the respective platform’s native-printing infrastructure or working with a printing partner”) will probably not be much help for those with older printers or phones that depended on Cloud Print. You can check to see if your printer’s manufacturer has a mobile app that will allow printing from devices wirelessly in lieu of Cloud Print. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDDwMV"&gt;Finally, some printers now have NFC capabilities. This lets you can connect one to your phone by simply touching the phone to the NFC label on the printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qPtu4n"&gt;Touch and non-touch LCDs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XG6cZr"&gt;Most printers today, even the most basic, come with LCDs that allow you to easily connect to your wireless network and tweak the printer settings — for example, if you want to always print double-sided, or to pull paper from a specific paper cassette. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4G0Ig7"&gt;Unless you’re really into saving money, you’ll find it easier to deal with a touchscreen. Non-touchscreens usually mean having to hit a combination of buttons to navigate to the feature you want to access, selecting the feature, navigating to the setting, selecting it, and then getting back to the main menu. Touchscreens make that process a lot simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s35ufT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10496647"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ex62QD"&gt;Photo printers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="V9rrsD"&gt;Unless you plan to fill up several albums with physical photos, a photo printer is probably not necessary. Some photo printers offer features like the ability to remove red-eye in photos of people, but this same functionality is commonly available in a number of photo apps (and is probably easier to deal with in software). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdTda8"&gt;There are exceptions. For example, there are small, portable printers such as the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084CMMHVV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon SELPHY QX10 photo printer&lt;/a&gt; that let you immediately print small (2.7 x 2.7-inch) pictures. These are fun for family gatherings and parties. (Although be aware that you will have to buy special photo paper as well as ink for this one.) And if you’re a professional — or would-be professional — photographer, you may want to invest in a high-level photo printer. But otherwise, most midlevel color printers will — if you use good photo paper — do quite an adequate job. If you’re intending on printing a lot of photos, you’ll spend less and get better results from a photo printing service such as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shutterfly.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shutterfly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XePZ98"&gt;Where should I buy it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NMiB13"&gt;Printers are available at almost any online or in-store venues that sell laptops and other computer equipment, such as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=printers&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740374987942209261" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fbrowse%2FPrinters-Accessories%2Fci%2F18317%2FN%2F4042754070%3ForigSearch%3Dprinters&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;. You can also usually purchase a printer directly from the manufacturer — for example, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeChoosingPrinters051221&amp;amp;platform=dl&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fcv%2Fprinters" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usa.canon.com%2Finternet%2Fportal%2Fus%2Fhome%2Fproducts%2Fgroups%2Fprinters&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fepson.com%2Fprinters&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Epson&lt;/a&gt; all sell from their websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obEQMV"&gt;As with any tech device, it’s always a good idea to check out the product in person before you buy — you may decide, for example, that the inexpensive printer you saw online feels too cheap when you examine it on the shelf. But for the most part, if you’ve checked all the specs online and read a few reviews, you’re pretty safe in ordering your printer remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7b7L1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 13th, 2021, 10:25AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on June 9th, 2020. Prices have been updated, some printers have been named to replace those that are no longer available, and sections on NFC-capable printers, LCDs, and where to buy have been added.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk’s SpaceX inks satellite connectivity deal with Google Cloud</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At Google Cloud Next ‘19 Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/maHLD7sv9D0G48HmqB8_5C54Giw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69280368/1135936636.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bimER0"&gt;Google said on Thursday that it signed a deal with Elon Musk’s SpaceX to use the space company’s growing satellite internet service, Starlink, with its cloud unit. SpaceX will install Starlink terminals at Google’s cloud data centers around the world, aiming to utilize the cloud for Starlink customers and enabling Google to use the satellite network’s speedy internet for its enterprise cloud customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUDXek"&gt;The Starlink-Google Cloud capabilities, which include secure data delivery to remote areas of the world, will be available to customers by the end of 2021, Google said in a press release Thursday morning. SpaceX will install the first Starlink terminal at Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/new-albany/"&gt;New Albany, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, data center, a spokesman said, adding more plans on the partnership will be shared in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3QNm7Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SpaceX has about 1,550 satellites of thousands more planned in space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E3G4xi"&gt;The deal is a natural alliance for Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Google — which, in 2015, &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/google-spacex-investment-is-900-million/"&gt;invested&lt;/a&gt; $900 million into the space company to cover an array of technology, including Starlink satellite manufacturing. So far, SpaceX has launched 1,625 Starlink satellites, with about  1,550 currently in orbit. A Starlink beta program that began last year has at least 10,000 users across the US, Canada, and a few European countries, with at least 500,000 deposits of $100 placed by potential customers of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raneDo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251127/elon-musk-bezos-amazon-billionaires-satellites-space"&gt;Competition is fierce&lt;/a&gt; between Musk’s Starlink network and the budding Kuiper Project from Jeff Bezos’ Amazon, which aims to launch more than 3,000 satellites in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405779/fcc-approves-spacex-starlink-lower-orbits-against-amazon-rival-objections"&gt;roughly the same&lt;/a&gt; orbit as Starlink to also provide global broadband internet. The Google-SpaceX deal marks another competitive win for Google in its own rivalry with Amazon’s behemoth cloud services unit, Amazon Web Services. Amazon executives have said they aim to leverage internet connectivity from Kuiper to supercharge its AWS cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vDKr2p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Businesses, public sector organizations, and many other groups operating around the world” benefit from the deal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AQqVWb"&gt;“Applications and services running in the cloud can be transformative for organizations, whether they’re operating in a highly networked or remote environment,” Urs Hölzle, senior vice president of infrastructure at Google Cloud, said in the press release. Hölzle said Google is “delighted to partner with SpaceX to ensure that organizations with distributed footprints have seamless, secure, and fast access to the critical applications and services they need to keep their teams up and running.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7u24n"&gt;The Google deal involves delivering internet-data “access to businesses, public sector organizations, and many other groups operating around the world,” SpaceX president and COO Gwynne Shotwell said in the press release. “Combining Starlink’s high-speed, low-latency broadband with Google’s infrastructure and capabilities provides global organizations with the secure and fast connection that modern organizations expect,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqKmcT"&gt;Microsoft, which runs another massive cloud service dubbed Azure that also competes with Amazon’s cloud, also partnered with SpaceX last year in a similar partnership. Putting Azure cloud data through the broadband highway of Starlink, the two companies will be “co-selling to our mutual customers, co-selling to new enterprise and future customers” for data services, Shotwell said in a promotional video at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoMwP3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What actually makes something ‘flushable’? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HqGKpg06JkXzlkWDF25ql31rQxE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69280223/Thumb_TEXTLESS.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZRA3rh"&gt;Go to any drugstore or supermarket, and it’s easy to find wipes and other supplies labeled “flushable.” It’s &lt;em&gt;totally fine&lt;/em&gt; to flush those wipes down the toilet, the packaging claims. No problem at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgz0QO"&gt;But according to sewage plants and wastewater experts, those so-called “flushable” products are actually a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; problem. They might be flushable enough to snake through the toilet’s plumbing, but they don’t disintegrate before they reach the various channels, tanks, and propellers at sewage plants. Instead, they clump up on everything they hit — clogging up the system and, in some cases, even breaking heavy pieces of machinery. Employees have to regularly hand-chisel wipe-boulders out of the innards of the sewage plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VllWkY"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;Science video team went to see the damage wipes can do — and got up close and personal with the bits of fabric that cost cities millions and millions of dollars each year to manage. Watch our latest video to see what we discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony announces new black and red DualSense controllers for the PS5 you still can’t buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T92jRH8v9wnNJndil-gkXYfa1GY=/19x0:1984x1310/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69280077/Screen_Shot_2021_05_13_at_9.08.52_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q0Gm3o"&gt;Sony has announced its first new colors for PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller: a “cosmic red” model that features a two-tone red and black design, and an all-black “midnight black” version that brings to mind the classic PS2, PS3, and PS4 controller designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pro8v"&gt;Until now, Sony has only offered the DualSense controller in a black-and-white color scheme to match the PS5 (which features a similar contrasting theme), so the new color options are certainly welcome ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuayIH"&gt;The midnight black option is particularly notable: the primarily white DualSense was a big departure for Sony’s designs, which have largely trended toward black and gray consoles and controllers by default for the entire life span of the PlayStation brand. The new black option (technically still a two-tone design, with two different shades of black) is closer to those other controllers, though. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nyv-k_W9-w4niSizPXuGu2b8gbY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22511515/51177281140_630303a64d_h.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WF51c1Q0LtRGxTDr516roOre7qc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22511516/51176194136_6b76edb34d_h.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2f5Jzx"&gt;Right now, Sony has only announced new colors for the controller, although the PlayStation 5 console does feature removable face plates — so it’s possible that the company could introduce matching plates for the PS5 sometime in the future. Enterprising companies like Dbrand have already started to fill that gap, though, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279685/matte-black-ps5-faceplates-on-sale-dbrand-sue-us-sony"&gt;with their own third-party options&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tbHGJt"&gt;The two new color schemes should be available to purchase sometime next month (Sony says that dates will be dependent on individual retailers). Pricing hasn’t been announced yet, but for reference, the standard DualSense controller costs $69.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ds6R1G"&gt;Of course, all that assumes that you can find a PS5 in the first place — something that Sony admits might be difficult to do &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428322/sony-ps5-supply-constraints-2022-hiroki-totoki"&gt;until 2022&lt;/a&gt; at the earliest. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three cheers for Scabby the Rat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/590KRkiHDiDorQrxNi-KWeVdLp0=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69280061/VRG_ILLO_4556_Scabby_the_rat_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by William Joel | Photo by Juana Arias for the Washington Post&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The giant inflatable rodent that became the face of America’s labor movement&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WW32Jq"&gt;The 12-foot rat loomed over the entrance to the RV trade show in Elkhart, Indiana, the “RV capital of the world.” It stood 12 feet high, its beady red eyes and snarling fangs alerting attendees that at least one company wasn’t playing nice with union organizers. Depending on who you asked, the gigantic inflatable rodent was either a menace or a rallying cry. But to its owners — members of the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE) Local 150 — it was merely Scabby, a beloved symbol of the labor movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYYbRC"&gt;Since the late ‘80s, unions have been using Scabby to shame business owners who won’t negotiate a fair contract with workers. “From the very beginning, you could be picketing in front of a business, have workers out there in tents in the winter, and a barrel full of wood, and a fire to keep warm. You wouldn’t get as much attention from the owners as you did when you had Scabby, because it’s an attack on their brand,” says Jim Sweeney, president of IUOE Local 150. Scabby embarrassed business owners, drawing unwanted attention from passersby. And embarrassment turned out to be a powerful force for union organizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SpaTZb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When it’s 90 degrees out and you put on a heavy, woolen Scabby suit, it could become very rancid inside there”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UUcGrx"&gt;Sweeney helped create the character in 1988 as a way to reclaim worker power from the infamously anti-labor Reagan administration. The first version was a furry costume worn by union organizers. “We quickly found out that when it’s 90 degrees out and you put on a heavy, woolen Scabby suit, it could become very rancid inside there,” Sweeney says. Next, the union created a midsize blow-up rat that stood on top of a car (the “rat patrol’’). The car was fun — a statement! — but still, they wanted something &lt;em&gt;bigger&lt;/em&gt;. Finally, they commissioned Big Sky Balloons to create a massive inflatable Scabby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0RqzMc"&gt;Today, in labor hubs like Chicago and New York City, the rat is a familiar symbol of worker power. Its size ranges from six to 25 feet tall, costing anywhere from $2,000 to $10,000. Yet even the small Scabby is hard to ignore. The rat has red, dark-rimmed eyes, yellowing buck teeth, and sharp fangs, with claws stretched out in front. Big Sky also offers a corporate “fat cat” balloon, as well as a “greedy pig,” although those are less widely seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3cyxEs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Scabby has come under threat of extermination in recent years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D5ANtK"&gt;As an emblem of worker power, Scabby has been enormously successful, pissing off business owners and spreading awareness about its cause. Perhaps for that reason, Scabby has come under threat of extermination in recent years, particularly during the Trump administration. Peter Robb, the former general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), tried to ban Scabby’s usage in some situations, citing a lawsuit about the rat’s presence at the RV trade show in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsaIQt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/25-CC-228342"&gt;According to a brief submitted by the NLRB’s general counsel&lt;/a&gt;, the IUOE placed Scabby at the entrance to the show, alongside two banners, one of which called out a company named Lippert Components for harboring rat contractors (someone who refuses to work with unionized workers or treats employees poorly). “The inflatable rat was particularly menacing and scary, standing twelve feet tall with red eyes and sharp fangs and claws,” the brief alleges — a description that likely delighted union organizers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAWFsX"&gt;Robb tried to say that Scabby’s presence at the show was “so intimidating” it could “coerce third parties that have nothing to do with the spat, such as the RV company’s contractors,” &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden-labor-appointee-frees-scabby-the-rat-from-legal-peril_n_6022e83dc5b6c56a89a4fa6a"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;HuffPost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Such coercion would constitute an illegal secondary boycott. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SS3879"&gt;Luckily for Scabby, Joe Biden took office and promptly fired Robb, replacing him with acting General Counsel Peter Sung Ohr. In February, Ohr filed a motion to withdraw the earlier complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3uBOz2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It doesn’t represent what’s going on in Alabama right now.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iFfphh"&gt;The move indicated that Scabby’s future was — for the moment — secure. But Erik Loomis, a labor history professor at the University of Rhode Island, says he’s not sure the rat is as relevant for the current worker-led movement as it once was. “It doesn’t represent what’s going on in Alabama right now,” he says. “It doesn’t represent organizing at Google. It doesn’t represent the gig worker economy. It really represents an older version of the American labor movement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43eUeW"&gt;That’s partly because Scabby is a product of the building trades, where the rat has long been associated with “scabs,” or people who cross a picket line during a strike to continue working. Newer organizers, particularly in tech, might not know that history, Loomis says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBbo6J"&gt;Sweeney believes Scabby could still have a place in tech unions, noting they are all fighting for the same cause. “It doesn’t matter if I’m a traditional older union, or if I’m a new tech union, we’re doing the same thing,” he says. “We’re all trying to lift workers’ wages, we’re trying to lift workers’ conditions and dignity up. That’s what we’re about.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="KyaTGy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10493160"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="scJWM1"&gt;The comments come just weeks after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;crushing defeat for workers at an Amazon warehouse&lt;/a&gt; in Bessemer, Alabama. On April 9th, the NLRB announced that workers had voted 1,798 to 738 against unionization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcwC7U"&gt;Organizers in Bessemer said the union was about more than just wages. “It is a matter of morality, of just who will make money off their labors,” &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22320009/amazon-bessemer-union-rwdsu-alabama"&gt;wrote Kim Kelly in &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a question of good and evil, about what is righteous, and just, and fair. For these workers and the organizers who have traveled from across the South to support their unionization effort, this is their David and Goliath story. What they want is dignity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ym0z2U"&gt;(According to the Dead Sea Scrolls, Goliath stood at “four cubits and a span,” about six feet and nine inches, or more than five feet shorter than an average Scabby.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Yw8OY4"&gt;Whether or not Scabby has a place in Bessemer, Loomis says he doesn’t expect the rat to go away anytime soon. That’s partly because of how fervently people like Peter Robb hate it. “It does show just how much that silly inflatable rat infuriates those building owners and contractors,” Loomis says. “If anything, Robb’s attack on it made people defend it even more.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMfNye"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CEh4N7"&gt;If you’ve been curious about checking out the Microsoft Surface Duo foldable Android phone but didn’t want to pay its original $1,399 price — first off, I get you. The good news is that you no longer have to pay such a high cost to get one. Wellbots is selling the &lt;a href="https://shrsl.com/2yvje"&gt;unlocked Surface Duo with 128GB of storage that works on Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile for just $690&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfPrbc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers can score this deal by using the offer code &lt;strong&gt;THEVERGEDUO&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. Residents outside of California and New York won’t be charged tax on this purchase. If you want to double the storage, you can get the 256GB Surface Duo for $790.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecCxvl"&gt;This phone released in September 2020 to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;less-than-stellar reception from Dieter Bohn&lt;/a&gt;. In his review, he praised the battery life, the great design of the hardware, and of course, the delight in running two apps at once. The high price was a big roadblock, but even though the price is lower today, you’ll likely find that its camera isn’t competitive with other similarly priced flagship Android phones. Still, you might be able to overlook its flaws because it’s a unique device that’s now in fire sale territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mjOtyU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10497909"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EQB62Z"&gt;Before I move on, I wanted to mention that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMSUSQ00001%2FMicrosoft-Surface-Duo-128GB-Unlocked-GSM-PC-Tablet-Glacier-USQ-00001&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F13%2F22433893%2Fmicrosoft-surface-duo-hori-split-pad-pro-nintendo-switch-anker-sale-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig is selling the Surface Duo for $699&lt;/a&gt; and the purchase includes a set of LG Tone wireless earbuds. However, this version of the phone works only on GSM carriers like AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EgOdHTDwPxaEpafuvgfOvx46DFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19210687/DSCF7116.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnCPro"&gt;Hori’s Split Pad Pro controller is a great alternative for people who find the Nintendo Switch’s Joy-Con uncomfortable to use. Normally $50, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FJ82W64?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the midnight blue color is $40.50&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon, which is a good price. Hori’s Joy-Con replacements can turn your Switch into a more ergonomic device that should make it easier to endure long &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter: Rise&lt;/em&gt; sessions. These don’t contain a battery, HD rumble motors, or motion sensors. To that end, they can’t be used when they aren’t attached to the Switch, so keep that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

Anker claims up to seven hours of battery on a single charge, and up to 28 hours of total playback from the battery inside of its included Qi wireless charging case that can also recharge via USB-C. I can’t attest to the sound quality for these, but the silicone ear tips should ensure a relatively comfortable fit that blocks out some outside noise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple needs to show iOS allows competition... while justifying locking it down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DCRM2h3Ieo_PTWpFPdxciLGaDYQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69279970/acastro_190319_1777_apple_services_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yhoevp"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial will deliver a verdict on whether Apple is suppressing competition. But if you were watching Wednesday’s testimony, you could easily end up &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;confused about what its App Store actually allows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2kXz0"&gt;Apple says iOS users benefit from a locked-down, curated platform. It rejects “stores within stores” like the Epic Games Store, which could allegedly expose users to harmful and unvetted software. It’s also, however, fighting Epic Games’ claims that there’s no meaningful competition on its platform. So this morning, an Apple attorney grilled one of Epic’s witnesses about a slew of iOS-hosted gaming apps. The move might have helped rebut Epic’s complaints, but it also highlighted just how arbitrary Apple’s policies can seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vO3Piu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“GameClub is a direct competitor to Apple Arcade, and GameClub is available in the App Store today”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vncLBS"&gt;Apple attorney Karen Dunn was questioning Susan Athey, an economist testifying on behalf of Epic. Athey criticized Apple yesterday for not allowing more “middleware,” or third-party services like alternate app stores. Dunn countered with several options that might fit that bill. The list included Valve’s Steam Mobile and Steam Link apps; Microsoft’s Xbox iOS app; Sony’s PlayStation app; and a mobile gaming subscription service named GameClub. “GameClub is a direct competitor to Apple Arcade, and GameClub is available in the App Store today,” Dunn said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQKjDz"&gt;Apple is right to call these apps gaming services, but as testimony continued, it wasn’t clear they make good App Store alternatives. Steam Mobile lets players manage games for Windows, Mac, and Linux — but not iPhones or iPads. The Steam Link, Xbox, and PlayStation apps all let you play a catalog of games on iOS — but only if you’ve got a PC or console to stream them from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQZzOe"&gt;GameClub &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;a cross-platform mobile gaming service. But right after Apple mentioned the app, a GameClub executive posted (and then deleted) a tweet calling that comparison “absurd beyond measure,” thanks to restrictions on how GameClub can operate. Athey testified that Apple rejected GameClub over 100 times, and that Apple only lets GameClub feature games to which it has an “exclusive license.” When &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;emailed GameClub business development VP Eli Hodapp, noting that Apple had described it as a successful iOS game-bundling service, Hodapp replied with “Are you serious?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o53r5T"&gt;The past week has demonstrated a bunch of extremely fine lines between what Apple considers good and bad. The iOS Xbox app allows console-based remote play, for instance. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421570/epic-apple-trial-iphone-xbox-console-specific-general-purpose-pc-testimony-day-3"&gt;as Microsoft’s Lori Wright testified&lt;/a&gt;, Apple and Xbox failed to strike a deal for xCloud, which lets players stream games without an Xbox. Wright even accidentally got an &lt;em&gt;approved&lt;/em&gt; streaming app called Shadow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421290/microsoft-apple-xcloud-ios-shadow-cloud-gaming-removal-app-store"&gt;kicked off the store&lt;/a&gt;, until Apple decided Shadow offered a “full Windows 10 PC, rather than a library of games.” From the outside, that looks more like a semantic dodge than a decision based on privacy, security, and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEe2uH"&gt;Apple hammered Epic for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5"&gt;offering access to Itch.io&lt;/a&gt;, a storefront featuring adult content. But Steam has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/6/17435244/valve-steam-game-release-new-policy"&gt;nearly anything-goes policy&lt;/a&gt; on porn, and Steam Mobile and Link put those games a few taps away on iOS. Conversely, an App Store executive testified that Roblox user-built “experiences” were fine because they couldn’t sneak new, malicious code onto iPhones. But it’s said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;cloud gaming services threaten&lt;/a&gt; the iPhone’s “safe and trusted” model, despite being essentially just streaming video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rK5MJP"&gt;Being confusing or inconsistent doesn’t make Apple’s App Store illegal. Epic needs to demonstrate that Apple’s ecosystem counts as a monopoly, and moreover, that it’s hurting users by producing higher prices or subpar service. But part of Apple’s defense is that it’s a fair, consistent steward putting users’ best interests first. As the trial goes on, it’s sometimes hard to tell what it thinks those interests are.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Quibi’s grounded content will be reborn on Roku starting May 20th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VDIRnAnPduB5FBthTMAtNfOrt7M=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69279854/TRC_Roku_Originals.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t6suLp"&gt;The Roku Channel is getting its first batch of Quibi shows on May 20th, Roku has announced. There’ll be 30 so-called “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395533/roku-originals-quibi-content-tv"&gt;Roku Originals&lt;/a&gt;” available to stream initially, but Roku says it eventually plans to release all 75 of Quibi’s titles on its service. They’ll be available to watch free of charge in the US, Canada, and UK, with ads inserted in between individual short-form episodes. Roku announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220426/quibi-roku-channel-acquisition-content"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt; that it would be exclusively licensing Quibi’s library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvxpVy"&gt;Included in this first batch of shows are the seventh season of &lt;em&gt;Reno 911!&lt;/em&gt;, the cooking documentary &lt;em&gt;Shape of Pasta&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Chrissy’s Court &lt;/em&gt;(starring Chrissy Teigen)&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and Kevin Hart’s &lt;em&gt;Die Hart&lt;/em&gt;. In the US, The Roku Channel is available on iOS, Android, select Samsung TVs, Amazon Fire TV devices, and the web, in addition to Roku’s own hardware. Meanwhile in the UK, it’s available on Sky Q and Now TV devices, as well as Roku devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Nsb832"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Quibi’s library lives on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="urHJkQ"&gt;Some of these shows have big names attached to them, but that didn’t stop Quibi itself from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527197/quibi-streaming-service-mobile-shutting-down-end-katzenberg"&gt;shutting down&lt;/a&gt; after just six months of operation. Despite this failure, Roku argues that it’s in a much better position to make a success of this content than Quibi was. For starters, its Roku Channel already reaches tens of millions of viewers, and they won’t have to pay anything extra to watch Quibi’s content. Roku also says Quibi’s short-form nature (each episode lasts 10 to 15 minutes) provides natural breaks for advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwWco1"&gt;Other than inserting ads, Roku says it hasn’t made any major tweaks to Quibi’s content. Of course, watching on your living room TV means there isn’t the option to view the shows in portrait like there was with the Quibi app, but Roku argues that the content was filmed in high enough quality that you shouldn’t be able to tell that they were originally made with phone screens in mind. All of the content will stream at 1080p resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLmzQs"&gt;Roku announced it would be exclusively licensing Quibi’s library of content in January, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285819/roku-original-content-job-listing-plan-original-shows-movies"&gt;job listing the following month&lt;/a&gt; suggests Roku has plans to develop its own in-house content. The Roku Channel currently hosts over 250,000 movies and TV episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDX9iE"&gt;Here’s the full list of 30 Quibi titles that will be available to stream on May 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="chpS5b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;#FreeRayshawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cLp4kW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;About Face&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bURNFl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bad Ideas with Adam Devine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BtY00V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barkitechture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="r1lyTq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Rad Wolf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WUEWvi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blackballed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ekCF51"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Centerpiece&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JzGIYF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrissy’s Court&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4fhIlC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cup of Joe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vH25Zx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die Hart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3kZOEO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dishmantled&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ERoN2B"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dummy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="43nieu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fight Like a Girl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gfCG3x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flipped&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5b2IRU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fugitive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hIKdnB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gayme Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z6HK6q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iron Sharpens Iron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Rx6yMo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last Looks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fmrFXT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let’s Roll with Tony Greenhand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="F7u7ar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most Dangerous Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FbbDCl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Murder House Flip&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eKSKVe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Murder Unboxed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sHgZba"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nightgowns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wAGBQp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prodigy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LupDLh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Punk’d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yv7386"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reno 911!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9wQagh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Royalties&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="N2O5c7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shape of Pasta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TQgbJB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks a Million&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1RDLGK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You Ain’t Got These&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="5PDQOp"&gt;These shows will be available exclusively on The Roku Channel. In the case of &lt;em&gt;Reno 911!&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;previous seasons are available to watch elsewhere, but the formerly Quibi-exclusive season 7 is now exclusive to Roku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5feQ8"&gt;To coincide with the release of the shows, Roku is discounting several of its players. In the US, the Streaming Stick Plus will be discounted by $10, the Streambar and Roku Ultra will be discounted by $30, and the Roku Express will be discounted by $5. The deals will be active between May 16th and 29th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how E3’s all-virtual event will work this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LN86UVaOmF3r4rA7vqg1UVQlCnE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69279862/acastro_190531_1777_e3_lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aHK30X"&gt;The world’s biggest gaming showcase, E3, is going all-virtual for the first time in its history, with organizers revealing today how they plan to keep enthusiasts interested without the sights and sounds of the show floor. The virtual E3 will run from June 12th to June 15th. The showcase will include an online portal with access to virtual exhibitor booths with video content and articles, live streams, and social elements like forums, customizable user profiles, leaderboards, and “lounges.” Registration is free and opens later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USCtUu"&gt;This will be the second year in a row that E3 has not taken place in person in Los Angeles due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year, the show’s cancellation was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21163570/e3-canceled-coronavirus-outbreak-xbox-nintendo"&gt;announced in March&lt;/a&gt;, and the show’s organizers, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), did not present an official online version of the event. In its place, a collection of digital events emerged, collectively called the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21254666/gaming-events-summer-game-fest-2020-e3-gamescom-digital-announcements"&gt;Summer Game Fest&lt;/a&gt;. This year, however, the ESA is coordinating a centralized virtual E3 event, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363385/summer-game-fest-returns-back-june-geoff-keighley"&gt;the Summer Game Fest&lt;/a&gt; is also returning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qlg7nR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;E3 broadcasts will still be available via Twitch and YouTube&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pBLDKz"&gt;Along with its virtual show floor, the E3 app and portal will host video streams with interactive elements like viewer polls and featured tweets. Broadcasts will include press conferences, industry panels, and game showcases. In addition to the official app and portal, streams will also be available via the official E3 &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/e3"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/e3"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/E3"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/E3Expo/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Enh9eK"&gt;As well as the public show, there’ll also be a “media access week” running from June 7th in which the ESA says media will be able to use the online portal and app to connect directly with E3 exhibitors. Today’s press release doesn’t detail exactly who these exhibitors are, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22368617/e3-2021-virtual-event-digital-microsoft-nintendo"&gt;last month the ESA announced&lt;/a&gt; that E3’s lineup would include Nintendo, Xbox, Capcom, Ubisoft, Take-Two Interactive, and Warner Bros. Games. Sony and EA were absent from the list. The PlayStation manufacturer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/15/18097441/sony-playstation-skipping-e3-2019-keynote-booth"&gt;skipped E3 2019&lt;/a&gt; and announced it would &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/13/21060433/sony-playstation-e3-2020-ps5-event"&gt;not be attending E3 2020&lt;/a&gt; prior to its cancellation. Meanwhile, EA will host its own EA Play Live event &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/electronicarts/status/1392148869459415040"&gt;the following month in July&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being on the ESA’s original list, Konami later announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Konami/status/1388266921498394624"&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; that it would not be participating at this year’s E3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAsR3h"&gt;E3 has evolved a lot over its history. Although certain aspects like the big publisher press conferences have been publicly viewable for years, until recently, the in-person show itself was an industry and media-only affair. It was only in 2017 that the ESA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/8/14548376/e3-2017-open-ticket-sales-public-february-13"&gt;officially opened its doors to the public&lt;/a&gt; with tickets priced at $250. This year’s format is dropping the high price of attending in person, though it’s unclear how much of the magic of the show floor can be recreated in virtual booths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szq6Aw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 13th, 9:18AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to note Konami’s tweet confirming it will not be presenting at this year’s E3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
