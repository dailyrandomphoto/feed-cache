    <title>Fortnite season 6 adds animals, crafting, Lara Croft, and Neymar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H7LZ9-UMaP51_HPSjGPcWlW2WEY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973192/EN_16BR_Social_KeyArt_Social.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lHr4lM"&gt;A new season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is upon us, and the latest digs even deeper into the battle royale’s reality-spanning narrative. Today, Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/chapter-2-season-6"&gt;officially launched season 6&lt;/a&gt; of the game’s second chapter, which is dubbed “Primal.” It takes place directly after the “Zero Crisis Finale” that concluded season 5 and introduces a new prehistoric biome to the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utJYvp"&gt;When players start playing the season for the first time, they’ll be greeted with a quick cinematic — which you can watch below — following a short-yet-intense single-player adventure where you help Agent Jonesy attempt to save reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7g3viH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xNWaHd8tj2E?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="534lll"&gt;That new setting includes a towering spire in the center of the island — right where the zero point explosion from season 5 took place — which is surrounded by a village and other new locations, replacing the alien desert from last season. Perhaps more significant is that animals now roam the island, including everything from wolves and wild boar to seemingly more harmless creatures like chicken and frogs. Along with this is a new crafting mechanic that lets players build makeshift weapons, like new bows, from hunted wildlife and discarded technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UtR0Rz2Wl9hhBkOIaxnsp1GWbqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374161/EN_CH2S06_MiniMap_1080x1080.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zj3oyB"&gt;Additionally, those who pick up the battle pass can expect the usual assortment of new character skins and other cosmetic items to unlock. This time around that includes characters connected to the ongoing story, like Agent Jones, as well as someone called the “Spire Assassin,” and Raz, described as “seeker of The Spire’s mysteries.” Of course, it wouldn’t be &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; without licensed tie-ins. This season those come in the form of Lara Croft from &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;, Raven from &lt;em&gt;Teen Titans,&lt;/em&gt; and, at some point in the future, Brazilian soccer star Neymar (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/14/22330003/epic-games-fortnite-brazilian-soccer-star-neymar"&gt;as expected&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPj7oS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s previous season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;started last December&lt;/a&gt;, and it similarly began with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;an impressive live event that capped off its Marvel-themed storyline&lt;/a&gt; — which turned out to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21921491/fortnite-galactus-live-event-player-count"&gt;the game’s biggest event to date&lt;/a&gt;. However, season 5 will likely be best-remembered for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;the sheer number of licensed tie-ins&lt;/a&gt;, spanning everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;professional sports&lt;/a&gt;. Those looking to dig a bit deeper into the ever-evolving &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; lore can also check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303107/batman-fortnite-comic-crossover-epic-games-dc-launch-date"&gt;an upcoming Batman crossover comic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s new gaming-focused earbuds play nicely with USB-C devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech G333" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qs4TEudqlmI2HdwuR4VNSEeNgAg=/0x0:5851x3901/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973117/g333lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DCXyKb"&gt;Logitech’s latest earbuds, a $50 model called the G333, are unremarkable in terms of design, with a flat cable that houses an inline remote and mic, swappable silicone ear tips, and the ability to connect to gadgets via a 3.5mm jack. What makes them stand out is the included 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3X2Wu"&gt;If your phone or other audio device lacks a headphone jack but has a USB-C port to spare, you’re all set to plug in with this model. With the adapter attached, I had no issues hooking up the G333 to my 3.5mm-less Pixel 3, my Nintendo Switch, or through a USB-C port on the MacBook Pro I use for work. Also included with these earbuds are two additional sizes of silicone ear tips and a small mesh carrying case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWFwqz"&gt;The G333 looks almost identical to Logitech’s other two gaming earbuds: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439854/logitech-g-pro-g333-headphones-earbuds-gaming-headset-oculus-quest-2-ready-vr"&gt;$50 G333 VR&lt;/a&gt; headphones (which are certified for the Oculus Quest 2) and the $50 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21494174/astro-a03-in-ear-headphones-monitor-earbuds-gaming-nintendo-switch-pc-chat-playstation-xbox"&gt;Astro A03 earbuds&lt;/a&gt;. The added value here is the USB-C adapter, which is included for the same price. So if you’re trying to decide between them, the new G333 are the most feature-packed for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G333" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mWh30fUSjC_OyU5wAm_Gqo2_1VI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22371741/logitechg333product.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each set of Logitech’s G333 includes a 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter, swappable ear tips, and a small mesh carrying case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wXcQXd"&gt;The G333 earbuds seem to have the same dual dynamic drivers as those aforementioned models, and their overall performance was similar in my testing. If you aren’t expecting much (considering the price), I think you’ll be impressed with their sound quality. There’s plenty of bass, but it doesn’t muddle the sound. My biggest nitpick against them is that the silicone ear tips don’t always want to stay in my ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNch5"&gt;Logitech’s new earbuds will be available in three colorways: black with blue details, dark purple with neon yellow detailing, and lastly, silver with light purple detailing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new Windows 10 update fixes the issue where some printers would crash computers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eRO4bUWP7qvp51rf_hEI5vxMJ3w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68971939/acastro_180226_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yoajye"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/march-15-2021-kb5001566-os-build-18363-1441-out-of-band-23c4c824-8638-43e9-a381-ff58213ae6fe"&gt;is fixing&lt;/a&gt; the issue where trying to use certain printers would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22326083/windows-10-security-update-bug-printer-crash-kyocera-ricoh-zebra-microsoft"&gt;freak out your Windows 10 computer and cause it to blue screen&lt;/a&gt;. If you (or your IT department) have been dealing with the issue, today’s update should let you get back to printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qs4Asm"&gt;In the update notes, Microsoft says that the issue only affected “certain printers using some apps,” but doesn't clarify which. It seemed to impact some printers from Kyocera, Ricoh, and Zebra, and if you owned one it’s the type of error that would be extremely annoying — or worse, workflow-breaking, if printing’s a need and not something you just do occasionally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BgvLuh"&gt;If this issue has been affecting you, you can download the update by going to Settings &amp;gt; Update &amp;amp; Security &amp;gt; Windows Update, and clicking Check for Updates. Hopefully, after updating, your printer and computer can go back to being friends again. May the ink once again meet the paper, and your computer not have to be rebooted from a hard crash.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GitHub employee fired for saying ‘Nazi’ in Slack declines to take his job back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Agrees To Buy Coding Site GitHub For $7.5 Billion" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R0fRiL5OtMfm0DKvxsoBBL4FoTo=/0x2:3000x2002/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68971773/967228286.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HNb7dZ"&gt;A Jewish GitHub employee who was fired for warning co-workers in Slack to stay safe from Nazis during the January 6th attack on the US Capitol has declined to take his job back after an offer from the company, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/fired-github-employee-reaches-amicable-resolution-with-company/"&gt;GitHub told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dw8KWM"&gt;“We offered the employee his job back immediately after reviewing the investigation findings, and he declined,” a GitHub spokesperson said to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. GitHub shared the same statement with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S88vtj"&gt;“Me and the company reached an amicable resolution,” the employee said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. “I appreciate that they have denounced white supremacy and the dangers it poses to everybody.” The terms of the resolution are unclear, but the employee had “previously told me he was seeking damages or some other form of reconciliation,” &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzA3PY"&gt;GitHub fired the employee two days after he wrote “stay safe homies, Nazis are about” to colleagues in Slack on January 6th, as &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-backlash-jewish-employee-termination-2021-1"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Approximately 200 of the company’s 1,700 employees signed an open letter asking the company for an explanation, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232766/github-employees-protest-jewish-employee-firing-warn-nazi"&gt;employees began using the word “Nazi” in Slack&lt;/a&gt; to describe the Capitol rioters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jknQFR"&gt;Following an independent investigation, GitHub CEO Nat Friedman admitted that “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22235913/github-significant-mistakes-were-made-firing-jewish-employee-nazis"&gt;significant mistakes were made&lt;/a&gt;” in an internal message to employees on January 16th, and the company offered the employee his job back. The company’s head of HR also resigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24kowd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 15th, 8:10PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added that GitHub shared a statement with &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get the Nintendo Switch Lite with a $20 gift card for a limited time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CFTIvFsKez_trhgyuwcaRZ3uzHA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68971574/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A0Mt8t"&gt;Not everyone takes advantage of the “switch” aspect of the Nintendo Switch, and for them, the smaller, easier-to-carry &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; is a worthwhile alternative. A few retailers are now tossing in a free $20 gift card when you purchase Nintendo’s more compact handheld. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4ctVf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V2BBMK4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734996775790451200#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-lite-gray%2F204518.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; are all offering the deal, and all Switch Lite colors are eligible. So regardless of whether you prefer gray, yellow, blue, or coral, you’ll end up with an extra $20 to spend at the retailer you’re buying it from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L7QqeX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10394076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u8I1dA"&gt;By going with the Lite model, you lose the ability to dock the Switch to a TV, and features like HD rumble are also omitted from the smaller hardware. But at least you get a better d-pad and sturdier design in exchange. And the downsized screen is the same resolution, so some people think it actually looks &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; thanks to the improved pixel density. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWHAlV"&gt;With the extra $20, you can grab yourself a game on sale (or put it towards a must-buy like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22274990/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), a screen protector, or maybe a carrying case. The Switch Lite isn’t as hard to come by as the regular Switch, which continues to face supply shortages, but it’s still proven to be a hit with many Nintendo fans as their main or secondary console.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bird will double its size in Europe with massive $150 million spend</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LLZjN2"&gt;Bird says it will spend $150 million on a major expansion in Europe. The Santa Monica-based scooter sharing company announced that it will bring its battery-powered two-wheelers to 50 new cities on the continent in the coming months, in addition to growing its fleet in its current markets. The move comes as scooter sharing continues to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/vc-investors-are-wild-for-europes-e-scooter-rental-startups.html"&gt;perform strongly in Europe&lt;/a&gt; amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKHvuW"&gt;To help oversee this new initiative, Bird is promoting to two employees to its executive team: Renaud Fages is named head of global operations; and Brendan O’Driscoll will be head of product, growth and data, overseeing both Bird’s global product strategy and its implementation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W9aZVI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Europe is playing a leading role”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dtju1o"&gt;“Europe is playing a leading role not only in embracing micro-EVs, but in redesigning cities to safely promote their use,” said Travis VanderZanden, founder and CEO of Bird, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKetJi"&gt;Bird said that portions of its $150 million investment will be spent “implementing the next generation of recycling and second life applications for vehicles, investing in industry-leading equity programs and securing partnerships across the region designed to improve transportation for all Europeans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJWo1A"&gt;Since it first arrived in Paris in 2019, Bird has seen huge potential for growth in Europe, with its more robust network of bike lanes and a culture less dependent on personally owned vehicles. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/27/21083751/bird-acquires-circ-electric-scooter-europe-asia"&gt;Bird acquired Circ&lt;/a&gt;, a leading electric scooter rental business in Europe and the Middle East, in January 2020. And the company now operates in over 50 cities on the continent, meaning this new investment will represent a doubling of Bird’s current footprint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FmnPQn"&gt;But the company has also seen a number of setbacks too. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335611/paris-electric-scooter-competition-lime-tier-dott-bird"&gt;Bird did not ultimately win one of the coveted permits&lt;/a&gt; to operate its scooters in Paris, &lt;a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/industrie-services/tourisme-transport/tier-lime-et-dott-raflent-le-marche-londonien-de-la-trottinette-electrique-1294014"&gt;nor does it appear to be on track&lt;/a&gt; to be granted a license in London either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhZWav"&gt;Bird has grown increasingly reliant on revenue from its franchising program, in which the company sells its older scooters to small operators and takes a cut of each ride. The program, which is called Bird Platform, has led some operators to fall into deep debt, &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/bird-is-quietly-luring-contract-workers-into-debt-through-a-new-scooter-scheme-3fa34fb4a0f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last year. The company has since launched Bird Platform in countries like Switzerland and Estonia, cheering investors who hope it will lower Bird’s labor and capital expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYb8iV"&gt;In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/after-tough-year-spacs-tempt-bird-lime"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Bird was nearing a deal to raise more than $100 million in convertible debt from some of its existing investors. The debt, which could eventually be converted into stock, would help Bird avoid selling shares at a lower price than in earlier fundraising rounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7hy93"&gt;The company is also doubling down on direct-to-consumer sales, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448941/bird-air-electric-scooter-announce-price-specs"&gt;unveiling its $599 Bird Air &lt;/a&gt;last year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>India will reportedly introduce bill to make owning cryptocurrency illegal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TuZfbT6AJIj5UncEwNG4iLDVHmo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68971166/mdoying_180308_2373_0091still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E1UM3B"&gt;India is reportedly moving forward with a sweeping ban on cryptocurrencies. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-cryptocurrency-ban/india-to-propose-cryptocurrency-ban-penalising-miners-traders-source-idUSKBN2B60R0"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the country’s legislature will introduce a bill that criminalizes trading, mining, issuing, transferring, or possessing cryptocurrency. The bill is likely to pass if it’s introduced, giving India some of the world’s strictest digital currency laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFomoo"&gt;Under the plan, people who own these digital assets would have six months to liquidate their holdings. &lt;em&gt;Reuters’&lt;/em&gt; source, a government official, didn’t specify the punishment for breaking the rules after that. But a 2019 government panel recommended a jail sentence of up to 10 years for cryptocurrency-related offenses. The official says the discussions are in their “final stages,” although there’s no strict timeline for introducing the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98pTti"&gt;The Indian government &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/30/india-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-bitcoin-other-private-cryptocurrencies/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANTVg2GJYkmVpDg-m9DEVgD9JUp1wMIZoZsO5FtdJPNvp8Mr_qb4UZrDQ695KbtwcFyZUdUASR1qhHDcg1ToEWe3YnwukJaWt-su65i9Q1fgaTcZUPUHWqwybgbgzDcQoR-Yl0PQkVw6zWfgErdSt3MhZDT-tHeUZLTzVsRgAy2M"&gt;outlined its plans in January&lt;/a&gt;, when it published an agenda for the upcoming legislative session. That agenda included banning “all private cryptocurrencies” in India, with some exceptions to promote the general use of blockchain technology. The goal is to roll out an official government-issued digital currency while outlawing private alternatives like Bitcoin — which reached &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-bitcoin/bitcoin-hits-record-high-trades-as-high-as-59755-on-saturday-idUSKBN2B50B1?il=0"&gt;a record high&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, trading at $59,755.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kn9Wbx"&gt;No other large country has implemented this kind of ban on cryptocurrency. China, which has some of the harshest policies, &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-didnt-ban-bitcoin-entirely-says-beijing-arbitration-commission"&gt;prohibits trading coins&lt;/a&gt; but does not outlaw owning them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhCezp"&gt;The in-progress proposal follows a years-long fight between cryptocurrency traders and the Indian government. India’s central bank cracked down on Bitcoin in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43669730"&gt;banning banks&lt;/a&gt; from dealing in virtual currencies. Its Supreme Court &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/india-lifts-ban-on-cryptocurrency-trading/"&gt;overturned the decision&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, but it didn’t necessarily preclude passing a new, even stricter law — like what’s on the table now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook strikes News Corp deal to license news from Australian media outlets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ISMtkvnt2MdvraASgbPRgaLmKiQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68971020/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RCbuNr"&gt;Facebook last month shut off the ability for Australian users and media organizations to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287776/facebook-block-news-australia-regulation-media-link-sharing"&gt;share news links in the country&lt;/a&gt;, and now it seems the company’s extraordinary measure has resulted in a compromise for the most interested parties as media giant News Corp has &lt;a href="https://newscorp.com/2021/03/15/news-corp-and-facebook-reach-agreement-in-australia/"&gt;struck a licensing deal with the social network&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jgd8HD"&gt;Financial terms were not disclosed, but the deal is a multi-year one that gives Facebook’s news platform access to major News Corp Australia properties, including news.com.au, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;. Google similarly struck a deal with News Corp last month, as the threat of a new Australia law regulating tech company payments to news organizations loomed overhead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEl2Rb"&gt;Facebook’s news shutdown in Australia wasn’t designed specifically to increase pressure on News Corp. Instead, Facebook wanted concessions from the Australian government about the then-forthcoming media bargaining law, which stipulated that major tech platforms like Facebook and Google would need to pay news publishers to access their content. Google also threatened to shut down its search engine in Australia, but it ended up &lt;a href="https://newscorp.com/2021/02/17/news-corp-and-google-agree-to-global-partnership-on-news/"&gt;striking its own deals instead&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="U1Mt8t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook pushed back against Australian’s media bargaining law, and it won&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1cTyAd"&gt;In a predictable turn of events, Facebook received its desired concessions, the largest of which involved negating the forced arbitration portion of the bill that Silicon Valley reviled if prior commercial agreements were struck, and the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296778/facebook-ends-australian-news-ban-bargaining-code-google"&gt;restored the ability to share news&lt;/a&gt;. Australia then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22283777/australia-new-media-bargaining-code-facebook-google-paying-news"&gt;passed the law&lt;/a&gt; and everyone more or less came out unscathed. Yet part of Facebook’s initial opposition to the law was that it gave the most powerful publishers too much negotiating power, and News Corp is &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/how-much-influence-does-the-murdoch-media-have-in-australia-20201015-p565dk.html#:~:text=A%202016%20study%20by%20academics,print%20newspaper%20readership%20across%20Australia."&gt;far and away the largest and most pervasive media conglomerate&lt;/a&gt; in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9nMYX"&gt;“Facebook would have been forced to pay potentially unlimited amounts of money to multi-national media conglomerates under an arbitration system that deliberately misdescribes the relationship between publishers and Facebook — without even so much as a guarantee that it is used to pay for journalism, let alone support smaller publishers,” Nick Clegg, Facebook’s global policy chief, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299229/facebook-one-billion-investment-news-industry-australia-google-regulation"&gt;argued at the time&lt;/a&gt; in a public blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0K52d"&gt;Following the Australia showdown, Facebook said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299229/facebook-one-billion-investment-news-industry-australia-google-regulation"&gt;commit $1 billion to news industry deals over the next three years&lt;/a&gt; to foster partnerships with media organizations, with the unspoken stipulation that it not have to face another media bargaining law like Australia’s. (Facebook said it reserves the right to shut down news in Australia again if it so chooses.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lb8fc"&gt;It appears Facebook and News Corp have made up, and this new deal will make News Corp-owned publishers accessible on the Facebook News platform in Australia. In addition to news.com.au and &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;, the latter of which has a separate deal as a broadcast organization, News Corp says it’s also licensing content from major newspapers like &lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Herald Sun&lt;/em&gt; in Victoria, and &lt;em&gt;The Courier-Mail&lt;/em&gt;, as well as numerous regional publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVvao9"&gt;“The agreement with Facebook is a landmark in transforming the terms of trade for journalism, and will have a material and meaningful impact on our Australian news businesses,” said News Corp CEO Robert Thomson in a statement. “Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch led a global debate while others in our industry were silent or supine as digital dysfunctionality threatened to turn journalism into a mendicant order.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZvNLI"&gt;“We’re glad to have this deal in place and look forward to bringing Facebook News to Australia,” wrote Faceboo’s global news partnerships chief Campbell Brown. Andrew Hunter, Facebook’s head of news partnerships for Australia and New Zeland, said in a statement that “the agreements with News Corp Australia and Sky News Australia mean that people on Facebook will gain access to premium news articles and breaking news video from News Corp’s network of national, metropolitan, rural and suburban newsrooms.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cricut is limiting the use of its crafting machines with a monthly subscription</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I3o6SBYpD-XO0MJUHOsvroA4ZZo=/65x0:3263x2132/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68970906/Screen_Shot_2021_03_15_at_11.52.22_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Cricut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C9ADxy"&gt;Cricut machines offer a customizable, automated way to speed up the precise cutting required in crafting projects, but the capabilities of these devices are about to be limited by an upcoming update. &lt;a href="https://inspiration.cricut.com/new-features-and-updates-coming-to-design-space/"&gt;Cricut is updating&lt;/a&gt; the machines’ accompanying software, Design Space, by putting caps on uploads that could restrict the number of projects Cricut owners are actually able to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgJF0N"&gt;Getting a Cricut ready to cut requires using premade patterns or uploading original designs to an application called Design Space. That’s been free and unlimited for all users in the past, but now Cricut is limiting users to 20 free uploads per month. To upload more, owners will soon have to subscribe to Cricut’s Access Standard plan for $9.99 per month / $95.88 per year or Access Premium plan for $118.88 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EnvzWl"&gt;Anything that’s previously been uploaded will be able to stay in Design Space without any changes or limits, but it’s important to understand that to use a modern Cricut, you need to use Design Space in some capacity. And Cricut machines themselves can cost anywhere from around $179 to $399, before the potential subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OBSE6bVcM2KP01Dtz6Vi1wdk6Go=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22372438/Screen_Shot_2021_03_15_at_11.39.19_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Cricut&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Cricut Explore Air 2, one of the many Cricut machines that require the use of Design Space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OTAR0e"&gt;At its most basic, Design Space is required to upload designs created in other apps so they can be formatted to work with Cricut machines. For example, a pattern for a paper flower made in Adobe Illustrator or a logo sketched in Procreate can be uploaded so the Cricut machine knows where to cut on whatever material is being used, whether it’s paper, fabric, vinyl, or even wood. Design Space works on its own as a creation software, but if you subscribe, it becomes more fully featured, with access to exclusive fonts, images, and patterns. Even with the optional subscription for more features, many users still choose to create their work elsewhere and only use Design Space for preparation before cutting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmndz8"&gt;Now with this new upload limit, a subscription is needed to restore the functionality crafters original bought a Cricuit for: creating as many projects as needed, with the only limit being materials, rather than an arbitrary number set by a software update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yydrQY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wh1_EYJHCdY?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=5&amp;amp;start=5" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KSPA1P"&gt;Beyond the ever-present, scary reality that companies can limit the capabilities of a product you “own” after the fact, multiple Cricut owners have contacted &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about an even more glaring problem: projects can often require multiple uploads to complete, meaning that 20 upload limit could be reached even faster. This could be because of user error or a complex project requiring multiple pieces, but for any person who uses a Cricut in their business, that means they could very well be forced to subscribe if they want to keep up their normal level of productivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20nAVj"&gt;In a statement provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Cricut said it remains committed to its plan and “creating the best possible experience for [its] members”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OqdDB4"&gt;Cricut announced changes to our Design Space software, including new Offset and Project Collection features, as well as an update to personal uploads, limiting image and pattern uploads to 20 per month for members without a Cricut Access subscription. All users will still be able to design and cut regardless of uploads. Cricut remains dedicated to creating the best possible experience for our members, and we will continue to support our community of makers as our top priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="564Jy5"&gt;The response to Cricut’s planned change is also boiling over on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cricut/"&gt;the company’s unofficial subreddit&lt;/a&gt;. Cricut users have shared the contact information of Cricut employees and launched &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/cricut-cricut-design-space-update-petition"&gt;a Change.org petition&lt;/a&gt; in protest of the upcoming update. Cricut says it will start prompting users to subscribe in Design Space in the next few weeks until the upload limit goes into effect at an unspecified date.&lt;/p&gt;
