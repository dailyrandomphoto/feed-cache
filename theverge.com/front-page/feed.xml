    <title>How to type special characters on a Windows PC</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nBtPSS"&gt;Here’s the situation: you’re typing a report for work, and you suddenly have to write the phrase “Jones née Berkowitz.” Or you are adding a phrase in Spanish and need to use the word “años.” How do you add the special characters to the letters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JFT5W"&gt;Special characters (also known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic"&gt;diacritical marks&lt;/a&gt;) may be more common in certain languages, but there are plenty of circumstances in which English speakers may need to use them. But because they are so rare in English, native English speakers may not have learned how to add those marks to documents, emails, or other writings. It’s not difficult to add them to your Windows document, although it’s not quite as smooth an operation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22347140/apple-mac-special-characters-how-to"&gt;as on a Mac&lt;/a&gt;, where all you have to do is hold the appropriate key down. (In fact, once upon a time, you would have had to look up the symbol character codes...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F2UXCI"&gt;Use the touch keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cK212s"&gt;The easiest way to add diacritical marks to a document is to enable the Windows touch keyboard. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-get-easy-access-to-symbols-emojis-and-other-special-characters/"&gt;Ed Bott from &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for first leading me to this method.) The touch keyboard automatically appears if you’re using a Windows tablet or if you’re using a PC in tablet mode. If you don’t have a touchscreen, you can use the keyboard icon that appears in the taskbar, on the right side near the date. Don’t see it? This is how you get it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="3mKSNx"&gt;Right-click on the taskbar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="guGqAk"&gt;Click on “Show touch keyboard button”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on “Show touch keyboard button.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zX5tGpTALETlEtcWIgb7syaRgx4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397964/special1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on “Show touch keyboard button.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="isigzU"&gt;Now, when you want to use a special character:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MiArSp"&gt;Click on the touch keyboard icon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vkiOjM"&gt;The touch keyboard will appear. Long press (with your mouse button or, if you have a touchscreen, your finger) on the letter you want to use &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mxWCG7"&gt;You’ll now see several extra keys showing the ways you can type that letter with different symbols. Select the one you want, and it will appear on your document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YsM2S5"&gt;If you want to enter an emoji, click on the emoji key (on the left of the “space bar”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select the special character you want, and it will appear on your document." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ianQf8kqWF7MLYr-Jkzt0fc99TM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397970/special3.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select the special character you want, and it will appear on your document.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3KuFuR"&gt;Use the emoji keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ias5hY"&gt;Another keyboard that you can access and can let you easily add special characters to your text is Windows’ emoji keyboard. Yes, it is mainly for adding emojis to your text, but it’s got other uses as well. And it’s simple to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YHAmrI"&gt;Hold down the Windows key (the one with the Windows symbol on it) and hit the period key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yERfP0"&gt;The emoji keyboard will pop up, showing a variety of emojis. Click on the symbols tab on top (the third from the left).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The emoji keyboard also lets you access special characters." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0rwi7njzEZ8YaPRWp_OnJwmWVBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399994/emoji4.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The emoji keyboard also lets you access special characters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="RBvuoy"&gt;Use the menu on the bottom line to select the type of symbol you’re looking for (if you’re looking for characters to use within text, you’ll probably want to select this one: Ç). Then scroll down until you find the character you want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="blWVk1"&gt;Use the character map&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MX8CIZ"&gt;If you’d like to try a more old-fashioned method of adding special characters to Windows, you can use the character map, which is a less polished and more complicated version of the touch keyboard but offers a similar service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCcyqh"&gt;To access it on your Windows 10 system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QyOOxs"&gt;Type “character” in your search field and then select the Character Map app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2thjaB"&gt;You’ll get a pop-up map showing a bunch of special characters for a specific font. You can change the font by clicking on the drop-down font menu at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The character map lets you access a wide variety of special characters." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t7GknZWGbXmLDWNLFDoIqxsW84U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397981/special4.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The character map lets you access a wide variety of special characters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4Xgqtz"&gt;Click on the letter(s) or special characters that you want to use in your document and then click on the “Select” button. They’ll appear in the “Characters to copy” field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XN5Maf"&gt;Once you’ve selected all the characters you want, click on the “Copy” button and then paste the character(s) into your document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TyzBrw"&gt;Use the US International Keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xFd69h"&gt;If you’re an English speaker who is multilingual and uses special characters a lot, you may want to try the US International Keyboard, which maps your keyboard to more easily allow you to add special characters. (Thanks to “shiroledat” for the tip.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zIVkO"&gt;First, you need to add the US International Keyboard to Windows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="L4pshC"&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Time &amp;amp; Language &amp;gt; Language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xnVyk8"&gt;Look for “Preferred languages” and (assuming you’re an English speaker in the US) click on “English (United States).” Then click on “Options.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rGKWxs"&gt;Look for the “Keyboards” section, which (if you’ve never been there before) will probably only contain a single keyboard icon labeled “US / QWERTY.” That’s the keyboard map you’re now using. Click on “Add a keyboard” just above it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="p6aTp5"&gt;In the pop-up menu that appears, scroll to “United States-International / QWERTY” and click on it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Under “Preferred languages,” click on “English (United States)” and then on “Options”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cP7g6d5Lqg42r94GE6Gz1vKeDsw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411514/send2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under “Preferred languages,” click on “English (United States)” and then on “Options.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on “Add a keyboard” and look for “United States-International”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LbxpVGvetBKsNgrO23ly0T16cN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411522/send3.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on “Add a keyboard” and look for “United States-International.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DLJYiS"&gt;Now you always have the choice of using either the standard US keyboard or the US International Keyboard. You can see which one is active in the lower-right side of your taskbar, near the date. It will either read “ENG / US” or “ENG / INTL.”  You can click on that to switch from one to the other, or just hit Windows key+space bar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on the icon to switch keyboards." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T3E5OjLpnUiIStTqkvN1nNO6byg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411664/send4__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on the icon to switch keyboards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EZgsPc"&gt;The US International Keyboard gives you two ways to add a special character:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gyKMWW"&gt;Use the right-hand Alt key in combination with the appropriate letter to get one of the more common combinations. For example, Alt+e will result in: é &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CRWm4n"&gt;Press the symbol you want to use and then the letter you want to use it with. For example, if you first press the ~ symbol and then the “n” key, you’ll get: ñ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0URckU"&gt;Washington State University &lt;a href="https://slcr.wsu.edu/help-pages/microsoft-keyboards-us-international/"&gt;has published a useful chart&lt;/a&gt; showing all of the symbols you can get using the US International Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F8Ftnt"&gt;Use the Unicode value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cLBy3k"&gt;If you look at the lower right-hand corner of the character map after you’ve chosen a letter or special character, you’ll see the word “Keystroke” followed by “Alt” and a four-digit number. This number represents the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode"&gt;Unicode value&lt;/a&gt; of the symbol, and it’s the time-honored standard for adding characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKmqL4"&gt;If you use a few special characters consistently, it can be faster to simply add the character you want using your keyboard. There are several ways to do this; here are two of the easiest (each of which has its limitations):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dMoLKy"&gt;Press the Alt key and then type the four-digit Unicode value. For this to work, you need to have a separate number pad on your keyboard, and the NumLock key should be enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PrXVUY"&gt;If you’re working with Microsoft Word, WordPad, Outlook, or another Microsoft app, you can type in the Unicode value and then type Alt-X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Hnw0dE"&gt;You can also press the Control key plus a symbol, and then the letter you want to accent. For example, Ctrl+’ and “e” will result in “é” — assuming you’re in a Microsoft app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="fcd8Jh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 26th, 10:50AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to add a section on using the Unicode values and the emoji keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOGU5g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 30th, 11:15AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to add another way to add special characters within Microsoft apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0fya3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 1st, 9:45AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to add information on the US International Keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Doom 3 for PSVR is a solid showcase for Sony’s Aim Controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gzcDAPPCuT8HnjBm5d9WPb92ZDM=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69060306/D3VR_41.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b2xVnB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt; has a long history with VR, so it’s a little surprising that this week’s PlayStation VR release is the first version ever to go on sale. Almost nine years ago, we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/30/3052191/doom-3-bfg-edition-announced-for-the-fall-we-try-it-with-john"&gt;visited Id Software luminary John Carmack&lt;/a&gt; to see his duct-taped prototype “Oculus Rift” headset for the first time, and &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt; was the game he used to show it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E24vvG"&gt;Carmack later moved to Oculus, of course, and Id never put out an official &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt; VR release until now. That said, it’s not like you haven’t been able to play &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt; in VR before — the game is open source, and there are various third-party mods available, including a &lt;a href="https://www.doom3quest.com"&gt;recent port to the Oculus Quest&lt;/a&gt;. So why is &lt;em&gt;Doom 3: VR Edition&lt;/em&gt; only landing now as a PS4 exclusive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkSJdU"&gt;After playing it for a while, I think I have the answer: the PSVR Aim Controller makes for a pretty good shotgun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zo82aG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y7eO3eATsxs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UQ96PR"&gt;For better or worse, &lt;em&gt;Doom 3: VR Edition&lt;/em&gt; is a straightforward port of &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt;, including its expansions. That means there’s a lot more content here than most VR shooters, but it also means you spend a fair bit of time watching 2D cutscenes rendered in the kind of quality you’d expect from a game that came out in 2004. PSVR games aren’t known for their visual pyrotechnics, though, and &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt;’s limited technology at least means it can run at a reasonable frame rate and resolution on a PS4 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhIeDq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt; itself is a somewhat divisive game that Id struggled to follow up for a long time before reviving the series with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/27/11795652/doom-review"&gt;excellent reboot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186572/doom-eternal-review-xbox-ps4-pc-stadia-date-battlegrounds"&gt;last year’s sequel &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Id decided to focus on atmosphere and horror with &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt;, leaning into the series’s moodier moments rather than rampant monster blasting. You spend much of your time traipsing through corridors, anticipating the next jump-scare where a demon bursts out from nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0wArH3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VR is often all about atmosphere, and ‘Doom 3’ has plenty&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rxv4Wt"&gt;In theory, this makes &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt; a much better fit for VR than the more recent &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; games, which are based around frenetic combat that’s difficult enough to keep track of on a regular monitor. (Id did adapt the reboot into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/15/16771826/fallout-doom-skyrim-virtual-reality-reviews"&gt;separate game called &lt;em&gt;Doom VFR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in 2017, but it suffered from awkward controls and didn’t play anything like the original.) VR is often all about atmosphere, and &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt; has plenty, even 17 years on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGGAuo"&gt;That said, this is still an old-school PC first-person shooter at its heart. The sprawling levels are designed to be navigated quickly, and they wouldn’t really work with typical solutions for VR locomotion like teleportation. &lt;em&gt;Doom 3: VR Edition&lt;/em&gt; forces you to be comfortable with analog stick movement and its affordances designed to ward off nausea, like a vignette that limits field of view and the use of snap turning instead of free motion on the right stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0N8prn"&gt;I didn’t have issues with nausea myself, though &lt;em&gt;Doom 3: VR Edition&lt;/em&gt; is definitely on the intense side of VR games. It does help that the PSVR is generally geared around seated experiences, given that it’s likely to be used in living rooms. You can play with a regular DualShock controller, which works reasonably well, but there’s no option for the Move motion controllers — probably for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PlayStation VR Aim Controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BHGKvL"&gt;Really, though, the only way to play &lt;em&gt;Doom 3: VR Edition&lt;/em&gt; is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/16/15643304/playstation-vr-aim-controller-farpoint-interview"&gt;PlayStation VR Aim Controller&lt;/a&gt;. Sony’s abstract gun-styled peripheral doesn’t have a lot of support, but it might as well have been made for this version of &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt;. It gives you all of the controls you need, including independent movement and aiming ability, and — crucially — it makes you feel like you’re holding a Super Shotgun. The game immediately becomes more immersive and easier to play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QB4og2"&gt;Not all of the weapons work perfectly with the controller. The starting pistol feels a little off with the Aim Controller’s two-handed setup, for example, and the machine gun’s sights don’t quite track with the controller itself. Overall, though, the Aim Controller is great to use, and it’s the only time PSVR ever beats competing VR systems on the control front. If you have one, that’s reason alone to check out this version of &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RgxlFJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The combat in ‘Doom 3’ wasn’t designed for VR&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bky4T1"&gt;Still, the original &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt;’s combat wasn’t designed for VR, and it does show. You’ll find yourself needing to use the 180-degree-turn button constantly as enemies move behind you, which really detracts from the otherwise smooth controls. There’s just no escaping the fact that the game was always intended to be played with a mouse and keyboard, for all that this version makes the most of its best control option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGlGwf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom 3: VR Edition&lt;/em&gt; is a good port, but it’s also a 2004 PC shooter that’s been adapted to VR, and there’s really only so much you can do with that. If you’re okay with an experience that ignores most of what we’ve learned about modern VR game design, and you have an Aim Controller, it’s a reasonable way to spend a few demon-destroying hours. But there are better VR shooters — and there are better ways to play &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5PE4r"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Doom 3: VR Edition &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is out now on the PlayStation 4. A PlayStation VR headset is required.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Nvidia RTX 4090 video wins 2021’s best April Fools’ joke</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RgeI0ZGTvLkz83PGGQWSPfXgONQ=/4x0:1813x1206/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059979/rtx4090joke.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The joke RTX 4090 card.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://captains-workspace.com/?page_id=268" target="_blank"&gt;Captain’s Workspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jXi55P"&gt;April Fools’ Day jokes are usually lame and lack any real effort, but 20-year-old Kasper Andersen has risen to the occasion for 2021 to deliver &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0frNP0qzxQc"&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 4090&lt;/a&gt;. The Danish hardware enthusiast loves to create homemade replicas of retro graphics cards, but his latest RTX 4090 project imagines a future where Nvidia’s card uses 1,000 watts of power, has a 12-fan design, and includes 48GB of VRAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSQ8f1"&gt;The video is a work of art, with subtle details like two power cords, RGB lighting, or the ridiculous GPU benchmarking tool that records more than 23,000 frames per second. My personal favorite is when the whole PC powers on and the desk starts wobbling, a Pepsi Max can tumbles by, and then the test rig swings around by itself and crashes into the monitor. It’s pure chef’s kiss.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QkxxHwj8FWgzqOgCxDfzfR_4mrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22412972/fC6ccck.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://captains-workspace.com/?page_id=237" target="_blank"&gt;Captain’s Workspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andersen’s joke Intel Xe GPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xVtyd6"&gt;If that’s not enough, wait until Andersen unveils the RTX 4090 Ti flagship with eight GPUs in SLI that “only takes up four PCIe slots.” Andersen has also created a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/s13iFPSyKdQ"&gt;similar video for Intel’s Xe gaming GPU&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a GPU to CPU switch on the top, “which allows you to use the card as a motherboard.” There are plenty more fun videos and projects over at Andersen’s &lt;a href="http://captains-workspace.com/"&gt;Captain’s Workspace site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qym9l"&gt;Andersen’s shenanigans won’t make the RTX 4090 any more real than the constantly out-of-stock RTX 3080. But if you’re still trying to snag a new GPU, hopefully this video puts a smile on your face while you battle scalpers, stock notifications, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;GPU prices that are utterly out of control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Magic Keyboard for the iPad is $100 off at several retailers again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new iPad Air with Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WjLpl9wmBHdz4PMZoSdR2Eboc-E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059965/vpavic_4244_20201020_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rUYgym"&gt;With the right keyboard, you can turn your iPad into a functional laptop (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229046/ipados-ipad-magic-keyboard-software-limitations-trackpad-html-inspect-source"&gt;sort of&lt;/a&gt;). If you have been eyeing Apple’s Magic Keyboard but are waiting for a sale, today’s the day. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Keyboard-11-inch-iPad-Generation/dp/B0863BQJMS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMagic-Keyboard-for-iPad-Air-4th-generation-and-iPad-Pro-11-inch%2F984505060&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDailyDeals04012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; currently have the Magic Keyboard designed for the 11-inch iPad Pro and fourth-gen iPad Air available for $199, $100 off its regular price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRPUiq"&gt;If you own the 12.9-inch iPad Pro model, don’t worry: you can buy the accessory at a discounted price, too. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736540284080851936#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has knocked $100 off the Magic Keyboard designed for this specific iPad, bringing the price down to just $249. Both Magic Keyboards include a set of backlit keys and a trackpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MbM10N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0fWiuI"&gt;Despite being three years old, the first-generation Microsoft Surface Headphones are still a good option for those looking for a pair of reasonably priced noise-canceling headphones. Usually $250, Woot is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://computers.woot.com/offers/microsoft-surface-headphones-8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently selling them for $106&lt;/a&gt;, making them one of the best values in noise-canceling headphones available right now. If you order the Surface headphones through the Woot app, you’ll receive an additional 10 percent off your purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kYLPHg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10373885"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="paJ861"&gt;Logitech’s G502 gaming mouse is one of the best on the market. Aside from the wired model being my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22244488/gaming-gear-recommendations-favorite-nintendo-logitech-microsoft"&gt;personal favorite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572162/remote-work-desk-home-set-up-writer-gamer-logitech-asus"&gt;primary computer mouse&lt;/a&gt;, my colleague Cameron Faulkner thinks both versions of the G502 are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;some of the best gaming mice you can buy&lt;/a&gt;. You can get the wireless variant, the G502 Lightspeed, for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-PowerPlay-Compatible-Lightsync/dp/B07L4BM851?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$118 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div id="htmnOS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9550529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P8cmk9"&gt;If you are in the market for a new laptop but were not interested in the MacBook Air deal we covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/3/30/22358166/amazon-kindle-oasis-beats-headphones-apple-macbook-air-m1-deal-sale"&gt;the other day&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon has discounted both storage configurations of the MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.

    <title>Nier: Replicant is coming out at the perfect time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ES68a1E-mirPBaTcPwTxQxTv2yU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059892/NIERRV1P2_SS_EV_BLACKSCRAWL.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dMxOwX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t expected to be a hit. It was a sequel to an RPG that could charitably be described as a cult classic, and its time-spanning story demanded a lot from players. Yet director Yoko Taro’s dark, poignant, and hilarious writing shone through, while the developers at PlatinumGames ensured the action felt great. It ended up selling more than 5 million copies, was ported to new platforms, and most recently was introduced to a brand-new audience through Xbox Game Pass. That makes now the ideal time to dig into its predecessor — which just so happens to be getting a remaster later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuB3ja"&gt;The first &lt;em&gt;Nier&lt;/em&gt; launched in Japan in 2010, and it was actually split into two versions: the main game on PS3, called &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Gestalt &lt;/em&gt;for the Xbox 360, which starred an older lead that Square Enix hoped would better appeal to Western audiences. The game was praised for its cryptic story and creative worldbuilding, but it also received plenty of complaints about dated graphics and clunky controls. The result was that it never really caught on with a big audience. And that’s where the new version — officially titled &lt;em&gt;Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139… — &lt;/em&gt;comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="GIcEKJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1899294"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qo0XLE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; appears to make the PS3 version the canonical story, and it’s centered on a brother who has to traverse a post-apocalyptic landscape in search of a cure for a mysterious disease that is slowly killing his sister. (It also takes place thousands of years before &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt;, so while there are connections, the stories stand alone pretty well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noFenL"&gt;I didn’t play either of the original versions, so I can’t speak directly to the changes made. But after playing the first 12 hours, it’s giving me the same vibes as &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt;. For one thing, it’s incredibly weird. You’re accompanied by a magic talking book that fires spears made from the blood of your enemies, and the game constantly shifts in unexpected ways; sometimes a dungeon involves fighting giant monsters; other times, it’s a text adventure full of riddles. Taro also &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; to break the fourth wall, and &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; does this in myriad ways, from complaints about sidequests to a sequence where characters talked directly to a narrator. This is a video game that doesn’t pretend to be anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KY8Bq2"&gt;There’s also a sadness that will be familiar to fans of &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt;. This is a story about death and loss, after all, punctuated by an incredible score from composer Keiichi Okabe. The muted color palette and world full of beautiful, crumbling ancient ruins only add to this feeling. There’s also a richness to what at first appears to be a fairly typical fantasy setting. Some of my favorite moments so far included visiting a desert town where its masked inhabitants live by a strict list of literally thousands of rules and learning how to communicate with them, or visiting a library and hearing people marvel at how much ancient civilizations used to write things down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3GC1XY8amNnxbSkh9y9weCp1KDs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411707/NieRReplicant_ver122_COMBAT1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bgFK8H"&gt;It also just feels great. Like &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt;, the action is relatively simple but fast and satisfying. You can pull off incredible moves just by mashing the attack button and rolling around, while your book companion handles ranged attacks, almost like a gun-firing drone. It’s the kind of game where I don’t ever avoid battles because they’re so fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWfvb3"&gt;But that’s not to say it’s exactly like &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt;. While the tone and gameplay are familiar, it is slightly clunky. The sidequests are full of interesting stories, but the ones I’ve played so far are pretty dull fetch quests. Running around collecting lizard tails is not a good time, no matter how beautiful the setting is. Similarly, while I love that the game tries new things, it doesn’t always work; the handful of frustrating platforming sequences are just one example. &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; definitely isn’t as polished as its sequel, even in this new and updated form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWA6XG"&gt;While the original &lt;em&gt;Nier&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t a breakout success, it’s clear that developer Square Enix had faith in it. Back in 2017, just before &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt; launched, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/16/13653128/nier-automata-square-enix-preview-yosuke-saito-interview"&gt;producer Yosuke Saito told me&lt;/a&gt;: “We thought that we really needed to let this new [intellectual property] grow and get bigger.” After spending some time with &lt;em&gt;Replicant,&lt;/em&gt; I understand why. Despite the rough edges, it’s a fascinating experience that I can’t wait to dig into even further — expect much more on the game later this month in my full review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRarTm"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Nier: Replicant &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches on April 23rd on the PS4, Xbox One, and Steam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How your gas stove sparked a battle over climate change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6mM7LTx7OA918VXMm-kOdhZUzC0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059825/Thumb_Textless__3_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TH68Fu"&gt;Gas stovetops have become a proxy battleground for the future of the planet. Some cities are trying to cut down their greenhouse gas emissions by getting rid of gas hookups in new construction. But the natural gas industry isn’t going down without a fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOTaqd"&gt;Pro-gas &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/how-the-fossil-fuel-industry-convinced-americans-to-love-gas-stoves/"&gt;marketing campaigns&lt;/a&gt; have most successfully waged its war in the kitchen, promoting gas stoves as superior to electric ranges. That’s made it more difficult for cities like Seattle to pass mandates that would limit the use of gas in homes and buildings. What’s at stake in this fight is cities’ ability to cut down their greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zw24Nz"&gt;Further complicating things, the gas industry has, for decades, framed itself as a “cleaner” alternative to fossil fuels like coal and oil. “We should probably discuss the name of it: ‘Natural gas.’” says Panama Bartholomy, executive director of the nonprofit Building Decarbonization Coalition in California. “It has been perhaps one of the most successful marketing campaigns that we’ve seen from a large industry to call what is really a dangerous pollutant, something natural.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="yQfGfv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The science that’s given us a new perspective on natural gas&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bIz5WX"&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6398/186"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has chipped away at that all-natural image. It turns out that the process of extracting natural gas and getting it to people’s homes can do serious damage to the climate because it belches out so much methane. Methane is a super potent greenhouse gas with even more power to heat up the planet than carbon dioxide. What’s more, gas stoves can also &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/5/7/21247602/gas-stove-cooking-indoor-air-pollution-health-risks"&gt;affect air quality&lt;/a&gt; inside the home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTT5CL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; dove into the science that’s given us a new perspective on natural gas. And we explore what this tussle over stovetops might mean for our homes and the environment.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mI8RHq"&gt;The Cat S62 Pro — and that’s Cat as in Caterpillar, the construction company — is now available in the US. The rugged smartphone is the latest device to feature Cat branding (it’s technically a product of licensee Bullitt Group) and builds on its predecessors’ integrated thermal camera capabilities. It’s designed with construction and industrial workers in mind,  and at $699, it’s a more attractively priced follow up to 2018’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/22/17039758/thermal-camera-caterpillar-s61-update-s60-smartphone-android-price"&gt;S61&lt;/a&gt;, which debuted in the US at $899.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tQ7qG"&gt;Introduced last summer for sale in the UK, the S62 Pro features solid (if not super competitive) phone specs, which isn’t guaranteed in the rugged phone class. You’ll get a 5.7-inch 1080p display, a Snapdragon 660 processor with 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 4,000mAh battery. But unlike mainstream midrange devices launching now, you won’t get 5G connectivity or Android 11 pre-installed; it ships with Android 10 and Cat says it will provide an update to 11. While the S62 Pro is significantly less expensive than its predecessor, it no longer offers the air quality and distance measurement sensors, and uses a slightly smaller battery (compared to 4,500mAh).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1f4rhd"&gt;That’s the boring stuff. The exciting bits that the S62 Pro has to offer include its marquee feature: a built-in Flir thermal imaging camera with four times as many thermal pixels as its predecessor. The phone offers new modes that allow users to adjust and blend overlaid information from the standard 12-megapixel camera, providing more context to the thermal image. There’s also an option to set an alarm that will notify you when a certain temperature level is detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Lgww6"&gt;As for its rugged credentials, the S62 Pro is rated at IP68 and IP69: the first indicates that it’s safe to submerge in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes, the second that it can withstand high pressure spray. The company says it’s been tested against even harsher conditions than this, but is warrantied to the level of those official IP ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9UdOXrH33qslNvSdecVI7V2Jm4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411957/cat_s62_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Cat Phones&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S62 is built to withstand harsh work environments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vQnKfY"&gt;It can withstand drops of up to six feet onto a steel surface, and its Gorilla Glass 6 screen is bolstered by an additional factory-fitted screen protector. The S62 Pro also meets requirements of the MIL-STD-810 military standard, including vibration and thermal shock resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCjmVl"&gt;The S62 Pro isn’t currently available through any of the major US carriers, but is being offered unlocked &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.catphones.com%2Fen-us%2Fcat-s62-pro-smartphone%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F1%2F22360767%2Fcaterpillar-s62-pro-us-availability-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;directly from Cat phones&lt;/a&gt; and third parties including Amazon and Home Depot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former NASA chief Jim Bridenstine joins satellite internet firm Viasat’s board</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RUJF1i"&gt;Former NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine is joining space-based broadband firm Viasat’s board of directors as his latest post-NASA gig, after joining a space-focused private equity firm in January. Wading into the world of satellite internet, he says he’s concerned about the digital divide and the future of humanity, and he wants to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6NgmL"&gt;“When I left NASA I had a lot of different phone calls and texts on what I should be doing next or what I could be doing next,” Bridenstine told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. A mentor, he said, suggested he reach out to companies he’s interested in, so he emailed Viasat’s co-founder and executive chairman Mark Dankberg and asked if they need any help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vf0F10"&gt;“There’s a digital divide and we need to close that,” the former congressman and NASA chief said, adding that he thinks Viasat’s approach of beaming internet from long-distance orbits with massive, high-throughput satellites is the right plan. He said he was also attracted by the company’s goal of cutting internet costs — almost invoking a mantra similar to the one he repeated nonstop at NASA about cutting costs of astronaut rides to space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNmu6J"&gt;“I mean, ultimately, if we want more of the world to be connected, we have to drive down the costs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WBWYu7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If we want more of the world to be connected, we have to drive down the costs”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8iwMI9"&gt;Southern California-based Viasat, a longtime provider of internet from space, plans to launch its technologically complex but long-delayed trio of internet satellites, called ViaSat-3, in roughly six-month intervals beginning in the first quarter of 2022. From super-high orbits, those three satellites will shower the world with broadband internet at a throughput capacity of one terabyte per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEp1tM"&gt;Smaller satellites in lower orbits, and in larger swarms, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22350643/oneweb-spacex-racing-broadband-internet-arctic-military"&gt;are all the rage&lt;/a&gt; in satellite broadband these days, where their proximity to Earth reduces the time it takes for internet signals to beam into homes and businesses. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;SpaceX’s Starlink&lt;/a&gt; constellation is growing rapidly, with over 1,300 satellites launched to space since 2019. Jeff Bezos’ Amazon is planning its own constellation called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348768/fcc-amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-approval"&gt;Project Kuiper&lt;/a&gt;. Both constellations are multibillion-dollar undertakings, an investment that has sent other companies into bankruptcy. Viasat also has plans to send 300 internet satellites into low-Earth orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCYrNu"&gt;For Viasat, bringing Bridenstine on board will help the company get an edge in “space systems and network technology globally,” Dankberg said in a statement, adding that “Jim is also an ardent proponent of preserving safe access to space via proactive measures to protect the space environment and contain orbital debris.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jC3qM"&gt;“NASA obviously cares a great deal about preserving access to space, so Bridenstine’s insight could help Viasat craft arguments about space sustainability that carry increased weight on Capitol Hill,” said Caleb Henry, a satellite industry analyst at Quilty Analytics. Bridenstine’s experience leading NASA, Henry said, could help Viasat take a plunge into the civil space market if it wants to, like providing communications for deep space exploration activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXlbBZ"&gt;Bridenstine wasn’t sure how demanding the new job will be, but he’ll partake in Viasat’s quarterly board of director meetings and possibly its annual shareholder meetings. “But if there are other areas where I can either fill gaps or provide support during the course of the year, I have no doubt that Viasat will probably be giving me a call,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFaed0"&gt;Less than a week after leaving office on January 20th, when President Biden was sworn in, Bridenstine joined aerospace and defense private equity firm Acorn Growth Companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBonQc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 1st, 9:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added analysis from Caleb Henry of Quilty Analytics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple forced to offer Russian iPhone users local apps at setup thanks to new law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KZkFJaQkba3BLqSfK6QLRtsj_sw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059430/acastro_180130_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eRTAWg"&gt;iPhones purchased in Russia now show a list of Russian-made apps at startup, thanks to a new law which comes into effect today, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/01/iphone-setup-russia-government-approved-apps/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The prompt is part of the standard iPhone setup process, appearing after the user has selected other options like whether to allow Location Services or App Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FC5mg"&gt;“In compliance with Russian legal requirements, continue to view available apps to download,” the dry text reads, before showing a short list of just shy of a dozen apps. These include various Yandex apps, an email app from Mail.ru, a video live streaming service called OK Live, and popular Russian social network VK. A “Get” icon appears next to each app, giving the user a shortcut to install them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="du1KVB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here is how it looks in the actual setup. &lt;a href="https://t.co/QOUwwIGSnx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QOUwwIGSnx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Khaos Tian (@KhaosT) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KhaosT/status/1377476353633624070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rUaQhd"&gt;The prompt comes in response to a Russian law that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20977459/russian-law-pre-installed-domestic-software-tvs-smartphones-laptops"&gt;originally passed back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; requiring manufacturers to pre-install Russian-made software on devices sold in the country. It covers smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, laptops, and desktop computers. According &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-technology-software/russian-law-requires-smart-devices-to-come-pre-installed-with-domestic-software-idUSKBN2BO4P2?il=0"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the law is part of a broader attempt by Moscow to reduce its dependence on foreign companies as well as gain more control over the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcv9fv"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334641/apple-follows-russian-default-apps-law-setup-screen-options-user"&gt;Apple agreed to comply with the law&lt;/a&gt; by giving users the option to install Russian-made apps at startup. It’s a notable concession from the company, which typically maintains tight control over the setup process of its devices. However, Apple has been willing to make changes in apparent attempts to comply with Russia’s local laws in the past, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20985762/apple-maps-weather-apps-crimea-russia-territory"&gt;changing maps&lt;/a&gt; to show Crimea as Russian territory and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/31/17803638/apple-watch-pride-face-russia-block"&gt;removing a gay pride watch face&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaWGyK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes that the big beneficiaries of the new law look set to be Yandex and Mail.ru. But in a statement last month a Russian official said that alternative apps will be included if they prove popular with users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lqbpt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kG06a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
