    <title>Twitter’s ‘unofficial mayor’ Chrissy Teigen quits platform after years of harassment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Chrissy Teigen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H3o7C64JjinL2mrLpgtsXwy-0yA=/234x0:2766x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69024194/1231632327.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hgqRM5"&gt;Chrissy Teigen, a prolific tweeter the company once called the mayor of Twitter, quit the social media platform Wednesday night. In a series of &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210325015153/https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/1374898752545169409"&gt;now-deleted tweets&lt;/a&gt;, Teigen said Twitter “no longer serves me as positively as it serves me negatively, and I think that’s the right time to call something.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96AZxT"&gt;The model and media personality who is married to singer John Legend was a witty presence on Twitter, and she had 13.7 million followers on the platform, which she joined more than a decade ago. Teigen tweeted about everything from her kids to her &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cravings"&gt;cooking projects&lt;/a&gt; to personal challenges in her life, including a &lt;a href="https://chrissyteigen.medium.com/hi-2e45e6faf764"&gt;miscarriage she suffered last October&lt;/a&gt;. She was famously &lt;a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/07/165013/chrissy-teigen-donald-trump-twitter-fight"&gt;blocked on Twitter by former President Trump&lt;/a&gt; (who was himself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned from the platform&lt;/a&gt; in January) and was one of a handful of accounts followed by the &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/joe-biden-twitter-potus-follows-chrissy-teigen-1234889200/"&gt;official POTUS account&lt;/a&gt; when President Biden took office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIdBKT"&gt;Twitter even promoted her as its unofficial mayor, doing a “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/behindthetweets"&gt;behind the tweets&lt;/a&gt;” video segment in 2019 where she gave some backstory about several of her higher-profile tweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m3tCH1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Go &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BehindTheTweets?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#BehindTheTweets&lt;/a&gt; with the unofficial mayor of Twitter, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@chrissyteigen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/oCf9UMtL5O"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oCf9UMtL5O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter (@Twitter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1092845570694307842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 5, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DREi8v"&gt;But Teigen was also the target of vitriolic abuse and ongoing harassment both on and off of Twitter. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2018/01/01/chrissy-teigen-fights-back-after-twitter-user-drags-model-into-the-false-pizzagate-conspiracy-theory/"&gt;Pizzagate conspiracy theorists&lt;/a&gt; baselessly claimed Teigen and Legend were part of the nonexistent pedophile ring supposedly run out of a Washington, DC pizzeria. She said she &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/chrissy-teigen-blocked-million-twitter-accounts-deleted-tweets-epstein-1518008"&gt;deleted thousands of tweets&lt;/a&gt; and blocked more than a million Twitter accounts last July after ongoing harassment by QAnon followers. “For years I have taken so many small, 2-follower count punches that at this point, I am honestly deeply bruised,” she tweeted Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5H9bxv"&gt;This is a very bad look for Twitter, which despite all of its efforts to reduce harassment on its platform, was unable to protect a woman of color — and arguably one of its best-known personalities — from being targeted and harassed. The company declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWLhJv"&gt;Here’s the full statement from Teigen, which she tweeted out before deleting her account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RkzJps"&gt;Hey. For over 10 years, you guys have been my world. I honestly owe so much to this world we have created here. I truly consider so many of you my actual friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qtj7HO"&gt;But it’s time for me to say goodbye. This no longer serves me as positively as it serves me negatively, and I think that’s the right time to call something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1qhZM"&gt;My life goal is to make people happy. The pain I feel when I don’t is too much for me. I’ve always been portrayed as the strong clap back girl but I’m just not. My desire to be liked and fear of pissing people off has made me somebody you didn’t sign up for, and a different human than I started out here as! Live well, tweeters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="38sFWX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: John Legend is on the board of directors for Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vivo X60 flagship series announced with Zeiss-branded camera system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jEV6tL8QcY4DGjvLaJYlxo_z9A4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69024156/DSCF7692.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RgiJzL"&gt;Vivo has announced its latest international flagship phones, the X60 series. The highest-end model is the X60 Pro Plus, which is coming first to India, while the X60 and X60 Pro are also launching in the UK and several other markets. Vivo previously launched the X60 series in China but with substantially different specs to these new global models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NtRkq"&gt;Vivo’s main focus with the X60 series is the cameras. The company has started a new partnership with Zeiss that it says includes the use of T* optical coating and swirly bokeh simulation based on the lens maker’s classic Biotar design. These kinds of collaborations tend to be more marketing hype than genuine selling points, but the X60 Pro Plus’ formidable camera bump at least looks the part.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZYlEe9ldzVQZsbFpCA_qZAVmHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22396445/DSCF7696.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ak9i5g"&gt;Whether Zeiss had anything to do with it or not, the X60 Pro Plus has some impressively versatile camera hardware. Its quad-camera setup consists of a 50-megapixel Samsung GN1 primary sensor, a 48-megapixel ultrawide with Vivo’s gimbal-style stabilization, a 32-megapixel 2x telephoto, and an 8-megapixel 5x periscope telephoto, as well as a 32-megapixel selfie camera. We’ll have to see how the system performs in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNgWrF"&gt;The rest of the X60 Pro Plus’ spec sheet is suitably flagship-level. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and comes in a single blue vegan leather model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The display is a 6.56-inch 1080p OLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate. The battery is 4,200mAh and fast-charges at up to 55W, though unfortunately (as is universally the case for Vivo) there’s no wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ldUGXhV7cDteShRU434B9NMZ2vI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22396444/DSCF7693.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1dYiCn"&gt;The X60 and X60 Pro step down to a triple-camera system with a 48-megapixel main sensor, a 13-megapixel ultrawide, and a 13-megapixel 2x telephoto. They both use a Snapdragon 870 processor, which is paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage on the X60 Pro and 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage on the X60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je0qnb"&gt;The X60 Pro Plus will cost Rs. 69,990 (~$960) in India, while the X60 Pro is Rs. 49,990 (~$690) and the X60 is Rs. 41,990 (~$580). Preorders begin today and the phones will be available on April 2nd. Details on the release in Europe and other markets will be announced later.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy VIII is now on iOS and Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUCHZe0su5-4nZRYaB4_XOI7l9A=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69024060/ss_978887f770227fdd7c54bf8216677b51fcb294a8.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kDL5rn"&gt;The oft-forgotten &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VIII&lt;/em&gt; has made its way to smartphones, just a few decades after it originally debuted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXT0Mn"&gt;Today, Square Enix launched the classic roleplaying game on both &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-fantasy-viii-remastered/id1326740784"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFVIII"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;; it’s available for $16.99 right now, but that price will jump to $20.99 starting on April 5th. &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VIII &lt;/em&gt;first launched on the original PlayStation back in 1999, though this version is the more recent remaster, which hit consoles like the Xbox One, PS4, and Switch in 2019. The game is also available on Steam. In addition to improved visuals, the remaster includes some quality-of-life tweaks, like the option to speed up combat and world exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S61gjI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We decided to take on the challenge to focus on ‘love’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sbb8ZK"&gt;And while &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; tends to garner much of the franchise’s nostalgia — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4"&gt;and the big-budget remakes&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;VIII&lt;/em&gt; is a notable entry in the series, one that saw &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; expand into more adult storytelling. It was still full of battles and monsters and magic, but the core of the experience was on a budding romance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URTczi"&gt;“The &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; series always placed emphasis on drama, and with &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt;, from a broad perspective, I believe we reached the pinnacle of depicting a story where ‘protagonists face a large force of evil,’” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20847283/final-fantasy-8-remaster-switch-xbox-ps4-yoshinori-kitase-interview"&gt;director Yoshinori Kitase told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1R4fdm"&gt;“On the flip side, the series has evolved on a more granular level since &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy IV&lt;/em&gt;, as it began to include narratives that focused on characters’ emotions. With the advancement of CG technology allowing for a more delicate expression of characters’ emotions, we decided to take on the challenge to focus on ‘love,’ which delves deeper into the internal aspect of humankind, as our theme.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart will have the Xbox Series X / S available at 3PM ET today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TyufjeA9rSs3VHiHMtnCN-XipQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69024003/vpavic_4275_20201030_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series S and Series X consoles. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FlmZ8E"&gt;If you have been keeping up with the news, you probably know that the Xbox Series X and S consoles are some of the most difficult things to buy currently. If you are looking for another opportunity to buy either console, Walmart will have both the Series X and S available at 3PM ET today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPE4nz"&gt;Unlike previous restocks at Walmart, the retailer is limiting purchases for both consoles by paying for the gadget with an Xbox All Access plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PjTBTm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="E7Eydo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10384596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YVYN0M"&gt;Once you’ve secured your next-gen Xbox, you’ll likely be looking into some new accessories that will take advantage of your new console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCLUlt"&gt;You could always buy some new games for your console, although the pool of true next-gen games for Series X / S is a bit thin. There’s a ton of third-party titles worth picking up, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-Xbox-One-Standard/dp/B087XR383W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VXFTPBK/ref=twister_B08WQ75YMZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SJ2T3CW/ref=twister_B07SW1PC5K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs Legion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, older titles released on Xbox, including &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fgears-5%2Fc2kdnlt2h7dm%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhalo-the-master-chief-collection%2F9MT8PTGVHX2P%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; received updates that take advantage of the next-gen hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbMwbi"&gt;Also, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF248LD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a second controller&lt;/a&gt; is good for players who are likely buying this console to share with someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z0emiA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10367357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="thARky"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sGVDrM"&gt;If you are in the market for a new TV that has fantastic picture quality and contrast and includes support for HDMI 2.1 to help you get the most out of your Xbox Series X / S, Best Buy has a deal on Vizio’s 4K OLED TVs. You can buy a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735893593609578015#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for $1,200&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735893770235738791#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,500&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5gullo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733767"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Motorola phones will now include endangered languages from Latin America</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tnUjdxZaikZ4omNhSQJosnT0WH8=/71x0:832x507/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69023912/Motorola_Picture_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motorola is adding Nheengatu and Kaingang to its language menus in Android.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ESvkqF"&gt;Motorola has added support for two new indigenous languages spoken in Latin America as part of a larger effort to make technology more accessible. Beginning today, Kaingang and Nheengatu will be among the language options available on Motorola Android devices. Any Motorola phone updated to Android 11 will be able to access the new language options, not just its most expensive models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLteUH"&gt;“We believe that this initiative will raise awareness towards language revitalization, not only will impact the communities that we’re working directly with, but right now we’re in the process of open sourcing all that language data from Android into Unicode,” Janine Oliveira, Motorola’s executive director for globalization software, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And by doing that we believe that we’re going to pave the way for more endangered indigenous languages to be added, not only on Android, but also on other smartphones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2nnKF"&gt;The Kaingang language comes from an agricultural community of people in southeastern Brazil, and only about half of the community still speaks it, Motorola found. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has designated Kaingang “definitely endangered.” This means that children no longer learn it as their first language at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DyE2D8"&gt;The Nheengatu community of about 20,000 people lives mostly in the Amazon, but only about 6,000 people in the region still speak that language, so UNESCO considers Nheengatu “severely endangered.” That’s the &lt;a href="http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/"&gt;second-most serious category&lt;/a&gt; before a language is considered “extinct.” UNESCO classifies a language as severely endangered if it’s spoken by grandparents and older generations, who may not speak it among themselves or to children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uqwhK"&gt;Both of the indigenous communities rely heavily on mobile technology, even though they may not always have reliable internet access, said Juliana Rebelatto, globalization manager and head linguist at Motorola’s mobile business group. “Teachers use their mobile phones in their classroom to teach their curriculum, so now that the phones will be in Kaingang and Nheengatu this will really help with the learning process,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yU6MN8"&gt;It makes sense that Motorola has a focus on Brazil: as of &lt;a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile/brazil"&gt;February, it had 21 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the market share in the country among smartphone manufacturers, ahead of Apple and second only to Samsung. Rebelatto acknowledged there isn’t necessarily a big return on investment for Motorola by incorporating the indigenous languages into its system; the move isn’t likely to add a huge number of new users for its products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ0cih"&gt;“We know that for most people it will be just another language in a drop down menu but for the people who speak that language, it’s a big innovation. It is part of the bigger mindset we have about digital inclusion,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hCcX7"&gt;Rebelatto said it was their colleague Robert Melo, Motorola’s internationalization lead, who first realized that there were no Latin American indigenous languages represented in any form of digitalized technology. “We started researching ways that Motorola could change that story,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0nSWD"&gt;The company partnered with the University of Campinas in São Paulo, Brazil, and worked with Professor Wilmar D’Angelis, a researcher in cultural anthropology and indigenous languages. “He has dedicated his life, 40 plus years, into researching languages,” Rebelatto noted, and he proved vital in helping the company narrow down which indigenous languages it would choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8qyPo"&gt;Motorola’s linguistics team worked with native language speakers of both languages throughout the project, which meant training them on the company’s tools and practices while on a multinational schedule. “We had to ship Lenovo PCs to communities where the mail barely got into,” Oliveira said, all during a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcyDjY"&gt;But the native speakers were eager to help, Rebelatto added. One of the women who was a translator on the project told them she couldn’t wait for the languages to be available on phones: “She now has all the argument she needs to convince her child to learn their ancestral language, because it will be on the phones they use every day.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gG1zhJp0pn1QSvseYwRsVtuRbng=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395624/Motorola_Picture_8.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4QTfaU"&gt;Nheengatu speaker Ozias Yaguarê Yamã Glória de Oliveira Aripunãguá worked with Motorola on the project and emphasized the cultural importance of the language. “You must understand that over time, Nheengatu has been weakening more and more, and today, many times, due to discrimination against the language, people are ashamed to use it,” he said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUwLJs"&gt;“But you can’t talk about the Amazon without talking about Nheengatu because the two are linked ... it’s part of the essence, it’s the core. The soul of the Amazon is Nheengatu,” he said. Seventy percent of fish names are Nheengatu names, and 50 to 60 percent of the city and river names are Nheengatu names as well, Yaguarê added. “There is no way to talk about one without talking about the other.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvKDwk"&gt;The team plans to open source all of the data it collected as part of the project, hundreds of thousands of UI strings, for anyone to use or research the Amazon languages, not only on Android, but other platforms as well. They had to customize a keyboard and are working with Google on the process of including the languages in G-board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEH5ei"&gt;“We don’t intend to stop here,” said Renata Altenfelder, Motorola executive director for brand. “We are putting this as an open source because we truly believe this should be something for everyone to join.” More endangered languages will be added to the project, she added, they just haven’t decided which ones yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmeiQ7"&gt;Rebelatto added that by digitizing endangered languages, the company hoped it would draw more attention to them and motivate other tech companies to consider similar initiatives. The Motorola project, she added, “will allow technology to have its rightful place in the preservation of not only the language but in their traditions, in their culture and their story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvHGhZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction March 25th 10:55 AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: An earlier version of this article stated that both endangered languages are spoken in the Amazon; Nheengatu is spoken in the Amazon and Kaingang is spoken in southeastern Brazil. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 780G chipset promises more flagship features for less</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1rTouLyZH7-32uTWAeoRpmEiqqE=/0x44:2266x1555/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69023942/Screen_Shot_2021_03_25_at_9.53.34_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2TZbFC"&gt;Qualcomm has announced its latest 7-series processor, the Snapdragon 780G, which trickles down features from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;company’s flagship Snapdragon 888 chipset&lt;/a&gt;, while still offering manufacturers (and, by extension, consumers) a more affordable phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzR4xq"&gt;The 780G takes the new top slot in the 7-series lineup, replacing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/4/20995714/qualcomm-snapdragon-765-chip-affordable-5g-phones-processor-low-price"&gt;765G&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/11/21252114/qualcomm-snapdragon-768g-5g-processor-765g-improvements-cpu-gpu-update"&gt;768G&lt;/a&gt; (the latter being largely a frequency-boosted version of the former). Obviously, there’s the usual boost in performance: the 780G features Qualcomm’s Kryo 670 CPU, which the company says offers a 40 percent boost in performance, and a new Adreno 642 GPU for up to 50 percent faster graphics compared to the 765 model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="437hTs"&gt;But the 780G also enables some new functionality, like the Spectra 570 triple ISP (image signal processor), which, like the Snapdragon 888, allows for phones to capture three simultaneous photo or video feeds at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpoyQ6"&gt;And like the Snapdragon 888, the Snapdragon 780G features Qualcomm’s sixth-generation AI engine running on a new Hexagon 770 processor, which can perform 12 trillion operations per second (TOPS) — twice that of its predecessor, even if it still pales in comparison to the 26 TOPS that the Snapdragon 888 offers. It also features the second-gen Sensing Hub that Qualcomm debuted on its flagship chipset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2p74Z"&gt;Lastly, the 780G has improved connectivity features, with an integrated Snapdragon X53 5G modem that promises up to 3.3Gbps speeds on Sub-6 GHz 5G networks. And like its pricier sibling, the 780G adds support for Wi-Fi 6E, meaning phones with the new chip will be able to take advantage of the fastest Wi-Fi speeds around as well as Bluetooth 5.2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6TEYv"&gt;The first phones with the Snapdragon 780G are expected to release in the second quarter of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tGDtuk"&gt;I usually prefer to highlight the best deals you can get on new tech, but sometimes a refurbished deal is good enough to make the grade. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony’s 1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; noise-canceling headphones haven’t slipped below $278 new (down from their usual $349 price), but a well-rated eBay seller is offering them in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FSony-WH-1000XM4-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Over-the-Ear-Headphones-Black-%2F274493598619%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeSonyHeadphonesDeal032521%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22350014%2Fsony-wh1000xm4-refurbished-headphones-deal-sale-ipad-air-half-life-alyx-vr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“like-new” condition with all original accessories&lt;/a&gt; included for $208. And with eBay’s offer code &lt;strong&gt;PICKCR5 &lt;/strong&gt;used at checkout, you can knock an extra 5 percent off, totaling $198 before tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2A49a"&gt;If you’re in the US, buying refurbished tech from eBay isn’t such a bad idea, as the retailer backs it with a two-year warranty through Allstate. If you encounter a problem with your purchase outside of the seller’s return window or warranty, you can file a claim to get a repair or a replacement if repair isn’t possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FaRw5Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10411678"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="UqA2h9"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Review: iPad Air Review (2020)|96393" data-volume-uuid="6c97cb5b6" data-volume-id="96393" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-295" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K47THS"&gt;If you’ve had your eye on Apple’s latest iPad Air with a refreshed design, a fast A14 Bionic processor, and a USB-C charging port, the upgraded model with 256GB of storage is $70 off for the first time at Amazon. Usually $749, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5SYG7S?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $680 in every color that’s available&lt;/a&gt;. This is $20 lower than the previous best price, according to pricing data from CamelCamelCamel.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4xIjCI"&gt;In case you missed it, &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; for VR is 40 percent off in celebration of its release about a year ago. Usually $60, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/"&gt;you can pick it up at Steam for $36&lt;/a&gt; until March 31st. You’ll obviously need a VR headset to play it. May I suggest the Oculus Quest 2 that starts at $299? The headset can be wired to your PC to behave just like a Rift, but for a wireless alternative, purchasing the Virtual Desktop app for the Quest 2 will let you play &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; over Wi-Fi without cables attached to your PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tANQ9h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10408507"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Adjusted AstraZeneca data shows COVID-19 vaccine 76 percent effective</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/22R7HS8Wd773Eg9-f43csDaDrFk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69023507/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PGPc8k"&gt;AstraZeneca released &lt;a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html"&gt;updated data&lt;/a&gt; on its COVID-19 vaccine, saying a more recent analysis shows the vaccine is 76 percent effective against symptomatic COVID-19. It’s a slight drop from the 79 percent the company touted in an announcement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344191/covid-vaccine-astrazeneca-effective-us-study-disease-protection-fda"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;. That number was based on outdated data, US health officials said in an unusual public statement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346135/covid-vaccine-us-astrazeneca-niaid-statement-concerns"&gt;rebuking the company&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaaioM"&gt;The original efficacy was based on an interim analysis using data collected until February 17th. But adding more data collected after that date showed that the vaccine may have been 69 to 74 percent effective, according to a letter from the independent panel monitoring the clinical trial and reported &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/astrazeneca-oxford-vaccine-concerns/2021/03/23/2f931d34-8bc3-11eb-a33e-da28941cb9ac_story.html"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The panel “strongly recommended” those numbers also be reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGcSZK"&gt;The new result is a few percentage points higher, but a finding in that range would have still been a good result and much higher than the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-s-cutoff-covid-19-vaccine-effectiveness-50-percent-what-n1245506"&gt;50 percent efficacy cutoff&lt;/a&gt; the US Food and Drug Administration said it wanted from COVID-19 vaccines last fall. A federal official &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/astrazeneca-oxford-vaccine-concerns/2021/03/23/2f931d34-8bc3-11eb-a33e-da28941cb9ac_story.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that AstraZeneca’s decision to publish only the higher number earlier this week was like “telling your mother you got an A in a course, when you got an A in the first quiz but a C in the overall course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgl9lt"&gt;Releasing scientific data in a press release instead of in a scientific paper means that outside experts can’t scrutinize the claims. The companies behind the first three COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States also first reported the results of their clinical trials in press releases. Their data held up, but experts were still &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/21556380/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-optimism-skepticism"&gt;critical of that strategy&lt;/a&gt;. The botched AstraZeneca data release shows why they were so cautious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkrkwX"&gt;The updated data indicated that, likelier than not, this vaccine is a good vaccine, and it will have a major role to play in the world’s fight against COVID-19. It’s cheap compared to the Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech vaccines, it can be stored at room temperature, and it’s been earmarked as the main shot to vaccinate &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/nov/23/oxford-astrazeneca-results-covid-vaccine-developing-countries"&gt;lower-income countries&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZnkYu"&gt;But for the past year, it’s been defined &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22274371/covid-vaccine-astrazeneca-south-africa-variant"&gt;more by controversy&lt;/a&gt; than good science. The company wasn’t transparent with regulators when the trial had safety issues, for example, and its clinical trial had mistakes and opaque methodology. The US clinical trial was supposed to clear up the confusion. Instead, the botched data release added to the mess just as public health officials are trying to shore up confidence in COVID-19 vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five-year-old Fairphone 2 getting updated to almost three-year-old Android 9</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yxzWufzeiJ-OPelFEGoc64fl6XM=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69023493/jvincent_160412_1017_8176.0.0.1484136509.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Farphone 2 was originally released five years ago.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by James Vincent / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T0b6Xx"&gt;Sustainable smartphone manufacturer Fairphone has gotten Google’s certification for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairphone.com%2Fen%2F2021%2F03%2F25%2Fandroid9-fairphone2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22349953%2Ffairphone-2-android-9-update-sustainable-long-term-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its Android 9 update&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/13/11414936/fairphone-2-review"&gt;Fairphone 2&lt;/a&gt;. Getting certification for a nearly three-year-old version of Android doesn’t sound that impressive until you realize that it’s running on a phone originally released five years ago when it ran Android 5. The roll-out of the software starts today, and will continue until April 18th, Fairphone says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjzkIV"&gt;It’s a length of support that’s basically unheard of among Android phone manufacturers. Although Fairphone 2 owners aren’t going to be able to enjoy the latest Android 11 features, the more important thing is that they’re running a version of Android that’s still officially supported. Google’s &lt;a href="https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2021-03-01"&gt;latest Android security bulletin&lt;/a&gt; from this month includes multiple fixes for security issues in Android 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FB9yH0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In order to get certification, we had to pass approximately 477,000 Google tests”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jfQlPs"&gt;The Fairphone 2’s Android 9 update has been in the works for a while and was released in beta &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairphone.com%2Fen%2F2020%2F06%2F18%2Ffairphone-2-gets-android-9%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22349953%2Ffairphone-2-android-9-update-sustainable-long-term-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;way back in June 2020&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Fairphone outlined the challenges it had in trying to support such an old phone, including the fact that Qualcomm no longer provides support for the processor inside the device, a Snapdragon 801, which originally announced back in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAK1pH"&gt;“To get Google certification for Android 9 for Fairphone 2 just as we hit five years of support for the smartphone is a huge achievement for Fairphone,” says CEO of Fairphone Eva Gouwens. “In order to get certification, we had to pass approximately 477,000 Google tests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="824F4E"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today we’re celebrating a milestone. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fairphone?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Fairphone&lt;/a&gt; 2 gets a major software upgrade 5 years after launch. We started Fairphone with a mission to encourage smartphone longevity by disrupting the electronics industry and this signifies that commitment.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/jdpOxZKEHQ"&gt;https://t.co/jdpOxZKEHQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/bQGbj54CEi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bQGbj54CEi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fairphone (@Fairphone) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Fairphone/status/1375048421971746818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SwZzZM"&gt;“We want to show the industry that this kind of thing is possible, that a smartphone doesn’t have to be discarded after 2-3 years, we can prolong it’s lifespan,” the CEO added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVEX66"&gt;The only other smartphone manufacturer that offers a similar length of support for its devices is Apple, which last year released iOS 14, its latest phone OS, for its 2015 iPhone 6S. Android manufacturers, while behind Apple, are improving. Samsung now offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;four years of security updates for its recent Galaxy devices&lt;/a&gt;, while Google offers three years of updates for its Pixel phones, and OnePlus says it &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/a-notice-about-oxygenos-11-for-our-previous-devices.1351579/"&gt;plans to release Android 11 for its 2018 OnePlus 6 and 6T&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByEc3U"&gt;The Fairphone 2’s update to Android 9 this long after release bodes well for the company’s long-term support of its more recent Fairphone 3 and 3 Plus phones. The company says the phones should be updated to Android 11 in the second half of this year, with “one more major Android upgrade” coming thereafter. Software support and spare parts availability is set to continue until 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel couldn’t wait any longer to kick off its next phase of movies and shows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O_eZp118hCR4QCxor10pEP5DlkE=/36x0:1104x712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69023439/Screen_Shot_2020_09_15_at_11.22.13_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dnCUCC"&gt;Disney is debuting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346947/black-widow-cruella-luca-disney-plus-streaming-premiere-access-marvel-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; as a Disney Plus Premier Access title&lt;/a&gt; alongside its theatrical release this summer, sacrificing one of its biggest potential summer blockbusters to its streaming service and forgoing what would almost certainly have been hundreds of millions (or even billions) of dollars at the box office in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q038dv"&gt;In a vacuum, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591175/black-widow-theatrical-release-streaming-disney-plus-hbo-max"&gt;Disney could have waited to release &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; until theaters were back to normal in a post-pandemic world, and reaped the box office rewards. But in many ways, the company is a victim of its own success. The ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe means that each new &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1019714/9358?subId1=VergeDisneyNewMarvelShows032521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; show or blockbuster film relies on previous Marvel entries, and Disney just couldn’t keep delaying its next wave of superhero adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="b8b7NT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Black Widow and Cruella are now coming to Disney Plus at the same time as theaters","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346947/black-widow-cruella-luca-disney-plus-streaming-premiere-access-marvel-theaters"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bg6bej"&gt;By the time &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; hits theaters — and now, Disney Plus — on July 9th, it’ll have been over a year since its intended release date of May 1st, 2020. Some of the ripple effects of those successive delays are easy to see: each time Disney has moved &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;caused a cascade of delays to its other films&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings &lt;/em&gt;(originally meant for February 12th, 2021, now out September 3rd), &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt; (originally planned to hit theaters on May 7th, 2021, and currently planned for March 25th, 2022), and &lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt; (moved from November 5th, 2021 to May 6th, 2022).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BI0pmK"&gt;And if the Marvel Universe was just movies, those successive delays would be fine; everything stays in the intended order, and while Disney would be out of its billions of box office revenue for an extra quarter or two, it’d bounce back once those movies started hitting packed theaters again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mIhfxgUUnX90u4zG9IO6fHB88WY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22306978/wandavision.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="omNQbL"&gt;But the company’s recent Disney Plus ambitions further complicate things. Disney can keep delaying its movies indefinitely — as, indeed, films like &lt;em&gt;No Time To Die &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt; have continued to do while waiting out the pandemic. But thanks to the tangled web of storylines crossing between those blockbuster films and the streaming shows, constantly moving back release dates for one thing — like &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; — can hold up the entire slate from moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOn3S8"&gt;The strain of scheduling is already apparent.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Take&lt;em&gt; WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, which&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;kicked off the company’s Disney Plus lineup earlier this year in its original 2021 slot. (This was mainly because COVID-19-related production delays forced &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Solider &lt;/em&gt;from its fall 2020 slot.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Yul84"&gt;Under the original, pre-delay schedule, the surreal &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;would have been the second Disney Plus show (after the more traditional &lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Solider&lt;/em&gt;), and would have been followed just a few short weeks after its debut by &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt; in March, which promises to pick up Wanda’s story where the show left off. Instead, fans will have to wait over a year to find out what happens next, ruining the carefully planned synergy between streaming subscriptions and box office receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ODhRZ"&gt;But unlike its films, Disney can’t afford to delay its streaming shows indefinitely. The fledgling streaming service is still extremely short on high-profile, must-watch shows — &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; being the only other non-Marvel title that fits the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XJOOEI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Disney needs Disney Plus, and Disney Plus needs Marvel shows&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XP67My"&gt;Shows like &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; are crucial to keeping subscribers paying for Disney Plus month after month, and Disney Plus’ continued growth in revenue is crucial to Disney’s future. As CEO Bob Chapek commented earlier this year, Disney’s “direct-to-consumer business is the company’s top priority, and our robust pipeline of content will continue to fuel its growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Avengers: Age of Ultron promotional stills (MARVEL/DISNEY)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p_9DRE-V6xTww9WyERzuihAOamY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3629872/Avengers255353118812fc-2040.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="odNSlE"&gt;The interconnectedness that has long been one of Marvel’s biggest strengths (best exemplified by its famous post-credit scenes and its incredibly popular crossover films) is conversely one of its biggest weaknesses here. Characters introduced in &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; are supposed to be in the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye &lt;/em&gt;series, for example, which is planned for later in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnSJGO"&gt;If Disney delays &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, it has to delay &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, lest it spoil surprises or confuse viewers. Delay &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; too much (as has happened multiple times already) and the company has to move all its other films — like &lt;em&gt;Shang Chi;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Eternals;&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Thor&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; sequels. The tie-in effects then continue to cascade; delay &lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt; too much, and you have to delay &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&lt;/em&gt;, which in turn delays that franchise’s holiday special for Disney Plus, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85iAoH"&gt;In a perfect world, Disney would want to wait for theaters to release &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;. But right now the company needs the long-term Disney Plus growth much more than a short-term windfall from one summer blockbuster. And to achieve that growth, it needs a steady drip of marquee content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V5Y4eR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Either way, Disney wins&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AcWqdq"&gt;The move isn’t a total loss for Disney, though. Moving &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; helps to keep the Disney Plus machine going and keeps the theatrical schedule on track for the fall when theaters can hopefully reopen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTwUEB"&gt;But the short-term loss could reap bigger gains for Disney down the line: if you want to watch &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; this summer, you have two options. You can go and buy expensive movie tickets in person, in which case Disney’s box office goals will be that much closer to succeeding. Or you either pony up for Disney Plus and a $30 fee on top, juicing subscriber numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dd4opU"&gt;And who knows — while you’re there, you might stick around to watch &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, or other Marvel films. At which point you might as well just keep your subscription active for &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt; that fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKqogr"&gt;Either way, Disney wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uB7OrZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
