    <title>The HomePod mini finally adds its long-promised ultra-wideband handoff feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8KUkQeNCTORVzfKiKt_ZCG5ck70=/0x70:2400x1670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68723965/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gYySHV"&gt;Apple has officially released iOS 14.4 and a matching update for its HomePod mini speaker, adding the long-promised ultra-wideband (UWB) handoff feature that will allow newer iPhones to more seamlessly transfer music, calls, and podcasts between the two devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2eY2ea"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple HomePod mini review: playing small ball","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="A5Dljp"&gt;While both the original HomePod and the HomePod mini have supported handing off music for some time, the smaller device features a U1 ultra-wideband chip that promises to make it even easier to transfer content over from an iPhone 12 or iPhone 11 device. The new U1-enhanced functionality also adds additional features, including new visual and haptic feedback. The U1-based system also will give the option to show listening suggestions when you bring your phone close and display media controls on your iPhone without requiring you to unlock it first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcqyfR"&gt;The ultra-wideband handoff feature was originally showcased when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21432979/apple-homepod-mini-features-specs-price"&gt;HomePod mini was first announced&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn’t included with the original release. Instead, Apple promised that it would be available later in 2020 (a deadline that the company has slightly missed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvIuOt"&gt;To take advantage of the new update, you’ll need a HomePod mini that’s been updated to the latest software, along with a U1-equipped iPhone 11 or iPhone 12 device that’s running iOS 14.4. The original HomePod isn’t compatible with the new functionality, though, due to its lack of a U1 chip. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon Fios is experiencing outages on the East Coast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/STHJWLoKzC7slsq44ZHqbze82kQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68722836/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SK6kEZ"&gt;Verizon Fios, the company’s fiber optic network, appears to be experiencing outages in many locations on the US East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPdUWQ"&gt;User reports of problems with Verizon &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/"&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt; peaked at more than 22,000, and there are still hotspots on &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/"&gt;Downdetector’s outage map for Verizon&lt;/a&gt; in Boston, New York City, Washington, DC, and more. A few &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers are experiencing outages as well, though one is seeing their service return occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/seXuvG_la5wS6LQRhP7-imbOyDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260844/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_9.25.33_AM.png"&gt;

&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Downdetector’s outage map for Verizon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, captured at 12:25PM ET.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zsiMLJ"&gt;Verizon’s support account on Twitter has replied to some individuals reporting problems, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354113894688698369"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; it has been “informed of a potential outage in the area.” The account also said there has been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354109889572982786"&gt;a fiber cut in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, and later on Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354156811964788736"&gt;the company shared&lt;/a&gt; that the cut was impacting a “small number of local Fios customers” and that technicians were working to fix things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1A4Z1g"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are aware of a fiber cut in Brooklyn, N.Y. impacting a small number of local Fios customers there. We have technicians on the scene and are working to quickly restore service.&lt;br&gt;^JAY&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon Support (@VerizonSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354156811964788736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="90C7DJ"&gt;People have also reported issues with Google, Zoom, Gmail, and more &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/"&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt;, but the reports appear to be coming from the same places that are experiencing problems with Fios. &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=status"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://status.zoom.us/"&gt;Zoom’s&lt;/a&gt; status pages aren’t showing any outages, so it’s possible problems with those services on the East Coast are tied to the Fios outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANgNyb"&gt;We’ve asked Verizon to comment, and the company says it’s looking into it now. Acting Federal Communications Commission chairwoman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1354132790044815360"&gt;Jessica Rosenworcel also said&lt;/a&gt; that the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau is looking into the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GrJNwU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have seen reports of internet-related outages on the East Coast, making it difficult for people to work  remotely and go to school online. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FCC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FCC&lt;/a&gt; Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau is working to get to the bottom of what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;— Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1354132790044815360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v6JxWC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 26th, 3:27PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added new information from Verizon’s support account and a tweet from interim FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio’s 75-inch P-Series Quantum X 4K TV is cheaper than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MM5wcwNIPd1CDbd4fspn58ndSsc=/29x0:787x505/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68723752/Vizio_P75Qx_H1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hP9EX8"&gt;Vizio’s P-Series Quantum X remains the company’s flagship line of QLED televisions. If you are in the market for a new TV and have room to fit a 75-inch device on your entertainment station, Vizio’s P75Qx-H1 model is $1,600 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730535517442483650" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1612716-REG%2Fvizio_p75qx_h1_p_series_quantum_x_75.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vizio.com%2Fen%2Ftv%2Fp-series%2FP75QX-H1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F26%2F22250776%2Fizio-p-series-quantum-4k-hdr-tv-deal-sale-ps5-xbox#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vizio&lt;/a&gt;. This is $400 off its usual price and the lowest we have seen this TV go for yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0bJvE"&gt;Released last fall, the P-Series Quantum X TVs can hit up to 3000 nits of peak brightness and support a variable refresh rate ranging from 48Hz to 120Hz at up to 4K resolution. Additionally, they feature 384 local dimming zones for great contrast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pshWo3"&gt;There are two HDMI 2.1 ports on the side and two HDMI 2.0 ports at the bottom. With HDMI 2.1 support, gamers will be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308026/vizio-2021-p-series-quantum-x-m-v-4k-hdr-tv-prices-specs"&gt;take full advantage&lt;/a&gt; of their PS5, Xbox Series X, or gaming PC, especially if their device is equipped with the latest Nvidia RTX graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iJybhI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10303742"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OjaTdy"&gt;Of course, this is a pretty big TV, so if you don’t have room for something this size but are still interested in a Vizio P-Series, you can grab the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/1/23/22244136/super-bowl-2021-tv-deal-sale-samsung-galaxy-s21-preorder"&gt;65-inch model for $1,200 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is opening up its full tweet archive to academic researchers for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DwzWEac3lDv9Fls_5_cZS3CPVKw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68723365/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V3gBCP"&gt;Twitter on Tuesday announced a significant shift in the type of data it makes available for free to third-party academic researchers interested in studying user behaviors and trends related to online discourse. Now, Twitter says it will no longer require researchers pay for premium or enterprise developer access and will instead make the “full history of public conversation” — what the company refers to as its full-archive search endpoint — available to any researcher or developer who applies as part of the launch of a new academic research track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83HTrd"&gt;The change is part of the company’s ongoing efforts to improve the Twitter API, the set of tools it makes available for those outside the company to build something on top of Twitter or use its mountains of data for research studies. Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21364644/twitter-api-v2-new-access-tiers-developer-portal-support-developers"&gt;launched its new and improved API last summer&lt;/a&gt; as a way to make amends with the developer and research communities, both of which have often found themselves at odds with the platform’s continuous and sometimes adversarial product development over the years. This contentious relationship began most notably in 2012, when Twitter decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/23/3263481/twitter-api-third-party-developers"&gt;cut off key developer access to the platform&lt;/a&gt; to maintain stricter control over what data it let potential competitors use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SDe1qs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our developer platform hasn’t always made it easy for researchers to access the data they need.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5MjvWQ"&gt;Twitter acknowledges the less-than-ideal relationship it’s had with the developer and research communities. “Our developer platform hasn’t always made it easy for researchers to access the data they need, and many have had to rely on their own resourcefulness to find the right information. Despite this, for over a decade, academic researchers have used Twitter data for discoveries and innovations that help make the world a better place,” write product managers Adam Tornes and Leanne Trujillo in a &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tips/2021/enabling-the-future-of-academic-research-with-the-twitter-api.html"&gt;blog post published today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBMDCn"&gt;Tornes and Trujillo point to steps Twitter has taken in the past year to improve its tools, including the release of a COVID-19 endpoint for free and a beta of the new academic research track to gather proper feedback ahead of today’s public launch. And the company is making a concerted effort to convince researchers it wants to help them, especially now that social media discourse has become more crucial in understanding online misinformation, election interference, hate speech, and other topics that took center stage during and after the 2020 US election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07L7Em"&gt;In addition to opening up its public archive, Twitter says it’s also giving approved applicants a higher monthly tweet volume cap of 10 million tweets, which is 20 times higher than what was available on the standard free track before. It’s also allowing more precise filtering to help researchers pinpoint tweets and other data relevant to what they’re studying and “new technical and methodological guides” for helping researchers find what they’re looking for and better make use of it in studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InpZt0"&gt;Twitter says interested academics and developers can apply to the new academic research  track on the company’s &lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/use-case"&gt;developer website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Axiom names first private crew paying $55 million for a trip to the ISS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VcueZF26hl4z5tRmKESFRhT09Vs=/326x0:3274x1965/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68723333/Ax1_Crew.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MeAO0j"&gt;An American real estate investor, a Canadian investor, and a former Israeli Air Force pilot are paying $55 million each to be part of the first fully private astronaut crew to journey to the International Space Station. The trio will hitch a ride on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule early next year, with a veteran NASA astronaut as the commander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5Q7Yj"&gt;The Ax-1 mission, arranged by Houston, Texas-based space tourism company Axiom Space, is a watershed moment for the space industry as companies race to make space travel more accessible to private customers instead of governments. Private citizens have trekked to the space station in the past, but the Ax-1 mission marks the first to use a commercially built astronaut capsule: SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, which flew its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21565237/spacex-crew-1-dragon-launch-success-falcon-9-nasa"&gt;first two crews to the ISS last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vfw0is"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A watershed moment for the space industry as companies race to make space travel more accessible to private customers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ILx4qV"&gt;“As the first fully private mission to go to the ISS, we feel an enormous responsibility to do it well,” Michael López-Alegría, a veteran astronaut and the mission’s commander, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Tuesday&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;“We realize that this is the trend-setter, the bar-setter for the future, and so our goal is to really exceed all expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiQnEj"&gt;Larry Connor, an entrepreneur and nonprofit activist investor; Mark Pathy, the Canadian investor and philanthropist; and Eytan Stibbe, the former Israeli fighter pilot and an impact investor, were revealed by Axiom on Tuesday morning as the company’s inaugural crew. Connor, 71, is president of The Connor Group, a luxury real estate investment firm based in Ohio. He’d become the second-oldest person to fly to space after John Glenn, who flew the US space shuttle Discovery at 77 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pxgl1"&gt;The crew’s flight to the space station, an orbital laboratory some 250 miles above Earth, will take two days. They’ll then spend about eight days aboard the station’s US segment, where they’ll take part “in research and philanthropic projects,” Axiom said in a statement. Living alongside working astronauts from the US, Russia, and likely Germany, the private crew members will roll out sleeping bags somewhere on the station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBzVGq"&gt;“There aren’t any astronaut crew quarters for us, which is fine. Sleeping in Zero-G is pretty much the same wherever you are once you close your eyes,” López-Alegría said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ac2T99"&gt;NASA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18656280/nasa-space-station-private-astronauts-commercial-business"&gt;updated its policies&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 to allow private astronaut flights to the ISS as part of a broader push to encourage commercial opportunities in space. The agency had previously opposed private visits to the ISS on US spacecraft. Seven private citizens flew to the station as wealthy tourists on separate missions in the early 2000s aboard Russia’s Soyuz vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GqAH5g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A $35,000 price tag per night, per person on the ISS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t3SNNJ"&gt;Private stays on the space station will have a hefty price tag, according to NASA’s 2019 announcement. It’ll cost $11,250 per astronaut per day to use the life support systems and toilet, $22,500 per day for all necessary crew supplies (like food, air, medical supplies, and more), and $42 per kilowatt-hour for power. That tallies to a nightly rate of about $35,000 per person, which, for the four crew members on the Ax-1 mission — including Commander López-Alegría — totals to $1.1 million for an eight-night stay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iss nasa" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xNF-vem7x53mAxSx2ZdgL9UAEug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/4448327/iss_wikimedia.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The International Space Station in low-Earth orbit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ttt5Cp"&gt;Those nightly costs are included in the $55 million price the private astronauts are already paying, Axiom says. The company bills itself as a “turnkey, full-service mission provider that interfaces with all other parties (e.g. NASA) for” the astronauts, an Axiom spokesman said. “Any and all necessary costs are part of Axiom’s ticket price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgnveJ"&gt;The Ax-1 mission will have to be approved by the Multilateral Crew Operations Panel, the space station’s managing body of partner countries that includes the US, Russia, Canada, Japan, and others. That approval process kicked off today, López-Alegría said. “I don’t think that there’s any doubt that the background and qualifications of the crew are more than adequate to be accepted by the MCOP, so I feel good about that,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJWyJc"&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, an acorn-shaped pod with seats for seven, was approved last year by NASA under its Commercial Crew Program to fly humans to the space station. Under that roughly $4.5 billion program, SpaceX developed Crew Dragon alongside its rival Boeing, which is about a year away from certifying its Starliner capsule for human flights. Both companies have contracts with NASA to fly six missions carrying US astronauts to space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptSTwC"&gt;The Ax-1 mission was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166657/spacex-tourists-iss-international-space-station-orbit-falcon-9-dragon"&gt;announced early last year&lt;/a&gt;. It is the second space tourism effort for SpaceX, which announced around the same time that it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/18/21142137/spacex-tourism-orbit-earth-private-citizens-dragon-space-flight"&gt;also working with space tourism company Space Adventures&lt;/a&gt; to send up to four private citizens into orbit around the Earth sometime in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yGTAHyv2WCzCkL9g-snj-3M9whU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22261032/crew_dragon.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule approaches the International Space Station carrying three US astronauts and a Japanese astronaut on November 17th, 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZR1C7i"&gt;Space tourism in recent years has sparked a wave of interest from the ultra-wealthy and investors as a growing field of space companies prove out hardware and ramp up uncrewed test flights in and around space. SpaceX founder and CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612410/elon-musk-overtakes-bill-gates-to-become-worlds-second-richest-person-behind-jeff-bezos"&gt;Elon Musk, now the richest person in the world&lt;/a&gt;, has made normalizing space travel and colonizing Mars SpaceX’s top priority. Billionaire businessman Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, which offers groups of four a few minutes of weightlessness in its massive spaceplane for a few hundred thousand dollars, became the first publicly traded space tourism company in 2019. And billionaire Amazon owner Jeff Bezos’ space firm Blue Origin will soon offer similar suborbital experiences with its vertically launched New Shepard rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoJK3o"&gt;Axiom’s chief executive Mike Suffredini co-founded the company in 2016 after spending 10 years as NASA’s ISS program manager. Already, the company is building its own modules called “Axiom Station” designed to attach to the ISS, offering room for science experiments and more tourists. Ax-1 “is just the first of several Axiom Space crews,” he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8ZD8W"&gt;López-Alegría, who has flown four times to space as a NASA astronaut, said he’s met with Connor, Pathy, and Stibbe a few times at SpaceX’s California headquarters and in Florida during SpaceX’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21565237/spacex-crew-1-dragon-launch-success-falcon-9-nasa"&gt;Crew-1 mission&lt;/a&gt; last year. He’ll be in charge of training them in person beginning a few months prior to the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Rpt8B"&gt;“They’re very individual, but they all have a very common thread, and that is they really want this to be a successful mission that paves the way for future private astronaut missions,” López-Alegría said. “It’s a good crew.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Plex is launching a game subscription service filled with Atari games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nn2PKWm4jJbU0OVP5VEYX1JUZNc=/204x0:2427x1482/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68723300/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_9.24.29_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g7l1gf"&gt;Plex, well known as a service for streaming movies, music, and TV shows from your own computer, is now adding another thing you can stream: video games (&lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/gaming/activision-blizzard-esports?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Plex announced the new service, called Plex Arcade, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.plex.tv%2Fblog%2Fgame-on-a-plex-blog-story%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F26%2F22250654%2Fplex-game-subscription-service-arcade-atari#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on its blog&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.plex.tv%2Farcade%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F26%2F22250654%2Fplex-game-subscription-service-arcade-atari#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;launched a website for it&lt;/a&gt;. The service will cost $3 a month if you’re a Plex Pass subscriber, and $5 a month if you’re not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6X3Fl"&gt;Instead of focusing on modern console or phone games like its competitors, Plex lets you play Atari games. It’s taking the arcade name seriously, as you can play arcade classics from Atari, like &lt;em&gt;Centipede&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Breakout&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Missile Command&lt;/em&gt;, as well as games from the Atari 2600 and 7800. Overall, there are 27 games available on the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wg6UMY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/504471886?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mCwic9"&gt;Unlike other game subscription services where you can simply sign up from your console and start playing, Plex Arcade has a few requirements. First is a Plex media server running on a Windows or macOS computer. There isn’t Linux support because Plex is using Parsec to stream the gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rk4JuZ"&gt;This means that you’ll have to sign up for a Parsec account, if you don’t already have one, and log in to it on Plex. There is a bit more freedom when it comes to what you can stream the games to, as Android devices and TVs are supported, as well as Google Chrome and Apple’s iOS and tvOS. Plex says you can play with “just about any Bluetooth-enabled controller.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpClTA"&gt;The service also supports you adding your own emulators and ROMs, which is nice, but it’s overall a bit of a tough sell. Even at the Plex Pass price of $3 a month, you’re paying a lot for games that, at this point, can basically run on a microwave. To be fair, it does let you run them on something like an iPhone or Apple TV, but the games are readily available on Android and PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RbMQvp"&gt;If you’re interested in playing them for nostalgic purposes, it could be worth a try, but you may want to set aside some time for it — getting it set up was an exercise in frustration for me, and I wasn’t ever actually able to successfully play a game. (The iOS and tvOS clients got stuck at a loading spinner, and keyboard controls didn’t seem to do anything when trying to play on Chrome.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hl52M4"&gt;If you want to try it out for yourself, there’s a free seven-day trial, though you will have to put in a credit card or link your PayPal. Plex says this is mostly a skunk works-type project, saying in the blog post that “[i]f there’s interest and we see some subs, it’ll grow into the glorious pheasant we know it can be. But if you guys drop the ball, it’ll die on the vine like a stomped ass &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goomba"&gt;goomba&lt;/a&gt;.” Harsh.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hacker pleads guilty to blackmailing Adafruit, Bleacher Report, and other sites for bitcoin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQUXAXRccvo6cJ2WOvMCJ0gq9Bg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68723287/acastro_200915_1777_hacking_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PX3UJY"&gt;A Cypriot man &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga/pr/cypriot-hacker-pleads-guilty-extorting-website-operators-stolen-user-data"&gt;pleaded guilty to hacking and blackmailing&lt;/a&gt; several US companies. Joshua Epifaniou admitted to computer fraud and paid $600,000 in restitution to his victims. He was extradited from Cyprus and will be sentenced on March 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQJRpi"&gt;Epifaniou operated what he described as a “hacking, extortion, blackmailing, [and] bluffing” scheme from 2014 to 2016. Going by aliases that included “Charley Sullivan” and “Richard Charley,” he picked targets based on their Alexa traffic rankings. That led him to several well-known online businesses — including the Turner Broadcasting-owned sports site &lt;em&gt;Bleacher Report&lt;/em&gt;, the DIY electronics company Adafruit, and the California-based gaming portal Armor Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cASddt"&gt;Epifaniou exploited security vulnerabilities or worked with co-conspirators to access sensitive information from these companies, then demanded a bitcoin ransom in exchange for not publicly releasing it. &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.gand.241979/gov.uscourts.gand.241979.1.0.pdf"&gt;According to an indictment&lt;/a&gt;, he threatened to publish &lt;em&gt;Bleacher Report’s &lt;/em&gt;entire user database online, successfully extorting around $19,000 in bitcoin from Turner. (Epifaniou apparently only had access to part of the database, which he received from a conspirator.) Armor Games paid $1,650 in bitcoin after he breached its computer network and threatened to release user account and payment details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjxXL0"&gt;A separate &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.azd.1055879/gov.uscourts.azd.1055879.3.0.pdf"&gt;indictment from Arizona&lt;/a&gt; mentions that Epifaniou also targeted consumer complaints site Ripoff Report. As part of that scheme, he gained access to Ripoff Report records and targeted companies with “reputation management” services, deleting at least 100 complaints and charging approximately $3,000 to $5,000 for each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kjfug"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22261020/N.D.Ga._1_17_cr_00327_MHC_JKL_33_1.pdf"&gt;Epifaniou pleaded guilty&lt;/a&gt; to one charge of computer fraud conspiracy and another of obtaining information from a protected computer. Each charge carries a maximum of five years in prison, and his plea deal recommends nearly five years in custody followed by three years of supervised release. He has also agreed to work as an undercover investigator for the US government.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s Commerce nominee backs changes to Section 230</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rhode Island Press Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NqABXmEtQMC8nzyBk-yAKSrxTmU=/0x0:5167x3445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68723221/1210801986.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Barry Chin/The Boston Globe via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bc6Wh6"&gt;In a hearing on her nomination for Commerce Department secretary on Tuesday, Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo told lawmakers that she will pursue changes to Section 230 if confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYgSuf"&gt;Responding to questions posed by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), Raimondo said that she would use the tools available through the Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to convene stakeholders, industry leaders, lawmakers and others to identify the means of reform to the pivotal internet law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="rWltJ0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:8777491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yQ6ou4"&gt;“I think platform accountability is important because I’ve seen in my own state that misinformation hurts people,” Raimondo said. “But of course, that reform would have to be balanced against the fact that these businesses rely upon user-generated content for their innovation, and they’ve created many thousands of jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhELXO"&gt;Last year, former President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273822/trump-signs-executive-order-facebook-twitter-section-230-social-media-companies"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; that sought to pare back platform liability protections under Section 230. The order prompted NTIA to draft a petition arguing for the Federal Communications Commission to reinterpret the law. After months of sitting on the petition, former FCC Chairman Ajit Pai declined to act on the petition. It’s unlikely that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22240827/biden-acting-fcc-chair-rosenworcel-net-neutrality-acting"&gt;Acting FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel&lt;/a&gt; or any future Biden nominee will act on the petition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIn7Hs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22048854/trump-nathan-simington-fcc-ajit-pai-section-230-moderation"&gt;Nathan Simington&lt;/a&gt;, now a Republican FCC commissioner, helped put together the NTIA’s Section 230 petition and is seen as a leading Republican advocate for modifying the pivotal measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tys6Bd"&gt;It’s unclear how the Biden administration plans to address Section 230 concerns, but Raimondo’s comments offer some insight into what could come in the future. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274812/joe-biden-donald-trump-twitter-facebook-section-230-moderation-revoke"&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year, Biden said that the law should be “revoked.” Once Trump signed his social media order, a Biden campaign spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274812/joe-biden-donald-trump-twitter-facebook-section-230-moderation-revoke"&gt;still wanted to repeal the law&lt;/a&gt; but disagreed with the former president’s executive order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4IyJQ"&gt;When it comes to addressing monopoly power in the tech industry, Raimondo said she would leave those decisions up to Congress and the Federal Trade Commission. Still, Raimondo told Johnson, “I believe in competition and innovation and as it relates to social media companies, I think they need to be held accountable for what they put on their platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeiHeI"&gt;“We have to hold these companies accountable,” Raimondo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oB6oJI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Testing sidelined as health departments focus on vaccination  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="COVID-19 Rapid Testing In Orlando, Florida As Coronavirus Cases Rise" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aWY6J1o5BsxHLHhG8GqRWh_8f5A=/198x0:4002x2536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68722998/1229559769.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Paul Hennessy/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EJpWh8"&gt;Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles was the biggest COVID-19 testing site in the United States, with the ability to test over 10,000 people each day. But two weeks into January, amid a chaotic and slow-moving COVID-19 vaccine rollout, the city shut down the site in order to convert it into a &lt;a href="https://californiahealthline.org/news/article/vaccine-ramp-up-squeezes-covid-testing-and-tracing/"&gt;vaccination site&lt;/a&gt;. The city closed another testing site, as well, temporarily slashing government-run COVID-19 testing capacity &lt;a href="https://californiahealthline.org/news/article/vaccine-ramp-up-squeezes-covid-testing-and-tracing/"&gt;by one-third&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKiIkh"&gt;It’s a pattern playing out across the country, in states like Florida, Nevada, and Illinois. Health departments are working with limited resources to fight COVID-19, and many had to make a choice: keep testing at the same level or focus on vaccinating. “We remain very concerned that there’s only so many resources to spread around,” says Lori Tremmel Freeman, the chief executive officer at the National Association of County and City Health Officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g460hA"&gt;Even before vaccines were available, health departments struggled to stay on top of testing and contact tracing. “That was before the introduction of the vaccine, and that’s another very complex, layered, response,” Freeman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uVI3Rw"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “There’s only so much staff who can do testing and vaccination”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fYfxRY"&gt;Collier County, Florida shut down &lt;a href="https://nbc-2.com/news/local/2021/01/03/fdoh-in-collier-county-cancels-all-but-one-covid-19-testing-site-due-to-vaccine-distribution/"&gt;all but one&lt;/a&gt; county-run testing site so that health officials could shift attention to vaccination. In November, there were &lt;a href="http://collier.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/11/COVID19testingsitesandhours.html"&gt;four&lt;/a&gt;. Staffing was the main issue, says health department spokesperson Kristine Hollingsworth. “There’s only so much staff who can do testing and vaccination,” she says. The department is now offering testing one or two days a week. “There’s still a need for tests, and we do get questions about it,” Hollingsworth says. “Thankfully, at least in our county, there are other clinics and urgent care sites that have tests.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqzdVa"&gt;On the other side of the state, the city of Jacksonville &lt;a href="https://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/article/city-converting-two-covid-19-testing-sites-to-vaccination-sites"&gt;converted&lt;/a&gt; two testing sites to vaccination sites. Fort Lauderdale converted &lt;a href="https://www.fortlauderdale.gov/Home/Components/News/News/5623/16"&gt;one site&lt;/a&gt;, which could handle around &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/coronavirus/fl-ne-fort-lauderdale-rapid-covid-20200821-qbfvrmum6ranfop64wv6jm475m-story.html"&gt;1,000 COVID-19 tests&lt;/a&gt; per day. In Illinois, officials &lt;a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20210119/dupage-closing-covid-19-testing-site-at-the-county-fairgrounds"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; the testing site at the DuPage County Fairgrounds outside of Chicago so that the health department could funnel support toward vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oso9y2"&gt;And in Clark County, Nevada, officials scaled back one of the main testing sites to &lt;a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/health/coronavirus-health/new-hours-at-texas-station-covid-19-testing-site-begin-jan-13/"&gt;three days&lt;/a&gt; a week before &lt;a href="https://news3lv.com/news/local/texas-station-covid-19-testing-site-to-close-for-vaccination-transition"&gt;shutting down&lt;/a&gt;. That site was running between 600 and 1,000 tests per day, says Fermin Leguen, acting district health officer of the Southern Nevada Health District. “The reason for that is because we didn’t have the resources to be able to open a mass vaccination site,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It is a big challenge for any health department to be able to accomplish both at the same time at a high level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSV1qi"&gt;Leguen says that he hopes Clark County will be able to reopen the closed testing site at some point. “We call this a temporary decision, but it’s contingent on us being able to to get more personnel so we can keep offering the same level of testing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B85iHq"&gt;Pharmacies and health centers also offer COVID-19 testing &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/community-based-testing-sites/index.html"&gt;across the country&lt;/a&gt;, so health departments aren’t cutting off all testing when they switch to vaccines. Department-run sites, though, are streamlined exclusively for COVID-19 tests and can process hundreds or thousands a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvLY2y"&gt;The relief bill passed by Congress in December included &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/21/covid-relief-bill-includes-about-8-billion-for-vaccine-distribution.html"&gt;over $8 billion&lt;/a&gt; for vaccine distribution, and that funding could help local health departments scale their efforts to vaccinate people. “Maybe we can convert testing centers into testing and vaccination sites,” Freeman says. Testing sites are running smoothly in many areas, and departments could expand on infrastructure that already exists. A drive-through testing center, for example, could add lanes for vaccination without shutting down testing completely. “We’re not reinventing the wheel, we’re taking advantage of what’s already been done,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxIu1q"&gt;The additional funding is welcome but is coming too late for health officials who are trying to jump-start their vaccination programs using their existing budgets. “Those resources were needed six months ago to help set up the systems,” Freeman says. “We’re just totally scrambling to play catch-up here.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSmUiP"&gt;For now, in many departments, that has meant letting testing slip down the priority list. Testing is still critical to help identify people who may be transmitting the virus, Leguen says. But when weighing the two, the department believes that vaccination has a higher value for the community. “I will give preference to vaccination because we want to protect as many people as possible,” he says. “The sooner the better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ALWYT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple execs discussed not ‘leaving money on the table’ when setting Apple TV subscription fees</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KBQY4h"&gt;In Apple and Epic’s ongoing court battle over App Store fees, one of the key sticking points has been Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21531873/epic-apple-fortnite-app-store-lawsuit"&gt;insistence on maintaining a 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; as a cornerstone of the storefront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QkC3mF"&gt;But newly revealed &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20464232-apple-exhibit-b"&gt;Apple executive emails from the case&lt;/a&gt; show that the App Store rules that Apple flouts as essential to the fairness of the app economy were carefully negotiated into existence over time in a way that ensured Apple wasn’t “leaving money on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4w4jse"&gt;The emails date back to a 2011 discussion, which included Apple software and services leader Eddy Cue, around how Apple would handle subscription video applications on the Apple TV — an important conversation, given the rise in popularity of streaming services. And while the discussion doesn’t offer much insight on Apple’s existing 30 percent fee for the App Store, it does reveal how malleable those rules were when it came to maximizing profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRP3wH"&gt;The company examined a variety of options, including a 40 percent one-time cut, a 30 percent one-time cut, a 30 percent ongoing fee, or more individualized deals with services like the NBA and MLB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SX3yid"&gt;One email in the thread breaks down the different forms of content partners that would be offering subscriptions on Apple TV. It muses on which partnerships would be fruitful to try to get a cut (like new streaming services) and which ones won’t (like “entrenched” cable and satellite companies).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UHle-AJR8b0RE6LKcGd2N6UC2lk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260627/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_11.07.36_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lDBfdE"&gt;Apple’s team settled on the idea that any iTunes-based transactions or subscriptions should stick with the same 30 percent cut as the App Store. But there’s more discussion over how the company will handle referrals, where the Apple TV applications link out to a service’s website for customers to subscribe directly to the service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xM9m6i_UWcZYgJgw3MB4OnVDiMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260629/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_11.08.32_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J6Yb07"&gt;The thread then discusses how fees should work when Apple refers a new subscriber. Should the company insist on 30 percent of the initial subscription? 30 percent of the first year? Just insist that all subscription applications funnel subscribers through the App Store? Concerns are raised that Hulu Plus might not be able to afford that kind of cost. Cue responds that Apple should ask for 40 percent of the first year, but that it may need to work out a few deals first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdnLiY"&gt;One point of concern for Apple was structuring the new fees in such a way that they didn’t undermine the payment structure it set on the App Store. “I don’t want to do any deals where we get less than 30%. That is what it is on the app store and we can’t be making a different deal here. If that is not possible than I want a one-time bounty but we need to very careful here so this doesn’t spillover to the app store,” one exec wrote. (The emails are threaded such that it’s hard to tell who is replying to whom.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Cw0ALFI1PdfQ_VGLmANjLY2Jqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260628/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_11.08.01_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0jAV1"&gt;It’s important to remember that in 2011, the Apple TV didn’t actually have an App Store — just individual apps that Apple worked out partnerships with on a case-by-case basis. And the thread seems to emphasize the ad hoc nature of the platform development here: Apple doesn’t seem to come into this with any defined ideas of what it needs to make the platform succeed, just a vague goal of maximizing profit and shaping the rules for the platform to best achieve that. &lt;/p&gt;
