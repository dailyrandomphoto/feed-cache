    <title>Brompton electric bikes recalled by US government over unexpected acceleration bug</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uCBRZr"&gt;Hundreds of foldable electric bikes made by UK firm Brompton have been &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Brompton-Bicycle-Recalls-Electric-Folding-Bicycles-Due-to-Fall-and-Injury-Hazards#"&gt;recalled for repair&lt;/a&gt; by the US government. A software fault is causing the bikes’ electric motors to deliver “forward momentum” when the rider is not pedaling. It’s an issue that poses “fall and injury hazards,” according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), but can be remedied by a free software upgrade performed at certain Brompton dealers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDraO9"&gt;The problem affects roughly 600 bikes sold by Brompton’s US dealers between June 2020 and March 2021, with the bicycles themselves retailing for between $3,500 and $3,800. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YD3crU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the risk of an accident occurring is very low,” say brompton&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lyV6vp"&gt;Owners can check if their bike is one of those affected by entering the product’s serial number (found on a sticker on the frame) into a tool on &lt;a href="https://us.brompton.com/recall"&gt;Brompton’s website&lt;/a&gt;. If necessary, they can head to a Brompton dealer to get the firmware upgrade. Anyone affected can apply for a $30 credit voucher provided by Brompton “as a gesture of goodwill.” Presumably this voucher can only be redeemed at Brompton’s &lt;a href="https://us.brompton.com/shop"&gt;online store&lt;/a&gt;, where you can find a range of sensible biking wear and leather accessories specially designed for commuting fetishists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LzahR"&gt;Although unwanted acceleration is pretty high on any company’s list of “software oopsies we don’t want affecting our electric vehicle,” Brompton says the actual danger posed by the issue is extremely low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mYUFQ"&gt;“Under specific circumstances if a system failure occurs, there is a low possibility that the electric system may continue to provide assistance to the motor, causing continued forward momentum, when the rider is not actively pedalling,” said the company in a statement on its website. “The risk of an accident occurring is very low with only one reported minor fault, which did not result in any injury or accident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ayawE"&gt;If you want to hear this same message delivered in soothing tones by Brompton’s chief design and engineer officer Will Carleysmith, you can watch the video on the issue below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fJKgoA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SYjga6Tbpys?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9h5Mv4"&gt;Brompton’s folding bicycles have achieved something of a &lt;a href="https://qz.com/704008/a-quirky-english-folding-bike-has-achieved-cult-status-with-its-specific-appeal-to-urban-cyclists/"&gt;cult status&lt;/a&gt; among a certain sort of nerdy and affluent urban commuter. However, a combination of Brexit and COVID have hit the company’s manufacturing operations &lt;a href="https://road.cc/content/news/brompton-reels-impact-brexit-and-covid-282435"&gt;hard&lt;/a&gt;, causing material shortages and rising production costs. A recall is hardly good news in such a tricky business environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rmay77"&gt;In our review of Brompton’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/2/19040479/folding-e-bike-review-price-weight"&gt;most recent folding electric bike&lt;/a&gt; (unaffected by the software issues that prompted this week’s recall) we found it to be extraordinarily adaptable thanks its folding design but lacking in comfort needed for longer commutes. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Touch ID Magic Keyboards work with all M1 Macs, not just the iMac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple’s Magic Keyboard in purple, with a Touch ID button in the top right corner." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZkZxtSCDTUFhTdFFRaP9NJbAzRQ=/0x16:1933x1305/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69167929/132_2021_04_20_132_vlcscreen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new Magic Keyboard has a Touch ID sensor on the top right.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nFtMuY"&gt;The Touch ID sensor in Apple’s new Magic Keyboard, which debuted alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;updated iMac&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, works with any Mac fitted with Apple’s M1 processor, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1384588508820647940"&gt;Rene Ritchie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/magic-keyboard-touch-id-compatible-all-m1-macs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. The catch is that, for now at least, the keyboard is only sold with  the new M1-equipped iMac, which is available to preorder from April 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yLBdK"&gt;Apple has been shipping MacBooks with built-in Touch ID for a while now, but this is the first time it’s been available in an accessory. The biometric security method can be used for logging into the device, as well as authorizing purchases and signing into some third-party apps. The new Touch ID keyboard is available with a compact layout, as well as a full size keyboard with a numpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0o7QaS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You can only buy them with the M1 Mac (for now?) but you can use them (with Touch ID!) on other M1 Macs, or just as BT keyboards (no Touch ID) on Intel Macs/other devices. &lt;a href="https://t.co/mOOp5mbmg2"&gt;https://t.co/mOOp5mbmg2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rene Ritchie (@reneritchie) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1384588508820647940?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dk29bH"&gt;The bad news for owners of older Macs is that the Touch ID functionality in the new keyboard won’t work with any Intel-based machines. The keyboard itself will reportedly function, just not the biometric security. As &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fimac-features-all-new-design-in-vibrant-colors-m1-chip-and-45k-retina-display%2F%23gallery-26ed471606120fad275da1d426bc5785%3A%7E%3Atext%3DCustomers%2520can%2520choose%2520from%2520three%2520models%2CMouse%2520and%2520the%2520industry%252Dbest%2520Magic%2520Trackpad.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F22%2F22397196%2Fmagic-keyboard-touch-id-m1-mac-macbook-intel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s press release&lt;/a&gt; explains, the new keyboard requires the Secure Enclave in the M1 processor to encrypt the transmitted fingerprint information end-to-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8hitW"&gt;Although the Touch ID keyboard is currently only available with the new all-in-one, &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes that Apple has previously opened up exclusive accessories for general sale. For example, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17168720/apple-space-gray-keyboard-mouse-trackpad-now-available-pricing"&gt;started selling&lt;/a&gt; the gray keyboard, mouse, and trackpad for anyone to buy in 2018, after previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15743110/apple-imac-pro-space-gray-magic-mouse-keyboard-colors-wwdc-2017"&gt;limiting them to the iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt; in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden pledges to drastically slash US greenhouse gas emissions by 2030  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks And Signs Executive Actions On Climate Change And Creating Jobs" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lHyvWSRc3YLalRvqWfJBD2JOSD0=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69167893/1230821964.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;U.S. President Joe Biden speaks about climate change issues in the State Dining Room of the White House on January 27, 2021 in Washington, DC. President Biden signed several executive orders related to the climate change crisis on Wednesday, including one directing a pause on new oil and natural gas leases on public lands. | Photo by Anna Moneymaker-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U946jq"&gt;President Joe Biden announced a new goal to sharply cut down US greenhouse gas emissions this decade. The country’s new mandate is to reduce planet-heating gases by 50 to 52 percent of what the US emitted in 2005. It significantly ramps up a previous commitment under the Paris climate agreement made by former President Barack Obama, who pledged to slash emissions between 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ft5jLG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US hopes to regain respect on the international stage &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WlUYTP"&gt;The urgency for the US to gut its climate pollution has only grown since the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015. Global carbon dioxide emissions need to drop by half this decade and reach close to zero by the middle of the century in order to hit the goals of the Paris Agreement and prevent some of the most devastating effects of climate change, a landmark &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;2018 report&lt;/a&gt; found. The US has a huge role to play as the second biggest greenhouse gas polluter after China. But it abdicated leadership on the climate front under former President Donald Trump, who briefly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21548147/united-states-paris-agreement-climate-change-presidential-election"&gt;pulled the US out&lt;/a&gt; of the Paris accord and &lt;a href="https://climate.law.columbia.edu/climate-deregulation-tracker"&gt;drastically rolled back&lt;/a&gt; environmental regulations in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEX9HE"&gt;Now the US hopes to regain respect &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22239441/us-paris-agreement-rejoin-climate-change-joe-biden"&gt;on the international stage&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to tackling the climate crisis. Biden will hold his own &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/leaders-summit-on-climate/"&gt;virtual summit&lt;/a&gt; on climate today (Earth Day) and tomorrow aimed at encouraging other countries to ratchet up their goals. All countries are expected to update their individual commitments to combating climate change ahead of a United Nations climate conference scheduled to take place in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJJ8sQ"&gt;“[The Biden administration is] very cognizant that the US as a credible actor and leader in this space really depends in large measure on having a really robust new target,” says Pete Ogden, vice president for energy, climate, and the environment at the United Nations Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43eT24"&gt;Major environmental groups like Sierra Club have &lt;a href="https://addup.sierraclub.org/campaigns/tell-president-biden-commit-the-us-to-reducing-climate-emissions-by-at-least-50-by-2030"&gt;pushed&lt;/a&gt; the Biden administration to target a reduction of at least 50 percent. Hundreds of &lt;a href="https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/ambitious-u-s-2030-ndc/"&gt;businesses&lt;/a&gt;, including Amazon, Apple, and General Motors, did also. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFzoMe"&gt;Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-government-and-politics-environment-and-nature-business-climate-8b27e89270de7cb03f2e61f23d0ba4b9?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=122623923&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--d1EiTS1GYd8wQXq7HwM3WLwLsbvmcJ4hyCpHseNPDbjQMNaB6uugUmcQYZDz9aA3JomNV5K0H90xvIik4zUGT0DRNNBjA9bTIUyqIBfgqfYqXu0c&amp;amp;utm_content=122623923&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the 50 percent goal “is precisely what is needed ... an actionable goal within the next decade that puts us on the path toward limiting warming below a catastrophic 1.5 degrees Celsius.″  The Paris agreement seeks to stop global average temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, a &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/"&gt;threshold&lt;/a&gt; that scientists project would lead to catastrophic effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCJ5jf"&gt;Some progressive groups &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22396522/us-climate-change-commitment-paris-agreement-joe-biden"&gt;called for deeper emissions cuts&lt;/a&gt;, citing the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/24/18512804/climate-change-united-states-china-emissions"&gt;US’s history of contributing more to the climate crisis&lt;/a&gt; than any other country. “There exists in my mind no possible ethically justifiable story in which the United States does not do more,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22396522/us-climate-change-commitment-paris-agreement-joe-biden"&gt;said Tom Athanasiou&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the activist think tank EcoEquity, which is part of a &lt;a href="https://usfairshare.org/"&gt;network&lt;/a&gt; that has called on the US to reduce its emissions by at least 70 percent below 2005 levels this decade.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OI32R6"&gt;More countries are expected to ratchet up ambitions this week during Biden’s climate summit. The UK announced on April 20 that it plans to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 78 percent compared to 1990 levels by the year 2035. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pG3I9f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a dire warning.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lqV8Kp"&gt;Those commitments couldn’t come any sooner as climate pollution continues to grow. After a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309374/global-china-carbon-dioxide-emissions-rising"&gt;temporary drop&lt;/a&gt; in planet-warming CO2 emissions during the pandemic, annual emissions this year are on course for the sharpest rise since 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aN6aYL"&gt;“This is a dire warning that the economic recovery from the Covid crisis is currently anything but sustainable for our climate,” Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/global-carbon-dioxide-emissions-are-set-for-their-second-biggest-increase-in-history"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the new estimate for 2021 emissions. “Unless governments around the world move rapidly to start cutting emissions, we are likely to face an even worse situation in 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzIJCr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drKa4d"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSRbMs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKDXYB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s solar panels will soon only be sold in bundles with Powerwall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Solar Roof" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lsl_dTJ8P4gkIm_zDrOWTVMoI_w=/216x0:1784x1045/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69167810/tesla_solar_roof_smooth_glass.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tesla’s solar roof.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YH5WU4"&gt;Tesla’s solar products will soon only be sold together with the company’s Powerwall battery, CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385042598692147204"&gt;announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Integrating them into a single product will making installations easier and home backup more seamless during outages, according to Musk. The change will affect both Tesla’s Solar Panels (which sit on top of an existing roof), and Solar Roof (which replaces a home’s existing roof slats).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aoKIA"&gt;The new policy was announced just hours after Musk responded to a tweet from Ark Investment Management’s director of research Brett Winton, who had complained that his Tesla solar panels hadn’t generated any electricity since installation because he was waiting on his local utility company to approve the connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3VIjnp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp;amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp;amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385048499415183360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FtuU27"&gt;“Did you buy a Powerwall?” Musk tweeted at Winton, “Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery.” &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/telsa-s-solar-panels-to-be-sold-with-powerwall-from-next-week?utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that Ark Investment has been a big supporter of Tesla, and holds “significant stakes” in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VKqK20"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp;amp; can stabilize grid.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385011236270526464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W79UAP"&gt;Signs of Tesla’s intention to bundle its solar products with the Powerwall were reported &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/15/tesla-stops-taking-orders-powerwall-without-solar-panels/"&gt;last month by &lt;em&gt;Elektrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who spotted that the company was only accepting new Powerwall orders when combined with a Tesla solar panel project. Powerwall supply shortages were thought to be to blame for the shift, with demand and wait times increasing for the home battery solution. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Tesla installed 86 mega-watts (MW) of solar energy, a 59 percent increase compared to the same period the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zhehxr"&gt;Alongside the change, Musk announced an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385099771220688906"&gt;upcoming software update&lt;/a&gt; for the Powerwall, which he says will enable upwards of a 50 percent power increase depending on production date. The current Powerwall is &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/powerwall/Powerwall%202_AC_Datasheet_en_northamerica.pdf"&gt;rated to provide&lt;/a&gt; 5 kW of real power (7 kW peak) in North America, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385105599608672257"&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; the CEO said that Tesla’s newest units can “probably” provide as much as 10kW continuous, and “double that in peak” under the right circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YAGZP"&gt;The changes come after Tesla faced criticism for substantially raising the prices of some of its solar products. Earlier this month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380057/tesla-solar-roof-price-increase-contract-amount"&gt;one customer reported&lt;/a&gt; that the company had told them a $35,000 solar roof order would now cost them $75,000, while the price of the accompanying batteries would increase from $30,000 to $35,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zzgwtp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fujifilm is releasing a Nintendo-themed Instax printer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uMJnRAtuboMbktKKyqdszqyIsqU=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69167794/fujinintendo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lOpF6S"&gt;Fujifilm and Nintendo have &lt;a href="https://www.fujifilm.com/jp/en/news/hq/6480"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new collaboration. The camera company is releasing a new Switch-themed version of its Instax Mini Link photo printer, as well as a new app that’s designed to let you edit Switch screenshots and print them out onto Fujifilm’s Polaroid-style Instax film, or add Nintendo characters to your photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgvJam"&gt;You can transfer screenshots from your Switch to the new “instax mini Link for Nintendo Switch” app with a QR code. The app contains filters and 59 new frames from games like &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;, and appropriately enough the upcoming &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap. &lt;/em&gt;Here’s how some of the frames look:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WaRn8B63WmfFBBfhvF_HTsWTS5o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461719/Screen_Shot_2021_04_22_at_17.03.52.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IiLPZnwW9yfe1UOt85Sa3B6pTG8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461720/Screen_Shot_2021_04_22_at_17.07.20.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bPiYLe"&gt;The actual printer hardware itself is identical to the existing Instax Mini Link, but it comes in Switch-inspired red and blue trim and there’s a bundle with a frankly adorable Pikachu silicone case. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P8l2N2t7svJNIJmZtRpPnPE8fkc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461721/fujinintendo.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xEMkws"&gt;Fujifilm says the app and the printer will be released on April 30th. The special edition Mini Link will cost $100, while the Pikachu case bundle will sell for $120 later in May. The app will be free to download and will still work with existing Instax Mini Link printers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gran Turismo will be featured in an Olympic competition this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2WaZoS2ikC4m18CfRHNinRVnml8=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69167772/gran_turismo_7_screenshot_08_disclaimer_en_01oct20.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4COlEW"&gt;The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced a new series of virtual sporting events that will take place ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, called the Olympic Virtual Series. No, this doesn’t mean that &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; just became an Olympic sport — what’s happening is that the IOC is partnering with five international sports federations to host virtual competitions in games featuring their sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVAUkW"&gt;The Olympic Virtual Series will kick off on May 13th and will run through June 23rd. Here’s the lineup of federations and what games they’ll be hosting events for, as we know it so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hgz7N4"&gt;Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile will host a &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo &lt;/em&gt;competition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vBXVEt"&gt;Union Cycliste Internationale will host a competition for &lt;em&gt;Zwift&lt;/em&gt;, which offers virtual cycling and running courses to use with indoor exercise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EiAMjx"&gt;The World Baseball Softball Confederation will host a competition for Konami’s &lt;em&gt;eBaseball Powerful Pro Baseball 2020&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="M2ffAN"&gt;World Sailing will host a competition for &lt;em&gt;Virtual Regatta&lt;/em&gt;, an online sailing and regatta sailing simulation game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cgGmUT"&gt;World Rowing doesn’t officially have a game attached to it yet; a press release only said vaguely that there would be an “open format.” A PR spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that details about the World Rowing competition are forthcoming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cnyhyN"&gt;There are still many things we don’t know about the Olympic Virtual Series. It’s still unclear who will be competing, how you can try to sign up to compete, what prizes will be offered (will somebody become a &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt; gold medalist?), and which events will happen when. The IOC promises that more details will be announced soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9S2ZFW"&gt;More sports could get involved in future virtual series. FIFA, the International Basketball Federation, the International Tennis Federation, and World Taekwondo have “confirmed their excitement and commitment to exploring inclusion in future editions of the OVS,” the IOC said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony releases a more powerful wearable AC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5XYoxKT67SHy7xzAVF4vuMVotPw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69167770/DSCF7272.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The original Reon Pocket.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rqUgxp"&gt;Sony has &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/ja/SonyInfo/News/Press/202104/21-034/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a follow-up product to the Reon Pocket, the app-controlled “wearable air conditioner” it released last year after crowdfunding it on the company’s own platform. The Reon Pocket 2 looks more or less the same as the original model, but the newly designed internals can achieve up to twice the level of heat absorption, according to Sony, resulting in more powerful cooling performance. Sony also says that it’s improved the sweat-proofing in the Reon Pocket 2, making it more suitable for light exercise situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWSXfk"&gt;The prior model was mostly marketed as something to wear with a special undershirt to make summer commuting more bearable, but this time around Sony is emphasizing more versatile use cases — particularly golf. The company has partnered with sportswear brands including Le Coq Sportif, Munsingwear, and Descente to produce a range of golf clothing that features pockets for the device to slot into.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rLT1qI7BxMQlzSbTP6mn4n2FRvk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461704/img_w02_pc.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xla5n6"&gt;Sony has also designed a neckstrap accessory so that the Reon Pocket can be used with regular clothes. Previously, you’d have to buy a bunch of pocketed undershirts from Sony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AgbND_-v8TzcHLe_gpgJH4h1WbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461707/img_w03_01_pc.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qdInma367J8m3IfBl5qjoD6zCOk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461706/img_w03_02_pc.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xEfFjX"&gt;The Reon Pocket 2 is out today in Japan for 14,850 yen (about $138). No word on a release elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are all the AirTag accessories we know about </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fYC-sV9f26gLYdwC4ya5f937KLY=/821x0:2261x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159412/airtag_accessories_header_202104.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="afQCgp"&gt;The Apple AirTags &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;have finally been announced&lt;/a&gt;, and with them come a ton of accessories to make them easier to use (so much easier than if it had, say, a built-in way to attach it to things). While a small tracking puck could be carried in a bag, there are a variety of other things that you may want to put an AirTag on that require some sort of holder or the judicious use of tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aibtVD"&gt;These are all the accessories we could find that are either listed for preorder on the maker’s site or have a page on Apple’s store. We don’t have official ship dates for most of them, but it’s probably a safe bet that the ones on the Apple Store will become available when the AirTags do, on April 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zukTwfmRIxQklWUdl7oFS7ls-Ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457924/HNPX2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Belkin’s AirTag holder. Tie it to anything!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pAbwNc"&gt;Belkin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RWmQC6"&gt;Belkin currently has two offerings, a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHNPR2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-secure-holder-with-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D4a11a0f92a3f82e2bc68e69e973caa245ea296126f6a1dea5da19b97d0d9b65242da69bc60433105cb23b3dcbfae194c6018f7a0e0a92d0ee1a81f4dc9a5d78ffd2ec296ae3f8902c56b9bb67e4de40bd67223cf08e2e2b4ddc7c848f910584ae10043f1f735c80aea4750706def61ce&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;key ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHNPX2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-secure-holder-with-strap%3Ffnode%3D4a11a0f92a3f82e2bc68e69e973caa245ea296126f6a1dea5da19b97d0d9b65242da69bc60433105cb23b3dcbfae194c6018f7a0e0a92d0ee1a81f4dc9a5d78ffd2ec296ae3f8902c56b9bb67e4de40bd67223cf08e2e2b4ddc7c848f910584ae10043f1f735c80aea4750706def61ce&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a strap&lt;/a&gt;, which both sell for $12.95. Both products have a circular holder for the AirTag and come in white, black, blue, and pink. They’re currently listed as unavailable in Apple’s online store and as “coming soon” on Belkin’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ACO1OVMfOG9bRTqGaMafFuiVKRI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457922/7245bb43_16cd_47d2_9cb4_94bc7f177b9a.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nomad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I genuinely love this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lTlcNk"&gt;Nomad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="678fYv"&gt;Nomad also offers its take on &lt;a href="https://www.pjtra.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergAirTag042121&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-leather-keychain" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a keychain&lt;/a&gt;, but (characteristically) its version is a leather pouch that encases the AirTag. The company also has &lt;a href="https://www.gopjn.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergAirTag042121&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-glasses-strap" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a glasses strap&lt;/a&gt;, which acts both as a strap to keep your glasses handy and as an AirTag holder in case you manage to misplace them. Both are listed for $39.95 but are marked down to $29.95 if you preorder, which you are able to do now on Nomad’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8DcdqCayePsBxP8zc6ye9XhXgWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457915/detail_airtags_rugged_armor_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spigen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spigen’s rugged AirTag case. Maybe you could attach it to your rock climbing gear?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XGObNE"&gt;Cyrill / Spigen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IwxThP"&gt;Cyrill is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.cyrill.com/collections/airtag/products/black-airtag?variant=36909671776414"&gt;vegan leather keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; in two colors, black and “stone” (which is a light gray). It costs $19.99 and seems to be available now. Spigen, Cyrill’s parent company, is also offering its own AirTag cases: a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-valentinus%3Fvariant%3D32709738725423&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-rugged-armor%3Fvariant%3D32709737971759&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a ruggedized case&lt;/a&gt; with a hefty clip connector (and what appears to be a bottle opener, though it’s not listed as a feature). Both are $24.99 — the keychain is available to order today, and the rugged case is available for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the bag charm. I dare you to put it on a Gucci or Louis purse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kuvoxz"&gt;Hermès&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5fM4hd"&gt;Apple has a history with Hermès; the French luxury company made some jaw-droppingly expensive Apple Watch bands. True to form, the Apple Store lists a leather &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX872AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;key ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX8A2AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-luggage-tag%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;luggage tag&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX862AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-bag-charm%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bag charm&lt;/a&gt; made by Hermès — costing $349, $449, and $299 respectively. It is worth noting, though, that the accessories do include an AirTag with a custom “Hermès” engraving, so you can flex while you find. The key ring and bag charm come in orange, brown, and what looks like black but is listed as “bleu indigo.” The luggage tag is currently only shown in brown. Like Belkin’s offerings, they are currently unavailable through the Apple Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="B4yP8n"&gt;Device-customization company dbrand &lt;a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/apple-airtag-skins"&gt;is offering pre-orders for its skins&lt;/a&gt; (which sounds very creepy, without context) that allow users to change the color of their AirTags. A pack that allows you to add a dot of color to the front and back of the tracker will cost $4.95, and comes with dbrand’s promise to “make your tiny frisbee look and feel like it’s worth the four full-sized frisbees that your $29 could have bought instead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxKfm0"&gt;The company is also creating a case, which adds the much-needed (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;or not, depending on who you ask&lt;/a&gt;) lanyard loop that Apple left off the AirTags. The case is available for pre-order, includes a lanyard loop, and costs $15 — there’s also a $19.95 pack &lt;a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/grip/apple-airtag-cases"&gt;that also includes a skin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ENSzYI"&gt;Everybody else &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CeOHhl"&gt;Of course, with how long AirTags have been rumored, there were some manufacturers that wanted to get a head start with their accessories. Last night, we saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393404/airtags-accessories-keychain-leaked-photos-listings-trackers-tile"&gt;various key rings show up on Walmart, Etsy, and eBay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney inks a huge Sony deal to bring Spider-Man and other films to Disney Plus and Hulu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rOLcX8CHnWx5PdaDVmIMDu7Ps6M=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166381/SpiderHaal.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Sony Pictures Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yeoaDF"&gt;Disney and Sony Pictures have signed a multi-year “content licensing agreement” that will bring new Sony theatrical releases, starting with its 2022 films, to Disney-owned platforms. The deal also gives Disney the rights to many of Sony’s older films, including &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; titles — meaning that movies starring the web-slinger, which are notably absent from Disney Plus’ collection of Marvel films, could eventually make their way to the streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuEnFE"&gt;Sony’s theatrical releases from 2022 through 2026 are included in the deal, and Disney will get access to them following their “Pay 1 TV window.” Starting in 2022, that window, which follows a film’s theatrical and home video runs, will be owned by Netflix, thanks to a deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373997/sony-pictures-movies-netflix-starz-pay-one-window-streaming-deal"&gt;announced earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. (That means new Sony films will hit theaters first, then paid rentals and purchases, then Netflix, and then finally head over to Disney platforms, possibly including Disney Plus.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUj2O2"&gt;So even though Disney and Sony’s deal means that Disney won’t have new &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; films right after their theatrical runs, the company will get to include them in its streaming catalogue over the long term — something that Disney arguably values more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxBPVh"&gt;Giving people access to yet another set of movies in its ever-growing collection of Marvel properties could give people more reason to subscribe to Disney Plus. The company continues to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22231578/wandavision-marvel-studios-disney-plus-streaming-characters-mcu-audience"&gt;connect the many Marvel films and shows to each other&lt;/a&gt; so you’ll always want to watch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22229076/wandavision-marvel-studios-disney-plus-streaming-loki-falcon-winter-solider-black-widow-theatrical"&gt;the next new MCU thing&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s continuing to invest heavily in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394275/emilia-clarke-olivia-colman-marvel-secret-invasion-disney-plus"&gt;courting big names for future series&lt;/a&gt; to give you even more reasons to keep your subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEPolr"&gt;That all said, if &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; films do make their way to Disney Plus, that won’t make Disney’s infinity gauntlet of films complete: 2008’s &lt;em&gt;The Incredible Hulk&lt;/em&gt; (the one starring Edward Norton as the Hulk) would still not be available on the service. Unless Disney strikes some sort of deal with Universal, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Gzzq8"&gt;Other Sony Pictures properties, such as &lt;em&gt;Jumanji&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hotel Transylvania&lt;/em&gt;, are also included in the deal, according to a press release. Disney’s Hulu will also have access to “a significant number of library titles” as soon as this June, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Capcom’s Resident Evil 4 VR remake launches later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7yottfu6J-YKOPo1ZxBM_WjjMlM=/40x0:1405x910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166374/Screen_Shot_2021_04_15_at_6.52.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Capcom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IlnUy8"&gt;Facebook Reality Labs has offered more detail about a virtual reality remake of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;, following Capcom’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386496/resident-evil-4-vr-remake-oculus-quest-2-announced"&gt;original announcement last week&lt;/a&gt;. The game will launch later this year exclusively on Facebook’s Oculus Quest 2 headset, although the exact date is still a mystery. As Capcom’s first trailer indicated, it’s a first-person VR adaptation of the 2005 third-person game, with a focus on making weapons and movement feel more natural with Oculus Touch motion controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oR87r6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; for VR uses the game’s original levels and animations, revamped with remastered textures, and Oculus says cutscenes will be rendered “in their original format.” But developer Armature Studio has added VR-friendly locomotion options like the ability to teleport or walk around a room-scale environment, in addition to using Touch controller analog sticks. You physically pick up weapons and items from the environment, and you can equip different weapons for each hand. The game’s enemies will also attack in ways that are optimized around first-person combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bAEbAB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bu7vJYpakPU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ywAXlE"&gt;These additions evoke features popular in other VR first-person shooters like &lt;em&gt;Arizona Sunshine, &lt;/em&gt;whose creator Vertigo also released a new trailer for its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Ffrom-the-creators-of-arizona-sunshine-after-the-fall-brings-four-player-co-op-action-to-vr-in-summer-2021%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;upcoming cooperative game&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;After the Fall&lt;/em&gt; today. The &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; remake is part of &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/oculus-gaming-showcase/"&gt;a larger slate of upcoming VR games&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6BPFNxv8jQ"&gt;a sequel to the original Oculus Rift title &lt;em&gt;Lone Echo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that’s launching this summer, as well as a horror stealth game called &lt;em&gt;Wraith: The Oblivion – Afterlife&lt;/em&gt;, which will launch tomorrow on Oculus Quest and Rift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="260xge"&gt;Capcom previously made &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt; playable on PlayStation VR, but this is the first full-length &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil &lt;/em&gt;game designed for VR. &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; is also the first Quest 2 app that won’t be playable on the original Oculus Quest. Oculus required all launch titles for the Quest 2 to be compatible with its predecessor, but it left the door open for an exclusive game that required the extra power of a newer headset — and &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; is apparently that game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QJ9cyi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_FJFnm9PCfY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
