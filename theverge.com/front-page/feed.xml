    <title>The Dish ‘fix’ for the T-Mobile-Sprint merger seems more shortsighted than ever</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S5QtMQ"&gt;To sell regulators on their $26 billion mega merger, T-Mobile and Sprint executives told anyone who’d listen that the deal would provide &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634195/t-mobile-sprint-merger-conditions-access-coverage"&gt;near-miraculous benefits&lt;/a&gt;. But economists warned that US telecom merger promises &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962739/t-mobile-sprint-nextel-merger-prices-rural-coverage-promises"&gt;are historically meaningless&lt;/a&gt;, and the reduction in overall competitors would — sooner or later — result in higher prices and job cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2G54r"&gt;Instead of heeding their warnings and blocking the deal, US antitrust enforcers &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/technology/sprint-t-mobile-merger-antitrust-official.html"&gt;concocted an elaborate workaround&lt;/a&gt;: they would erect Dish Network as the nation’s new fourth major wireless carrier. Under the plan Dish received some T-Mobile spectrum, the Boost Mobile prepaid brand, and the assurance that T-Mobile would help Dish run a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) while it got its own nationwide network up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwB2t9"&gt;But squabbling between the companies culminated this week in Dish announcing it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583799/dish-network-att-mvno-t-mobile-5g-4g"&gt;replacing T-Mobile with AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; as its primary partner, indicating that T-Mobile and Dish were simply incapable of getting along, and the government was never that interested in forcing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EEyMI"&gt;“If T-Mobile is able to shirk this regulatory obligation with impunity, what’s to prevent future consent orders from being ignored?” Hal Singer, an economist who testified against the merger approval tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJTjGh"&gt;Earlier this year, Dish called T-Mobile a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;grinch&lt;/a&gt;” for shutting down its CDMA network earlier than Dish had expected. In complaints to &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/dish-california-regulators-t-mobile-inquiry-reopen-9d87c61c-8349-440c-97eb-8cde807ba9bf.html"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/dish-tmobile-network-shutdown-fcc-466e406c-db9d-4318-8cec-3579a54fdf04.html"&gt;federal&lt;/a&gt; regulators, Dish accused T-Mobile of reneging on its merger promises, and claimed the shutdown risked leaving many of Boost’s 9 million wireless customers without service in 2022. T-Mobile has denied fault and effectively accused Dish of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;not understanding its own agreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HW4Gc"&gt;So far the Biden administration, focused largely on Big Tech policy conversations, hasn’t taken much action in the telecom space. The administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570567/biden-net-neutrality-competition-eo"&gt;has yet to fully staff the FCC&lt;/a&gt;, and only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585590/joe-biden-jonathan-kanter-antitrust-lina-khan-tim-wu-google"&gt;just appointed a DOJ antitrust enforcer this week&lt;/a&gt;. Dish’s deployment goals are far off, and any meaningful government action, if it comes at all, likely remains years away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hE81zs"&gt;The deal gives Dish until 2025 to deploy its wireless network to 70 percent of the population. Given that 70 percent of the US lives on roughly 3 percent of the country’s landmass, that shouldn’t have been a particular challenge. (Dish hasn’t given any public indication that it’s nearing that goal yet.) But it’s getting to 95 percent coverage where Dish needs help, given that the remaining chunk lives on ten times the land mass as the initial 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bi9tZJ"&gt;That’s where Dish’s $5 billion deal with AT&amp;amp;T comes in. Under &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001001082/000100108221000019/dish-20210714x8k.htm"&gt;the proposal&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T will grant Dish MVNO customers access to AT&amp;amp;T’s 4G and 5G networks in rural and harder to reach markets, as Dish focuses on building out its own 5G network in major cities. Dish will still have access to T-Mobile’s network until 2027, but AT&amp;amp;T will now be Dish’s primary partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFpfHC"&gt;In a research note to investors, Wall Street analyst Craig Moffett argues that while Dish’s relationship with T-Mobile may have soured, the deal with AT&amp;amp;T likely increased Dish’s chance of survival as a wireless operator — for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bN6QEo"&gt;“Under the T-Mobile agreement, Dish had until 2025 to satisfy the FCC, but only two more years afterwards to satisfy the much more exacting demands of customers,” Moffett says. “That was always the real challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6k0EQv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;How many major cellular carriers does it take to prop up their supposed competitor?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LCHLlj"&gt;Given that AT&amp;amp;T has never offered CDMA access, the arrangement won’t solve Dish’s complaints about T-Mobile’s decision to shutter its CDMA network, potentially harming Boost Mobile subscribers. AT&amp;amp;T, meanwhile, nabs significant wholesale revenue with the dangerous bet that Dish will never become successful enough to erode AT&amp;amp;T market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Po3IgU"&gt;But with Dish bleeding &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/dish-sheds-363k-wireless-subs-warns-t-mobile-3g-shutdown"&gt;wireless&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/dish-loses-230000-pay-tv-subscribers-in-first-quarter-4175362/"&gt;TV subscribers&lt;/a&gt; at an alarming rate, the clock is ticking on Dish’s overall survivability. In the next six years, Dish has to remain financially viable, build out a massive and popular next-generation wireless network, keep state and federal regulators happy, and somehow steal meaningful market share from a US telecom sector historically averse to being meaningfully disrupted by competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyRnnZ"&gt;It’s a big ask for a company long criticized — &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/t-mobile-takes-huge-swing-at-dish-for-hoarding-spectrum"&gt;including by T-Mobile in 2018&lt;/a&gt; — for gobbling up troves of valuable spectrum, then not delivering on its promises to put that spectrum to use. While the government deal bars Dish from selling its spectrum for six years, analysts have long pondered if Dish will just string regulators along, sell its spectrum, then use the immense profits to laugh off any remaining regulatory, legal, and contractual obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5uoo4"&gt;Moffett tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Dish has already spent upward of $10 billion in long-term cellular tower leases, and risks losing its spectrum in addition to financial penalties for missing deployment goals. Singer, however, remains unimpressed by the integrity of the merger arrangement with the government and still thinks an early Dish exit remains possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ffcTb"&gt;“The decree always gave Dish an easy out,” Singer says. “The real target of the regulation was T-Mobile. And now T-Mobile is getting to slither out.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KCqm6"&gt;The saga could also end with &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/19/dish-and-atts-new-wireless-partnership-potentially-foreshadows-directv-deal.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T buying Dish Network&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T nabbing Dish’s vast spectrum holdings, the US wireless industry consolidating even further, and everybody involved pretending none of this ever happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bdCjJ0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“jobs positive from day one” turned out to be a joke&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dw34vb"&gt;Meanwhile, other merger promises remain unfulfilled. T-Mobile’s promise that the deal would create new jobs — still viewable over &lt;a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/new-t-mobile-creating-jobs"&gt;at the company’s website&lt;/a&gt; — wound up not being worth much. Despite claiming the deal would be “jobs positive from day one and every day thereafter,” the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429587/t-mobile-sprint-merge-jobs-promise-pandemic"&gt;eliminated 5,000 positions so far&lt;/a&gt;, much as critics like Singer predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxE94E"&gt;Historically, antitrust enforcers are supposed to look at the available evidence of a proposed union and act accordingly. In the case of Sprint and T-Mobile, the Trump FCC approved the deal &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-360243A1.pdf"&gt;before even seeing impact analysis&lt;/a&gt;, and the Trump DOJ’s top antitrust enforcer Makan Delrahim &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/technology/sprint-t-mobile-merger-antitrust-official.html"&gt;personally worked with all three companies&lt;/a&gt; to ensure deal approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2JIMG"&gt;Instead of simply blocking the merger and finding a way to prop up Sprint, the resulting solution always required a great deal of optimism in both the integrity of corporate merger promises and the competency of US regulators. Now consumers are left waiting for a network that may never arrive, based on relationships that were sour from the start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGJTtK"&gt;“Just as Delrahim scripted it,” Singer jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvGNUW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWPVRc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple AirPods update to arrive later this year with iPhone SE refresh coming 2022: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csz6F4-t8Kc9zJwssBSsQVlCehg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69610248/akrales_170124_1410_A_0093.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-generation AirPods will reportedly have a shorter stem than current models (above). &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CtMfh8"&gt;Apple will start production on updated AirPods next month, with plans to launch the third-generation earbuds later this year, according to a &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-to-go-all-in-on-5G-for-its-2022-iPhone-lineup"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the latest rumor regarding Apple’s product schedule, which will reportedly include an all-5G iPhone line-up in 2022, including a revamped iPhone SE sporting the as-yet-unannounced A15 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5QeOa"&gt;A refresh of Apple’s entry-level AirPods have been rumored for a while now, with previous generations launched in 2016 and 2019. Back in May, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the earbuds will have a design similar to the AirPods Pro, with “a new case and shorter stems poking out of the bottom of each one.” If &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; is right about production starting next month, we can expect to see the new-look AirPods revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;alongside the iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; this September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4qe52"&gt;In addition to the earbuds, Apple might also release new versions of the MacBook Pro later this year, says &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;. This rumor seems pretty solid, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;previous reports&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that the new laptops will be available in 14-inch and 16-inch screen sizes, with next-gen Apple-designed Arm processors, the return of MagSafe charging, and the end of the Touch Bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhhfLd"&gt;Looking ahead to 2022, Apple is expected to equip all new iPhones that year with 5G compatibility. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; says the company will not update the smaller iPhone 12 Mini in 2022 after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;disappointing sales&lt;/a&gt; (though &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/05/2021-iphone-13-name-report/"&gt;reports suggest&lt;/a&gt; it will offer an iPhone 13 Mini later this year). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0zPpn"&gt;Instead, in 2022, the company will refresh the cheaper iPhone SE with 5G and an A15 processor. The updated iPhone SE will reportedly use a Qualcomm chip for 5G compatibility, an interesting note given that Apple is reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168779/apple-leak-cellular-modem-johny-srouji-town-hall"&gt;building its own modems&lt;/a&gt; in order to further wean itself off third-party designs. The new iPhone SE will also reportedly keep its 4.7-inch LCD displays, says &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;, making it the obvious choice for consumers who prefer a smaller device. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/23/2022-iphone-se-details/"&gt;Earlier reports&lt;/a&gt; about the third-generation SE said it will also retain the home button and Apple’s Touch ID sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve will replace Big Picture mode with the new Steam Deck UI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xJ_x0TfJoS9yUVFESBJoQ5x4mGE=/0x0:1612x1075/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69610106/steam_deck_004.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qsneG1"&gt;Big Picture, the mode that converts Steam’s user interface into a more console-like design better suited to TVs and controllers than monitors and mice, may not be long for this world. According to austinp_valve, a Valve employee &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigpicture/discussions/1/5167301764850695635/"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; on the Steam community forums, the plan is for the new UI from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;just-announced Steam Deck handheld PC&lt;/a&gt; to replace Big Picture mode on the desktop version of Steam as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1YNsg"&gt;Valve announced Big Picture mode in 2011 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/3/3723508/valve-steam-big-picture-leaves-beta-launch-sale"&gt;released it the following year&lt;/a&gt;. The mode formed the basis of the UI for SteamOS, the version of Linux that shipped on console-style devices that were part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/5/8733139/valve-steam-machine-half-baked"&gt;Valve’s ill-fated Steam Machine project&lt;/a&gt;. With the Steam Deck running an all-new version of the operating system called SteamOS 3.0, it makes sense that the redesigned UI would make its way back to the PC client — especially since Big Picture has felt outdated for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EKusfTBeQSEh2iGkaiyjJ_Zdr_s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22730287/steamos3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;SteamOS 3.0 on Valve’s Steam Deck.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ry7zDW"&gt;Valve isn’t giving an ETA for when the new UI will make its way to existing PCs. The Steam Deck is set to start shipping in December, though the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22582617/new-steam-deck-reservations-q2-q3-valve-hand-held"&gt;level of demand&lt;/a&gt; has meant that new orders are being pushed out to midway through next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsuG4w"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Green travel rewards app Miles raises $12.5 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rTteoSt1KtFcpzsh78TzvUKpwVw=/214x0:1947x1155/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69609858/Miles_screenshots_1a.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Miles&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VgIKNG"&gt;Three years ago, a startup called Miles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17604438/miles-app-tracking-transportation-deals-discounts"&gt;launched a free app&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of becoming a sort of rewards program for all travel — with an emphasis on clean transportation. Cover enough ground by bike, bus, subway, or even on foot, and you’d be rewarded with “miles” (aka points) that could be exchanged for perks at Starbucks or discounts to services like Audi Silvercar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNzjrI"&gt;I was curious, so I used Miles for a little over a year. I lived in New York City at the time and did a lot of daily walking and subway-riding, with occasional biking and bus travel. I was in a great spot to rack up miles without having to change my habits, so I shook the icky feeling of letting another app know my location to see if that occasional free coffee would be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkTuDR"&gt;It never was for me. While Miles had teased gift cards from places like Amazon, Target, and Starbucks, the rewards I saw were always far less enticing or tangible. You know all the kinds of ads for introductory offers you hear in the middle of podcasts? Those seemed to dominate the Miles app. I hoarded thousands of miles but had almost nothing to spend them on besides temporarily free or discounted subscriptions to services like Hello Fresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3bEQgP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The team will use the investment to create “Miles 2.0”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v8aNjg"&gt;Now, Miles says it’s setting out to change some of that. On Wednesday it will announce a Series A round of funding of $12.5 million led by Scrum Ventures that includes Japan Airlines, TransLink Capital, and a host of others. The funding will help the startup create “Miles 2.0,” which will feature many new rewards, and new &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt; of rewards — like, eventually, PayPal credits, airline miles, or even cash.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YvgSV3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Miles is an app that tracks your every move in exchange for deals and discounts","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17604438/miles-app-tracking-transportation-deals-discounts"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wHbrrO"&gt;First, though, Miles CEO Jigar Shah tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview that the company has already made lots of changes to the app, especially since early last year, when it was forced to reshuffle priorities during the pandemic. With people around the world self-isolating, and both &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-government-and-politics-environment-and-nature-politics-lifestyle-56d36574e38cec038f77339ef12076bc"&gt;transit ridership&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://kinder.rice.edu/urbanedge/2020/07/27/transportation-traffic-dropped-66-it-came-back-and-covid-19-followed"&gt;vehicle miles traveled dropping&lt;/a&gt;, Shah says Miles started tweaking its rewards system to encourage the outdoor activities it already tracked where social distancing was possible (like walking, running, and biking). The Miles team also got to work on drumming up new rewards that didn’t require going into physical stores. They brought on new partners, including streaming services like Disney Plus and FandangoNOW, as well as home delivery startups like wine company Winc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxMVWY"&gt;“We went from almost 40 to 60 different partnerships in 90 days in March, April, and May of last year,” Shah says. The Miles team also started pulling other levers, like how many miles it cost to redeem certain rewards. It added a charity function, too, where miles can be donated to non-profits on the platform. If those non-profits collect enough miles, they get a payout directly from the startup. (The thresholds and payouts vary per charity and are negotiated with Miles.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="M2bc6v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The pandemic already forced Miles to make a lot of changes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="src1kL"&gt;All of these changes accelerated growth across the board for Miles last year and into 2021, Shah says. More people used the app, and users redeemed more of their miles. Out of 12 billion miles collected by users to date, 3.5 billion have been redeemed for around 7 million rewards, he says. Miles also says it has driven more than $200 million in revenue to its rewards partners to date. While it may be hard to grok those numbers, it’s obvious they were at the very least good enough to convince investors to come together for a Series A round. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4ez1z"&gt;Miles attracted new rewards partners along the way, which Shah says might help address the problem I had with the app. On Wednesday it will announce even more, including Lego, Buffalo Wild Wings, Garmin, Sam’s Club, Chewy, Wayfair, Rover, and HP. It still features plenty of subscription services, though, as some of its more recent deals include ButcherBox, Harry’s Razors, and Craftsy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ay7yBM"&gt;Shah admits that the balance was likely not right at the outset. “I think [in the] initial days, we were building up the marketplace, and it was all about the quality of the marketplace [versus] the quantity of the marketplace, and I think we couldn’t fight both,” he says. “And we chose quantity at that point in time over quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKlhQP"&gt;The pitch Miles originally made in 2018 of constant location tracking in exchange for rewards was eyebrow-raising, to say the least. In theory, that idea has only gotten &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;fraught over the last three years as &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/nepxbz/i-gave-a-bounty-hunter-300-dollars-located-phone-microbilt-zumigo-tmobile"&gt;reporting from &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has uncovered just how much of a black market there is for precise location data created by our phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C9pH7A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We [initially] chose quantity at that point in time over quality”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l7qslq"&gt;Miles maintains that it does not share any location data with its rewards partners, and Shah takes his company’s position as a sort of middleman in this respect seriously. “They get zero data at this point in time,” he says, emphatically. “Even at the aggregated level, even at the anonymized level, they just don’t get anything. The only thing they get is to put a reward on our platform.” As Shah put it back in 2018, the selling point is that Miles has created a “predictive marketing AI platform” that is supposed to match users with appropriate deals based on their behaviors — sort of like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/6/6917895/advertising-beacons-discovered-in-hundreds-of-nyc-phone-booths"&gt;a smarter version of advertising beacons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tborrV"&gt;The closest Miles comes to sharing information about people’s actual movements is in the relationships with cities and transit agencies, Shah says. Even then, it’s offered in aggregate and abstracted. “[Say] there are 14 percent of people in San Francisco who walk after taking a train trip, and their median distance of walking is 0.7 miles. That’s the formation of the data” that cities or transit agencies get in a dashboard created by Miles, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ogIT1H"&gt;(Cities and transit agencies don’t necessarily have goods to sell, so Miles can create “challenges” in its app that encourage, say, subway ridership. For example, the Miles app may challenge users to take the subway to work instead of drive in exchange for a reward from a different partner.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="0vIqX2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is it better to get something rather than nothing?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cV1aps"&gt;If you want to be optimistic about all this, you could view Miles as a vanguard of sorts for trying to offer &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;kind of compensation for being tracked — something other apps are likely already doing without you knowing. A $5 Target gift card is not nearly as progressive an idea as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18302076/data-monetization-control-manipulation-economy-jaron-laniers-virtual-reality-vr-vergecast"&gt;federal law requiring tech companies to compensate people&lt;/a&gt; for the labor of generating data while using their services. But it’s more than what we get right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmMeQE"&gt;“It’s more than we get right now” is also a pretty grim place to be. So it’ll be up to Miles’ users to decide whether the tradeoff is worth it, all while the company adds new rewards and continues to tweak the platform to shift the underlying balance. In that light, maybe the best we can hope for isn’t necessarily that users get a free coffee now and then, but that the promise of one gets a few more people to experience riding a bus for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One of the biggest myths about EVs is busted in new study</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Geely Targets Apple, Big Tech With Its New Zeekr Electric-Car Unit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQIvIC63IHAynHTF3NTDNWPYzXE=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69609851/1232320777.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vehicle bodies on the production line of the manufacturing plant for Zeekr Co., an electric-car unit of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China, on Wednesday, April 14, 2021.&amp;nbsp; | Photographer: Gilles Sabrie/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DGmj74"&gt;A new study lays to rest the tired argument that electric vehicles aren’t much cleaner than internal combustion vehicles. Over the life cycle of an EV — from digging up the materials needed to build it to eventually laying the car to rest — it will release fewer greenhouse gas emissions than a gas-powered car, the research found. That holds true globally, whether an EV plugs into a grid in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577162/european-union-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-emissions"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; with a larger share of renewables, or a grid in India that still relies &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/country/IND"&gt;heavily on coal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q32XhA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fossil fuels are driving the climate crisis&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zu8uIv"&gt;This shouldn’t come as a big surprise. Fossil fuels are driving the climate crisis. So governments from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576994/european-union-gas-vehicle-ice-ban-2035-electric-cars"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; have proposed phasing out internal combustion engines by 2035. But there are still people&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;who claim&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that EVs are only as clean as the grids they run on — and right now, fossil fuels still dominate when it comes to the energy mix in most places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="184Szi"&gt;“We have a lot of lobby work from parts of the automotive industry saying that electric vehicles are not that much better if you take into account the electricity production and the battery production. We wanted to look into this and see whether these arguments are true,” says Georg Bieker, a researcher at the nonprofit research group the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) that published the &lt;a href="https://theicct.org/publications/global-LCA-passenger-cars-jul2021"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. The ICCT’s analysis found that those arguments don’t hold true over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6ZaSg"&gt;The report estimates the emissions from medium-sized EVs registered in 2021 in either India, China, the US, or Europe — countries that make up 70 percent of new car sales globally and are representative of other markets across the world,  the ICCT says. Lifetime emissions for an EV in Europe are between 66 and 69 percent lower compared to that of a gas-guzzling vehicle, the analysis found. In the US, an EV produces between 60 to 68 percent fewer emissions. In China, which uses more coal, an EV results in between 37 to 45 percent fewer emissions. In India, it’s between 19 to 34 percent lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pKbuek"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s difficult to predict how much the world’s energy infrastructure will actually change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nGZ6ZN"&gt;It’s important to note that the study assumes that the vehicle was registered in 2021 and will be on the road for around 18 years. Study authors ended up with a range of potential emissions reductions for each region by looking at the energy mix under existing policy, as well as projections from the International Energy Agency for what the future electricity mix will look like as climate policies develop. But it’s difficult to predict how much the world’s energy infrastructure will actually change. For example in the US, President Joe Biden has set a goal of getting 100 percent clean electricity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;by 2035&lt;/a&gt; — but still needs to pass the policies to make that happen. The study also doesn’t take into account other non-climate related&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;environmental effects that constructing the cars might have from things like mining and waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foZ2AP"&gt;Actually building an EV is still a little more carbon-intensive than building a traditional vehicle. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20951807/electric-vehicles-battery-recycling"&gt;Recycling EV batteries&lt;/a&gt; could eventually bring that carbon intensity down. But for now, EV drivers start to reap the climate benefits after driving their car for a year or so, according to Bieker. That’s when the car passes the threshold when the emissions that it saves by running on cleaner electricity make it a better option for the climate than a traditional car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5RNgg3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We need globally to phase out combustion engine cars.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7W1Zlw"&gt;Bieker hopes the ICCT’s findings will help policymakers make more informed decisions about the future of transportation. Climate experts are rushing to bring global greenhouse gas emissions down to &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;near zero by the middle of the century&lt;/a&gt; to avoid the worst effects of global warming. Electric vehicles are necessary to make those cuts happen, and even hybrid-electric vehicles aren’t clean enough to meet that goal. The report recommends against allowing any new internal combustion vehicles on the road by the 2030s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qa9ytm"&gt;“Combustion engine vehicles of any kind are not able to deliver the greenhouse gas reductions we need to live with climate change,” Bieker says. “That’s a global finding, therefore we need globally to phase out combustion engine cars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7zf9B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7KLf1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brokered cell location data led to the outing and resignation of a Catholic official</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ijapUNFChi3zs9pdIeFDHX8c74U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69609783/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EKcZHM"&gt;Location data from a cell phone, obtained and sold by data brokers, has lead to the alleged outing and resignation of a priest working for the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, according to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2021/07/20/bishop-misconduct-resign-burrill/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; The traffic data, which was linked to the priest and appeared to show when and where he was using the LGBTQ dating app Grindr, was obtained by a publication and shared with the Conference, where the priest worked as the general secretary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Q9q92"&gt;This incident is another example of how invasive the collection and sale of location and other personal data by brokers can be. While the data sold by these companies is ostensibly anonymized, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21029992/smartphone-location-tracking-legal-technology-privacy-new-york-times"&gt;shown that individuals can be picked out and tracked&lt;/a&gt;. The data broker industry has been a concern among privacy advocates for years, especially after companies have been caught selling data to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303190/congress-data-smartphone-tracking-fbi-security-privacy"&gt;law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244848/us-intelligence-memo-admits-buying-smartphone-location-data"&gt;state agencies&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve also seen how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18214667/att-t-mobile-sprint-location-tracking-data-bounty-hunters"&gt;carriers&lt;/a&gt; and other companies sell data to these brokers, with Grindr itself being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249578/grindr-fined-norwegian-data-protection-authority"&gt;fined for the practice&lt;/a&gt; by the Norwegian government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bu6mAo"&gt;The priest’s story is illustrative of how that commercially available data can be used against someone, and of how the relatively-unknown data broker industry can have profound consequences on peoples’ lives. For many of us, it’s hard to keep track of who’s tracking our data — making it difficult, if not impossible to prevent it from being collected and sold by companies we didn’t know had access to it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces Unpacked event for August 11th with Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip teaser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JJRsXNwsE4SF8Tb9Nn-5nGY2Ngw=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69609266/unpacked.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ymloVB"&gt;Samsung has officially announced when it will hold its next Unpacked product event: August 11th at 10AM ET / 7AM PT. It is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572858/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2021-leak-evan-blass-galaxy-z-fold-flip-3-s21-fe-watch-4-buds-2-date"&gt;widely expected&lt;/a&gt; to announce the next version of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;both of which have already leaked quite a bit&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung’s not being shy about those expectations, as a quick look at its invite reveals the outline for both of those devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMCaRV"&gt;Samsung is also expected to announce new Galaxy watches, which would be the first to use the new combined Wear platform that was announced at Google I/O earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63RkvA"&gt;Samsung is holding the event virtually again on its website, and it promises to post more &lt;a href="https://smsng.news/2TqTjNm"&gt;details on the livestream here&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also keeping up another Samsung trend: &lt;a href="https://shopsamsung.page.link/A1gWkiA6yiC9Xvvt7"&gt;letting customers “reserve” “its next flagship”&lt;/a&gt; before it’s even been officially announced. Samsung says it will offer “increased trade-in credit and 12 months of Samsung Care+ at a discounted rate” for early reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIeRnR"&gt;According to the images leaked by Evan Blass, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 looks very similar to the current iteration of the folding phone. The largest upgrade will apparently be compatibility with Samsung’s S Pen stylus. Samsung itself has been telegraphing that it would add stylus support to the Fold line for a very long time now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qZULQKv1zeeuJKAzVV0v4dZAQrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679450/E4qkWBHXwAgIQ_W.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1408107239903223808?s=21" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (tweet now deleted)&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4zpnFF"&gt;As for the Galaxy Z Flip 3, the biggest update may be on the outside, where Samsung will replace a very tiny screen with a slightly larger but still fairly small screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ooz3x6"&gt;Samsung has done a better job with durability on its folding devices since it switched over to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;using “Ultra thin glass”&lt;/a&gt; under a plastic sheet for these displays. However, the screens are still much more fragile than regular smartphone screens. If Samsung is intending to encourage users to poke at the Z Fold 3’s screen with a plastic stick, that folding screen will need to become more durable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KgHEKq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/cLlE0ot4fO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cLlE0ot4fO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734400420896768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Afejm"&gt;Though it’s not likely to get top billing, the new Galaxy smartwatches are likely to be a bigger shift than the iterative updates to the folding phones. That’s because it’ll be the first Samsung smartwatch to run Google’s Wear operating system in over half a decade. Samsung had been using its own Tizen-based OS on smartwatches, which had benefits over Google’s Wear OS but did not have an app library worth using. Now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;the two operating systems are combined&lt;/a&gt;, this upcoming Samsung watch will be our first real look at what the new Wear operating system really works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6G3NZn"&gt;We are expecting both a Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 with a rotating bezel and a Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 4 without to be announced, both in multiple colors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITtldf"&gt;It’s always possible there will be more on tap — Samsung’s Galaxy Buds lineup could also be due for a new model. We’ll find out for sure when Samsung kicks off its livestream on August 11th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A fix is coming for those locked out of their Chromebooks by Google’s update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IGDNtT94BgE2U_2DM88YHB9UrV0=/0x186:1360x1093/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69609149/mchin_181029_4126_0002sq.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zvs0vw"&gt;A bad update to Chrome OS, version 91.0.4472.165, has left some users unable to log in to their accounts, or reportedly with boot-looping computers (&lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/second-major-chrome-os-update-bug-leaving-users-locked-out-chromebooks"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you’ve found yourself locked out of your Chromebook, help is on the way: Google posted &lt;a href="https://support.cloud.google.com/portal/system-status"&gt;on its system status page&lt;/a&gt; that it’s working on a fix, which it expects to release on Wednesday. It’s also pulled the update, which should prevent more users from experiencing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRKjwL"&gt;According to Google, the only options to immediately regain access to your Chrome OS device (if it unfortunately downloaded and installed the update) will lead to the local data on the device being wiped. If you can wait until the new fix the issue is released, though, your device should automatically download that update as well. Or, you can manually trigger the update using the guest account. If your computer has downloaded the bad update but not installed it, you might want to avoid shutting it down or rebooting it until the fix is out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tyv3MS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The second bad Chrome OS update we’ve seen this month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eQ5rVb"&gt;If you can’t wait for the fixed update, Google recommends either &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/183084?hl=en"&gt;“Powerwashing” (factory resetting) your Chrome OS device&lt;/a&gt;, rolling back the update &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1080595?hl=en"&gt;with a recovery USB key&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1059260?hl=en#zippy="&gt;removing your account and re-adding it&lt;/a&gt;. Again, all these solutions will delete local data on the device, so be careful. Google’s status page also doesn’t address the boot looping issues — &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/second-major-chrome-os-update-bug-leaving-users-locked-out-chromebooks?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+androidcentral+%28Android+Central%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; that if you’re experiencing those issues you’ll have to use the recovery USB key method to reinstall Chrome OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KT04LY"&gt;The broken 91.0.4472.165 update is actually the second bad Chrome OS update we’ve seen this month: &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/16/chrome-os-91-performance-issues-chromebooks/"&gt;Google had to pull another update&lt;/a&gt; around July 7th after users discovered that some Chromebooks were having their performance seriously throttled. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An on-the-ground look at Blue Origin’s motley crew </title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jeff Bezos, his brother Mark and Oliver Daemen walk off New Shepard’s landing pad as Wally Funk, 82-year-old aviation icon and the mission’s fourth passenger, remains in awe at the size of New Shepard, the suborbital rocket they all launched to space on. | Joey Roulette/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A record-setting flight&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="vAdeNf"&gt;Today, Wally Funk, 81, and Oliver Daemen, 18, made history as the oldest and youngest people ever to go to space. They &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;hitched a ride with Jeff Bezos&lt;/a&gt; and his brother, Mark, aboard the New Shepard, a rocket made by Bezos’ company, Blue Origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZ2NPS"&gt;Blue Origin will eventually sell seats, though Bezos declined to say how much they’d sell for. “We’ll be announcing that later,” Bezos said, when &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked how much his company plans to charge. When’s “later?” “We’re not quite sure yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jksRet"&gt;Daemen was the first paying customer — though he didn’t win the June auction for the seat. That winner, who remains anonymous, bid $28 million to fly, but had to reschedule for vague “scheduling conflicts.” (Blue Origin would not identify the bidder or explain what the issue was.) Daemen’s dad, a Dutch private equity firm’s CEO, was bumped up from the next mission, and gave the seat to his son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGNKTc"&gt;“We know the vehicle is safe. If the vehicle is not safe for me, it’s not safe for anyone,” Bezos said in an interview with CNN. If nothing else, it’s good advertising for space tourism.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where to preorder the Nintendo Switch OLED model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/evcDNXAUvZ90QSh1sO3zM2YmJ8A=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587172/oled_model_photo_01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="guw0Bh"&gt;After months of speculation and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346041/oled-nintendo-switch-dlss-nvidia-chip-report"&gt;sea of rumors&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;officially announced&lt;/a&gt; the next iteration of its popular gaming console: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt;. The upcoming device serves more as a midlife update than anything else, a refinement of the 2019 model as opposed to the more powerful “Switch Pro” that was rumored (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565469/nintendo-switch-pro-oled-timing-chip-shortages-cpu-nvidia-tegra"&gt;may still launch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKuikp"&gt;On sale for $350 starting October 8th, the aptly-titled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565307/nintendo-oled-switch-screen-news-updates"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt; is the next iteration of what has become one of the best-selling consoles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562530/nintendo-switch-lite-sales-october-2020"&gt;over the last two years&lt;/a&gt;. It’s outfitted with a 7-inch 720p OLED display, a new dock with a wired Ethernet port, and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand"&gt;improved kickstand&lt;/a&gt; that seems to take a cue directly from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablets&lt;/a&gt;. It also offers 64GB of built-in storage, up to nine hours of battery life — the same as the current Switch — and features “enhanced audio” for handheld or tabletop play. Sadly, despite persistent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;rumors of 4K support&lt;/a&gt;, the OLED model only supports 1080p resolution when docked. Apparently, Bluetooth support and an improved CPU will also have to wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6ASo1a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo denies report that OLED Switch will have higher profit margin","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583141/nintendo-switch-oled-profit-margin-report-denial"},{"title":"Nintendo Switch OLED hands-on: a small upgrade that makes a big difference","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="UyweAO"&gt;Still, the OLED model has plenty to get people excited, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564966/nintendo-switch-oled-display-ps5-xbox"&gt;including our own Alex Cranz&lt;/a&gt;. It plays all the same games, supports the original Joy-Cons, and ships with a sleek black-and-white finish reminiscent of next-gen consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S. It will also be available with the red and blue Joy-Cons, if you prefer the original model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HnhAvm"&gt;Where to buy the Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5An2L3"&gt;The Nintendo Switch OLED model initially went up for preorder on Thursday, and we’ve seen a few retailers allow for additional preorders in the time since. However, if you’re still looking to get your hands on the OLED-equipped Switch at launch and get ahead of what already appears to be another console shortage, you’re in luck. Right now, you can preorder the red and blue iteration of the forthcoming console for $350 at &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-oled-with-blue-and-red-joy-con%2F11149259.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zikzMn"&gt;The white model is currently unavailable for preorder, though neither configuration is expected to ship until the console officially goes on sale on October 8th. &lt;/p&gt;
