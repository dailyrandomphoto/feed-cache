    <title>HMD Global backs out of Nokia 9 PureView Android 11 upgrade, blames camera system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nokia 9 PureView" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OgDw6J8vmWJnNazmzV-cxiM1vRg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70216530/bfarsace_190210_3229_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia 9 PureView was launched in 2019 with a rare five-camera system.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tcIFwQ"&gt;HMD Global is not only reneging on its promise to bring Android 11 to the Nokia 9 PureView, but it is also dangling a discount for a new phone at customers who just found out their current devices are no longer supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RboZRa"&gt;These are customers who paid between $599 and $699 for the premium Nokia 9 PureView back in 2019 after it made quite a splash with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/24/18234962/nokia-9-pureview-cameras-5-features-specs-multiple-price-release-date-photos-hands-on-mwc-2019"&gt;quintuple rear camera array at World Mobile Congress&lt;/a&gt; that year. At the time, Nokia was even known as the best phone brand for receiving fast software updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/2/20844444/android-updates-still-take-forever-study-says"&gt;according to Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt;, so customers understandably might have felt they could trust Nokia and HMD Global. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HD1C0N"&gt;As one of the devices in the &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/intl/en_in/one/"&gt;Android One program&lt;/a&gt;, the Nokia 9 PureView runs a near-stock version of Android 9 and is supposed to get at least two years of OS upgrades and three years of security updates. Although the phone got upgraded to Android 10 in December 2019, it has not received any other OS updates since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHL5As"&gt;HMD Global said it is unable to update the Nokia 9 PureView with Android 11 because “[i]ncompatibilities between the camera and the software would have led to a compromised experience that does not meet our high standards,“ &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fphones%2Fen_us%2Fnokia-9-upgrade&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F1%2F22811988%2Fhmd-global-nokia-9-pureview-android-11-software" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to its statement&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps because its quintuple cameras were co-developed with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/12/21289574/light-camera-company-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;Light, the camera company that has quit smartphone photography&lt;/a&gt;, HMD Global just cannot overcome this technical challenge. That said, the company said the phone will continue to receive security updates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uImLeyLTb-iHesU6EO6GZjGjQEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14130617/bfarsace_190213_3229_0067.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HMD blames the 9 PureView’s unique camera array for being unable to update it to Android 11&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iGvNKt"&gt;Rather than let current owners trade in their now-unsupported devices, HMD Global comes across as trying to profit on those affected customers by asking them to buy a new Nokia phone. “[F]or those of you looking to make the jump to Android 11,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fphones%2Fen_us%2Fnokia-9-upgrade&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F1%2F22811988%2Fhmd-global-nokia-9-pureview-android-11-software" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to its website for Nokia 9 PureView owners&lt;/a&gt;, “we’re offering a 50% discount on Nokia XR20, or another device depending on regional availability.” First of all, the midrange &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fphones%2Fen_us%2Fnokia-xr-20%3Fsku%3DVMA750D9FI1CN0&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F1%2F22811988%2Fhmd-global-nokia-9-pureview-android-11-software" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nokia XR 20&lt;/a&gt; is hardly a substitute for the premium Nokia 9 PureView, and you need to jump through some hoops just to get that discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VE7U5O"&gt;At a time when Android phone makers are trying to differentiate themselves by modeling after Apple’s four-year-plus software support for iPhones, cases like HMD Global backpedaling on the Nokia 9 PureView’s update just remind us not to take these promises too seriously. Bigger companies like Samsung might have more resources to deliver on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;four years of security updates&lt;/a&gt; for its huge portfolio of devices, but smaller outfits like HMD Global and &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/motorola-software-updates-rant/"&gt;Motorola just don’t have a good track record&lt;/a&gt;. While software support is something to consider when making a phone buying decision — especially when we’re holding onto our phones longer between upgrade cycles — it should not be &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;deciding factor for an Android because it just might not happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwO2fv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmzOZe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook removes block on searches for Kyle Rittenhouse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kyle Rittenhouse Found Not Guilty In Kenosha Protest Shootings" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KZBa8z29Tc5k-QA_UoOUdR408lQ=/187x0:5103x3277/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70216479/1236665464.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Kyle Rittenhouse can rejoin Facebook if he wants, after being acquitted of murder charges in November. | Photo by Sean Krajacic - Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lWnTO7"&gt;Facebook on Wednesday removed a block on searches for the name Kyle Rittenhouse that it had put into place following his arrest for an August 2020 shooting in Wisconsin that left two people dead and a third seriously injured. Last month, a jury in Kenosha acquitted Rittenhouse on all charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUH9SW"&gt;In the days following the shooting, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21404518/facebook-search-kyle-rittenhouse-blocked-kenosha-shooting"&gt;the company removed Rittenhouse’s profile&lt;/a&gt; from Facebook and Instagram and blocked users from creating new profiles using his name, to prevent copycats from spreading misinformation. By the end of that week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21404518/facebook-search-kyle-rittenhouse-blocked-kenosha-shooting"&gt;Facebook was blocking searches for “Kyle Rittenhouse&lt;/a&gt;,” as well as removing expressions of praise or support for him on the platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qE1uhZ"&gt;“After the verdict in Kenosha we rolled back the restrictions we had in place that limited search results from returning content related to key terms including Kyle Rittenhouse,” Sally Aldous, spokesperson for Facebook parent company Meta, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;“While we will still remove content that celebrates the death of the individuals killed in Kenosha, we will no longer remove content containing praise or support of Rittenhouse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kr9P6k"&gt;The changes were rolled out in the days following the verdict, Aldous said. “Given the granularity of these policies as well as the wide public interest in these events, we anticipate enforcement at scale will be especially challenging,” she said, adding that Rittenhouse himself does not currently have any accounts on Meta’s platforms — which include Facebook and Instagram — but in theory he would now be able to rejoin them. Like all users, however, he would be subject to the company’s community standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCoNQf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otg4Bf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQyMz1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFNEhb"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor 60 announced in China with vlogging-focused gesture controls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uW00EkpePKhkR1gC7X0Eem4Tkd0=/0x1:5999x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70216451/HONOR_60_All.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor 60 series.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Honor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DIHeSZ"&gt;Honor, the former Huawei sub-brand that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;split from the Chinese tech giant last year&lt;/a&gt;, has announced its latest handsets for the Chinese market. The Honor 60 and Honor 60 Pro are two midrange handsets powered by Qualcomm’s recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22740748/qualcomm-snapdragon-695-778-plus-480-680-5g-4g-smartphone-chips"&gt;Snapdragon 778G Plus processor&lt;/a&gt;, but otherwise, they’re very similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536512/honor-50-series-pro-release-date-news-features-google-mobile-services-apps-play-store"&gt;Honor 50 series phones&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this year, right down to having similar dual-ring camera bumps on the rear of each phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ythUCQ"&gt;A notable new feature for both new phones is support for hand gesture controls, which let you perform actions like making the “Okay” gesture or raising your hand to perform camera controls like switching between its front and back cameras, or enabling picture-in-picture mode. The phone can recognize five hand gestures in total, and Honor says features like these make vlogging “easier than ever.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pfNLCL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Releasing in China on December 10th&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TlilDF"&gt;Honor is far from the first smartphone company to have added hand gestures like these, with everyone from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20907715/google-pixel-4-motion-sense-gesture-controls-radar-sensor-project-soli-demo-features"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/sg/support/mobile-devices/how-to-use-palm-gesture-to-take-selfie-on-samsung-mobile-device/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18301982/lg-g8-thinq-review-android-phone-snapdragon-855-6-gb-ram-z-camera-sensor"&gt;LG&lt;/a&gt; having experimented with similar features. These controls tended to be laggy and inexact in the past, so Honor’s tech has a lot to prove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKJIeD"&gt;Both phones have triple rear camera setups for when you get filming. On the 60 Pro, there’s a 108-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel combined ultrawide and macro camera, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. The big improvement here is with the ultrawide, which was only 8 megapixels on the 50 Pro. The 60 Pro also has a high resolution 50-megapixel selfie camera. Meanwhile, the regular Honor 60 has a lower resolution 32-megapixel front-facing camera, triple rear cameras with a lower resolution 8-megapixel ultrawide, and no mention of macro photography capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KBeyi"&gt;Both phones have 120Hz curved OLED displays, though the 60 Pro’s is slightly bigger (at 6.78 inches) and curves around all four sides of the device, &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/honor_60_pro_arrives_with_snapdragon_778g_50mp_ultra_wide_cam_honor_60_gets_a_larger_120hz_display-news-52093.php"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while the Honor 60 has a 6.67-inch display that curves around its left and right sides. Internally, both phones have 4,800mAh batteries, a small increase from the 4,000 and 4,300mAh batteries found in the 50 Pro and 50. Both charge at a maximum of 66W, which is in line with the Honor 50, but a slight downgrade from the Honor 50 Pro’s 100W fast charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQEXKc"&gt;Honor has yet to confirm a global launch for the phones, but it’s worth noting that if either phone were to release outside of China, they’d be able to come preinstalled with Google’s apps and services, just like the Honor 50. Huawei, meanwhile, is still subject to US sanctions that prevent it from shipping phones with Google’s proprietary software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kJAgh"&gt;The Honor 60 series has only been announced for the Chinese market so far, with no confirmed plans for a global launch. But there was only a matter of months between the launch of the Honor 50 in China and its release in the rest of the world, so we shouldn’t have too long to wait if there’s a global release coming. In China, both phones will be available on December 10th. The Honor 60 will start at ¥2,699 (around $424), while &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt; notes the Honor 60 Pro starts at ¥3,700 (around $581). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big tech’s first generation of founders starts to step aside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jeff Bezos’s India Visit Marked By Probe and Protests" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_R7fyPRCD47GK1go_CdRw566v4=/0x0:2138x1425/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70214184/1193819818.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JC8jKS"&gt;Massive tech companies like Google, Amazon, Netflix, and more have had a huge impact on the way we live our lives, and have had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770569/alphabet-google-market-cap-hits-2-trillion"&gt;incredible levels&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/"&gt;financial success&lt;/a&gt;. Another thing many of these companies have in common is that their founders are no longer necessarily in control; they’ve either stepped down, started sharing power with others, or in some cases possibly even been pushed out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hAI6N"&gt;This week alone, Twitter co-founder &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;Jack Dorsey stepped down as CEO&lt;/a&gt;, and Salesforce founder Marc Benioff &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/salesforce-promotes-bret-taylor-to-co-ceo.html"&gt;became a &lt;em&gt;co&lt;/em&gt;-CEO&lt;/a&gt;. They’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1EMUxc"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alibaba&lt;/strong&gt; — Jack Ma stepped down as CEO of the giant Chinese tech company in 2013, and retired from his position as &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/09/tech/jack-ma-retire-alibaba/index.html"&gt;executive chairman in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. At the time he still had a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/business/alibaba-jack-ma-retire.html"&gt;considerable amount of power in the company&lt;/a&gt;, but after a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-19/ant-s-record-ipo-remains-in-limbo-a-year-after-china-crackdown?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;stalled IPO for the division he was in charge of&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/billionaire-alibaba-founder-jack-ma-reappears-hong-kong-sources-2021-10-12/"&gt;disagreements with the Chinese government&lt;/a&gt;, it’s hard to say how much power he still holds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EujqeX"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Amazon &lt;/strong&gt;— In July 2021, Jeff Bezos officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563671/andy-jassy-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos"&gt;handed the CEO position of Amazon over&lt;/a&gt; to former Amazon Web Services head Andy Jassy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LI0HDf"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Apple &lt;/strong&gt;— Tim Cook was &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/01/14Apple-Media-Advisory/"&gt;temporarily left in charge of Apple&lt;/a&gt; in 2009 while Steve Jobs underwent medical treatment. Jobs returned to the company, but then put Cook in charge for another leave of absence in 2011, before permanently making him CEO later that year. Around the time of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;his 10-year anniversary as CEO of Apple&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, Tim Cook said he doesn’t intend to run the company for another decade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="03YCHp"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;ByteDance — &lt;/strong&gt;Zhang Yiming, founder of the company that owns TikTok, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445212/tiktok-bytedance-ceo-zhang-yiming-steps-down"&gt;announced he’d be stepping down as CEO&lt;/a&gt; this May. In an internal letter, he said he worried about “relying too much on the ideas I had before starting the company.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nPcfNv"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; — In August 2015, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20994361/google-alphabet-larry-page-sergey-brin-sundar-pichai-co-founders-ceo-timeline"&gt;moved on to overseeing Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, the holding company for Google’s disparate properties. The shakeup was seen as them taking their hands off the search engine company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/10/9128083/sundar-pichai-ceo-google-larry-page-sergey-brin"&gt;leaving Sundar Pichai in charge&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20994218/google-alphabet-ceo-sundar-pichai-larry-page-sergey-brin-step-down-control-management"&gt;Pichai took over as CEO of Alphabet as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="geIrqO"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Instagram &lt;/strong&gt;— In September 2018, Instagram’s co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger announced they were stepping down, reportedly after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/4/17/18411363/why-instagram-founders-quit-hamburger-button-location-tracking"&gt;major disagreements with Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8zbaph"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft &lt;/strong&gt;— Microsoft founder Bill Gates’ departure happened in many stages, with him first stepping down as CEO in 2000, then leaving his full time position at the company he helped found in 2008, and finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;stepping down from his position on the board last year&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is currently being run by Satya Nadella, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537683/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-chairman-bill-gates-john-thompson"&gt;acts as both CEO and chairman of the board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="boWSkR"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Netflix&lt;/strong&gt; — In July 2020, Ted Sarandos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327550/netflix-ted-sarandos-ceo-netflix-reed-hastings-board-member-originals-tv-movies"&gt;joined Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings as co-CEO&lt;/a&gt;. The company said that Sarandos was already helping lead (he’d been &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/03/outside-the-box-2"&gt;with the company for twenty years&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/co-ceos-are-out-of-style-why-is-netflix-resurrecting-the-management-model-11594987416"&gt;was in charge of its original programming&lt;/a&gt;), and that him joining Hastings as CEO was just a formalization of his role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sw7urw"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Salesforce&lt;/strong&gt; — Bret Taylor, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;replaced Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt; as Twitter’s chairman of the board on Monday, is also becoming the co-CEO of enterprise tech giant Salesforce, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/salesforce-promotes-bret-taylor-to-co-ceo.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not the first time Marc Benioff, the company’s CEO and founder, will be sharing power, but it’s another instance of a former deputy starting to gain more power within a tech giant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UUkvbR"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Twitter &lt;/strong&gt;— On Monday, November 29th, Jack Dorsey &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;announced he was leaving Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and said “I’ve decided to leave Twitter because I believe the company is ready to move on from its founders.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Qrn2YB"&gt;It’s probably worth noting that all of the founders listed above were men, and were replaced by men, which isn’t a great trend. There are a few notable women in power — Meta’s COO Sheryl Sandberg, and YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki. As of this writing, neither has indicated whether they plan to depart their posts any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ld7HAA"&gt;There are, of course, exceptions to the trend. The most notable is Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s complete control over Meta. He &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt; that he doesn’t have plans to give up his job, and it’d be pretty much impossible for shareholders to force him out, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/opinion/tech-dual-class-stock.html"&gt;thanks to the company’s stock structure&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from Zuckerberg, a couple of other CEOs come to mind: Jensen Huang is still in charge of Nvidia (until it &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/nvidia-faked-part-of-a-press-conference-with-a-cgi-ceo/"&gt;replaces him with a digital AI avatar&lt;/a&gt;), Tencent co-founder Ma Huateng still acts as CEO and chairman of the company, and Snapchat is still helmed by Evan Spiegel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qjaxxe"&gt;Obviously, tech companies can survive and thrive without their founders — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753251/microsoft-apple-market-cap-business-valuable-company"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; are the two most valuable public companies in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EA086j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated December 1st, 3:30PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; — Added information about Tencent and Alibaba, and about female leaders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon teams up with B&amp;O on pricey Android TV soundbars for cord-cutters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="closeup of right side of a soundbar shaped like a semicircle and focused on the Verizon checkmark logo pasted on" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RioqNkeMzYPUNeCERxTg7hfrgBk=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70216361/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_10.01.26_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Verizon logo can return to your living room and you’re technically still a cord-cutter ($399 Verizon Stream TV Soundbar shown) | Image: Inside Verizon YouTube Channel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SdIWv0"&gt;Verizon already sells accessories like phone cases and chargers, but in addition to electronics like digital picture frames and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22736065/tcl-tab-pro-5g-verizon-mmwave-tablet-device"&gt;tablets&lt;/a&gt;, there are also... &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/onesearch/search?q=sound%20bars&amp;amp;ES=MobileAccessories&amp;amp;src=wireless" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;soundbars&lt;/a&gt;. Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-bang-and-olufsen-soundbars-stream-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s releasing two new soundbars with a built-in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21572099/verizon-stream-tv-box-android-google-assistant-updated-lost-remote-feature"&gt;Verizon Stream TV&lt;/a&gt; streaming box. The &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/verizon-stream-tv-soundbar/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99&lt;/a&gt; Stream TV Soundbar and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/verizon-stream-tv-soundbar-pro/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$999.99&lt;/a&gt; Stream TV Soundbar Pro are both built by Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen, with the Pro model sporting a similar housing to the even more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/3/20847593/bang-olufsen-beosound-stage-speaker-sound-bar-expensive-design"&gt;Beosound Stage&lt;/a&gt;, but with nine drivers inside instead of 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3ip9I5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Q77kORvl9g?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pBLGFJ"&gt;The concept of a soundbar with streaming hardware hidden inside is nothing new, as Roku,  JBL, and others have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/4/20848492/roku-smart-soundbar-wireless-subwoofer-speakers-tv-setup-ifa-2019"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/3/20885361/jbl-link-bar-review-soundbar-android-tv-google-assistant-price-specs-features"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the clutter in your entertainment center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtnPco"&gt;Since Verizon’s Stream TV system is a skinned Android TV that includes Verizon’s services, it also touts Google Assistant and all the streaming services you can name: HBO Max, Netflix, Disney Plus, YouTube TV, Amazon Prime, and more. Verizon normally only allows TV subscribers access to the Stream TV box, but with these new soundbars, you don’t need to be a Verizon subscriber to check it out — making it pretty cord-cutter friendly (though you will need to register with Verizon to use it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgM3Bj"&gt;Both of the soundbars stream 4K content, output virtual Dolby Atmos sound, and support HDMI 2.1 with multiple inputs — two on the cheaper model and three on the Pro. Both also feature Bluetooth 5, Wi-Fi 6, and Chromecast, but the Airplay 2 support that the Beosound Stage includes is not available here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_0V1YYxIGDrxHwjGBmSXnISv_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055853/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_12.15.21_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The soundbars can be discounted right now up to 40 percent if stacked with four “eligible” accessories that are $20 or more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gCOcxN"&gt;If you choose to accept the post-cable living room that Verizon is building, then you can order the new soundbars today. Verizon also has a promotion to save 30 to 40 percent off items like these soundbars if you purchase three, four, or five eligible accessories that are more than $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXzmmc"&gt;I added both of the new Verizon soundbars (other brands were ineligible for the promotion) and three Verizon phone charging accessories and got the prices of the Stream TV soundbars down to $239.99 for the cheaper one and $599.99 for the Pro. It’s an unusual route to a home theater upgrade and still more expensive than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493125/tcl-alto-soundbar-9-plus-8i-6-plus-3-bluetooth-airplay-google-assistant-dolby-atmos-surround-sound"&gt;the cheapest Atmos-compatible one-piece audio solutions&lt;/a&gt;. But it could be a way to add Dolby Atmos sound processing and reduce clutter in the living room while restocking on phone chargers all at once. It might also be a good deal for TV subscribers turning into cord-cutters... Verizon doesn’t seem to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Respawn stops selling the original Titanfall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="titanfall-560-art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZL7OHIIXKM1ikg0jFG6LwYen7sA=/0x11:560x384/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70215880/titanfall-560.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HngWCC"&gt;Respawn Entertainment has decided to end sales of the original &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o8YFIW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A note about Titanfall. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ew232HkUIo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ew232HkUIo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Respawn (@Respawn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1466097260836519938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1HkB2z"&gt;Starting today, players will no longer be able to purchase &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; and the game will be removed from subscription services like Xbox Game Pass on March 1st, 2022. Though &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; is no longer purchasable, players who already own the game will still be able to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3O8w6"&gt;“We will, however, be keeping servers live for the dedicated fanbase still playing,” Respawn wrote. It is not known how long Respawn intends to keep those servers around.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RMd24EbJvhzdeWo22feHaaHznf4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23056075/steam_titanfall.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Titanfall is no long available on Steam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B8VWlZ"&gt;The announcement goes on to say that the &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; universe is “core to Respawn’s DNA” perhaps to reassure players that the studio will continue to support the series. Earlier this year, both &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; games were subject to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/4/22563257/save-titanfall-hackers-apex-legends-ea-respawn"&gt;numerous game-disrupting hacks and DDOS attacks&lt;/a&gt; with players accusing Respawn Entertainment and publisher EA of ignoring &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt;’s problems in favor of the more popular and more lucrative &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3T5So"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is getting some much-needed taskbar and Start menu improvements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gMCv170wsj9b-dzSD384ylGQwpA=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70215630/windows11darkmode.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VNLDn6"&gt;Windows 11’s taskbar is a giant step back in usability compared to Windows 10, and now Microsoft is starting to make improvements. A new update that’s currently being tested by Windows Insiders brings the clock and date back to the taskbar on secondary or multiple monitors. It’s a change that multiple monitor users will appreciate, as many have had to install third-party apps like ElevenClock just to get this basic functionality in Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmHx3k"&gt;I’ve not been shy about criticizing the changes made to the taskbar in Windows 11. I hate the new taskbar, so I’m happy to see Microsoft make this initial change. There’s still much more to be improved, and hopefully we see the return of being able to drag and drop files onto taskbar apps and the general customization options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WYle5oMIX54zG8jpTOKAw-hnvtw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055934/Start_Resize.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Windows 11 Start menu changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gjckhh"&gt;Elsewhere, Microsoft is also making some improvements to the Start menu in Windows 11. The latest 22509 Insider build includes the ability to configure the Start menu to show more pins or more recommendations instead. That makes the Start menu a little more customizable, although many Windows 11 users are also opting for third-party apps here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXmp71"&gt;This latest Windows 11 build also includes more improvements to the Settings app as part of Microsoft’s ongoing effort to include more Control Panel settings in the main Settings app. “We have moved the advanced sharing settings (such as Network discovery, File and printer sharing, and public folder sharing) to a new page in Settings app under Advanced Network Settings,” explains Amanda Langowski, head of Microsoft’s Windows Insider program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="99BaUB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"I hate the new Windows 11 taskbar","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673266/microsoft-windows-11-taskbar-features-missing-design-changes"},{"title":"These apps let you customize Windows 11 to bring the taskbar back to life ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722202/microsoft-windows-11-taskbar-customize-apps-start11-elevenclock"},{"title":"How to customize your Windows 11 taskbar ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22688307/windows-11-microsoft-taskbar-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LKPcd9"&gt;There are also improvements to the pages in the Printers &amp;amp; Scanners section, and some parts of the Control Panel will now redirect Windows 11 users to the main Settings app instead. It feels like Microsoft is moving ever closer to finally removing the Control Panel in favor of its modern Settings app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HLt2s"&gt;All of these features won’t be available for some months yet, though. These are part of the Dev Channel round of updates to Windows 11, and some may debut as cumulative updates in the monthly changes Microsoft makes to the OS. Others may be included in the larger annual update that Microsoft is planning for Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok rolls out Creator Next and expands money-making opportunities for creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2JsiCbz5CgHXtHa6ujqYERlK8xE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70215618/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k1Ny4W"&gt;TikTok has announced that it’s rolling out Creator Next, a single hub for all of the platform's monetization tools, and it also outlined some updates for its existing creator tools (via &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/tiktok-adds-creator-monetization-features-including-tips-and-video-gifts/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-next"&gt;post on TikTok’s newsroom&lt;/a&gt;, the short-form video platform explains that alongside Creator Next, it’s also widely introducing its tipping feature, which lets users send money directly to their favorite creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXyG8z"&gt;This is part of TikTok’s larger efforts to retain creators and prevent them from hopping on other networks that pay creators, like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Snapchat. When the platform was just a year old in 2019, users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335404/tiktok-creators-monetization-fund-followers-youtube-content-videos"&gt;struggled to find ways to earn money natively through the app&lt;/a&gt;, as they had to secure deals and sponsorships outside of the app. To help remedy this, the platform later rolled out its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362060/tiktok-creators-fund-recipients-david-dobrik-brittany-tomlinson-youtube-adsense"&gt;$200 million Creator Fund in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, splitting up the cash to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362060/tiktok-creators-fund-recipients-david-dobrik-brittany-tomlinson-youtube-adsense"&gt;reward the platform’s most popular creators&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPQDr9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751715/tiktok-new-tips-feature-creators"&gt;TikTok started testing Tips&lt;/a&gt; as another way for creators to make money this October, but now it appears that the feature is available to all creators who meet TikTok’s &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/tips/"&gt;eligibility requirements&lt;/a&gt;. The qualifications include being over the age of 18, having an account in good standing, and having 100,000 followers or more. TikTok notes that creators will receive 100 percent of every tip, and that they’ll be processed through payment service Stripe, with tippers incurring a small fee. As &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; points out, going through Stripe ensures that TikTok won’t have to pay Apple’s required 30 percent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;commission for in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V9mUJ3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Creators now need 10,000 followers to access the Creator Marketplace&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1xJqIZ"&gt;In its post, the platform also noted that it’s expanding on its Live Gifts feature, which lets viewers gift diamonds — a virtual currency that’s redeemable for cash — during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596718/tiktok-live-video-streaming-events-scheduling-co-host-picture-in-picture"&gt;livestreams&lt;/a&gt;. TikTok is now throwing Video Gifts into the mix, allowing users to donate diamonds during regular, non-live videos. Just like with Tips, creators must have 100,000 followers or more (&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/video-gifts/"&gt;among a few other things&lt;/a&gt;) to qualify. This is quite the change from Live Gifts, which only require creators to have 1,000 followers or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JUy1z6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to find and create live videos on TikTok ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22576007/tiktok-how-to-live-find-go-gifts-diamonds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="lpbg8e"&gt;Additionally, TikTok is giving more creators access to its &lt;a href="https://creatormarketplace.tiktok.com/"&gt;Creator Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, a portal where creators can find and collaborate with business partners to earn money through sponsored videos. Creators now need 10,000 followers to access the Marketplace, as opposed to the &lt;a href="https://armfulmedia.com/tiktok-creator-marketplace/"&gt;previous 100,000 follower requirement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dl5wbj"&gt;All of these tools, including the Creator Fund, Creator Marketplace, Live Gifts, Video Gifts, and Tips, will appear within the Creator Next portal. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/creator-next/"&gt;TikTok notes&lt;/a&gt; that creators must “meet minimum follower requirements,” which can vary depending on region, as well as 1,000 video views within the past 30 days to use Creator Next. The feature is also only available in the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, with support for Canada and Australia arriving in the “coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox is letting more people test the very latest console features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eGWIOPn7r14tFHH-i6xde4xlz0s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70215551/acastro_180604_1777_xbox_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CtOF8e"&gt;Microsoft is opening up its invite-only Xbox testing rings for more console testers to get access to the very latest features. Xbox testing includes many levels, and the Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead rings typically include the bleeding edge of Xbox dashboard features that may not debut publicly for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IoqsK"&gt;Microsoft keeps these Alpha rings invite-only, reserved for those who regularly provide feedback through other Xbox testing rings. Now, &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/11/30/are-you-interested-in-joining-the-alpha-or-alpha-skip-ahead-rings/"&gt;Microsoft is inviting Xbox testers&lt;/a&gt; to complete a survey to be considered for the Alpha or Alpha Skip-Ahead rings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Tfo8X"&gt;“You will receive a notice on your console if you are selected to participate,” says Austin Olney, an Xbox program manager. “There are limited spots available, so completing the survey does not guarantee an invitation. You also might be selected for a different ring than what you indicated in the survey.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDG18A"&gt;The survey is available in the Xbox Insider Hub app, and Microsoft says it doesn’t matter what ring you’re in for testing right now or how long you’ve been a part of its Xbox Insider program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbpxUq"&gt;Microsoft has been testing a bunch of new Xbox dashboard features with Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead testers over the past 12 months, including the early release of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318050/microsoft-edge-xbox-chromium-browser-testing"&gt;Edge Chromium browser&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in trying out the very latest features, then Skip-Ahead has the most updates, but be warned there are occasional bugs that often sneak into these builds that can affect games or apps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Renewables see record growth in 2021, but supply chain problems loom </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rwOgJM"&gt;2021 is on course to break a global record for renewable energy growth, according to the International Energy Agency’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2021"&gt;Renewables Market Report.&lt;/a&gt; That’s despite skyrocketing commodity prices, which could bog down the transition to clean energy in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykcPoC"&gt;With 290 GW in additional capacity expected to be commissioned by the end of the year, 2021 will smash the record for renewable electricity growth that was just set last year. This year’s additions even outpace a forecast that the International Energy Agency (IEA) made in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430465/renewable-energy-solar-wind-iea-2020-exceptional-growth"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Att8pA"&gt;“Exceptionally high growth” would be the “new normal” for renewable sources of electricity, the IEA &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/renewable-energy-market-update-2021"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time. Solar energy, in particular, was on track to take the crown as the “new king of electricity,” the IEA said in its October 2020 &lt;a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/a72d8abf-de08-4385-8711-b8a062d6124a/WEO2020.pdf"&gt;World Energy Outlook report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="nN9EtM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Solar continued to dominate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qbJVI4"&gt;Solar continued to dominate in 2021, with an expected record growth of nearly 160 GW. It made up more than half of all the renewable energy capacity added this year, a trend that the IEA thinks will continue over the next five. Renewables will likely make up 95 percent of new power capacity globally through 2026, according to the new report. The IEA also predicts explosive growth for offshore wind capacity, which could more than triple over the same time period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMiAj"&gt;By 2026, the IEA says, the amount of renewable electricity capacity globally will likely be equivalent to today’s fossil fuel and nuclear energy capacity combined. That’s a huge shift. In 2020, renewable energy only made up &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2021/renewables"&gt;29 percent&lt;/a&gt; of electricity generation globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpF05L"&gt;Still, there are some dark clouds in the IEA’s new forecast for renewables. Soaring prices for commodities, shipping, and energy all threaten the previously rosy outlook for renewable energy. The cost of polysilicon used to make solar panels has more than quadrupled since the start of 2020, according to the IEA. Investment costs for utility-scale onshore wind and solar farms have risen 25 percent compared to 2019. That could delay the completion of new renewable energy projects that have already been contracted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xs0ajU"&gt;More than half of the new utility-scale solar projects already planned for 2022 could face delays or cancellation because of larger price tags for materials and shipping, according to a separate &lt;a href="https://www.rystadenergy.com/newsevents/news/press-releases/most-of-2022s-solar-PV-projects-risk-delay-or-cancelation-due-to-soaring-material-and-shipping-costs/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by Rystad Energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JAFV6k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The transition to renewable energy needs to speed up significantly to meet the scale of the climate crisis&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3c8ytx"&gt;If commodity prices stay high over the next year, it could erase three to five years of gains&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;solar and wind have made, respectively, when it comes to affordability. A dramatic price drop for photovoltaic modules over the past few decades has fueled solar’s success. &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/evolution-of-solar-pv-module-cost-by-data-source-1970-2020"&gt;Costs fell&lt;/a&gt; from $30 per watt in 1980 to $0.20 per watt for solar energy in 2020. By last year, solar was already the &lt;a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/a72d8abf-de08-4385-8711-b8a062d6124a/WEO2020.pdf"&gt;cheapest source of electricity&lt;/a&gt; in most parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIJZKi"&gt;Renewables haven’t fallen too far behind, however, because costs are rising for all forms of energy. “The high commodity and energy prices we are seeing today pose new challenges for the renewable industry, but elevated fossil fuel prices also make renewables even more competitive,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/renewable-electricity-growth-is-accelerating-faster-than-ever-worldwide-supporting-the-emergence-of-the-new-global-energy-economy"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFyf6P"&gt;Still, the transition to renewable energy needs to speed up significantly to meet the scale of the climate crisis. Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels need to virtually disappear by the middle of the century to avoid catastrophic climate change, according to a huge body of &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;. To make that happen, new renewable power capacity needs to grow at nearly twice the rate the IEA foresees over the next five years, the agency says.&lt;/p&gt;
