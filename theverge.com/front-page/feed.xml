    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bql2JV"&gt;Toyota will build a $1.29 billion battery factory in North Carolina in an effort to bring some of its electric vehicle supply chain to the US. The news comes on the heels of Toyota’s announcement that it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662236/toyota-battery-investment-electric-cars-hybrids-2030"&gt;invest around $13.6 billion in battery tech&lt;/a&gt; over the next decade, including a $9 billion investment in production, as it attempts to electrify its vehicle lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="encq9M"&gt;Toyota plans on spreading the $1.29 billion for the new factory over the next decade, but production at the facility is scheduled to begin in 2025, said Chris Reynolds, chief administrative officer for Toyota Motor North America. In the first year, Toyota plans on producing 1.2 million battery packs for its upcoming lineup of electric vehicles, Reynolds said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dCNjOu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota has said it will create 1,750 new jobs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOxx2t"&gt;“This investment, which I believe is so far the largest private capital investment in North Carolina history... will create at least 1,750 new jobs and help us develop and localize automotive battery production,” Reynolds said during a press conference, “which will pave the way for battery electric vehicles built here in the United States of America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcdh9a"&gt;The factory won’t come without its costs to the taxpayers. &lt;a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article256372267.html"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;News &amp;amp; Observer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, North Carolina’s Economic Investment Committee approved a $438.7 million tax incentive package to encourage Toyota to build in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c28VTd"&gt;Toyota’s battery factory is the latest new facility planned as car companies scramble to ramp up production of EVs. Toyota’s first long-range EV, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22752539/toyota-bz4x-electric-suv-steering-yoke-solar-roof"&gt;the BZ4X compact SUV&lt;/a&gt;, is expected to be released in mid-2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0WCjP"&gt;Ford and South Korean battery manufacturer SK Innovation are spending $11.4 billion on several new factories in Tennessee and Kentucky, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313251/gm-ev-second-battery-factory-lg-chem-tennessee"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; is planning four new battery factories in the US with partner LG Chem. In Europe, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; is aiming to have six battery cell production plants operating by 2030. And Tesla is close to finishing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961812/elon-musk-berlin-tesla-ceo-fourth-gigafactory-construction"&gt;battery factory in Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, which would produce 250GWh — roughly equivalent to the current world battery cell production capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHhOwU"&gt;Globally, battery production is expected to grow from 95.3GWh in 2020 to 410.5GWh in 2024, according to GlobalData, a data and analytics company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhlLN7"&gt;The news is also set against the backdrop of fierce lobbying in Washington, DC, over the future of the federal EV tax credit, which currently provides shaves $7,500 off the purchase price of some electric vehicles. Congressional Democrats have proposed increasing the credit to $12,500 for purchases of electric vehicles made in the US by unionized workers, triggering a backlash from non-union companies like Tesla and Toyota. The Japanese automaker has &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qll6xa/toyota_full_page_ad_in_the_wsj_screams_antiunion/"&gt;run full-page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; accusing President Joe Biden and the Democrats of “play[ing] politics with the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoE9SY"&gt;Although the company was an early leader in gas-electric hybrid cars with the Prius, Toyota reportedly viewed hybrids as a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/toyota-whiffed-on-electric-vehicles-now-trying-slow-their-rise/"&gt;stopgap measure&lt;/a&gt; until hydrogen fuel cells became competitive. Now, the company is playing catch-up with the likes of Nissan and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594235/toyota-lobbying-dc-ev-congress-biden-donation"&gt;reportedly lobbied&lt;/a&gt; to slow the US’s transition to electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MlTPA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA announces 10 new astronaut candidates who could fly to the Moon someday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ve-ZzhSLL1Vm8-kee60n2uinazY=/0x630:9448x6929/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70236216/jsc2021e062834.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;(L to R): Nichole Ayers, Christopher Williams, Luke Delaney, Jessica Wittner, Anil Menon, Marcos Berríos, Jack Hathaway, Christina Birch, Deniz Burnham, and Andre Douglas.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7qxUJ3"&gt;Today, NASA announced the selection of its newest class of astronauts: six men and four women chosen from more than 12,000 people who applied to the space agency in March of 2020. Once they train and become full astronauts, these selectees have some exciting spaceflight opportunities ahead of them, potentially including flights to the Moon someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfhXHd"&gt;The astronauts announced today are part of the so-called Artemis Generation. The name is a reference to NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to send the first woman and the first person of color to the lunar surface as early as 2025 (a landing date that is considered incredibly ambitious). The program calls for launching astronauts on a series of flights into deep space on NASA’s new massive rocket, the Space Launch System, or SLS, eventually culminating with humans landing on the Moon once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTiqhX"&gt;“These NASA astronauts will plan, train, and fly missions to the International Space Station and to the moon under Artemis, and eventually onto Mars,” Vanessa Wyche, director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, said during a presentation announcing the astronauts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wBXYuo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was the Apollo generation, and that did so much for so many. Now it’s the Artemis generation.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2qgU3L"&gt;NASA has yet to assign crews to any of the missions associated with the Artemis program, so technically the flights are still up for grabs. However, in December of 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166077/nasa-artemis-astronauts-18-first-woman-moon-mike-pence-space-council"&gt;NASA revealed the Artemis Team&lt;/a&gt;, 18 astronauts already part of the space agency who could potentially be selected to fly on Artemis missions. Presumably, the candidates selected today will join the pool that NASA chooses from. Aside from lunar missions, NASA is still regularly flying astronauts to and from the International Space Station on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft. Eventually, Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner will also take astronauts to the ISS when it’s deemed ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQn4gL"&gt;But before the new recruits can fly, they have to train. The astronauts will go through roughly two years of training at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, which includes flying in the agency’s fleet of T-38 jet aircraft, spacewalk training, robotics work, and more. If that all goes well, they’ll eventually graduate to full astronaut status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lClBju"&gt;“Today, we welcome 10 new explorers — 10 members of the Artemis generation,” NASA administrator Bill Nelson said during the ceremony. “It was the Apollo generation, and that did so much for so many. Now it’s the Artemis generation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeGTK3"&gt;The new class of astronaut candidates includes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XSbpOU"&gt;Nichole Ayers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J3vPfy"&gt;Marcos Berríos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="flA9GV"&gt;Christina Birch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="odMiuZ"&gt;Deniz Burnham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I3JQTW"&gt;Luke Delaney&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7hQbqy"&gt;Andre Douglas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GqE3Vz"&gt;Jack Hathaway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6o9mKO"&gt;Anil Menon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ypjFLX"&gt;Christopher Williams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8drhGs"&gt;Jessica Wittner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="q6qu8b"&gt;Most of the group has some kind of military experience, with various members currently or formerly enrolled in the US Air Force and Navy. Burnham, meanwhile, is a drilling engineer from Alaska, while Menon was recently working as a medical officer at SpaceX. Ayers is also one of just a few women currently flying the F-22 for the Air Force, according to NASA, and she “led the first ever all-woman formation of the aircraft in combat.” Learn more about the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-new-astronaut-recruits-to-train-for-future-missions"&gt;astronaut candidates’ backgrounds here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpAEld"&gt;In order to be considered as a NASA astronaut, candidates must be a US citizen and have a master’s degree in a STEM-related field from an accredited university. On top of that, applicants must have at least 1,000 hours of piloting a jet aircraft or at least three years of experience in a STEM-related field. With all those requirements in hand, finalists must then pass a NASA physical before being considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSLbjf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7UwMX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Book Pro (13-inch) review: a travel buddy</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A great laptop at the right size&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="W2kcUO"&gt;When I reviewed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419899/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-15-inch-review"&gt;15-inch Galaxy Book Pro 360&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, I concluded that it was great — but that its somewhat unique combination of a 15-inch OLED screen, integrated graphics, and a stylus at a fairly premium price point made its audience fairly specific. The package it offers is somewhat unusual in the 15-inch space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmuLz3"&gt;The 13-inch Galaxy Book Pro is clearly the laptop I was looking for. Like many of Samsung’s Galaxy Books, this device has a thin and light chassis, a standout screen, and excellent battery life. Unlike many other Galaxy Books, it doesn’t come with significant compromises for those benefits, and it doesn’t cost a fortune — &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/business/computing/galaxy-books/galaxy-book-pro/galaxy-book-pro--13---256gb--mystic-silver-np930xdb-kh3us/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;my test unit is $999&lt;/a&gt;. It comes with many of the benefits that we’d expect from a premium business laptop, but also with a consumer-accessible price tag. It’s a package of business-ready features that I’m happy to see finally available in the mainstream sphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6T1UT0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10905403"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="qG6JyJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905411"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8XUZRU"&gt;In many ways, the Galaxy Book Pro is a similar package to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;. It’s attractive, well built, and comfortable to use. But there are a couple reasons shoppers might want to go for the Galaxy Book instead. The first is its size and weight. My test unit is just 0.44 inches thick — almost as thin as many smartphones — and 1.92 pounds. This ties it with the &lt;a href="https://shop.asus.com/us/expertbook-b9-b9450-11th-gen-intel.html"&gt;Asus ExpertBook B9&lt;/a&gt; (which is close to twice the price of my test unit) as one of the absolute lightest laptops in the world. For some quick context, the &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-surface-laptop-4-13-5-touch-screen-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-512gb-solid-state-drive-latest-model-matte-black%2F6455204.p%3FskuId%3D6455204&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt; is almost a pound heavier, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;14-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmacbook-pro-14-laptop-apple-m1-pro-chip-16gb-memory-1tb-ssd-latest-model-space-gray%2F6450854.p%3FskuId%3D6450854&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;close to the weight of&lt;/a&gt; two of these things stacked on top of each other. You will not notice this thing in your bag; carrying it feels like carrying a small tablet around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8VPvc"&gt;The second is the screen. The Galaxy Book Pro is one of few 13-inch OLED laptops you can buy (and some of the others out there have… &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt;), and one of the more affordable OLED devices out there, period. Note that this is a 1920 x 1080 OLED screen — it’s visibly more pixel-y than the 4K panels that you’ll often see on OLED workstations. But that hardly ruins the experience. Blacks are black, and colors are rich — the Galaxy Book covers 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut and 100 percent of the sRGB gamut. And, thankfully, I didn’t see any screen wobble (which was an issue I had with the convertible Galaxy Book). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jb03YE"&gt;The screen’s main downside is that it’s a bit dim for this price point (as OLEDs often are), maxing out at 314 nits in my testing. This wasn’t a major problem in use, however — even around medium brightness, the panel wasn’t kicking back a ton of glare in bright settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZs8UK"&gt;Another notable drawback is that it has the 16:9 aspect ratio, which is falling out of fashion in the consumer space; the Galaxy Book’s big competitors, including the Surface Laptops, MacBooks, and XPS laptops of the world, all provide more vertical space. The screen was a bit cramped for my workload as a result, especially since it’s only 13.3 inches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The corner of the Galaxy Book Pro 13, closed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_gzKJEXi1Bt909XYhbUB266dyOI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982908/akrales_211102_4817_0125.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look how thin!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 13 seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l6aGoQ45g7I1M0A1J92UtID5q2M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982900/akrales_211102_4817_0042.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tell me this doesn’t give you serious XPS 13 vibes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vmBCf7"&gt;The third unique thing: there’s a whole bunch of Samsung-specific software on it that will cooperate with a Samsung phone, if you have one. For example, you can quickly move things between the Galaxy Book Pro and a Galaxy phone using the Quick Share feature and can sync up notes and the like as well. The sheer amount of OEM software on here is actually a bit overwhelming. I counted 14 Samsung-branded programs on this device — Samsung Flow, Samsung Studio Plus, Samsung Security, Samsung Settings, Samsung Care+, etc. — and I was never quite sure where to find specific settings and features. Those who are already plugged into the Samsung ecosystem may not have this problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LXyES"&gt;One thing I did uncover in this labyrinth of apps is Studio Mode, which attempts to beautify you in real time on video calls. A little menu pops up when you turn the Galaxy Book’s camera on. There are a few different presets to choose from, which all attempt to enlarge your eyes, thin your face, and remove skin blemishes to various degrees. Without getting into the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18215051/fauxtography-photography-image-processing-editing-filters-reality"&gt;politics of this&lt;/a&gt;, I will note that this feature seemed effective at what it was trying to do. The only weird thing I noticed was that my face would sometimes flicker weirdly if my hand was covering part of it, possibly because the obstruction made the algorithm struggle to recognize my face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 13 half open, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C-hjYU6a0whP7RnC7GT_mjZSgcE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982904/akrales_211102_4817_0071.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lid is a bit blah.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 13." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-y3p0j0xa0xZnxIZuRb6RfGGEC0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982903/akrales_211102_4817_0057.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;They somehow squeezed an HDMI port onto this tiny thing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the right side of the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 13." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/11SmlIpRcvuZ7b9mjd1KXh_fT3c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982902/akrales_211102_4817_0053.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And a USB-A!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="EgY8vJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905439"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HPvGrD"&gt;In most other areas, the Galaxy Book Pro is a run-of-the-mill ultrabook (which means it’s quite good). It feels a lot like using a thinner, lighter XPS 13. (Samsung nailed the keyboard texture in particular — it’s eerily similar.) The trackpad is massive, with a smooth texture and an ever-so-slightly stiff click. The keyboard is on the shallow side, but I was surprised by how much I liked it — it has a very satisfying click, and I surpassed my normal typing speeds. The one category where the Galaxy Book is a bit behind top competitors is looks; the exterior has a bit of a drab vibe that I think belies the excellence of the rest of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 13 open seen from above and to the right on a brown table. The screen displays a Verge 10 graphic." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EfcA4kQ1cekDSLDzo2PTyYutOTs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982907/akrales_211102_4817_0113.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plus, those are some real bezels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yzwWqk"&gt;My unit comes with 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, and a Core i5-1135G7; $1,199 gets you &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/laptops/buy/?modelCode=NP930XDB-KH2US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage and a Core i7&lt;/a&gt;. You can get it in “Mystic Silver” or “Mystic Blue” — the shades are the same price. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/laptops/buy/?modelCode=NP950XDB-KE6US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fifteen-inch models&lt;/a&gt; start at $1,099, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/2-in-1-laptops/buy/?link=galaxy-book-pro-360" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;convertible models&lt;/a&gt; (equipped with a stylus and a touchscreen) start at $1,199. The $999 tag puts my unit at the same price level as the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Laptop-4%2F946627fb12t1%3Fcrosssellid%3D%26selectedColor%3D9A9CA3%26cid%3Dmsft_web_collection" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt;, which swaps in an AMD Ryzen 5 processor in place of the Intel chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6reDHy"&gt;The Core i5-1135G7 is tailor-made for thin and light laptops — despite the “Pro” moniker, this Galaxy Book is not designed for intense professional workloads, and the lack of a discrete GPU means it’s not a good choice for gaming. But it is just fine for someone like me who spends most of their time hopping around a couple dozen Chrome tabs with the occasional Zoom call or Spotify stream over top. I never heard fans or felt any kind of heat, even when I was running the device on Battery Saver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIbX5c"&gt;Battery life was also good. I averaged eight hours and five minutes of work. That’s not as good as the 15-inch model, which has a slightly bigger battery, but should still get you through a full day of work, especially if you’re letting the device go to sleep rather than continuously pushing it as I was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The webcam of the Galaxy Book Pro 13." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/98C62HPTzYLXmP-kNxfWvhRAIwg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982905/akrales_211102_4817_0074.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The webcam itself is nothing to write home about.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The fingerprint sensor on the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 13." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/99bkGCXSntMmc2wzkHs2-a7ZFyY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982901/akrales_211102_4817_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fingerprint reader!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iyyWR2"&gt;My feelings on the 13-inch Galaxy Book Pro are easy to sum up: it’s the perfect travel companion. It’s light, it’s well-built, it lasts a long time, and I can see the screen outside. If I’m going on a trip, there is no other consumer laptop I’d rather have with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="jSLpLp"&gt;The word “consumer” is, of course, doing a lot of work in that sentence. That’s because this combination of features &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; available in the business space and have been hallmarks of the best business laptops for years. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22239215/asus-expertbook-b9450-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Asus’ ExpertBook&lt;/a&gt; is close to this device’s weight and lasts significantly longer. But consumers travel, too, and they should have options that accommodate an on-the-go lifestyle without the &lt;a href="https://www.insight.com/en_US/shop/product/B9450FA-XS74/ASUS/B9450FA-XS74/ASUS-ExpertBook-B9-B9450FA-XS74---14%22---Core-i7-10510U---16-GB-RAM---512-GB-SSD/"&gt;exorbitant prices&lt;/a&gt; attached to enterprise purchases. For that reason, I’m glad the 13-inch Galaxy Book Pro exists, even if its boring aesthetic and aspect ratio mean it wouldn’t be my laptop of choice. It’s my top recommendation for anyone who goes a lot of places or anyone who just wants something really, really light. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Solar Ash’s world and combat can’t keep up with its incredible movement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ebJ7wj6DS0JidCvIyNdzbDbjZAU=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70236192/solarash1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yv8pkZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solar Ash&lt;/em&gt; is a visually stunning though mechanically uninteresting game that I tried and failed to fall in love with. I thought it’d be easy to love or at least somewhat like a game made by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18264280/hyper-light-drifter-solar-ash-kingdom-heart-machine-announcement-teaser-trailer"&gt;same folks&lt;/a&gt; who developed &lt;em&gt;Hyper Light Drifter&lt;/em&gt; and published by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540676/annapurna-games-indie-publisher-development-studio"&gt;the company that underwrote indie darlings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/27/21083368/kentucky-route-zero-act-v-review-pc-switch-ps4-xbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kentucky Route Zero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;What Remains of Edith Finch&lt;/em&gt;. But after a couple hours of grav-boosting my way through colorful but sterile environments and beating on the same handful of enemies, &lt;em&gt;Solar Ash&lt;/em&gt; just couldn’t hold me — and that’s a shame since most things with Ash in its name are pretty neat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQqT6g"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Solar Ash,&lt;/em&gt; you play a voidrunner tasked with saving your planet from the black hole that’s slowly sucking in your homeworld like my dog thinks will happen to him whenever I fire up the Hoover. The big &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin"&gt;MacGuffin&lt;/a&gt; that will save your planet, however, is broken, requiring you to defeat several kaiju-like monsters called remnants in order to get the machine back online. Through void-powered grav boots, you can skate, boost, and rail grind your way through riotously colorful environments, collecting drops of blood that splatter the landscape, which you can spend to upgrade your shields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6tG4cr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most things with Ash in its name are pretty neat&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Xw7Ry"&gt;The skating feels really good. I got the most enjoyment out of &lt;em&gt;Solar Ash&lt;/em&gt; when I was boosting off natural ramps and grinding on rails to see how high or far I could get without hitting a wall or falling cliff. But the game’s environment isn’t really set up for you to fully take advantage of how good that movement feels. There are lots of vertical platforming sections in which you slowly climb up cliffs and buildings that interrupt your ability to freely skate about. It reminds me of the worst parts of the later &lt;em&gt;Sonic &lt;/em&gt;games. Whenever Sonic’s speed was broken up by a slow “climb up these arbitrary steps now” platforming section, the game’s momentum, and thereby my enjoyment, would crash. It’s the same with &lt;em&gt;Solar Ash.&lt;/em&gt; I wish it had been constructed in a way that let me &lt;em&gt;Jet Set Radio&lt;/em&gt; across the landscape to my heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRepeB"&gt;I think &lt;em&gt;Solar Ash&lt;/em&gt; failed me from the beginning. While I really enjoyed its pastel-but-make-it-dirty colorfulness, &lt;em&gt;Solar Ash&lt;/em&gt; dumped me into its world with too little explanation and expected me to care enough to keep going. Almost immediately after pressing start, I’m thrown at an extremely frustrating boss fight while having only a handful of button tutorials and on-screen prompts as my guide. A lot of games do that cold open when you’re dropped into a manic combat situation, and only after you triumph are you allowed a moment to learn a little story and finally take in your surroundings. That didn’t work for &lt;em&gt;Solar Ash&lt;/em&gt;. The first boss was just so aggravating, given I hadn’t had the time to really gel with the controls, that I contemplated putting down the game for good. Eventually, I triumphed and got the story info dump I desired, but overall, I spent about three hours with the game before calling it quits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tngzcT1sW7L4D_iqNrz2A7MlnkE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067725/solarash2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vfFCQe"&gt;The world doesn’t just impede your movement — it also feels so empty. Enemies are sparse, and despite their morphological differences, you don’t have to change up your combat to defeat them (or at least you didn’t in the part that I experienced). It’d be neat if flying enemies required you to use your grapple to bring them down before you could wail on them, anything to break up the button mashing. There are suits to collect and bits of story to uncover, some of which hit the exact kind of tragic pathos I enjoy, but the rest of the game beyond that first rough boss fight didn’t do enough to keep me around.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8e546"&gt;I don’t think &lt;em&gt;Solar Ash&lt;/em&gt; is a bad game, and if you can overcome the tough initial minutes, you’ll probably have a decent time. But there are a lot of games competing for attention right now, and &lt;em&gt;Solar Ash&lt;/em&gt;’s splashy colors and slick skating just don’t go far enough to make it stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncs6IE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SEC reportedly investigating Tesla over its solar panels’ potential fire risks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oxf3Gj0kFfYRE7758WJoY-_u98U=/195x0:1805x1073/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235826/press_solar_roof.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ELiNvU"&gt;The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking into a claim that Tesla didn’t appropriately inform its shareholders and the public about potential fire risks that its solar panel systems may pose, according to a report by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/exclusive-sec-probes-tesla-over-whistleblower-claims-solar-panel-defects-2021-12-06/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFhTK3"&gt;This comes after Steven Henkes, a former field quality manager at Tesla, filed a whistleblower complaint against the company in 2019. The SEC probe was made public following Henkes’ request for information about his report, through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; obtained a copy of the SEC’s response to Henkes, dated September 24th, that declined his request but stated: “We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing.” As confirmed by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, an SEC official also noted that the letter doesn’t imply that there was any legal wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fDWPjq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Safety issues associated with Tesla’s solar panels arose in 2019&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vTiEbA"&gt;Henkes claims that Tesla and SolarCity, which Tesla acquired in 2016, failed to warn customers and shareholders about the fire risks associated with the solar panel systems’ defective electrical connectors. The complaint alleges that Tesla misled customers by telling them the company simply had to conduct maintenance on the systems, rather than informing them about the potential fire risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4Mju0"&gt;Henkes says he told Tesla management that the company should shut down the defective systems, notify customers, and inform the proper authorities. Tesla fired the former field quality manager in 2020, and he believes the move was done in retaliation. Henkes has since &lt;a href="https://unicourt.com/case/ca-ala-henkes-vs-telsa-energy-inc-1402323"&gt;filed a wrongful termination lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUEvao"&gt;Safety issues associated with Tesla’s solar panels arose in 2019 when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20825566/walmart-tesla-solar-panel-fire-lawsuit-negligence"&gt;Walmart sued Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, blaming the company’s solar panels for starting fires in several Walmart stores. The retail giant claimed that the solar panels were defective — some of which were allegedly installed by SolarCity prior to its acquisition — and that Tesla failed to ground the systems properly. However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20949661/walmart-tesla-lawsuit-settlement-solar-panel-fires-solarcity"&gt;Walmart dropped the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; later that year, saying that the two companies had come to an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fi8L2n"&gt;“The SEC does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation,” an SEC spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A multiplayer Pac-Man game is coming to Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_0FZMgFBV4RdGbYBWzdYpbhl0nU=/0x0:1974x1316/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235758/MazeCreator1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Meta&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KvSna3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;/em&gt; is a new multiplayer-focused spin on the classic arcade game that you’ll be able to play right on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3TAyw"&gt;The main draw of &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;/em&gt; is the ability to play co-op Pac-Man with up to three other people. Players work together to try to survive the pesky ghosts, but they’ll also be competing for the highest score. You can make rooms to play with your friends, and Facebook Gaming streamers can invite viewers to join their game with Facebook’s Play with Streamer feature. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LMjOIJQqfTuMQrpV_ANDiTWaeIY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23061915/PlayWithStreamer2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You can join a &lt;/em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;em&gt; game right from a livestream.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="63XkZy"&gt;You won’t just be working through the familiar &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; maze, though. Players will be able to make their own levels, which could lead to some &lt;em&gt;Mario Maker&lt;/em&gt;-style delights or deviousness once people get their hands on the level creator tools. (If you want to play the entire classic version of &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man, &lt;/em&gt;that’s an option, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utBOPL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;/em&gt; also features the first of what Facebook is calling Facebook Interactives with its “Watch” mode, which is launching in beta. In Watch mode, 2D mazes are converted to an isometric 3D view, and viewers can power up Pac-Man or the ghosts. User-created maps can appear in Watch mode, too, meaning players might be able to create some interesting tests for the AI-driven characters. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TS3JJ2uuas8SADKFtjV2qKmQL5U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23061922/Watch1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;em&gt;’s Watch mode.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ITqcqk"&gt;If you’re interested in trying &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;/em&gt;, it’ll be available for free beginning Monday on desktop and the mobile versions of the Facebook app. It will be exclusive to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbN4Ii"&gt;The game — which was developed by &lt;a href="https://www.genvidtech.com/"&gt;Genvid&lt;/a&gt;, a company that specializes in interactive livestreamed experiences — could be a signal of how Meta wants to expand Facebook’s gaming offerings to let streamers play games directly with their audiences. Facebook already offers Twitch-like livestreaming as well as games you can play right inside the app (and some that even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21528438/facebook-cloud-gaming-beta-android-web-jason-rubin-interview"&gt;stream from the cloud&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;twist on a familiar formula seems like it could be a smart first step into interactive content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aYhUOE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Pac-Man Community’ has shades of ‘Pac-Man Live Studio’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rhe11V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;/em&gt; seems similar to &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt;, a multiplayer &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; game with a level editor designed to be played on Amazon-owned Twitch that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440891/amazon-games-pac-man-live-studio-twitch-bandai-namco"&gt;still hasn’t been released&lt;/a&gt; despite being announced in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266881/pac-man-live-studio-playable-on-twitch-june"&gt;May 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Bandai Namco assures &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they’re different games, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPksgE"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;/em&gt; is a brand new Facebook instant game from Bandai Namco Entertainment and Genvid that will be available in December,” a Bandai Namco spokesperson said in a statement. “We don’t have any specific news to share about &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; today, but we will communicate updates and more &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; news in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vns36n"&gt;The future of &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t seem bright. Its official Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/"&gt;no longer exists&lt;/a&gt;, a previously functioning URL about the game on &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games/pac-man-live-studio"&gt;Amazon Games’ website shows a 404 error&lt;/a&gt;, and a previously functioning URL on Bandai Namco’s website &lt;a href="https://pacman.com/en/games/livestudio.php"&gt;now redirects&lt;/a&gt; to a directory of &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; games. But if &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio &lt;/em&gt;never sees the light of day, at least there’s &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can attend the Game Awards red carpet in the metaverse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IDLm3FvBwzOFoORiU5o7OouCanM=/92x0:1057x643/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235767/axialtlt_core_16d_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jdgUDL"&gt;The Game Awards is the latest institution to try its hand at virtual worlds. The awards show, which takes place on December 9th, will be available to watch through the usual platforms like YouTube and Twitch. But viewers can also check it out via what’s described as a “metaverse experience” built with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21158189/core-free-game-creation-tool-pc-youtube-twitch"&gt;the creation tool Core&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGjvva"&gt;Players will not only be able to watch the event within the Core experience, but also do things like attend a virtual version of the red carpet, along with “several unique interactive experiences that are only available during the broadcast.” There will also be an afterparty with a currently unnamed DJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLs1ef"&gt;The move is just part of a growing trend of virtual worlds, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;all banded together under the metaverse label&lt;/a&gt;, being used by everyone from Facebook to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. In the case of the Game Awards, the expansion makes a lot of sense, given that the show is already broadcast on a huge range of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICvyY4"&gt;The Game Awards kicks off at 9PM ET on December 9th, and the show has historically been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166109/the-game-awards-2020-announcements-trailers-fortnite-smash-bros-among-us-mass-effect"&gt;a place full of game reveals and big trailers&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this month host Geoff Keighley confirmed that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;given the ongoing revelations of abuse at Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817651/activision-blizzard-the-game-awards-harassment"&gt;the publisher would not be involved with the show outside of its nominations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel’s lock screen Snapchat shortcut is here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mA9FXslofqpqtWjA9DSdVjP8ZDY=/0x0:2512x1675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235787/image3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel’s new Quick Tap to Snap feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zo2E1H"&gt;Quick Tap to Snap, a Google Pixel feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734993/pixel-6-snapchat-feature-tap-camera"&gt;announced in October&lt;/a&gt; that lets you open Snapchat directly from your lock screen by tapping twice on the rear of the phone, is arriving as part of the Pixel’s latest feature drop. The functionality will be available on the Pixel 4A 5G and newer devices, and Google says there’s also a new Pixel-exclusive Snapchat filter called “Pixel Face” on the way this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQ88uj"&gt;The Quick Tap to Snap feature is one of a handful of updates coming as part of the Google Pixel’s feature drop this month. Other features include new ultra-wideband (UWB) functionality on the Pixel 6 Pro, a new “conversation mode” accessibility feature in the Sound Amplifier app, and the expansion of car crash detection and automatic transcriptions to more countries and languages, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3die9m"&gt;We’ve known since its launch that the Pixel 6 Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;includes an ultra-wideband chip&lt;/a&gt;, but until now it’s not been used for much. However, with this latest update, Google says the 6 Pro’s UWB chip will be used to improve its Nearby Share feature when sending files to other ultra-wideband devices, including compatible Samsung phones. UWB chips found in Samsung and Apple’s recent phones have used the technology to accurately pinpoint their respective &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373410/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-uwb-ar-bluetooth-price-release-date"&gt;location&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;trackers&lt;/a&gt;, but similar functionality has yet to make an appearance on Google’s latest phone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WygfKEcLEX0kpULp-3i8m-OyUCo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067299/ezgif.com_gif_maker__6_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sound Amplifier feature in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jKgDGX"&gt;Google is characterizing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708608/google-sound-amplifier-accessibilities-android-6-marshmallow-support-expansion-how-to"&gt;Sound Amplifier’s&lt;/a&gt; “conversation mode” as an “early-stage accessibility feature.” It’s designed to tune out distracting background noise when you’re trying to listen to someone, with an interface that’s as simple as pointing your phone at the person to whom you want to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djVGbF"&gt;A couple of previously launched features are also expanding. The Pixel’s Recorder app, which allows you to automatically transcribe speech, now supports more languages like Japanese, French, and German on the Pixel 3 and up. These languages were previously exclusive to Pixel 6 devices, according to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/9516618?hl=en"&gt;Google’s support page&lt;/a&gt;. Car crash detection, which originally launched with the Pixel 4 in 2019, is also expanding to more countries. It’s coming to Taiwan, Italy, and France, after having previously been available in Spain, Ireland, Japan, the UK, Australia, Singapore, and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxGiwg"&gt;There are a couple of customization tweaks coming to select Pixel devices and accessories. If you’re using a Pixel phone with the A-series Pixel Buds you now get more control over bass response, and the Pixel 3 and newer can now customize how long you need to hold the power button before the Google Assistant activates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQvRe9"&gt;Google says these features are rolling out “in the next few weeks.” The exact availability of features varies by Pixel model. They join a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811617/google-android-auto-widgets-assistant-family-bell-updates-december-2021"&gt;collection of new features&lt;/a&gt; that were announced for the Android platform more generally last week, which included the ability to unlock select 2020–2022 BMW cars in certain countries by tapping Pixel 6 phones on the door handle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google TV adds more than 300 free channels to its live tab with Pluto TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B7AKCntewHTHlekPEASKUM18xMw=/74x0:865x527/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235770/image002__1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WIyeVJ"&gt;Google TV is adding yet another cord-cutting option to its live TV tab. With the addition of Pluto TV, Google TV users now have even more live TV channels to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6frkJ"&gt;Beginning today, Google TV will now support Pluto TV within the live TV tab, meaning users can easily access more than 300 free channels from the platform’s primary live TV hub. Pluto TV is the fourth streaming service to grab a spot on Google TV’s tab. Previously, Google TV supported YouTube TV, Philo, and Sling — all of which require paid subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uTdrA"&gt;Technically Google TV already offers plenty of free live TV services through its apps, but baking an ad-supported service directly into the live tab is a much easier way to find live and linear coverage. Plus, rival streamer Roku already supports free live TV through its Roku Channel experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Z0rZn"&gt;In addition to adding Pluto TV to its live tab, new Google TV users can also &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/peacock-promo-terms/"&gt;claim six months&lt;/a&gt; of Peacock Premium for free (after which time, it’ll cost $5 a month). Peacock Premium gives users access to originals, live sports, on-demand movies, and series, as well as WWE programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFDfUT"&gt;Google said in a blog post that the new Pluto TV integration will be supported on all Google TV devices within the coming weeks, with more free streaming options on the way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SEC investigating Trump SPAC deal to take his social media platform public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Trump Departs The White House En Route To Army v Navy Football Game" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N4QzJIZtRD3W3BLVUOqE5sVaHbQ=/0x0:4158x2772/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235740/1230086816.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The SEC is investigating a SPAC deal involving former President Trump’s nascent social media company. | Photo by Al Drago/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DsbNj7"&gt;Two US regulatory agencies are investigating the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that plans to take former President Trump’s nascent social media company public. &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000119312521348598/d242442d425.htm"&gt;Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) said Monday&lt;/a&gt; that it has received inquiries for information from the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcPUHq"&gt;The SEC is interested in documents related to communications between the SPAC and Trump’s social media venture, including “documents relating to meetings of DWAC’s Board of Directors, policies and procedures relating to trading, the identification of banking, telephone, and email addresses, the identities of certain investors, and certain documents and communications between DWAC” and the Trump Media and Technology Group, (TMTG).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xmqEm"&gt;FINRA, meanwhile, is seeking details about a review of trading that happened prior to the October 20th announcement that &lt;a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/b2icontent.irpass.cc/2660/rl104194.pdf"&gt;DWAC was merging with TMTG.&lt;/a&gt; According to DWAC’s Monday regulatory filing, the inquiries occurred in late October and early November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAIQAv"&gt;If either agency finds evidence of improper financial dealings in the SPAC’s inception, it could derail the project, leaving the fate of Trump’s media company in jeopardy. And SPAC shareholders can withdraw their investment at any time before going public. While 2020 was a big year for SPAC deals, in recent months, investors’ excitement about the deals has cooled. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/buzzfeed-suffers-wave-of-spac-investor-withdrawals-before-going-public-11638472756"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported last week that since July, the average SPAC deal has lost more than half its money before the deal closes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k88V83"&gt;If approved, the SPAC deal would give Trump’s company nearly $300 million to get Truth Social, which is essentially a Twitter clone, up and running. It would also bring the company public, with a listing on the Nasdaq exchange. &lt;a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/b2icontent.irpass.cc/2660/rl104343.pdf"&gt;TMTG said in a news release&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday that it had agreements with a “diverse group of institutional investors” — whom it did not identify — to raise about $1 billion as part of a concurrent private funding round. According to the release, DWAC projects Truth Social to reach 40 million subscribers and 81 million total users by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="f7SMMi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"SPACs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fNPLJh"&gt;DWAC said it was cooperating with the information requests and noted in its SEC filing that “the investigation does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone violated the law or that the SEC has a negative opinion of DWAC or any person, event, or security.” It made a similar note about FINRA’s request that its inquiry “should not be construed as an indication that FINRA has determined that any violations of Nasdaq rules or federal securities laws have occurred.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tCqB8"&gt;Trump first registered TMTG in February and, in its initial investor presentation, said it planned to build a “media powerhouse ... to fight back against the ‘Big Tech’ companies of Silicon Valley who have used their unilateral power to silence opposing voices in America.” The former president was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218805/donald-trump-platforms-bans-facebook-twitter-youtube"&gt;barred from Twitter, Facebook, and other social platforms&lt;/a&gt; in January after his supporters carried out an insurrection on the US Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CcvpB"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/warren-urges-sec-to-investigate-potential-violations-of-securities-laws-during-spac-merger-with-trump-company"&gt;November letter to SEC chair Gary Gensler&lt;/a&gt;, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) asked the SEC to investigate the Trump SPAC deal, saying that DWAC and TMTG had “brazenly flouted” securities rules. Warren cited an October 29th &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/business/trump-spac-digital-world.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; that reported that DWAC head Patrick Orlando had been in discussions for a deal with Trump since at least March. Warren pointed out that SPACs “are required to disclose any direct or indirect conversations with potential target companies.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HP45dX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NbC16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
