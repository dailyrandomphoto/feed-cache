    <title>DoorDash has acquired salad-making robot company Chowbotics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSFHDCqHpj547zcTZemp8c4H1WI=/161x0:2539x1585/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68788641/chowbotics.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Salad vending machine company Chowbotics is now part of DoorDash&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AEYUQi"&gt;DoorDash has acquired salad-making robot startup Chowbotics, the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@DoorDash/welcoming-chowbotics-to-the-doordash-team-cf0b59c4ce94"&gt;companies announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but the Chowbotics team have all become DoorDash employees, and the company will operate independently within DoorDash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3hLeh"&gt;“We have long admired the work that Chowbotics has done to increase access to fresh meals, with its groundbreaking robotics product and vision,” DoorDash co-founder Stanley Tang said in statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “With the Chowbotics team on board, we can explore new use cases and customers, providing another service to help our merchants grow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kIKHS9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bPeE-zfU00w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="keVa67"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chowbotics.com/about-us/"&gt;Chowbotics&lt;/a&gt; was founded in 2014, and its fresh food robot Sally — a rectangular machine that’s essentially a salad vending machine — can create customizable salads, grain and poke bowls, parfaits, cereals, and snacks all within a small space. The robot is used by companies like universities, hospitals, and grocery stores, according to a blog post from DoorDash general manager Penn Daniel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWyMuI"&gt;DoorDash currently has the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/edison-discovers/q4-2020-food-delivery-rideshare-sales-report-70382329c1b1"&gt;greatest share&lt;/a&gt; of the US food delivery market, around 48 percent, ahead of rivals like UberEats and Grubhub. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21563716/doordash-ipo-profit-pandemic-food-delivery-drones"&gt;Its revenue skyrocketed in 2020&lt;/a&gt; as restaurants closed in-person dining due to the pandemic and customers relied on delivery services. But when DoorDash went public late last year, its IPO was criticized by some analysts as lacking in value; they questioned how DoorDash would be able to continue to grow if demand for food delivery subsides once the pandemic is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1a9WDK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/doordash-ipo-most-ridiculous-david-trainer-bailing-out-private-investors-2020-12-1029870440"&gt;Analyst David Trainer of New Constructs said at the time&lt;/a&gt;, “We think this proposed public equity offering holds no value, $0, beyond bailing out private investors before unsuspecting public investors realize the business is not viable in its current form.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JT8HQQ"&gt;But the Chowbotics acquisition raises interesting questions about DoorDash’s post-pandemic plans. Daniel wrote in the blog post that Chowbotics will allow DoorDash to help the restaurants that use its delivery platform expand their offerings. It seems likely that Chowbotics’ vending machines would fit into the ghost kitchen model, which are delivery-only restaurants that &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/21540765/ghost-kitchens-virtual-restaurants-covid-19-industry-impact"&gt;some in the industry regard warily&lt;/a&gt;. DoorDash has a &lt;a href="https://www.nrn.com/delivery-takeout-solutions/doordash-launches-program-revive-closed-restaurants-using-ghost-kitchens"&gt;ghost kitchen facility&lt;/a&gt; in California, and last year announced it was working with Chicago restaurant Krazy Hog — which closed in-person dining during the pandemic — as part of its &lt;a href="https://blog.doordash.com/helping-restaurants-to-reopen-for-delivery-4326c4edf29d"&gt;Reopen for Delivery&lt;/a&gt; initiative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XB4yXR"&gt;If you’re ordering for delivery, chances are you’d never know whether your salad was made by a Chowbotics robot or a human unless the restaurant tells you. It’s not uncommon for restaurants to brand their delivery operations under a different name — like when some diners discovered the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chuck-e-cheese-pasquallys-grubhub_l_5ec2dd89c5b646534f558efa"&gt;pizzas they ordered from “Pasqually’s”&lt;/a&gt; actually came from kids’ eatery Chuck E. Cheese. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New California law would exempt employees who speak out about discrimination from NDAs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Legislature in session at Capitol in Sacramento,CA." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pqlu_2ZgnvmYcy_wNyOwomCG_kw=/56x0:4145x2726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68788548/1230682089.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c9dXsf"&gt;On Monday, California state Senator Connie Leyva introduced the Silenced No More Act, a bill that advocates say will protect employees who speak out about discrimination at work, even if they’ve signed nondisclosure agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raHVAj"&gt;“SB 331 will prevent workers from being forced to sign non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements that would limit their ability to speak out about harassment and discrimination in the workplace,” Leyva said in a statement. “It is unacceptable for any employer to try to silence a worker because he or she was a victim of any type of harassment or discrimination—whether due to race, sexual orientation, religion, age or any other characteristic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga9tqL"&gt;The newly introduced legislation builds on work by Ifeoma Ozoma, a former Pinterest employee who went public in June, alongside her colleague Aerica Shimizu Banks, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/"&gt;with allegations of racism and sexism&lt;/a&gt; at the company. Ozoma knew she was partially covered by a California law called CCP 1001, which passed in the wake of the Me Too movement to protect employees speaking out about sex discrimination in the office. But she also realized the law had serious limitations: it didn’t account for other forms of workplace harassment, including racism, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/Policy/new-california-law-ndas"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJu9Mb"&gt;“If Pinterest decides to sue me, they’d have to state affirmatively that the discrimination I faced was not because of my sex — it was because of my race,” &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/Policy/new-california-law-ndas"&gt;Ozoma said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This has been the only time being a Black woman was a double-bind for the other person, not for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FC7eeJ"&gt;After she went public, Ozoma started working to expand CCP 1001 protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpqEXk"&gt;If successful, the law would have a dramatic impact on the tech industry, which is famous for making workers sign strict nondisclosure agreements. These NDAs can include broad non-disparagement clauses which prevent employees from speaking out. The rule is especially hard for contract workers who often lack the protections and resources of full-time employees. In recent years, contractors at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have chosen to speak out anyway — and risked retaliation as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ynpnv"&gt;The Silenced No More Act, which is jointly sponsored by the California Employment Lawyers Association and Equal Rights Advocates, covers “every discrimination category under California law,” &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; reports. This includes race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, ancestry, disability, and age, among others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RrE8Q"&gt;“NDAs are inherently harmful because they prevent workers from speaking out against abuses in the workplace,” said Jessica Stender, senior counsel for workplace justice and public policy at Equal Rights Advocates. “We are proud to cosponsor SB 331, which will prohibit forced NDAs related to all forms of discrimination—including overdue race discrimination protections—to ensure that workers are not silenced and discrimination is not swept under the rug.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s App Store is hosting multimillion-dollar scams, says this iOS developer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nRMuVrltnfZKYSvIEWrK-dR5QdU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68788371/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UakKY0"&gt;Mobile app developer Kosta Eleftheriou has a new calling that goes beyond software development: taking on what he sees as a rampant scam problem ruining the integrity of Apple’s App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7m4aTz"&gt;Eleftheriou, who created the successful Apple Watch keyboard app FlickType, has for the last two weeks been publicly criticizing Apple for lax enforcement of its App Store rules that have allowed scam apps, as well as apps that clone popular software from other developers, to run rampant. These apps enjoy top billing in the iPhone marketplace, all thanks to glowing reviews and sterling five-star ratings that are largely fabricated, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bfrJAE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Up to now, I've been in the "Apple *wants* to do the right thing" camp. My viewpoint is starting to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How to spot a $5M/year scam on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt;, in 5 minutes flat: &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1357938977748078594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zq0wOY"&gt;“It’s surprising more people don’t know about this. The extent to which this has been going on and is currently going on is absolutely mind-blowing,” Eleftheriou tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;of the magnitude of fraud he says is occurring daily on the App Store&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;In particular now with the App Store, which is my main concern, the problem has grown to such an extent that having the rating and review system is making it worse. It gives consumers a false sense of security and a false idea that the app is great as you’re entering it through a glowing App Store page with raving reviews.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otnjzC"&gt;His vocal complaints, which have attracted the attention and support of countless other app developers in the iOS community, underscore the increasing tension between Apple and the software makers upon whom it depends. It comes at a time of unprecedented antitrust scrutiny and legal challenges from competitors related to the company’s stewardship of the App Store, from which it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;estimated to have made more than $64 billion last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpAAa8"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZkhTKG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The extent to which this has been going on and is currently going on is absolutely mind-blowing.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eoaFRC"&gt;The issues Eleftheriou is raising are interlocking ones all stemming from what he says are inconsistently enforced App Store rules and lazy moderation. It’s not just apps that try to siphon money away from consumers under false pretenses using exploitative subscription services. It’s also fake reviews and ratings that can be bought and a broken algorithmic ranking system that helps these apps float to the top and take the spot of genuine paid apps developed by small teams or singular developers, Eleftheriou says. Letting it perpetuate, he adds, is a platform that Apple does not actively police unless it’s an issue that gains the attention of the media or involves one of Apple’s current rivals like Facebook or &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;maker Epic Games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEXORD"&gt;Eleftheriou first detailed his personal experience with App Store scams &lt;a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;amp;jsonp=vglnk_161281136039111&amp;amp;key=c1c7d488bb2df8a8b659d5d41634d304&amp;amp;libId=kkwxug0j010023dg000DLc57hpt7i&amp;amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2021%2F02%2F08%2Fapp-store-scam-apps-how-to-spot%2F&amp;amp;v=1&amp;amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fkeleftheriou%2Fstatus%2F1356011069395755009&amp;amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;amp;title=Developer%20exposes%20multiple%20scam%20apps%20on%20the%20App%20Store%2C%20some%20bringing%20in%20millions%20of%20dollars%20in%20revenue%20-%209to5Mac&amp;amp;txt=thread%20began%20two%20weeks%20ago"&gt;late last month in a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;, where he explained how his app FlickType was maliciously copied by numerous developers that built non-functioning versions of the software and charged egregious subscription fees, only getting away with it because of strong App Store reviews and high five-star ratings he claims are fake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDyny2"&gt;Eleftheriou says his primary competitor, a scam app called KeyWatch, was charging users $8 per week and amassing more than $2 million a year, according to analytics from Appfigures, despite the app not functioning properly. He says KeyWatch even advertised its software using his promotional video — with his name still attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7onrML"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The App Store has a big problem &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You: an honest developer, working hard to improve your IAP conversions.&lt;br&gt;Your competitor: a $2M/year scam running rampant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1/ &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011069395755009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dDNC96"&gt;Eleftheriou has since embarked on an online crusade to bring more attention to the topic, fueled in part by Apple choosing to take down some of the apps he’s been highlighting but letting the developers behind those apps continue publishing to the App Store. Scores of other developers have begun chiming in with their own experiences, too, including notable Apple critics like Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KZ5te"&gt;Some of these critics, including Hansson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;with regard to his company’s Hey email client&lt;/a&gt;, have accused Apple in the past of mistreating and overcharging developers using the App Store’s standard 30 percent cut of app downloads and in-app purchases. These critics see the scam situation as further proof that Apple profits off of these developers and therefore doesn’t take proper steps to moderate the platform and enforce its rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kkilUu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The subscription scam apps that Apple allow in the App Store really are bananas. While they're busy hunting legitimate developers down for their pound of flesh, they're letting these hyaenas strive on the savannah unopposed. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NpsjjWC0CY"&gt;https://t.co/NpsjjWC0CY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1358822574243905538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="S1tG5n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple refuses to take down two scam apps that destroy my honest business via fake ratings and false marketing claims.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have hard proof yet Apple ignores my numerous reports.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt;, please do something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is my story.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppStore?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AppStore&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Appocalypse?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Appocalypse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Scams?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Scams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/SCw9FHrN7g"&gt;https://t.co/SCw9FHrN7g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WatchChat (@WatchChatInfo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WatchChatInfo/status/1358825883465904131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AqKXD9"&gt;Apple has yet to respond publicly to Eleftheriou’s claims, though the company has removed KeyWatch and some of the other scam apps he’s brought attention to over the past week. But the issues are systemic, Eleftheriou says, and nothing short of an overhaul to how the App Store ranks software, measures trustworthiness, and roots out bad actors will remedy the issue. Until then, Eleftheriou says he’s going to keep sounding the alarm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DP3h6I"&gt;“I’m not gonna stop. Whenever I see a scam, I’m going to call them out,” he says. “I just can’t wait for some actual proper change from Apple to make me feel like I should concentrate on what I should be concentrating on, which is app development.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="zke3Gs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The more users understand this is a problem, the more pressure there will be on Apple to act.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2FSGs"&gt;He says a competing app store on the iPhone could help solve a lot of these issues. That’s the same line of argument Epic has used in its lawsuit against Apple over the removal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Epic and its chief executive, Tim Sweeney, have called for alternative marketplaces on iOS, as well as the ability for apps distributed through the App Store to use their own payment systems and not give Apple 30 percent of every transaction. After Epic deployed its own in-app payment system within &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;last summer, Apple removed the app for violating its rules. Epic is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;suing both Apple and Google&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95KyD4"&gt;“In an ideal world, competition does have the tendency to sort a lot of things out, whether it’s pricing or enforcement of rules. Competition is like creativity; you get all these new ideas and hopefully the best get to the top,” Eleftheriou says. “The other way would be for developers to publicly share their stories as far and as wide as possible. The more users understand this is a problem, the more pressure there will be on Apple to act.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOAb8y"&gt;Eleftheriou adds that he’s disappointed in Apple’s silence on the matter, though that’s only energized him further to continue speaking out. “It’s not just acting. I think Apple needs to, at the minimum, say something, acknowledge the issue and that they’re working on it,” he says. “Just staying silent about it is just falsely reinforcing this notion for consumers that App Store reviews and ratings are to be trusted. They are not.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYjouv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alabama warehouse workers prepare to face down Amazon in union vote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WxqYexX5a2tyiy9Vp8fivS3YIRU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68788137/acastro_210208_4402_amazonVote.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An Amazon warehouse in Alabama could become the first to unionize in the US &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="jq4fTt"&gt;For the next seven weeks, employees at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama will vote on whether to become the first of the company’s US employees to unionize. The only other US Amazon employees to make it as far as a union election was a smaller group of maintenance workers at a Delaware warehouse in 2014. That effort failed after an aggressive &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/technology/amazon-proves-infertile-soil-for-unions-so-far.html"&gt;anti-union campaign&lt;/a&gt; from a company that has long been &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dp3yn/amazon-leaked-reports-expose-spying-warehouse-workers-labor-union-environmental-groups-social-movements"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-worker-retaliation-coronavirus"&gt;worker organizing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNeO4L"&gt;The vote in Alabama, at a warehouse outside Birmingham called BHM1, comes at a pivotal time for the company and its workers. Amazon is emerging from the pandemic in a stronger position than ever: posting &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-amzn-4q-earnings-report-2020-11612221803"&gt;record earnings&lt;/a&gt;, opening new warehouses at a rapid clip, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/pushed-by-pandemic-amazon-goes-on-a-hiring-spree-without-equal.html"&gt;hiring&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of new workers a day. Those workers, however, have become increasingly vocal about the fact that they haven’t shared in the company’s success. Last year’s wave of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216172/amazon-coronavirus-protests-response-safety-jfk8-fired-covid-19"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; and walkouts over COVID-19 safety measures and other issues won some partial &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-workers-who-petitioned-for-paid-time-off-claim"&gt;victories&lt;/a&gt;, but the Bessemer union, if it succeeds, would give workers the power to negotiate a contract that could lock in durable changes to wages and working conditions. It could also inspire other Amazon warehouses to organize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5RcSDF"&gt;Workers at BHM1 say that one of the primary issues driving the union push is Amazon’s grueling and automatically enforced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155254/automation-robots-unemployment-jobs-vs-human-google-amazon"&gt;productivity metrics&lt;/a&gt;, a complaint that has prompted demonstrations at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20696154/amazon-prime-day-2019-strike-warehouse-workers-inhumane-conditions-the-rate-productivity"&gt;other Amazon facilities&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oV8jO2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You don’t have time to step back.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xbNIUW"&gt;Darryl Richardson started working at BHM1 when it opened in March, after the automotive company he worked at closed down. At first, he thought it would be a good job, but it wasn’t long before Amazon’s productivity tracking started to grate on him. Richardson is a “picker,” which means he removes products from shelves that robots bring to his station, sometimes climbing a ladder to do so, scans them, and sends them to be packaged for shipment. Amazon tracks how many items he scans, how quickly, and how much time he spends not scanning, which it calls “time off task,” or “TOT.” Going to the bathroom counts as “TOT.” Stretching between items counts as “TOT,” and after 30 minutes of “TOT,” workers get an automated writeup, and after two hours, they get fired, Richardson says. He estimates he has to scan an item approximately every ten seconds, all day, to avoid penalties. “It’s a very consistent fast pace. You don’t have time to step back.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyHOaH"&gt;“You go get some water, you can’t pause your time, and you get docked, because you aren’t scanning,” Richardson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="df9s9O"&gt;“I mean, you come into work and need to be treated like a human being,” says another worker, a longtime Amazon employee who transferred to BHM1 when it opened. He supports the union but asked to remain anonymous because of “Amazon’s reputation for how they deal with people trying to unionize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2rFB7S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You come into work and need to be treated like a human being.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MuLU6K"&gt;By the summer, other issues had arisen. Amazon had ended the hazard pay it implemented at the beginning of the pandemic, as well as its policy of allowing workers to take unlimited time off without pay. Meanwhile, COVID cases in the South were spiking. (A filing with the National Labor Relations Board provides a snapshot of the COVID rate at BHM1, with Amazon saying 218 workers at BHM1 had tested or were presumed positive for COVID-19 in the two weeks ending January 7th.) The warehouse was also extremely hot, workers say, and schedules would change unpredictably. “They change your schedule while you sleep,” Richardson says. “If they change the schedule and you don’t know, they terminate you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9Ih8W"&gt;“I think like a bunch of these frustrations with the company trying to make every little extra dollar, at the expense of the person actually doing the work, has really frustrated people down here,” says the Amazon worker who asked to be anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrHLUb"&gt;Amazon spokesperson Rachael Lighty said that the company offers a starting salary of $15.30 per hour with benefits at the Bessemer facility, and that 90% of employees there would recommend Amazon as a good place to work. “We don’t believe the RWDSU represents the majority of our employees’ views,” Lighty said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPHSHK"&gt;Beth Gutelius, who studies the logistics industry at the University of Illinois Chicago Center for Urban Economic Development, sees the Bessemer union push and other Amazon protests as a symptom of tensions that have long existed in e-commerce but have been heightened by the pandemic. “We’re reaching this point where some of the contradictions that have existed uncomfortably maybe can’t hold anymore,” Gutelius says. “Companies like Amazon really benefited from fulfilling consumer demand during the pandemic, and workers are seeing that those gains have not trickled down to them. Warehouse work in particular has long been invisible to the public, and highly undervalued by firms as a supply chain function, and I think it’s possible that we’re seeing the start of a pretty big course correction on this question, with the value of warehousing being seen in a new light.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VdN2s1"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2 id="U31BKe"&gt;An atmosphere of activism &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3C88co"&gt;At Richardson’s previous job, he had been a member of the United Auto Workers, and he felt employees there had been treated with more “respect.” There had been a procedure for addressing workers’ grievances and rules that made firings less arbitrary. Meanwhile, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union had been waging a public battle for better COVID-19 protections at nearby poultry plants. Richardson and other BHM1 employees decided to reach out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oopw4z"&gt;The campaign came together quickly, a fact that employees attribute to a confluence of factors. Frustration with Amazon — with the grueling work, dehumanizing management approach, and the company’s rocketing profits — was intense and widespread. This frustration coincided with a rising tide of activism at the facility. The majority of BHM1 workers are Black and many had been galvanized by the summer’s Black Lives Matter protests following the killing of George Floyd. “I think it also correlated with the recent racial justice movement,” says the anonymous employee. “There’s a lot of support for the movement in that building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWlhDZ"&gt;Joshua Brewer, the lead RWDSU organizer on the campaign, agrees with the role the movement played. “A lot of these workers are involved in that, especially a lot of these activists that have really worked hard to get their co-workers on board,” he says. “You feel that kind of spirit throughout the campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eW2ZGk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You feel that kind of spirit throughout the campaign.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Om7hos"&gt;He also attributes the campaign’s success to Bessemer’s deep union roots. “It’s a union town, so they go home to their families, and they hear from their aunts and uncles and dads and grandparents that worked in the steel industries or in the mines, and they say unions are good, you need to sign that card and get involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZBzo5"&gt;After several months of workers talking privately to other workers, Brewer says they decided it was time to go public. On October 20th, RWDSU members from nearby poultry plants and warehouses came to the BHM1 gates and started talking to employees. A month later, they had collected enough signatures supporting an election to feel confident filing a petition with the National Labor Relations Board. Brewer says over 3,000 employees, more than half the workers Amazon says work at the facility, have now signed cards in favor of an election. (Organizers need 30 percent of workers to show interest in an election to begin the election process, and more than half of workers who vote to win the election and certify the union.) On January 15th, the NLRB &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/15/amazon-union-alabama-vote/"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that the election could go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUk6kv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o2uzNW"&gt;Amazon goes on the offensive &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Zv5Zyi"&gt;By then, Amazon’s anti-union campaign was underway. In late December, it had launched a &lt;a href="https://www.doitwithoutdues.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; with the tagline #doitwithoutdues, with warnings that signing cards in support of a union election could legally obligate workers to pay dues. (This is misleading: dues wouldn’t start unless workers voted to approve a union contract, and even then, Alabama is a right-to-work state, so dues would be voluntary.) The site also featured photos of happy Amazon employees and an animated cartoon dog that was, inexplicably, also a DJ. Managers started pulling workers aside for anti-union presentations — so called “captive audience” meetings — where they made similar arguments about dues, workers say, and gave out anti-union pins to wear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7nzxS"&gt;Richardson and the other BHM1 employee say some of these meetings were conducted by people who don’t work at the warehouse. It’s common for companies to hire anti-union consultants who specialize in dissuading employees from organizing, though Amazon did not comment directly on whether consultants had been hired for BHM1’s unionization effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRHycH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;It is important that all employees understand the facts of joining a union and the election process,” said Amazon’s Lighty. “We host regular information sessions for all employees, which include an opportunity for employees to ask questions. If the union vote passes, it will impact everyone at the site and it’s important all associates understand what that means for them and their day-to-day life working at Amazon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjGrJF"&gt;Workers now get near-daily text messages from Amazon telling them to vote no, that “a union is a business that takes money out of your paycheck to fund itself,” and other anti-union messages, according to screenshots viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. On Facebook and Instagram, employees are targeted with anti-union ads linking to Amazon’s #doitwithoutdues website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ujh27x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even in the bathrooms, Amazon’s anti-union campaign inescapable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="moZKxj"&gt;“I have never seen Amazon fight for something like this. I have never seen them try to push for something this hard before,” says the longtime Amazon employee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WINSOM"&gt;Anti-union banners and signs have gone up across the warehouse. Even in the bathrooms, Amazon’s anti-union campaign inescapable: signs have been posted on stall doors and at eye level above the urinals warning workers about union dues and telling them to “remember everything you already have without giving any of your hard earned money to the RWDSU,” one poster reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2fmas"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qoiSalYN-kx6GK5tGYpflExSfv8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22289064/Screen_Shot_2021_02_08_at_9.25.32_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ce-U4MS7_ncJ93oeC7ezq9eI-8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22289066/Screen_Shot_2021_02_08_at_9.24.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-union signs in the BHM1 bathrooms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8pdmdw"&gt;“It’s right in your face, like when you walk up to it, so you have something to read. It’s a pretty great way to get the info out there, but come on,” says the worker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEnyEC"&gt;At the NLRB, Amazon tried to delay the election and have it be conducted in person, rather than by mail. Since the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-establishes-standards-for-mail-and-manual-ballot-representation#:~:text=Since%20March%2C%20approximately%2090%20percent,concerns%20raised%20by%20the%20pandemic."&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of union elections have been by mail, but Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244413/amazon-union-vote-decision-appeal-alabama-us-labor-board"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that mail-in voting would decrease turnout, and that, in an argument that echoed misinformation about the presidential election, it would have a greater risk of “party fraud and coercion.” Instead, Amazon proposed setting up a tent in the warehouse parking lot, testing all participants for COVID, conducting temperature screening, and monitoring the line for social distancing, either using a “digital assistant” or with human teams. Amazon also proposed renting a floor of a local hotel for NLRB election agents and providing them with chauffeurs and food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cw8oCj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I have never seen Amazon fight for something like this.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LCw3bs"&gt;On Friday, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22268280/amazon-nlrb-denied-union-election-alabama-warehouse"&gt;NLRB denied&lt;/a&gt; Amazon’s appeal, reaffirming its position that mail voting is safer, and that letting Amazon rent out hotels and monitor voting lines would create an impression of bias and surveillance. Ballots will be sent out February 8th and need to be returned by March 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="FOHr0O"&gt;Amazon will undoubtedly continue its anti-union campaign, though it can no longer hold mandatory meetings on company time now that ballots have been sent out. But the BHM1 organizers are optimistic about their chances and about what a victory will mean for Amazon workers elsewhere. “I hope they’re watching what’s going on,” says Richardson. “And that they stand strong, they stick together, and do what they need to do to try to make it better there, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PIH6j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 8th 3:14PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The story has been updated to include responses from Amazon. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>E3 2021 may be digital as ESA says it’s ‘transforming’ the gaming showcase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WVURhht5P1Ja8MDkQkKcbpnKKbk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787987/acastro_190531_1777_e3_lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="syw46E"&gt;The Entertainment Software Association has announced that E3 2021 is happening this year, and it could be going digital, &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/e3-pushes-forward-with-plans-for-a-digital-2021-event/amp/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Video Games Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The event will be held from June 15th through June 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KljMd9"&gt;“We can confirm that we are transforming the E3 experience for 2021,” an ESA spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And will soon share exact details on how we’re bringing the global video game community together.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfs37P"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Video Games Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;, the ESA has outlined its plans for E3 2021, with intentions to hold multiple two-hour keynote sessions from games partners, an awards show, a preview night on June 14th, plus some small streams from various game publishers, influencers, and media partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84udVn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video Games Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; also notes that the ESA’s outline proposes that the broadcast event would be supplemented by media previews the week before, and game demos slated to appear at the event would be released on consumer platforms. The ESA would also allow partner companies to remotely stream playable game demos to the media across “thousands” of scheduled meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5N3xQL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can confirm that we are transforming the E3 experience for 2021”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qOZUes"&gt;While the entire plan sounds ambitious, it still requires approval from ESA’s membership, which is made up of some of the industry's biggest companies, which also hold significant influence over the structure of the event. Traditionally, E3 has been one of the biggest weeks in the gaming industry, with the event showcasing some of the year's largest announcements. However, in recent years, the ESA has faced pressure with redefining E3 as major publishers, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063737/sony-ps5-e3-2020-skip-again-launch-new-console-generation"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;, have opted to skip the event entirely in favor of hosting its own events around the week E3 is normally held. Following E3’s cancellation, many digital events were held to fill the void, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21243981/summer-game-fest-news-events-geoff-keighley-sony-microsoft"&gt;Summer Games Fest&lt;/a&gt; hosted by industry veteran Geoff Keighley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21OcVK"&gt;This is the first time the ESA is holding E3 after the organization &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21163570/e3-canceled-coronavirus-outbreak-xbox-nintendo"&gt;canceled E3 2020&lt;/a&gt; due to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. But E3 is not the only event that plans to go digital this year due to the pandemic; Activision Blizzard plans to host an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449517/blizzconline-blizzcon-blizzard-entertainment-event-convention-19-20-date"&gt;online-only BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; from February 19th through February 20th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Kaitlin Hatton?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_nva1kx3i753k7aqG9zbj0FbAWY=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67375083/khatton_200826_4171_0010_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘Is meatball an fruit?’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6bAL14"&gt;Like many businesses, the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has largely decamped to our homes. Starting in early March, we packed up our laptops and headphones, and we are now working from home offices, dining room tables, desks set up in the corners of bedrooms, or living room sofas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAMMnn"&gt;We thought it would be fun to find out, six months later, what adjustments the staff has made to their various living quarters in order to be able to turn out the same journalism that was formerly produced in an office setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGoGYf"&gt;For this article, we talked to &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; social media manager Kaitlin Hatton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqAnWw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaitlin, what does a social media manager do, actually?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="em4NoD"&gt;I handle everything from analytics to posting across all of our platforms, with a bunch of responsibilities in between. I tend to focus on our &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/verge/"&gt;Instagram accounts&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VergeDeals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; Deals&lt;/a&gt; Twitter account, so if you’ve ever wondered who is behind the screen for those profiles, that would be me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCB0ab"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking at the photos of your desk, I have to tell you that’s a great space. Was that an existing setup or did you put it together once you knew you’d be working at home?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8zi4t"&gt;Thank you! The situation around my setup is unique in that it came about when I switched from being in Vox Media’s office full-time while I lived in New York City to going entirely remote and moving to Ohio. I had always envisioned what I wanted my workspace to look like at home, but I wasn’t able to actually act on it until I moved. So everything from the setup to relocating was a fresh start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSV8UG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love the view out your window.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmIrdy"&gt;The large windows are my favorite part of the apartment — especially since I’m home all the time now. I spend a lot of time at my desk, and the natural light is a lifesaver.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQMjXEYG4cE67w7srpFGBqOfDJU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21845696/khatton_200826_4171_0017.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m66sGx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joERzR"&gt;Believe it or not, the desk is actually a Facebook Marketplace find. I was on a tight budget from moving and trying to be eco-conscious with some of my furniture choices. I made a pact with myself that I would try to find something that fits my needs and aesthetic secondhand first before buying new. I ended up really lucking out on this desk because it was $25, is incredibly spacious, and it’s been super sturdy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wT8hjE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What Are the Best Office and Desk Chairs Under $250?","url":"https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-desk-office-chairs-under-250.html"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8cKn9k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s great. It’s hard to find something that useful secondhand. Is the chair secondhand as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk7Jzc"&gt;It’s not! It’s from a set of dining chairs that I purchased new. I decided it was more comfortable than my previous desk chair so I swapped them out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bez4dZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think you’ll be looking around for a “real” desk chair? Or is this one comfortable enough to last you for a while?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5j2rX"&gt;It’s actually pretty comfortable so I’m going to keep it around for a while!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxg1xa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, can you tell me about your tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hW1hTW"&gt;Yes! The most crucial items that I need for work are my 2017 MacBook Pro, my external Dell monitor, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OWC-Thunderbolt-3-Pro-Dock/dp/B081K9J5FV/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OWC Thunderbolt 3 dock&lt;/a&gt; that I use to connect them. As a social media manager, I have to keep a lot of different websites and platforms up at all times so I’d be lost without a second screen. Unfortunately, my laptop is about to be sent off for repair because it’s missing the H key. It just popped off one day! As a solution, I’m using another Apple keyboard and mouse so my desk is a little crowded at the moment. (&lt;em&gt;Note: since this was written, Kaitlin reports that her H key has been fixed&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3tm1m"&gt;I also keep my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/ref=sr_1_3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DPMXZZ7/ref=s9_acsd_al_bw_c2_x_5_i?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt; within close reach so I can just grab them as I move around the apartment throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pv1kPh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s interesting that you grab for your Kindle rather than your phone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xvDF3"&gt;I wear an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-watch-series-3%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21409065%2Fremote-work-desk-setup-from-home-office-tech#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; nearly every day, so unless I need to post to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Instagram accounts, I tend to just leave my phone around since I’ll see texts coming in anyway. I’m always reading books so I like to make sure my Kindle is around me in case I have some spare time to use it. It’s ancient; I’ve had it for years, but it’s still chugging along just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1fs19j"&gt;
&lt;div id="gkOGsP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="yHuwAX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And you knew I was going to ask: “Is meatball an fruit?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JanYp"&gt;Honestly, it’s one of the best things I own! I’m a major &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406041/post-malone-envy-gaming-dallas-empire-fuel"&gt;Post Malone&lt;/a&gt; fan, for starters. Then several acquaintances of mine in the social media management sphere were getting these plaques with their favorite inspirational tweets on them. The only tweet I could think of that I wanted to look at every day was this one. It’s truly iconic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mAuXI9"&gt;
&lt;div id="XeDebX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326069" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x2TKI1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a beautiful decoration on the back of your monitor. What is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUB7kl"&gt;Thanks! It’s an embroidered coffin! Halloween is my favorite holiday, and I refuse to limit my celebration of it to just October. So I keep little, subtle holiday decorations up year-round. I got this one from a local artist at an art fair last year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zVAYK9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s lovely. Okay, just two more questions. First: is your desk always this neat? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndGP5F"&gt;Ha! Yes! I like to call myself an accidental minimalist. I unintentionally own relatively few things, so it’s easy for me to stay tidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbkLsR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second: is there anything you’d like to change or add to the current setup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJtSlM"&gt;I’ve actually been thinking about that a lot recently. I think I’d like to add some LED strip lights to my desk in some way so I can light up the rest of my living room with a pretty color. I’d also like to find a cable box to hide my mess of cords that are currently tucked in the corner behind me. I’ve never been one for cable management until I put my desk out in the open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huPnmQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 8th, 2021, 11AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on September 9th, 2020.

    <title>This $300 Meowth turns a meme into a five-foot-tall plushie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SB9TJPBgxmldZvI1n5Ggd78xLwo=/0x342:1500x1342/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787975/P6480_701_06559_06.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lvQsEQ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/701-06559/gigantamax-meowth-poke-plush-65-in"&gt;Pokémon Center&lt;/a&gt; is selling a Gigantamax Meowth that, while not true to size, is still pretty damn big. This Long Meowth measures 65 inches, which is just over five feet, and has a “dangerous smile.” A bad boy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jJt9j"&gt;Gigantamax Meowth is a 1:20 scale version of its &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Sword&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shield &lt;/em&gt;counterpart, and it costs $299.99 for the pleasure of its company. Now the bad news: it’s currently sold out. Will it restock? I have no idea, but kudos to the unknown number of people who dropped $300 for a 5-foot-something body pillow. If this isn’t love, I don’t know what is:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pcU29eTHYf5FbTF-qFbV3wH_J14=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22289982/P6480_701_06559_05.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cQQeo0"&gt;I’m not thrilled that there is no light in Meowth’s eyes, but who can blame him. At least it’s better than &lt;a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/yeah-this-is-the-week-for-a-centipikachu-plush-1845990716"&gt;Pikachu centipede&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Section 230 turns 25 today, and it’s never been more important</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GiO1ERgV20OQzhAj_L2az-7MMKE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787967/VRG_ILLO_4341_American_Ethernet.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The real questions behind Section 230 reform&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="EtZZM2"&gt;On February 8th, 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Communications Decency Act, a sweeping regulatory framework for the internet. Almost all of the CDA was found unconstitutional, but what remained allowed the nascent web to flourish. It’s called Section 230 — and for the past quarter-century, it’s shaped the internet for better and worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bdbk2G"&gt;Section 230 protects any owner or user of an “interactive computer service” — typically an app or website — from liability for content that someone else posted. Over the past few years, it’s drawn the ire of conservative politicians who want to punish “Big Tech” for banning users, but also lawmakers and activists who say it lets web services knowingly allow harassment, nonconsensual sexual imagery, and other illegal material. Congress has introduced several major reform proposals, and at least one will likely advance in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGnDyV"&gt;The debate over Section 230, though, is a lot more complicated than one law or a few giant social networks. In the coming weeks, &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/thevergelive/thevergearticle"&gt;we’ll be hosting a live event&lt;/a&gt; with some of the people that Congress’ fight over Big Tech has left out — trying to reset the conversation to be less about Facebook and YouTube and more about the internet at large. But for now, on the 25th anniversary of Section 230 becoming law, I want to look at a few of the big questions that any proposal will have to grapple with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="d2TT7z"&gt;Section 230 versus the First Amendment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NwLtAA"&gt;One of the pithiest tech policy commentaries is a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/pageoneplus/corrections-august-7-2019.html"&gt;2019 correction in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. On August 6th, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/technology/section-230-hate-speech.html"&gt;published a long article&lt;/a&gt; about “why hate speech on the internet is a never-ending problem,” &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190806/20524742733/ny-times-joins-lots-other-media-sites-totally-completely-misrepresenting-section-230.shtml"&gt;explaining in a subheader&lt;/a&gt; that it was “because [Section 230] protects it.” The next day, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; soberly noted that hate speech is actually shielded by a different law: the First Amendment. It’s a fact that gets &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201030/09165945621/your-problem-is-not-with-section-230-1st-amendment.shtml"&gt;frequently, bizarrely glossed over&lt;/a&gt; in Section 230 debates — but is unavoidable in any debate about dangerous content online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84oz55"&gt;Section 230 shields sites from liability for illegal content, but a lot of bad speech simply &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; illegal under current laws. It’s legal to claim COVID-19 is a hoax or the election was stolen, unless that claim involves something like selling a scam cure or libeling a voting machine company. It’s legal to leave a racist Facebook comment or wish cancer on somebody in an email, unless you’ve been persistently harassing them. And it’s legal to ban users from a website for doing any of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lOP7OQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lots of online abuse is harmful but still legal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tXurlo"&gt;This doesn’t make online abuse or disinformation less potentially harmful, especially when it’s happening at a huge scale. But courts have interpreted the First Amendment as a broad shield against the government banning or punishing speech. Section 230 can’t overrule those protections to make companies remove offensive but legal content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40Yw72"&gt;Some critics explicitly acknowledge this fact. That includes legal scholar Mary Anne Franks, who has called for a &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90365443/mary-anne-franks-cult-constitution-free-speech"&gt;narrower interpretation of the First Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Tim Wu, who has argued that current speech law doesn’t account for &lt;a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/tim-wu-first-amendment-obsolete"&gt;how modern censorship works online&lt;/a&gt;. Many politicians haven’t, though — including President Joe Biden, who wants to repeal Section 230 to stop Facebook disinformation, or his deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed, who &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/why-section-230-hurts-kids"&gt;appears to think&lt;/a&gt; repeal will make YouTube axe &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/culture/2017/11/21/16685874/kids-youtube-video-elsagate-creepiness-psychology"&gt;creepy &lt;em&gt;Peppa Pig&lt;/em&gt; parodies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4Yqsb"&gt;Changing Section 230 would affect (for better or worse) how sites handle potential libel, child sexual abuse material, or &lt;a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2020/01/armslist-unlicensed-gun-sales-engaged-in-the-business/"&gt;illegal gun sales&lt;/a&gt;. But for hateful content, disinformation, and tough-to-define offenses like inciting violence, the question isn’t when people can sue Facebook. It’s whether the American conception of free speech itself needs to change. And that’s a much riskier, more complicated proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7Zx7BX"&gt;Big Tech versus Dark Corners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="w1cm1s"&gt;To repurpose a couple of massively overused buzzwords, bad content online is concentrated in a couple of places: “Big Tech” and “the dark corners of the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K59qUM"&gt;Big web services — particularly giants like Facebook and YouTube, but also midsized platforms like Grindr and Tripadvisor — have a specific set of problems. While most of their content is innocuous, they’re too big to moderate perfectly, granting a megaphone to a fraction of abusive, dangerous users. They’re often highly automated and include recommendation and sorting features that shape what people see online, sometimes in unpredictably negative ways. And being banned from the biggest networks can seriously impact your ability to connect with friends, family members, and businesses. At worst, the platforms are confusingly moderated and unresponsive to complaints about harassment or illegal material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZfH7om"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Indifference and hostility are different problems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CLqXNo"&gt;Small, toxic sites pose different issues. These might be neo-Nazi forums that encourage racist abuse, niche communities that solicit nonconsensual pornography, or blogs devoted to abusive and libelous rumors. They’re openly hostile to content moderation and host small but devotedly vicious communities. Most people will never visit these sites, but their actions bleed across the web through defamatory search results, organized harassment campaigns, or the swapping of “revenge porn” and child sexual abuse material. Sometimes Big Tech and the Dark Corners collide — as with the violent conspiracy movement QAnon, which launched on 4chan but gained mainstream reach through Facebook. (Again, as discussed above, not all this content is illegal.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SV5jo8"&gt;Lawmakers have framed Section 230 as almost exclusively a “Big Tech” issue so far, introducing bills clearly aimed at fixing specific problems with Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. Section 230 supporters have validly argued that this could hurt smaller, well-meaning businesses. But this framing is also bad for people who support &lt;em&gt;changing&lt;/em&gt; the law because it ignores an important piece of the online ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dmqxmw"&gt;“Lock it up” versus “burn it down”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oZxKUu"&gt;If Congress successfully changes Section 230 so websites are held liable for harmful content posted by users, there are two very broad possible outcomes for the internet. In one case, our current online giants get more power and tighter restrictions; in the other, Silicon Valley’s basic business model no longer works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBjZYN"&gt;The first is a world even more dominated by a few big, familiar sites and apps. Amazon, Facebook, and Google will have the resources to hire giant moderation teams and run complicated automated takedown systems or to fight lawsuits over their content. If Facebook or another company comes up with a functional system, it could offer it as a service to smaller sites — which could either adopt that (likely strict) framework or simply shut down their forums and comment sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QOW2Mi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lots of people like social media&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WJ5Inn"&gt;That’s a double-edged sword. Twitter might be more likely to act on borderline threats or harassment, for instance, but movements like #MeToo would be nearly impossible if abusers could silence accusations with a simple complaint form. (Pirated content gets limited Section 230 protections already, and the result has been an unwieldy and exploitable automated takedown system.) Sites that thrive on unverified gossip could be shut down, but so could legitimate venues for consumer complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYFvqg"&gt;Despite plenty of often deserved criticism, people still have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21144680/verge-tech-survey-2020-trust-privacy-security-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;overwhelmingly favorable opinions&lt;/a&gt; of major social media companies. And a more buttoned-up online landscape would almost certainly mean a lot more content getting taken down by accident — almost inevitably including a lot of silly but joyful stuff like &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2021/1/19/22233525/sea-shanty-tiktok-wellerman-song"&gt;sea shanties&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166215/ratatouille-the-tiktok-musical-broadway-show-todaytix-streaming-one-night-date-viral-disney"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; musical&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juB1Au"&gt;In the end, though, it would look roughly like the internet we know today. But there’s a second, much weirder option, even if Silicon Valley’s lobbying power makes it unlikely. Legal scholar Jeff Kosseff has called Section 230 “the 26 words that created the internet,” and it’s an apt description. Section 230 created a web where sites (both commercial &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;nonprofit) can rapidly scale based on user-generated content, drawing millions or billions of users, then fleshing out a moderation policy and enforcement team as they grow. If mega-services are deemed essentially “unsafe at any speed,” that changes some basic assumptions about how you launch and grow a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="B4r83f"&gt;Whether you think that’s good or bad, it’s the kind of stakes that changing Section 230 deals in — and Congress needs to spend more time talking about what that means.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="gAic9I"&gt;Microsoft is bringing &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4&lt;/em&gt; to Steam on March 9th. It marks the first time the &lt;em&gt;Forza&lt;/em&gt; franchise has been available on Steam, and it will include crossplay with players on Xbox consoles, the regular Windows 10 version, and those streaming &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4 &lt;/em&gt;through xCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gaj0bA"&gt;Playground Games has been gradually improving &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4 &lt;/em&gt;with expansions and a battle royale-like mode. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17763904/forza-horizon-4-halo-experience-warthog-cortana-master-chief"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; driving experience&lt;/a&gt; even appeared in the game a few years ago, and the &lt;em&gt;Lego Speed Champions&lt;/em&gt; expansion includes brick cars and scenery. A new Hot Wheels car pack is also coming soon, which will include a number of new cars for $10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VW760s"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;em&gt;Forza &lt;/em&gt;embrace of Steam comes after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645250/microsoft-xbox-game-studios-publishing-valve-steam-32-bit-windows"&gt;reversed course nearly three years ago&lt;/a&gt;, promising to distribute more Xbox titles through Steam. &lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18261723/halo-the-master-chief-collection-pc-release-steam-halo-reach"&gt;arrived on Steam&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, followed by &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21266626/sea-of-thieves-steam-release-date-pc-microsoft"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, all three titles are now regularly found in the &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=topsellers"&gt;top sellers list on Steam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s former hardware leader reportedly now overseeing AR and VR devices</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5zoIYV"&gt;Apple’s former hardware leader, Dan Riccio, is now overseeing the company’s still-secretive work on augmented and virtual reality products, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/apple-s-riccio-shifts-from-hardware-chief-to-ar-vr-headsets"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Riccio &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249393/apple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new"&gt;stepped back from Apple last month&lt;/a&gt;, after serving as senior vice president of hardware engineering since 2012. At the time, Riccio said he would remain at the company with a focus on “creating something new,” but he didn’t say what that would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DSeCo"&gt;Mike Rockwell, who &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-19/apple-team-working-on-vr-and-ar-headset-and-ar-glasses"&gt;runs Apple’s AR / VR group&lt;/a&gt;, is still responsible for day-to-day development of these upcoming products, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. But Riccio reportedly has “ultimate oversight” of Apple’s first hardware to enter the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5n4AV"&gt;There have been reports for years indicating that Apple is working on AR and VR hardware. That’s been buoyed by Apple’s continued investments in AR on its iPhones and iPads, plus some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/10/14581428/apple-tim-cook-ar-vr-product-reveal-interview"&gt;coy remarks&lt;/a&gt; from CEO Tim Cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e22N1o"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;latest reports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242131/apple-vr-headset-2022-fabric-design-fan-price-details-rumors"&gt;suggest that&lt;/a&gt; Apple plans to first debut an expensive virtual reality headset as a stepping stone on the path toward a more impressive augmented reality device. &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt; that the VR device could sell for $3,000 and launch in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
