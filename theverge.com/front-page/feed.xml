    <title>Instagram and Twitter finally make link previews work again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jGS4qXJxgqjPAEBjUJsh8MgpQFA=/186x0:2196x1340/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70087067/FDSQYWzVgAA0cEV.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Instagram link preview on Twitter.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nADVI2"&gt;The ice is thawing on a nine-year internet feud. When you share Instagram links on Twitter, you’ll see a preview of the link that includes an image instead of just the URL text starting on Wednesday. The feature is rolling out on Android, iOS, and the web. I didn’t see a preview when I tried sharing an Instagram post on my Twitter feed, so it might not work for you just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmwhoZ"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1455947657067782148"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1455952061665841157"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; are promoting the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JElmOu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They said it would never happen… Twitter Card previews start rolling out TODAY.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, when you share an Instagram link on Twitter a preview of that post will appear.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/XSZRx9dzd1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XSZRx9dzd1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Instagram (@instagram) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1455947657067782148?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="posCzT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you want to share your latest Instagram post on the Twitter timeline too, you’re in luck: now when you share a link to an IG post in a Tweet, it’ll show up as a card with a preview of the photo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rolling out on Android, iOS, and web.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1455952061665841157?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8u6Ikb"&gt;Instagram turned off the ability to see previews of posts on Twitter after it was acquired by Meta (formerly Facebook) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/9/2936375/facebook-buys-instagram"&gt;in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. Kevin Systrom, Instagram’s founder and former CEO, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/05/kevin-systrom-on-pulling-twitter-cards-integration-we-want-images-viewed-on-instagram-com/"&gt;said that the decision was his&lt;/a&gt;, not Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s. Instagram wasn’t the only party that made changes limiting Instagram and Twitter’s integration, though; Twitter removed a feature that let you find people you follow on Instagram, on Twitter, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/26/no-api-for-you-twitter-shuts-off-find-friends-feature-for-instagram/"&gt;a few months after&lt;/a&gt; the acquisition was announced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook skirts Apple’s App Store fees with custom subscription links for creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QzAtrnUON_Qk07K-Zz7IZQcIz0c=/0x150:900x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70087032/250777847_389387596230472_4377046633797999619_n.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IuaHwK"&gt;Facebook has found a way to skirt Apple’s 30 percent tax on in-app transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjdpM6"&gt;On Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook parent company Meta, announced that creators will &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/earn-money-with-subscriptions"&gt;soon be able to share custom web links&lt;/a&gt; directing their fans to pay them for subscriptions using Facebook’s native payments system. If a fan signs up through the link rather than Apple’s in-app subscription, the creator will keep all of the money minus taxes. Facebook subscription feature, which lets creators charge on a reoccurring basis for access to exclusive content, is available in 27 countries and accessible to creators who meet certain eligibility requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djqG5H"&gt;Facebook is operating in a gray zone under Apple’s rules for the App Store, though a spokesperson said the social network believes its approach has always been allowed on iOS. The App Store currently forbids iOS apps from offering alternative payment options for purchasing digital goods, but in this case, it’s the creator, not Facebook, the app developer, that will be sending people to pay for a subscription on the web. The spokesperson for Facebook confirmed the social network isn’t removing the ability for users to sign up for a creator subscription using Apple’s native payments system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TV8qp4"&gt;“As we build for the metaverse, we’re focused on unlocking opportunities for creators to make money from their work,” Zuckerberg said &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/4/posts/10114044739955341/?d=n"&gt;in a Facebook post&lt;/a&gt;. “The 30 percent fees that Apple takes on transactions make it harder to do that, so we’re updating our Subscriptions product so now creators can earn more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="c62oKO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook will start paying creators a bonus of between $5 and $20 for every new subscriber they add using their custom web link&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oCz6Pb"&gt;In addition to not collecting a cut of subscription transactions until at least 2023, Facebook will start paying creators a bonus of between $5 and $20 for every new subscriber they add using their custom web link. An earnings calculator will show creators on Facebook a breakdown of their earnings and fees, including how much they pay to Apple and Google. And starting in December, Facebook creators will be able to download the emails of their subscribers directly from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFJfMk"&gt;Facebook is taking advantage of cracks that are starting to show in Apple’s grip on iOS app payments. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;recently settled a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; with developers by agreeing to let them directly email customers about alternative payment options and is facing even more restrictions after its high-profile lawsuit with Epic Games. At the close of that case, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;judge ordered&lt;/a&gt; Apple to allow developers to link to outside payment methods, giving the company until December 9th to comply. Apple has asked for a stay while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22717271/apple-appeals-epic-games-ruling-anti-steering"&gt;the ruling is appealed&lt;/a&gt;, but the judge has yet to rule on the stay.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create a signature for PDF documents on a PC </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Surface Laptop Go on a table angled slightly to the left." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UZ9mdUxw-DkKVmIqP29-0LLQBPA=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948215/twarren-surfacelaptopgo-7.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ALZBsW"&gt;These days, more and more official papers are being turned into PDF documents. (PDF stands for Portable Document Format; it is a standard created by Adobe in the early 1990s that allows paper documents to be turned into exact digital copies.) In fact, hard copy paperwork is fast becoming the exception rather than the rule. However, even digital documents have to be signed. You can do it the long way — print those documents out, sign them, and then scan them back into your computer — or you can create a digital signature and place it directly on the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isjki5"&gt;Windows doesn’t offer a built-in PDF signing feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321383/signature-pdf-mac-pdf-how-to-preview"&gt;the way a Mac does&lt;/a&gt;. However, you can use Windows’ built-in browser, Microsoft Edge, to sign a PDF document. There are also third-party apps you can download that will give you the same ability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7Ufzw"&gt;In this article, I’ll first go over how to use Edge to add a signature, and then I’ll do the same using Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, which is Adobe’s free PDF reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="48UahT"&gt;Use Microsoft Edge to create a signature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XaiP5q"&gt;Find your PDF file in the file manager. Right-click on the file and open it using Microsoft Edge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SWoqip"&gt;The file will open in Edge’s PDF reader. Click on the Draw icon (it looks like a pencil facing downward).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QRckNJ"&gt;If you’ve got a touch screen, it will automatically enable the Draw with Touch option (the icon looks like a hand)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QSXp8u"&gt;Use your cursor (or, if you’ve got a touch screen, your finger) to sign the PDF, and then save the document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can sign a PDF in Edge, but you can’t save your signature." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CliD63oM5Q0McFJa_BSdzTsDbV0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982850/Screenshot__133_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can sign a PDF in Edge, but you can’t save your signature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TrnRXm"&gt;While this is a good, quick way to sign a PDF document, it means you have to go through the same process every time. It would be a lot simpler if you could simply pop your signature into the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pecqMl"&gt;One way to do this is to write a signature, photograph it, and download it as a PDF or graphic file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HKFLZW"&gt;Use Adobe Acrobat Reader DC to create a signature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SgeMF3"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fget.adobe.com%2Freader%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22323097%2Fpdf-signature-windows-pc-adobe-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Download Adobe Acrobat Reader DC&lt;/a&gt;. Adobe has the unfortunate tendency to encourage people to download excess apps, so make sure you uncheck all the additional installations that may pop up on the page: in my case, it was two McAfee apps and Acrobat’s Chrome extension. (You can install this last one later if you think it might be useful.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fyH4Ve"&gt;After you click on “Download Adobe Reader,” you can start the install by clicking on the downloaded .EXE file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s a good idea to uncheck Adobe’s promotional offers before downloading Acrobat Reader" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/niGsIsy1D5YvmE7KouzVOkm-ru0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360298/adobe1___Copy.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a good idea to uncheck Adobe’s promotional offers before downloading Acrobat Reader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="BW88IR"&gt;Once it’s installed, Acrobat Reader will open. Look for “Fill &amp;amp; Sign” in the main window. Click on that and then on “Select a File” to choose a PDF file to work on. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on “Fill &amp;amp;amp; Sign” and then on “Select a File” to choose a PDF file to work on. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/854NWSY_k8elQZvVSYH6tDAZa9Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982492/Screenshot__121_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on “Fill &amp;amp; Sign” and then on “Select a File” to choose a PDF file to work on. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="71mubA"&gt;Alternatively, you can open the file first (by going to “File” &amp;gt; “Open”) and then scroll down to “Fill &amp;amp; Sign” in the app’s right-hand column. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HoZ2ay"&gt;A new window will invite you to “Fill and sign forms or get them signed from others.” Click on the “Select a File” button and choose your document from the file manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A new window will invite you to “Fill and sign forms or get them signed from others.” " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/67nslT3k5p_v7drOHUSh2qc4jI8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982500/Screenshot__122_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new window will invite you to “Fill and sign forms or get them signed from others.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="r5zYEz"&gt;Before your documents come up in Acrobat, you will probably get a pop-up that invites you to “Get documents signed fast with Adobe Sign,” which lets you send out up to two documents for signatures every 30 days for free; if this is something you want to do more often, it will cost you $120 annually for the “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fsign%2Fpricing%2Fplans.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22323097%2Fpdf-signature-windows-pc-adobe-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Acrobat PDF Pack with e-sign&lt;/a&gt;.” For now, you can remove the pop-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R3cvjj"&gt;Your document will come up in Acrobat. There should be a small “Ab” next to your cursor; if not, check to make sure the “Fill &amp;amp; Sign” icon on the right is highlighted. This will let you sign by typing your name into your form. If you want to sign by actually drawing your signature or save a typed or drawn signature, tap on “Sign yourself” in the icon above the main screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Add Signature.” Once you’ve saved your signature, it will appear on this drop-down menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lImQxdduh6w81mRdMHEHpwnt25I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982506/Screenshot__126_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Add Signature.” Once you’ve saved your signature, it will appear on this drop-down menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JdYWBB"&gt;You will have the option to “Add Signature” or “Add Initials.” For now, click on “Add Signature.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EdgQjv"&gt;A pop-up window will give you three ways to sign your document: type your name (Adobe supplies you with several handwritten-looking fonts), draw your signature (either using your touchpad or directly on a touchscreen), or upload an image of your signature. Make sure “Save signature” is checked if you don’t want to have to write it again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are several ways you can create a signature" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HGmXg75kGQyZue77CYS5TfEVabI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360374/adobe7.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are several ways you can create a signature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ImiYmj"&gt;Once you’ve hit “Apply,” your PDF document will be back. Place your new signature where you want it on the document and left-click. You can then change the size or placement of the signature if you wish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Now place your signature where you want it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lAy1LTw9E94MjePMZFsXxhfX6wI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982513/Screenshot__129_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now place your signature where you want it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ldRjRL"&gt;And you’re done! Now, if you want to add your signature to a PDF, just open your document using Adobe Acrobat Reader and click on the “Sign yourself” icon. You can then select your saved signature and place it where you need it on your PDF document. (The “Add Initials” option works just the same but gives you less space, so you can only add initials.) If you want to change your signature, just click the “minus” sign next to the signature and try again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your signature is now available whenever you need it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F8nuPxlBO8ti2jgE7a3pCbIoOH0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982516/Screenshot__131_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your signature is now available whenever you need it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ojzgTu"&gt;Adobe Acrobat Reader DC is, of course, not the only app that you can use to read and / or edit a PDF document. There are a variety of other apps out there with free versions that will let you do basic PDF work, such as &lt;a href="https://app.hellosign.com/info/pricing?_ga=2.98293343.1191478015.1615406363-173908718.1615236989"&gt;HelloSign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://smallpdf.com/sign-pdf"&gt;eSign&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.signwell.com/"&gt;SignWell&lt;/a&gt;. However, most of those free versions come with limitations — for example, SignWell lets you sign up to three documents a month, while eSign lets you process up to two documents per day. Adobe Reader doesn’t have any limitations on your ability to sign documents, but if you want to create a PDF or export it to another format, you’ll have to get the Pro version.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adidas reveals a new, Xbox 360-inspired sneaker that you can actually buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XzW7FQnCK2uq170LbqOTZGVSRpA=/8x0:6008x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70086840/The_Xbox_360_Forum_Mid_01_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5lSXxn"&gt;Microsoft is continuing to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Xbox in style this year with a second themed Adidas sneaker: &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/11/03/xbox-360-adidas-sneaker/?ocid=Evergreen_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Video_lrn_11.3.1"&gt;the Xbox 360 Forum Mid&lt;/a&gt;, which, as the name suggests, is inspired by the company’s second console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9peG1"&gt;The Xbox 360 design follows the first Xbox / Adidas collaboration, announced in October which took inspiration from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712418/adidas-xbox-sneakers-trainers-microsoft"&gt;original Xbox console&lt;/a&gt;. The Xbox 360 Forum Mid, however, is decked out in the 360’s white, silver, and green color scheme for a 2005-era look, complete with plenty of subtle details that reference the original design. The velcro strap, for instance, is emblazoned with the disc tray from the 360, while the air vents and Xbox button are featured on the outside. Even the heel is designed to look like the memory card and hard drive slots. The shoe will come with red, yellow, green, and blue laces, to represent the A, B, X, and Y buttons on the 360 controller, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UYUaItipYO5ePnjGaqAEl3frSuo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982984/The_Xbox_360_Forum_Mid_03_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dWt7uZ"&gt;Microsoft and Adidas are also teasing that a third model — inspired by the Xbox Series X — will be announced on November 15th at its celebratory stream for the 20th anniversary of Xbox and &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; to close out the sneaker trilogy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqxk2v"&gt;And unlike the original Xbox collaboration (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22735619/xbox-adidas-sneaker-stockx-20th-anniversary"&gt;which was a limited edition for giveaways&lt;/a&gt;), the Xbox 360 Forum Mid will actually be available to purchase. The sneaker is set to be available in the US and Canada on November 4th at 7AM PT / 10AM ET on Adidas’ website, although there’s no word on price yet. That said, if demand is anything like it is for the next-gen Xbox Series X, Series S, and even the Xbox mini-fridge, you’ll probably need a healthy dose of luck to snag a pair. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A one-ton tungsten cube was just bought by a crypto cabal for $250,000</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3zFh5b52HyzlbAhcICpTOpIAK3o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70086774/acastro_211103_1777_tugnstenCube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hhKaTE"&gt;What’s 14.545 inches across, weighs one ton (around 907kg or 2,000lbs), and just sold to a group of anonymous crypto investors for roughly $250,000? Why, it’s the biggest tungsten cube ever to be manufactured by Midwest Tungsten Service of Willowbrook, Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JT9TAV"&gt;Confused? Yes, that’s understandable. But consider this: tungsten cubes are one of the most popular memes in the world of cryptocurrency right now, a realm where value is defined as much by attention as anything tangible. (Call it the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744728/money-fandom-cryptocurrency-retail-trades-stocks"&gt;stonk market&lt;/a&gt; if you like.) Tungsten, if you’re not familiar, is a metal 1.7 times as dense as lead, and since 2015, &lt;a href="http://6https://twitter.com/tweetsauce/status/726125711220563968"&gt;nerdy types&lt;/a&gt; have been able to buy small cubes of tungsten manufactured by outfits like the Midwest Tungsten Service. Owning one has been a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/eyqwn9/tungsten_cube_amazon_review/"&gt;joke on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; for years, but in recent months, the cubes have become &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tungsten-cubes-bitcoin-gamestop-crypto-investors-11635431036"&gt;fashionable among crypto aficionados&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="16MmHv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some say the density of tungsten contrasts with the immateriality of crypto&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I9mwfB"&gt;Why exactly this happened isn’t all that important. Some claim that the density of the cubes makes for a pleasing contrast with the immaterial nature of cryptocurrency and NFTs. Others say that the experience of holding these objects is its own reward. (I can vouch for that myself. I once had the pleasure of holding a kilogram made of an iridium alloy, which is denser than tungsten, and it was a genuinely cool experience.) The simplest and most convincing answer, though, is that buying tungsten cubes is just a good, solid meme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzEQBl"&gt;The recent interest in tungsten cubes led the folks at Midwest Tungsten Service to ask themselves an important question: what’s the biggest tungsten cube they can build? From this query, their 14.545-inch cube was born, with access to the cube sold via an NFT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEsiag"&gt;As the company explained in a &lt;a href="https://midwesttungsten.com/blog/midwest-tungsten-service-cube-nft/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the project last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4lDOon"&gt;We will make the 14.545” cube, it will weight approximately 2,000 pounds. This NFT represents a real-world physical cube that will be stored at Midwest Tungsten Service headquarters and owned by the NFT owner. One visit to see/photograph/touch the cube per calendar year will be allowed and scheduled with a Midwest Tungsten Service representative. Unlockable content required for scheduling and proof of ownership required for entry. The cube will be stored in a room of its own that will be locked and only accessible by the NFT owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6FASF"&gt;Subsequent owners of the NFT cannot visit the cube in a year in which the cube has already been visited. The cube will not be available to view until 12 weeks after the first sale. Burning the NFT will result in shipment to the most recent owner via freight truck, owner will be responsible for alerting Midwest Tungsten Service of the intention to burn and transport after freight drop-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="L5hWED"&gt;Now that NFT has sold to a group calling themselves TungstenDAO, with the sale — which you can &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/36033305814565393839012117540795495898903988734891995320738861183142759235585/"&gt;see here on OpenSea&lt;/a&gt; and which we &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7dgnm/crypto-investors-spend-dollar250k-to-touch-2000-lb-tungsten-cube-once-a-year"&gt;spotted via &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — going through on Monday for 56.9 ETH or roughly $250,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3b18oa"&gt;Exactly what TungstenDAO plans to do with their purchase isn’t clear (we’ve reached out to the group for comment and will update this story if we hear back). But, fittingly, it seems they bought the NFT simply to bring more attention to the group itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wghqti"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The cube’s buyers call themselves an “experimental meme incubation studio”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="raozBQ"&gt;If you’re not aware, a “DAO” or “decentralized autonomous organization” is a type of co-operative organization whose rules are supposedly enshrined in the blockchain. DAOs are typically investment vehicles of one sort or another, and for TungstenDAO, their preferred asset is memes. The group describes itself as an “experimental meme incubation studio” and &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/@TungstenDAO/~/104253"&gt;says its aim&lt;/a&gt; is to “amass a collection of assets that are highly memeable, then create content that reinforces their social significance and strengthens memetic desires for these assets.” Really, it’s a logical evolution for the world of cryptocurrency and NFTs. If attention assigns value and memes drive attention, then why not cut out the middleman and buy memes? In this case (and just to reinforce this point), that meme is a 14-inch tungsten cube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMeBjq"&gt;Will the cube hold onto its value? Will TungstenDAO become the first trillion-dollar meme studio? Honestly, who knows. But some whispers in the crypto world suggest cubes may have already had their day, and the hot new property is the tungsten &lt;em&gt;sphere&lt;/em&gt;. Still confused? Just roll with it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nokia G50 review: affordable but awfully average</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Why suffer for a $300 budget 5G phone?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="AaZTJg"&gt;Finding a good budget 5G phone seems as elusive as finding a unicorn these days. Not only do manufacturers have to keep the price as low as possible, but the device also has to pull off some advanced 5G-compatible technologies. No wonder phone makers tend to compromise on other components, and the overall experience takes a hit as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IiJZLo"&gt;This is where I find the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687760/nokia-g50-phone-battery-android-upgrades"&gt;Nokia G50&lt;/a&gt;, the $300 phone that Nokia pitches as an affordable 5G-phone alternative. While the Nokia G50 is a solidly built phone with a minimalist, no-nonsense Scandinavian aesthetic, it has many flaws that I haven’t experienced in a modern smartphone in a long time. Its entry-level 5G processor lags, its low-resolution touchscreen requires more effort to use than others, and I even had some connection issues with my 4G T-Mobile service on this phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hVCPW"&gt;These are significant trade-offs for a device that is not the only $300 5G phone in town, assuming you need 5G connectivity at all. There is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; that is a T-Mobile exclusive, the newer and cheaper &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;$239.99 OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;$279 Samsung Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt;. It’s hard to see how the Nokia G50 could possibly stand out from this increasingly crowded, budget 5G space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fTlwZX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10843493"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="G4pAdw"&gt;Heavy. That’s the first word that comes to mind when holding this 6.84 x 3.06 x 0.35-inch phone that weighs 7.76oz (220g), which is heavier and taller than the Pixel 6 Pro (7.4 oz; 210g). While I appreciate that its stainless steel-framed body is a rarity in smartphones these days (other than the much more expensive Pro-model iPhones), this phone is too heavy to hold with just one hand for long. Its sharp edges dig into my palms due to its heft and make me eager to put the device down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R37XDV"&gt;As classy as that Ocean Blue matte ombre looks, the G50’s smooth polycarbonate coating is a sucker for finger smudges and makes the phone way too slippery to use without a case. I can’t tell you how many times the phone has slipped off a table or countertop, thanks to a combination of its slippery back and the vibrate mode. My review unit only survived the falls because it’s built like an indestructible tank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c6ATy29iSPGiUEvElKGocVnKQ2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940472/akrales_211015_4805_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On its right side, the Nokia G50 has a handy fingerprint sensor embedded into its power button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tpVyMH"&gt;Its durability is definitely a plus since Nokia (and parent company HMD) expects you to keep this Android 11-running phone for longer and is committed to providing two years of OS updates and three years of security updates. This is not as impressive as it sounds: the $279 Samsung Galaxy A32 5G provides four years of security updates, which is the longest out of this class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TtDBy"&gt;Like other Nokia Android phones, the G50 has a non-customizable Google Assistant button and a combination SIM and microSDXC tray on its left side, a volume rocker, as well as a power button embedded with a fingerprint sensor on the right. It has a 3.5mm audio jack on top for your wired headphones or mic, as well as a USB-C port and a mono speaker at the bottom. Because the speaker is located on the bottom right corner, it’s easy for your hand to cover the sound. When listening to the &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; theme song from the HBO series, the opening percussion track sounds more muffled and buzzy on the Nokia, whereas each beat sounds clear and distinct on the OnePlus 9 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="EdLwsX"&gt;One of the ways Nokia cut corners with the G50 is by using a 720p low-resolution display.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W6i4pg2LMUX2M-BzIsf-IFPoZiw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940475/akrales_211015_4805_0051.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G50 comes with a pre-applied screen protector, which you can feel around the edge of the display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MYVXcF"&gt;The G50’s 6.82-inch, 720 x 1560 LCD display is simply too big for so few pixels to produce sharp, high-resolution content. Although its IPS LCD panel does offer good viewing angles with vibrant colors, it doesn’t make up for its low-resolution or 252ppi pixel density. It’s a fine screen for reading emails and social media posts, but there is a noticeable difference when looking at multimedia content. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gAOcTfVX5IHtCBRNm73e2-VGr8M=/0x0:2040x1360/1075x1075/filters:focal(857x517:1183x843):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073384/Verge10yearEditorsnote_homepage_2.0.jpg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; 10th Anniversary image with the stacked motherboards&lt;/a&gt;, for example, looks pixelated and has blurred edges at maximum zoom on the Nokia phone, but lines still look sharp on the OnePlus 9 Pro, even when completely zoomed in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3NiUi"&gt;Not only does the G50 have a low-resolution screen, but it’s also not as touch-sensitive as other modern phones, where you only need to lightly brush the display to navigate the interface. When I was playing &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Unite&lt;/em&gt;, for example, I had to exert more force with each of my swipes to move my character along the battlefield. It’s not a deal-breaker, but it makes this phone a little less enjoyable to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxZqd0"&gt;The G50 comes pre-installed with a screen protector, which explains the weird horizontal streaks that run across the screen when the phone is off, as well as the slightly raised edge around the display. The screen protector looks invisible when the phone is on, but if you’re looking at a video with a significant black frame around it, random sightings of this layer can be distracting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dmRuqRm8RX12tnBgeoQBkahDR1M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940476/akrales_211015_4805_0062.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G50 has a stainless steel framed body and a polycarbonate coating in a matte, ombre finish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="69kQoI"&gt;The Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G processor may be responsible for making the Nokia G50 one of the few $300 5G phones around, but it might just be too underpowered for its ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhgUC5"&gt;Despite the fact the processor is supported with 4GB RAM and 128 GB of internal storage, the G50 sometimes struggles with very basic tasks. It can take an extra second longer to open a link or an app, or a web page would crash, and I’d have to reload it. The G50 also seems to have trouble multitasking when using a resource-intensive app like &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Unite&lt;/em&gt;. After I downloaded the game, I could not even open it until every single app I had running in the background was closed, and there were only three apps in the background. The game is playable on the G50, but the combination of its slower performance and less sensitive touchscreen can make it feel like you’re moving your character through molasses against faster opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JmyqV2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The $300 Nokia G50 is neither the cheapest nor the best budget 5G phone out there&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hAKozV"&gt;For a phone that is supposed to be future-proofed for 5G connectivity — at least on sub-6Hz 5G networks on T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T and not Verizon’s mmWave network — the Nokia G50 I was testing had some trouble connecting to 4G LTE cellular service. My T-Mobile SIM card worked fine until the one day I needed cellular access, and no amount of restarting the phone would fix it. After speaking with Nokia’s PR representative, I realized I was missing an important system update but had trouble installing it until it just installed itself on another day. My G50 has had no problem accessing my T-Mobile 4G service since then. It’s unclear whether my connection issue is a known problem with the hardware, or I just got unlucky with an update or just this particular unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="LpiaR1"&gt;One place Nokia did not skimp on is the 5,000mAh battery in the G50. It is a nice luxury to have a large capacity battery in your phone, even for a $300 device. To test its battery life, I used only Wi-Fi to actively post on Twitter and Hangouts, read online articles, take photos, and check my two email accounts. All in, I was able to get about 28 hours of active use out of the G50 over two days, which tracks with other phones with 5,000mAh batteries like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22717002/tcl-20s-and-20se-review-budget-affordable-unlocked-smartphone"&gt;TCL 20S&lt;/a&gt;. The included 18W charging brick is definitely not a fast charger, though, because it took almost three hours to recharge this gigantic battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-BlXYnsiKNbUO7Oa7sw5etS0DVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940473/akrales_211015_4805_0019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can tell this is a Nokia phone by its iconic circular array of three rear cameras on the back of the phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="4dY15x"&gt;You can tell this is a Nokia phone by its iconic circular array of three rear cameras on the back of the phone. This may be a budget phone, but Nokia did not compromise on photography — at least not on the main 48-megapixel wide camera. It also has a 5-megapixel ultrawide camera, 2-megapixel depth camera, as well as a front 8-megapixel wide camera embedded into the bezel of the display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNs4Za"&gt;The main camera, with its wide lens, f/1.8 aperture, and auto phase detection autofocus, can capture some detailed shots during the day, as well as on clear nights. You can still see the bubbles in my boiling-hot Korean stew and the distinct lamination layers in the pastry. I was particularly surprised by the night photo of colorful graffiti against the backdrop of an office tower. Using the 5-megapixel ultrawide camera, I was able to capture One World Trade and the Oculus in one shot, though, of course, the lights from the towers are all blown out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EF4zyf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10843175"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z20ECC"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample photos from the Nokia G50.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XtSog2"&gt;The biggest downside to the ultrawide camera is that its photos’ colors are not always accurate. For example, the pastries look significantly more yellow in the ultrawide photo compared to the photo of the mini cakes from the main camera. The photo with the two colorful doors is another example of how the ultrawide camera skews yellow in misleading ways. While the two doors look like they’re yellow and blue in the photo, in real life, the doors are actually orange and teal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlP9Jl"&gt;If you need to capture anything that’s far away on a dim day, I wouldn’t bother using the cameras on this phone with digital zoom. I took some waterfront photos on a cloudy evening, and all the photos were either blurry messes or way too saturated with yellow lighting.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MN6C-xtnxBIrxlkSMIVSn0TvRzU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940474/akrales_211015_4805_0039.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G50 is a $300 budget 5G phone that works on the sub-6GHz 5G network.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sK98bD"&gt;The $300 Nokia G50 is neither the cheapest nor the best budget 5G phone out there, and you may be better served by its competitors. For example, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;$239.99 OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; uses the same Snapdragon 480 5G processor as the G50 but has a 1080p display with 90Hz refresh rate for less money. Or, if you’re already a T-Mobile customer, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; might be the better choice, as it uses the faster Snapdragon 690 5G processor and has the same HD display as its sibling. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; is another popular choice at $279. It uses a faster MediaTek Dimensity 720 5G processor, has four years of security updates, and is compatible with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;newer 5G C-band&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJkgcM"&gt;Yet all these budget 5G phones suffer from the same problem: they all had to compromise in some way to make room for its more expensive 5G components. Since 5G isn’t ubiquitous yet and is hardly essential to our lives in 2021, I’m not sure it’s necessary to limit yourself to 5G phones when there is a world of 4G phones that already offers better value and user experience. For around $300, you can get a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Pixel 4a&lt;/a&gt; with a camera that will blow any budget 5G phone’s camera out of the water. Or you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22717002/tcl-20s-and-20se-review-budget-affordable-unlocked-smartphone"&gt;TCL 20S&lt;/a&gt; with premium looks and specs for just $250 and save some money toward your future 5G phone —  when the technology matures.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden admin’s bug fix mandate aims to prevent the next major cybersecurity attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZKUMZBWMs5AhvCyOjaF5w4vB2l0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70086595/acastro_170621_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7nBrFg"&gt;The Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2021/11/03/cisa-releases-directive-reducing-significant-risk-known-exploited-vulnerabilities"&gt;is requiring civilian federal agencies&lt;/a&gt; to fix hundreds of cybersecurity flaws, as reported earlier by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-to-order-federal-agencies-to-fix-hundreds-of-cyber-flaws-11635937200"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As the&lt;em&gt; WSJ&lt;/em&gt; states, the &lt;a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/22-01/"&gt;BOD 22-01&lt;/a&gt; directive from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) covers around 200 known threats that cybersecurity experts discovered between 2017 and 2020, as well as 90 more flaws that were found in 2021. Federal agencies have six months to patch older threats and just two weeks to fix the ones that were discovered within the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tn5jlp"&gt;The&lt;em&gt; WSJ&lt;/em&gt; report points out that federal agencies are usually left to their own devices when it comes to security, sometimes resulting in poor security management. The goal is to force federal agencies to fix all potential threats, whether they’re major or not, and establish a basic list for other private and public organizations to follow. While zero-day vulnerabilities that exploit previously unknown openings get major headlines, addressing “the subset of vulnerabilities that are causing harm now” can get ahead of many incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FbuEDV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Federal agencies have six months to patch older threats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wuIbDZ"&gt;Previously, &lt;a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/15-01/"&gt;a 2015 order&lt;/a&gt; gave federal agencies one month to fix threats deemed “critical risk.” This was changed &lt;a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/19-02/"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; to include threats categorized as “high risk,” as pointed out by the&lt;em&gt; WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. The new mandate distances itself from prioritizing specific threat levels and instead acknowledges that small holes can quickly cause larger problems if hackers can find a way to take advantage of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kIN9R"&gt;“The Directive lays out clear requirements for federal civilian agencies to take immediate action to improve their vulnerability management practices and dramatically reduce their exposure to cyber attacks,” says CISA director Jen Easterly. “While this Directive applies to federal civilian agencies, we know that organizations across the country, including critical infrastructure entities, are targeted using these same vulnerabilities. It is therefore critical that every organization adopt this Directive and prioritize mitigation of vulnerabilities listed in CISA’s public catalog.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfcIsV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog"&gt;CISA’s newly released list of known vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; notably includes the Microsoft Exchange Server flaw. In March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316189/microsoft-exchange-server-security-exploit-china-attack-30000-organizations"&gt;emails from over 30,000 US governmental and commercial organizations were hacked&lt;/a&gt; by a Chinese group, thanks to four known security holes that, had they been patched, would’ve prevented the attacks. CISA’s list requires patching the “Microsoft Exchange Remote Code Execution Vulnerability” and is calling on federal agencies to install available SolarWinds patches by May 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IoaZLx"&gt;The Solarwinds Orion Platform is also on the list, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/13/22173035/hackers-russia-breached-us-government-agencies-email-cozy-bear"&gt;was the victim of a major hack in late 2020 that compromised US government agencies&lt;/a&gt;. The CISA notes that the “SolarWinds Orion API is vulnerable to an authentication bypass that could allow a remote attacker to execute API commands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpLHTB"&gt;Cybersecurity has been a priority for President Biden since he entered office. In May, he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433266/biden-executive-order-cybersecurity-government-infrastructure-colonial-pipeline-solarwinds-hafnium"&gt;signed an executive order to help prevent future cybersecurity disasters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/12/fact-sheet-president-signs-executive-order-charting-new-course-to-improve-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-protect-federal-government-networks/"&gt;The order mandates&lt;/a&gt; two-factor authentication across the federal government, establishes a protocol for responding to cyberattacks, and forms a Cybersecurity Safety Review Board, among other safety measures.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s GitHub CEO steps down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MZuqgK9KD2eeg3qXPgeOrRSIDls=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70086575/microsoftgithub.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cat8ik"&gt;GitHub CEO Nat Friedman is stepping down after three years at the company. Friedman originally joined Microsoft after the company acquired Xamarin, which Friedman helped found. He then took over as the head of GitHub when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17422788/microsoft-github-acquisition-official-deal"&gt;Microsoft acquired GitHub&lt;/a&gt; three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsRHt2"&gt;Friedman is now returning to his startup roots. “With all that we’ve accomplished in mind, and more than five great years at Microsoft under my belt, I’ve decided it’s time for me to go back to my startup roots,” &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2021-11-03-thank-you-github/"&gt;says Friedman in a GitHub blog post&lt;/a&gt; today. “I’m moving on to my next adventure: to support, advise, and invest in the founders and developers who are creating the future with technology and tackling some of the biggest opportunities of our day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4BL2Sa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft’s new GitHub CEO takes over on November 15th&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WMxL3B"&gt;Thomas Dohmke, GitHub’s chief product officer, will now take over as GitHub CEO on November 15th, and GitHub will continue to operate as an independent Microsoft-owned business. Dohmke will report to Julia Liuson, who is being promoted to president of Microsoft’s developer division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zwONeJ"&gt;That’s a change in the GitHub structure at Microsoft, as Friedman used to report to Scott Guthrie, Microsoft’s Cloud and AI chief. Julia Liuson was at the center of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740701/microsoft-dotnet-hot-reload-removal-decision-open-source"&gt;recent controversial .NET change&lt;/a&gt; that triggered an open source community backlash and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/23/22742282/microsoft-dotnet-hot-reload-u-turn-response"&gt;forced the company to quickly U-turn on its decision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEwosX"&gt;While there were some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/18/17474284/microsoft-github-acquisition-developer-reaction"&gt;initial fears&lt;/a&gt; around Microsoft acquiring GitHub, the company has kept the business running separately without seeking to make major changes. Friedman was quick to respond to the firing of a Jewish employee at GitHub earlier this year, admitting that “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22235913/github-significant-mistakes-were-made-firing-jewish-employee-nazis"&gt;significant mistakes were made&lt;/a&gt;.” Microsoft also revealed recently that GitHub is now home to 73 million developers, up 2x since the company acquired GitHub in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 2022 Volkswagen ID 5 is a sporty electric SUV with over 300 miles of range</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kMWXmz4Wl3YMh1M5BbN2KX44quA=/0x0:4096x2731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70086532/DB2021AU00964_large.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dlhcwx"&gt;Volkswagen revealed the ID 5, a smaller, sportier version of its landmark ID 4 electric SUV that will only be available in Europe. It’s the latest vehicle to join VW’s growing “ID family” of electric vehicles as the company gets closer to its 2035 deadline &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551956/volkswagen-stop-selling-combustion-engine-vehicles-europe-2035"&gt;to stop selling gas-powered vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in its home continent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kpxxw7"&gt;VW is releasing two versions of its new EV: the entry level ID 5, and the more premium ID 5 GTX, with dual electric motors on both the front and rear axel. (GTX is for VW’s ID models what GTI, or Grand Tourer Injection, means for the Golf.) The entry-level ID 5 will be equipped with a single rear-wheel-drive motor with an output of 174 horsepower and a 77kWh battery pack — theoretically enabling over 320 miles of range. (VW has yet to release range estimates for the ID 5.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3eXyT"&gt;On the surface, the ID 5 looks indistinguishable from the ID 4, but a closer look reveals some key differences. It’s slightly shorter than the ID 4, with 12 millimeters less headroom in the back, and the bumper, painted door paneling, and new roof line are distinctive. Other than that, the ID 5 is basically just a coupe version of the ID 4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291294/vw-id5-ev-electric-suv-coupe-production-volkswagen-2021"&gt;Earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, a VW spokesperson said there were “no plans” to sell the ID 5 in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Epwd5o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VW says the ID 5 in-car features will be improved over the ID 4&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="68Q2JI"&gt;VW says the ID 5 in-car features will be improved over the ID 4, including an updated voice assistant that is now “learning-enabled” with “online access to information from the cloud.” The vehicle will also be equipped with VW’s “Car2X communication” to improve safety and data collection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="1vPtZJ"&gt;Data from compatible vehicles in the Volkswagen fleet and signals from infrastructure within a radius of up to 800 metres can be locally interpreted in a fraction of a second, enabling driver alerts about dangerous areas, accidents and stationary traffic. The ID. Light in the cockpit helps by providing visual warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="svI4M2"&gt;The ID 4 is the first vehicle built on VW’s modular MEB electric architecture to be available in North America. Its predecessor, the hatchback ID 3, is only being sold in Europe. The company sold over 6,000 in the first three quarters of 2021, which is fewer than the number of Mustang Mach-E SUVs sold by Ford but still a solid start for a brand-new EV in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="swoIJf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10843783"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lJ7pH0"&gt;VW’s ID electric lineup also includes concept versions of a large SUV (&lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-volkswagen-i-d-roomzz-concept-has-room-for-days-an-1834048772"&gt;ID Roomzz&lt;/a&gt;), a dune buggy (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254329/volkswagen-id-buggy-electric-concept-car-geneva-motor-show-2019"&gt;ID Buggy&lt;/a&gt;), and a revamped version of its iconic microbus (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/19/16173938/volkswagen-microbus-i-d-buzz-concept-production-nostalgia"&gt;ID Buzz&lt;/a&gt;), for which VW has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882400/vw-volkswagen-id-buzz-cargo-van-concept-electric"&gt;promised a delivery variant&lt;/a&gt;. All are being built on Volkswagen’s modular electric vehicle platform known as MEB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bo5mmt"&gt;The ID family of vehicles won’t be VW’s first foray into battery-powered drivetrains. The e-Golf was first launched in 2012 but was discontinued in 2020 as the automaker shifts focus to its MEB-built vehicles. VW subsidiary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"&gt;Porsche’s first all-electric sports car, the Taycan&lt;/a&gt;, went on sale in 2019. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17876012/dieselgate-volkswagen-vw-diesel-emissions-test-epa-german-auto-industry-mercedes-benz-bmw"&gt;The E-Tron&lt;/a&gt;, the first battery-electric SUV from Volkswagen Group-owned Audi, debuted in 2018, followed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274376/audi-etron-gt-rs-electric-car-specs-price"&gt;the E-Tron GT&lt;/a&gt;. Together, these vehicles represent the tip of the spear in VW’s effort to dominate the emerging EV market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipYYGi"&gt;They’re also crucial in helping VW turn the page on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17876012/dieselgate-volkswagen-vw-diesel-emissions-test-epa-german-auto-industry-mercedes-benz-bmw"&gt;now six-year-old Dieselgate scandal&lt;/a&gt;, in which VW was accused of installing illegal software in 11 million diesel cars in order to trick emissions tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ujqmG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brydge’s 11-inch Max Plus iPad keyboard is now available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wbnJyj0hA9CRKotgVWZESUMN71c=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70086425/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Brydge 11 Max Plus keyboard with an 11-inch iPad Pro in it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PWj0BD"&gt;Following the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22553643/brydge-12-9-max-plus-review-price-shipping"&gt;12.9-inch Max Plus keyboard for the iPad&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, Brydge is now releasing an 11-inch version. The new, smaller keyboard has all of the same features as its bigger sibling, including Brydge’s new magnetic mounting system and Instant-On Bluetooth tech, but is sized to fit all generations of the 11-inch iPad Pro and the fourth-generation of the 10.5-inch iPad Air. It’s available starting today, November 3rd, from both &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-max-plus-for-ipad-pro%3Fvariant%3D39674056966249&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759698%2Fbrydges-11-inch-max-plus-ipad-keyboard-now-available-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brydge’s online store&lt;/a&gt; and Amazon for $199.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR0P3l"&gt;Despite its smaller size, the 11-inch Max Plus’ pitch is exactly the same as the 12.9-inch model’s: it’s meant to provide a MacBook-like experience with an iPad. That includes a full keyboard layout with a function row, plus a large trackpad that supports multitouch gestures and navigation. The aluminum chassis can be purchased in either a dark gray or a silver finish to match your iPad’s color, and it has a very MacBook-like appearance when the iPad is installed in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AxoD1EnoshadMbeA7wjhr95UBKA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980077/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back panel of the 11 Max Plus is plastic and has tabs to easily pop the iPad off of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sq5nntfMZ3aBYNgydxlj_THVy00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980078/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 11 Max Plus connects to the iPad’s built-in magnets to hold it in place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P7ayvW"&gt;The big new innovation with the Max Plus line is the magnetic attachment system, which eschews the clamps Brydge used in older designs for a full backplate that connects to the magnets inside the iPad to hold it in place. The advantage here is that it allows you to quickly remove the iPad from the keyboard and use it handheld and just as easily snap it back into place when you want to use the keyboard again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p84uXJ"&gt;The Max Plus does not use the iPad’s Smart Connector, relying instead on a Bluetooth connection with the tablet. To overcome the usual delays that happen when using a Bluetooth keyboard with an iPad, Brydge developed its Instant-On technology, which allows the keyboard to stay connected to the iPad for up to four hours, even if it isn’t being used, without detrimental battery drain on either the case or the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7G61ky"&gt;This makes waking up the iPad feel much the same as a directly connected keyboard and mitigates one of the major complaints with Bluetooth. Brydge claims up to three months of battery life between charges, but that varies greatly on how much you utilize the three-level backlight. In the week or so I’ve been testing the product, I’ve not had to charge it back up once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ax7BVZ"&gt;Brydge CEO Nick Smith tells me that the company’s inspiration for the keyboard feel was the vaunted 2015 MacBook Pro. As a result, the Max Plus keys have a bit more travel than either &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard case&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547938/logitech-combo-touch-ipad-air-fourth-generation"&gt;Logitech’s Combo Touch&lt;/a&gt;, the two main competitors in this space. The keycaps themselves are also a little smaller and have a little bit more space between them, but I had no trouble getting comfortable with the layout after a few minutes of use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n88GEQqlJgIPgnFRtSS2HfnuTE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980079/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 11 Max Plus has a full keyboard with function row and a large multitouch trackpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NzwXx3"&gt;Brydge is also very proud of the size of the trackpad it was able to include with the Max Plus; the 11-inch model has a larger trackpad than either Apple or Logitech’s keyboard. It supports multitouch gestures and has good tracking, if not quite as precise as Apple has in the Magic Keyboard. Due to the smaller size of the 11-inch’s deck, I did have a few instances of palm rejection, which caused my cursor to jump across the screen when I didn’t expect it to. But otherwise, the trackpad experience on the Max Plus is quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxdnmp"&gt;Using the Max Plus keyboard is a different experience than the Magic Keyboard or the Combo Touch, by design. It’s a chunkier, heftier product, adding nearly two pounds of weight to the iPad itself, but it’s more stable on a lap, like you’d expect a laptop to be. It’s also more comfortable to type on for longer periods because the deck provides more room to rest your hands. And the full function row is a boon compared to the Magic Keyboard, which requires reaching up to use the iPad’s buttons or touch the screen anytime you want to adjust brightness or volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPwJcz"&gt;Lastly, because the Max Plus uses a Bluetooth connection, you can remove the iPad from the case and still use the keyboard and trackpad with it. I particularly liked putting the iPad in a portrait orientation when working on a long document, which you can’t do with the Magic Keyboard or the Combo Touch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1eZo1MBkMOokkxIqaaoS6YU9rVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980081/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When closed, the 11 Max Pro is chunkier than other keyboards, but preserves the MacBook-like aesthetic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qrsgNm"&gt;The Max Plus is also not designed to provide much in the way of protection. Unlike Logitech’s Combo Touch, when you remove it from the keyboard, you’re holding a bare iPad, and it doesn’t provide any corner protection from drops. If you are looking for a more protective design that has similar traits as the Max Plus, Brydge offers the plastic &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-air-max-plus%3Fvariant%3D39421148594281&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759698%2Fbrydges-11-inch-max-plus-ipad-keyboard-now-available-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Air Max Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which provides four feet of drop protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoEeWd"&gt;At $200, the Max Plus undercuts Apple by about $100 and is priced similarly to the Combo Touch. It’s not a budget product by any means; that’s reflected in the copious amount of aluminum used and the long feature list. But if you’re looking for a way to get more out of your 11-inch iPad Pro or iPad Air and want a more traditional experience than Apple’s keyboard provides, there’s a lot to like here.&lt;/p&gt;
