    <title>MSCHF’s next project won’t wait for Mickey Mouse to enter the public domain</title>

  &lt;p id="8T76XI"&gt;After prodding Nike with a Lil Nas X collaboration for “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374480/nike-mschf-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-lawsuit-settled"&gt;Satan Shoes&lt;/a&gt;” and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573466/mschf-dead-startup-toys-drop-price"&gt;memorializing iconic failed startups as toys&lt;/a&gt;, the internet collective MSCHF is aiming bigger and further out &lt;a href="https://mschfxfamousmouse.com/"&gt;with its next drop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSCHF “Famous Mouse” token" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2gOpCq2qlPvaYe6S7vwIgKemwGQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800386/famous_mouse.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: MSCHF&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSCHF “Famous Mouse” token&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="slf48h"&gt;Mickey Mouse is set to enter the public domain in 2024, at which point MSCHF could make a Mickey Mouse artwork. Today, in 2021, we cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7LH5h"&gt;Instead, we are making and selling the idea of a MSCHF “Famous Mouse” artwork now, that will not exist–even as a design–until 2024. If you purchase this artwork, we give you a temporary token with a unique code that can be redeemed for the actual piece in 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dmWaCz"&gt;Instead of waiting a few more years for copyrights on works from 1923 to expire, MSCHF is taking a decidedly modern approach and selling the idea for its artwork now, tied to a token that buyers can redeem in 2024. The name is still copyrighted so for now this is just a “Famous Mouse,” find out more &lt;a href="https://mschfxfamousmouse.com/faq/"&gt;in the FAQ here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4l6hQL"&gt;The tokens will ship in a “plastic slab case” with a sticker covering the code. Buyers are free to sell or trade their codes, and whoever has one can redeem it in 2024, assuming Mickey Mouse &lt;a href="https://blog.jipel.law.nyu.edu/2019/12/in-2024-mickey-mouse-will-finally-enter-the-public-domain-sort-of/"&gt;actually enters the public domain&lt;/a&gt;. As MSCHF points out, “It is entirely possible that Disney will lobby for changes to U.S. copyright law in order to further hoard their IP. After all, what is the law compared to the power of a U.S. corporation?”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is giving customers a free year of Apple TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hiC77TNwBUp-4F-OVSyfPk0hggo=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763688/Ted_Lasso_Photo_020106.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0n2u1d"&gt;T-Mobile has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Ft-mobile-apple-tv-on-us&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced a new promotional perk&lt;/a&gt; for its customers: starting on August 25th, both new and existing subscribers to its Magenta and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;Magenta Max&lt;/a&gt; plans can get a year’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-tv-plus-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscription to Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGx288"&gt;The deal applies to virtually any of T-Mobile’s post-paid customers that it classifies as part of those plans, including its Magenta 55 Plus, Magenta Military, Magenta First Responders, Sprint Unlimited Plus, Sprint Premium, and T-Mobile for Business plans. Better yet, the deal isn’t just for newcomers to T-Mobile; it seems that anyone subscribing to those plans can get the free year of Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tew1Ky"&gt;Customers under T-Mobile’s Magenta, Magenta Max, and T-Mobile for Business can find the offer listed under their rate plan details on T-Mobile’s website or app to get the free year, while customers who are still under Sprint’s umbrella will have to go to T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-tv-plus-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;promotional site&lt;/a&gt; and apply the code 2021APPLETVP1 to get the offer. (Regular T-Mobile customers can do that, too, should they prefer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nGr6x0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Watch ‘Foundation’ for free&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKhcRS"&gt;T-Mobile also notes that the free 12 months on offer here will seemingly apply even if you’ve had a subscription or trial to Apple TV Plus before, meaning that customers can stack the deal with other free trials, like the three months of service that come with the purchase of a new Apple device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96944Y"&gt;The freebie also comes as T-Mobile is reckoning with its recent massive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633853/tmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc"&gt;data breach&lt;/a&gt;, which exposed data for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;millions of its customers&lt;/a&gt;, including first and last names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver’s license / ID numbers, phone numbers, and IMEI / IMSI information for 7.8 million postpaid customers. Additionally, T-Mobile says that data on over 40 million “former or prospective customers” was compromised in the breach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6kuAz"&gt;And while it’s certainly a nice bonus for customers, it’s likely that a few months of &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;will not make up for having to deal with the ramifications of having that much personal data leaked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Richard Branson’s satellite launch firm, Virgin Orbit, to go public via SPAC merger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Spaceport Cornwall Opens Exhibition On Satellites At Newquay Airport" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CrAzwtZg39_mbQZwyLfON1EDCWQ=/0x0:5327x3551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763558/1333540386.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfvqEz"&gt;Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit, a satellite-launching spinoff of the billionaire founder’s space tourism firm, is going public through a merger with a shell company, the firm announced on Monday. The company will be valued at $3.2 billion and includes an investment from Boeing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bulDnU"&gt;Virgin Orbit plans to merge with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt; (also known as a SPAC), NextGen Acquisition Corp. II around the end of 2021. It will be listed on NASDAQ under the ticker “VORB.” The deal will bring Virgin Orbit $483 million in new capital — $383 million stored in NextGen and $100 million from another round of funding. Investors in that round include Boeing, Virgin said, but it’s unclear how much they pitched in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLhaNb"&gt;The $483 million will help Virgin Orbit ramp up “rocket manufacturing to meet customer demand, and to fund growth in its space solutions business and Virgin Orbit’s ongoing product development initiatives,” the company said in a press release. “Our success in launch has driven the business forward, and now we expect this investment will enable us to build on our R&amp;amp;D efforts and our incredible team,” Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-AEROSPACE-VIRGIN-ORBIT" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gLCnJ3JtENB9XTvkGj_BBasx4YE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691005/1230643749.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P9c5Z2"&gt;That Virgin Orbit would go public has been sort of an open secret for months, mainly after &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-12/branson-targets-new-space-spac-to-take-virgin-orbit-public"&gt;reports emerged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/branson-plots-3bn-spac-merger-to-launch-virgin-orbit-onto-stock-market-12330845"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that the company was shopping for a SPAC with which to merge to go public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCcTrP"&gt;Virgin Orbit, founded in 2017, launches a small rocket called LauncherOne from the underwing of a modified Boeing 747, named Cosmic Girl. It uses a so-called “air launch” method that the company touts as being more reliable and quicker for getting satellites to space than the more common methods of launching rockets vertically from the ground. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22221212/virgin-orbit-rocket-test-launch-satellites-nasa-branson"&gt;reached orbit for the first time&lt;/a&gt; in January and deployed ten satellites, and later launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557103/watch-virgin-orbit-launch-debut-commercial-mission-richard-branson"&gt;first commercial mission&lt;/a&gt; in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D5eyNw"&gt;The launch industry has been racing to NASDAQ ever since Virgin Galactic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936896/virgin-galactic-public-offering-nyse-spce-space-tourism"&gt;Branson’s space tourism firm, went public in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Small launch firm Astra went public through a SPAC in June, becoming the first company of its kind to do so. Rocket Lab, another small launch company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306971/rocket-lab-neutron-public-spac"&gt;plans to do the same&lt;/a&gt; and begin trading on NASDAQ on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine gets full FDA approval  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vaccine Mandates For Kids Is Next Big Back-To-School Fight" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/htBgOtKfd6Ox0dLJnnT04Ic-OHo=/0x0:5280x3520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763296/1234462203.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h6zBmZ"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;granted full approval&lt;/a&gt; to the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, another landmark in the historic immunization campaign. The vaccine was previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22158608/fda-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-emergency-use"&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; to people over the age of 12 in the United States under an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22189236/fda-approval-authorization-difference-clearance-vaccines"&gt;emergency use authorization&lt;/a&gt;. Now, it’s officially licensed in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06KGpd"&gt;With full approval, Pfizer and BioNTech can directly market the shot to consumers. The vaccine will be marketed under the name Comirnaty to people over 16. It will still be available to people 12-15 years old under an emergency use authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSeH0j"&gt;“The FDA’s approval of this vaccine is a milestone as we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic,” acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement. “While this and other vaccines have met the FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for emergency use authorization, as the first FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine, the public can be very confident that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality the FDA requires of an approved product.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XacCgw"&gt;The approval may push more companies and schools to mandate vaccinations. While it’s legal for them to require vaccinations under an emergency authorization, some have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/us/colleges-vaccinations-enrollment.html"&gt;been reluctant&lt;/a&gt; to do so. Public health officials hope that full approval may encourage more people to get vaccinated. “Today’s milestone puts us one step closer to altering the course of this pandemic in the U.S.,” Woodcock said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VI86vD"&gt;The companies needed to provide six months of safety and efficacy data on their vaccine to the FDA in order to submit their application for what’s called a Biological License. The agency only asked companies to collect &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download"&gt;two months&lt;/a&gt; of data before applying for an emergency use authorization. The shortened timeline allowed the agency to sidestep some of the more lengthy regulatory steps and get vaccines to people quickly during the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgCShz"&gt;This approval is based on mountains of data, including a clinical trial that looked at 20,000 patients who received the vaccine, and 20,000 people who received a placebo. That trial found that the vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598151/pfizer-covid-vaccine-efficacy-drop-booster"&gt;91 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing symptomatic COVID after six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gyzy9C"&gt;“Our scientific and medical experts conducted an incredibly thorough and thoughtful evaluation of this vaccine,” Peter Marks, director of FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said in a statement. As part of the evaluation, the agency reviewed hundreds of thousands of pages of data, conducted new analyses of the vaccines’ effectiveness, and inspected manufacturing facilities, Marks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Baol4h"&gt;FDA approval may help some people who were on the fence about getting vaccinated feel more comfortable taking the shot. One &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-may-2021/"&gt;May survey&lt;/a&gt; found that one-third of unvaccinated adults would be more likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine that was fully approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0ccM0"&gt;Now that one COVID-19 vaccine has full approval, other pharmaceutical companies will not be able to ask the FDA for new emergency use authorizations. Emergency authorizations can only be issued for drugs or vaccines when there are no approved options available — now that the Pfizer / BioNTech shot is licensed, that’s no longer the case. If AstraZeneca, for example, wanted to make its shot available in the US, it would have to start with the longer formal approval process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNExtg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxWquB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="UDaTXS"&gt;The Bose QuietComfort 35 Series II, often referred to in shorthand as the QC35 II, are just about the cheapest they’ve ever sold for today. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13112648?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fbose-quietcomfort-wireless-headphones-12" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot has new, black-colored units with a one-year Bose warranty for $195&lt;/a&gt;. According to pricing data from CamelCamelCamel, this is $5 cheaper than the previous best price on record. These aren’t the latest noise-canceling headphones to hit the market. They released in late 2017, and the reasons they’re still popular are because of their solid sound quality, comfort, a dedicated voice assistant button, and an effective noise cancellation effect. One thing you might not like about them, though, is that they recharge via a Micro USB port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3uzUI"&gt;A new set of Bose headphones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583264/bose-quietcomfort-45-headphones-qc45-fcc-filing-leak"&gt;appeared in an FCC filing recently&lt;/a&gt;, a possible hint that the QC45s might be releasing sooner than later. They’ll almost certainly be an improvement in many ways over the QC35 II, but they’ll likely be much pricier than today’s deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qVLwxG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556398"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vLVp3v"&gt;Apple’s clear case for the iPhone XR is, frankly, a terrible value for the $40 or so that the company usually charges for it. So, if you have an iPhone XR and want a durable case with simple styling, I’m encouraging you to instead &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749902636215052284" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;consider Best Buy’s deal&lt;/a&gt; on the case. It’s going for just $14, so you could even buy two of them, in case one should degrade over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pU1IHH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10714816"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rY20hi"&gt;It wasn’t too long ago when finding a webcam selling for a reasonable rate was out of the question. If you want a basic webcam that offers 720p resolution at 30 frames per second, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-C505-Webcam-720p-Long-Range/dp/B08BNJPVXG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s C505 is selling for its lowest price today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, costing $40 instead of $55. Given these specs, don’t expect remarkable fidelity, but it should be good enough if you just need an affordable webcam for jumping into some face-to-face meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sQJGgR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10714827"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9n9NRd"&gt;Last week, we featured a $100 off deal on Apple’s latest iPad Mini from 2019. Your chances of finding that deal increased over the weekend, as Best Buy started honoring this deal. You can get $100 off each model, whether it’s limited to Wi-Fi or you want an LTE-enabled model. The price starts at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749903282026194249" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 for the 64GB Wi-Fi model&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749903296052984453" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$430 for the 64GB LTE version&lt;/a&gt;. Does this recent price drop mean that a new iPad Mini is around the corner? I wish that we knew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AqXdb6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Cowboy Bebop is out on November 19th, check out the first photos</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jLywiT"&gt;Four years after news broke &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15745990/cowboy-bebop-live-action-series"&gt;that work had begun on a live-action adaptation&lt;/a&gt; of beloved sci-fi anime &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, the series finally has a release date. Netflix announced today that &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; will come in for a landing on November 19th, and here are some new photos to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F05jUt"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18115752/cowboy-bebop-netflix-live-action-series-announced"&gt;Netflix confirmed it was working on &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the streaming service has been decidedly tight-lipped on details. It announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295535/netflix-cowboy-bebop-john-cho-spike-live-action-series"&gt;the show’s cast in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and, earlier this year, that original composer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22463620/netflix-live-action-cowboy-bebop-release-date-john-cho"&gt;Yoko Kanno would return to the live-action series&lt;/a&gt;. But there still hasn’t been an official trailer or a casting announcement for series regular “Radical Edward.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UxZspCFTomOAQCEs4dL3LQAlrk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22796080/COWBOYBEB_Unit_08114RC4.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6mLyON"&gt;Now at least Netflix is sharing photos of the cast — John Cho as Spike Spiegel, Mustafa Shakir as Jet Black, and Daniella Pineda as Faye Valentine — featuring what look to be final costumes and sets for the series. You can see a few choice selections above, along with a whole gallery below. Feel free to pair them with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Hj6hPqKiS4"&gt;Kanno’s score from the original series&lt;/a&gt; for the full effect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube says its Partner Program now has 2 million members</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S5HvgfuCsMLkbcs_IeRH5uM-oek=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763043/acastro_200123_3880_Youtube_NDA_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube’s Partner Program has passed the 2 million creator mark | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SGOdvM"&gt;YouTube’s Partner Program, which allows users to make money off their videos, has passed the 2 million creator mark, the company said Monday. The platform has helped turn YouTube into a viable business for top creators like PewDiePie and Jenna Marbles, but it’s also been the cause of consternation for the company when eligible partners — often those same top creators — do something that reflects poorly on the platform and temporarily drives away advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqHByb"&gt;Creators who qualify for the Partner Program — you need at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of overall watch time on your channel in the past 12 months — can earn money through ads, subscription fees, donations, livestreaming, and YouTube Premium revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="daTupU"&gt;The Google-owned company has struggled at times to find the balance between having a lot of creators who rake in ad revenue and keeping advertisers happy. This has included deciding when to remove ads from channels that engage in harassment or other problematic content; while YouTube takes a cut of eligible creators’ ad revenue, if advertisers are wary of a channel’s content, they’ll pull their ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VExuM"&gt;YouTube updated its harassment policy in 2019 in response to some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754620/youtube-commentary-harassment-creators-bullying-susan-wojcicki"&gt;creator-on-creator harassment&lt;/a&gt;, which was a significant corner of the site for years, and has punished creators who cross legal or ethical lines by demonetizing their channels. In the past year, that’s included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164553/youtube-coronavirus-demonetization-sensitive-subjects-advertising-guidelines-revenue"&gt;demonetizing videos&lt;/a&gt; that mention the coronavirus, considered a sensitive topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0h5NP"&gt;Neal Mohan, chief product officer at YouTube, said in a blog post that the number of new channels joining the program in 2020 more than doubled when compared to 2019, and the number of YouTube channels making six figures or more in revenue is up 35 percent year over year (but he didn’t provide the specific number of creators who make that much money). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLHBx5"&gt;“Finding new ways to reward trusted creators financially and help them ramp up their businesses will always be a top priority for us,” Mohan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knY9Jo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As demand for bikes surged, Amazon got in the way</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tqyygfPBIs88MRZrMe30TolbNAY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763054/VRG_ILLO_4687_Amazon_Bikes.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Claudia Chinyere Akole&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A bike parts company ditched Amazon to support indie shops instead&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hCWaUa"&gt;After leaving his job in global business development at Amazon, Aaron Kerson used his knowledge of the platform’s sales algorithms to power up his new business. Pacific Northwest Components, launched in 2017 with his wife Emily, slowly became a success, selling handlebars, levers, and other mountain bike parts. But when the pandemic hit and a global shortage battered the bike industry, Kerson realized one company was causing a lot of problems: Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJwgmV"&gt;Now Kerson’s company is part of a slew of businesses turning their backs on Amazon and removing their products from the platform’s marketplace. In the last two years, brands like &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2020/01/22/why-nike-cut-ties-with-amazon-and-what-it-means-for-other-retailers/?sh=184a5d5f64ff"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt;, Ikea, and Birkenstock have pulled their merchandise, citing frustration with business practices, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/20/birkenstock-quits-amazon-in-us-after-counterfeit-surge.html"&gt;counterfeit products&lt;/a&gt;, and lack of access to customer data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="T5Sp61"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It would mean that 20-30 percent of PNW’s sales would disappear overnight&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oJuov0"&gt;“Is this worth it?” Kerson kept asking himself as he decided how much of PNW’s limited stock to list on Amazon. The responsibility of running a small business had been getting to him: “The multitude of scariness just keeps getting bigger.” But he had to change something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwXFbJ"&gt;In June, Kerson removed all of PNW Components’ products from Amazon. He wanted to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pnwcomponents.com%2Fblogs%2Fnews%2Fpnw-components-pauses-business-on-amazon&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22618306%2Fpacific-northwest-components-bike-company-quit-amazon-support-indie-shops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reallocate the inventory&lt;/a&gt; to independent bike shops in an effort to save an industry shell-shocked by the effects of the pandemic. It would mean that 20-30 percent of PNW’s sales would disappear overnight. But there were upsides to leaving Amazon, too; PNW would regain direct control of customer service and returns, much of which was ceded to Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avF0jp"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic affected supply chains everywhere. By the end of March 2020, there was a &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/5/29/21267958/bikes-supply-chain-bicycle-memorial-day-weekend"&gt;global shortage&lt;/a&gt; of bikes and bike parts, while demand surged. Most bike manufacturing is based in Asia, and as the pandemic wore on, PNW parts that used to take 45 days to ship from Taiwan took up to 200 days to arrive. By the start of 2021, Kerson heard of bike shops on the brink of closing down due to such high demand and low inventory. Pulling his products from Amazon, he thought, could help those independent bike shops — and rid PNW of an ongoing frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifmRKG"&gt;Amazon had been posing serious customer service problems for PNW.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Shopping for bike parts is complex, Kerson says, because choosing the right item depends on specifics about the customer and their bike. Amazon offers no way to provide that kind of expertise, so the rate of returns is high. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Part of the website shows the categories of gear they offer, including dropper posts, levers, and parts of gravel bikes." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/23KfyWuLC4APGrSIgrbgkrlVK08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773485/pnwcomponentswebsite.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pacific Northwest Components moved its bike parts sales off Amazon and to independent bike stores.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="28WaQz"&gt;Return fraud was a constant issue for PNW, too. Kerson says he had hundreds of fake items returned to him via Amazon. He’s opened boxes containing steel pipes, a Mr. Coffee coffeemaker, a high-end faucet, and once, a child’s Superman costume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2Y8I5"&gt;Another headache was maintaining participation in Seller Fulfilled Prime, an Amazon program where sellers ship products directly on a speedy timeline, rather than using Amazon’s warehouses. The pace was unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="97VBgX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The only reason they were on Amazon was because they had to be”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fUcJF3"&gt;“You need to ship out products the same day. You have to do that at a 99 percent success rate. You can’t have too many returns,” says Andrew Marshall, who handles PNW’s operations and finance. PNW ended up selling some products where more than half the sale price went to shipping, even before Amazon had taken its commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjprVc"&gt;“For anyone who is a small or medium-sized business, it’s physically impossible, or unprofitable, to be doing all-week nationwide delivery,’ says Juozas Kaziukėnas, founder of e-commerce research firm Marketplace Pulse. “Amazon has effectively killed Seller-Fulfilled Prime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4rDwc"&gt;The alternative is to use Amazon’s in-house service, Fulfilled By Amazon. But that requires small businesses to cede control, selling wholesale to the company or using Amazon’s fulfillment centers and delivery systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9dC7L"&gt;PNW wasn’t the only business growing tired of Amazon.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kerson and his team asked buyers at every retailer who stocks PNW parts to remove them from their Amazon stores too, so that everyone involved could maximize their profits and not undercut each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mDYlmz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Other sellers have run into similar frustrations with Amazon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nhSGsO"&gt;“We set up these calls and we were not expecting them to go very well,” says Marshall, “As soon as we started talking about it the buyers were really excited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpmZQJ"&gt;Turns out, Amazon wasn’t working for these bigger bike retailers either. “The only reason they were on Amazon was because they had to be, to compete to sell that product,” says Marshall, “They were also losing money on low-dollar items, but they were taking the hit just to get a chance to connect with that customer.” Some sellers were putting slips of paper in with low-value items, asking customers to buy directly from the store next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jz1Ar"&gt;Unlike struggling bike shops, Amazon’s profits skyrocketed during the pandemic. The company’s annual revenue &lt;a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/default.aspx"&gt;hit $386 billion in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, up 38 percent from the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f04clb"&gt;These problems aren’t unique to the bike industry. Kerson is part of a growing movement of small-scale sellers frustrated with Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge5CeQ"&gt;Sarah Ford, a former US Marine, pulled her Texas-based luxury boot brand, Ranch Road Boots, off Amazon in 2019. “I looked at Amazon as the world’s biggest mall. And I just wanted to get my boots on as many people’s feet as possible,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgrDbZ"&gt;Ford quickly faced challenges after starting on Amazon in 2016. She had underestimated the additional costs of succeeding on the platform, like buying paid advertising to ensure customers found her products. This was on top of the commission Amazon took on every sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lxBKl1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I have zero regrets”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r7Tk0S"&gt;Amazon accounted for 50 percent of Ford’s sales when she pulled her boots from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAvsdn"&gt;“It took a couple of years to get that revenue back on our side. But I have zero regrets,” Ford said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ru3wfR"&gt;Kerson and Marshall hope PNW will be in a similar position soon. However, as Marshall points out, PNW could only make the decision to leave Amazon because they’d grown their business there in the first place. For small businesses just starting out, ignoring the platform might not be an option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJJKf0"&gt;“A lot of the smaller brands are really forced into using Amazon,” says Marshall. “If they want to grow their brand, there’s really not any alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVdrL5"&gt;Since they left Amazon, PNW’s returns have already dropped, Kerson says, and sales from their website have increased. They’re selling fewer low-dollar items, but they’re optimistic they will regain lost revenue. More bike shops have asked to stock their items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="aASEv7"&gt;Kerson doesn’t shop on Amazon himself anymore. But from the windows of his house in Seattle, he can see their delivery vans coming and going, all day long.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="fBxKul"&gt;Supercell, the Finnish developer best known for mobile hits like &lt;em&gt;Clash of Clans&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Brawl Stars&lt;/em&gt;, announced its next game today — and it looks to be a big departure. Called &lt;em&gt;Everdale&lt;/em&gt;, it’s described as “a peaceful building game based on cooperation and friendship.” There are plenty of mobile games about building towns or villages, but &lt;em&gt;Everdale&lt;/em&gt;’s hook is that you’ll do that alongside other players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEhsiD"&gt;Here’s the basic setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kegaKr"&gt;Your village is actually part of a larger valley, where you and nine other players work together to build a big, wondrous utopia. In the valley, you’ll meet an eclectic cast of characters, make handcrafted goods, and trade with merchants from far off lands. More still, you can jump into local adventures, and level up your villagers at the esteemed valley guilds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="l1x6bq"&gt;For the most part, Supercell’s previous games have been centered on conflict, whether that’s the fantasy card battles of &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18093052/supercell-brawl-stars-global-launch-iphone-android"&gt;the squad-based shooting in &lt;em&gt;Brawl Stars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The peaceful tone of &lt;em&gt;Everdale&lt;/em&gt; feels like a notable departure, and it’s also set in a brand-new universe. (Supercell has steadily been expanding the &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; franchise with new games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362092/supercell-clash-of-clans-clash-royale-new-games"&gt;including three new titles currently in development&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/12/21430993/clash-of-clans-royale-animated-short-youtube-supercell"&gt;an animated short&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBgBNF"&gt;You can check out &lt;em&gt;Everdale&lt;/em&gt; for yourself today depending on where you’re based — the game is going into soft launch in a handful of countries, including Canada, the UK, Nordics, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Philippines, and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
