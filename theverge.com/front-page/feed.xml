    <title>China complains to UN after maneuvering its space station away from SpaceX Starlink satellites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFlJIr"&gt;China &lt;a href="https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/oosadoc/data/documents/2021/aac.105/aac.1051262_0.html"&gt;filed a complaint this month with the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that it had to conduct evasive maneuvers of its space station to avoid potential collisions with two of SpaceX’s internet-beaming Starlink satellites. The country is requesting that the UN’s Secretary General remind countries of their obligations under international space law, though China did not specify exactly what actions it wants to be taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5cmFb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.unoosa.org/res/oosadoc/data/documents/2021/aac_105/aac_1051262_0_html/AAC105_1262E.pdf"&gt;In the complaint&lt;/a&gt;, dated December 6th, China details two instances on July 1st, 2020 and  on October 21st, 2021 when the nation had to maneuver the core module of its space station, called Tianhe, out of the way of two separate Starlink satellites. The three Chinese astronauts currently living on Tianhe had just arrived to the station several days before the October maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T6652Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;China did not specify exactly what actions it wants to be taken&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qAiquW"&gt;China cited its responsibility to report the incidents to the UN due to its obligations under &lt;a href="https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/introouterspacetreaty.html"&gt;the Outer Space Treaty&lt;/a&gt;, an international agreement ratified in the 1960s that governs how countries should explore space. The Treaty offers up a set of loose guidelines and rules for countries to follow when launching spacecraft and people to space, such as prohibiting the placement of nuclear weapons in orbit and making the exploration of space a peaceful enterprise. The treaty also notes that participating countries are responsible under international law for all of the actions they take in space, including those by their commercial companies. And China apparently wants everyone reminded of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JexO5l"&gt;The complaint reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="E78vmu"&gt;China wishes to request the Secretary-General of the United Nations to circulate the above-mentioned information to all States parties to the Outer Space Treaty and bring to their attention that, in accordance with article VI of the Treaty, “States Parties to the Treaty shall bear international responsibility for national activities in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, whether such activities are carried on by governmental agencies or by non-governmental entities...”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yZKLH4"&gt;Starlink is SpaceX’s ambitious internet-from-space initiative, which calls for launching nearly 12,000 satellites into low Earth orbit in order to beam broadband internet coverage to the ground below. So far, the company has launched more than 1,900 Starlink satellites, with nearly 1,800 still in orbit, &lt;a href="https://planet4589.org/space/stats/star/starstats.html"&gt;according to satellite tracking&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJJAZI"&gt;As SpaceX continues to launch large crops of Starlink satellites into orbit, space trackers have raised concerns about how the spacecraft could make Earth orbit more crowded and raise the likelihood of collisions with satellites already in space. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20847243/spacex-starlink-satellite-european-space-agency-aeolus-conjunction-space-debris"&gt;there have already been&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374262/oneweb-spacex-satellites-dodged-potential-collision-orbit-space-force"&gt;a couple of reports&lt;/a&gt; of satellites having to move out of the way of Starlink vehicles to avoid collisions. SpaceX claims that its Starlink satellites have their own autonomous collision avoidance software, which allows them to move out of the way on their own if the satellites suspect they may come close to another vehicle or piece of debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="wlg6s1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This isn’t the first time that a space station has had to maneuver out of the way of a satellite&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xADCi4"&gt;China says that its two avoidance maneuvers with Tianhe came after two Starlink satellites changed their altitudes in space. The first one in 2020 came after a Starlink satellite moved from its long-held orbit at 555 kilometers down to 382 kilometers. China claims the second Starlink satellite that caused trouble was “continuously maneuvering,” making it hard to know where it was headed. As a precaution in consideration of the astronauts on board, China opted to do a maneuver to avoid a collision. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uXX5d"&gt;This isn’t the first time that a space station has had to maneuver out of the way of a satellite or piece of debris. The International Space Station is consistently boosting its orbiting to avoid potential collisions with objects in space. In November, the astronauts on board the ISS had to shelter in place after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782946/russia-asat-test-satellite-international-space-station-debris"&gt;Russia destroyed one of its own satellites in a nearby orbit&lt;/a&gt;, a show of strength known as an anti-satellite, or ASAT test. The test created thousands of pieces of debris that initially threatened the space station — and may continue to pose a threat to the ISS for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifk2Hl"&gt;China is also responsible for some of the International Space Station’s collision avoidance maneuvers. In 2007, China destroyed one of its own satellites during an ASAT test, creating thousands of pieces of debris. Many of those pieces are still in orbit, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/science/china-debris-space-station.html"&gt;the ISS has periodically had to move out of the way&lt;/a&gt; to avoid these leftovers over the last decade. Now with its own space station in orbit, China is getting a taste of what that experience is like.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reopens NYC stores to ‘limited’ walk-in services</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Daily Life in New York City Around The One-year Anniversary of The COVID-19 Shut Down" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DtEwK0yns5G9a3pC5n7lXBrqSlU=/0x0:5017x3345/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70321421/1306792576.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bax011"&gt;As initially reported by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1475577591268446214"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-27/apple-closes-new-york-city-stores-to-shoppers-after-covid-spike"&gt;all of New York City’s Apple Stores&lt;/a&gt; joined the list of locations closing their doors to most customers amid a spike in the number of COVID-19 infections. Gurman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1475878857500606468"&gt;tweeted again&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, noting the stores have updated their listings, saying they are available for “limited” walk-in services for shopping and Genius Bar tech support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Services at Apple Upper West Side" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r5zjvcRXI95h7RUKpwxu6Z0VVs8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128905/apple_services_nyc.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Services at Apple Upper West Side&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DQ5AT4"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850946/apple-store-covid-two-hour-free-shipping-option"&gt;Apple closed seven stores in North America&lt;/a&gt; in a single day as positive tests among employees rose, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/27/20-apple-stores-closed-in-us-today/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out that even before this announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/storelist/"&gt;the Apple website listed&lt;/a&gt; more than 20 locations that were closed today due to the effects of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nu30nI"&gt;For people in New York City, the stores were still accessible if you have an appointment to pick up an online order. Apple is no longer offering the free two-hour delivery option it pushed ahead of last week’s holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcphrN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 28th, 1:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to note NYC Apple Stores are allowing limited numbers of customers inside for shopping and Genius Bar services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tumblr goes overboard censoring tags on iOS to comply with Apple’s guidelines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GKAnq5xJTJ7g8S8GOddg5Yp0qAw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70323955/acastro_191203_177_tumblr_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://instagram.com/alexcas.io" target="_blank"&gt;Alex Castro&lt;/a&gt; / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oQUWIs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://wip.tumblr.com/post/671184848292118528/an-update-on-the-tumblr-ios-app"&gt;An update to Tumblr’s iOS app&lt;/a&gt; censors a long list of tags to comply with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#safety"&gt;strict safety guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. The platform explains that it’s changing iOS users’ ability to access sensitive content, affecting their experience when it comes to searching for content, scrolling through the “Stuff for You” and “Following” sections of the dashboard, and could even prevent access to blogs that are flagged. Tumblr says it has to “extend the definition of what sensitive content is” to “remain available within Apple’s App Store,” and it seems that Tumblr stretched it pretty far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tcci7"&gt;Tags are what make posts searchable on Tumblr; posts with censored tags won’t appear on a users’ dashboard, nor will they show up on the platform’s search page. A Twitter thread brought attention to some of the absurd tags that ended up getting filtered out on iOS, including the tag “submission.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UAQwdx"&gt;The interesting part, though, is that Tumblr applies that tag automatically when a post is submitted and then published to a blog on the platform. Users on iOS who receive a submission to their blog won’t even be able to view it since the “submission” tag is already added, as shown &lt;a href="https://hellbabyfromhell.tumblr.com/post/671605726003773440/submission-is-banned-too"&gt;in a post by one Tumblr user&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NOSbIC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;but the other thing is TUMBLR WILL AUTOMATICALLY ADD THAT TAG FOR YOU&lt;/p&gt;— foone (@Foone) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1474985625140940802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LhMdqQ"&gt;Another Tumblr user, aptly named “bannedtags,” has been keeping track of all the blocked tags in a &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YG7E84Dvs2PyoKMgSgZFgEX0Kh0RtJqsazZsyVGY8dk/edit"&gt;Google Doc&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://bannedtags.tumblr.com/post/671610234653048832/a-growing-list-of-banned-tags"&gt;user notes&lt;/a&gt; that most of these tags have been banned on iOS —not on all devices — and that the listed tags are subject to change. Some banned tags are blatantly related to sexual, violent, or harmful content, but others don’t seem to belong on the list, and may actually do more harm than good by staying on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJrvbx"&gt;For example, “girl,” “sad,” and oddly enough, “Alec Lightwood,” an actor from the show &lt;em&gt;Shadowhunters&lt;/em&gt;, has been banned (because even Tumblr can’t handle those eyes). “Single dad,” “single mom,” “single parent,” “suicide prevention,” and “testicular cancer” are also on the list, potentially harming those who want to seek support in any of these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuPVKP"&gt;To make things even weirder, Tumblr blacklisted some tags that basically function as unspoken social cues on the site. “Me” and “my face” are blocked, both of which are tags that bloggers use to label their selfies (oh, and did I forget to mention that “selfie” is banned, too?). The platform appears to have blocked “queue” as well, a tag that’s typically applied to posts that were placed in a queue and serves as a signal to followers that they may not be online at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G996J6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We understand that these adjustments will impact how users are able to access potentially sensitive content”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pjKRHP"&gt;Tumblr started having issues with Apple in 2018 when its app was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/17/18100156/tumblr-apple-app-store-ios-missing"&gt;unexpectedly removed from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104366/tumblr-ios-app-child-pornography-removed-from-app-store"&gt;child pornography was found on the platform&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode"&gt;Tumblr banned adult content&lt;/a&gt; altogether, a major shift from the platform's previously laissez-faire policies on NSFW posts. When Tumblr first implemented the change, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18124461/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-flagging-errors-algorithm-fail"&gt;innocent posts were frequently flagged for explicit content&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems like we’re seeing history repeat itself, but in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MubylY"&gt;Tumblr says it’s working on “additional features for a less restricted iOS app experience,” but there’s no information on when or how this will be implemented. Users on Android or on the browser-based version of the site remain unaffected by this change. It remains unclear why Tumblr banned so many tags or if Apple was involved in any way. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Family Hub smart fridge gets a colorful new look</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/djAz__zFIRocQs08BKJSwabcTTw=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70323927/Bespoke_Kitchen_White.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Family Hub smart fridge will now be part of its colorful, customizable Bespoke line.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d02BHq"&gt;The smart fridge has long been the butt of many IoT-related memes, but Samsung is betting that maybe all smart fridges needed to nab a spot in your kitchen was a more colorful look. The company will show off its newest iteration of the smart fridge at CES 2022 next week, and while it still can’t reliably determine what food you need and automatically order it so you don’t even have to think about shopping, it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be a pretty shade of blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qXFZ6"&gt;The Samsung Family Hub fridge is now a part of Samsung’s Bespoke appliance line. First introduced in 2021, the Bespoke range is a selection of modular, configurable appliances with a clean, modern look and customizable colors and finishes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iuHiyn09zS3C7lVf893GbSwT9_c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130240/CES2021_FamilyHub_RF9000.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Family Hub fridge is getting an upgrade to Samsung’s Bespoke line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="om8q57"&gt;The idea behind Bespoke is to allow households to create personalized decor for their kitchens and laundry rooms. The line includes refrigerators, ranges, dishwashers, microwaves, vacuums, washers and dryers in a choice of customized colors that can be mixed and matched. The fridge will have 12 color choices, including yellow, blue, pink, white, green, gray, and orange; two finishes, glass or metallic; and three styles, four-door flex and three- or four-door French door models, which come in full or counter depth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8Amxv"&gt;While the new style and color options are the main attraction, this iteration of the Family Hub does have a few new, tech-focused features. These include an updated, bezel-less design for the signature 21.5-inch touchscreen, which allows the tablet-interface to blend into the glass panel of the fridge, support for Samsung TV Plus in addition to the ability to mirror a Samsung TV on the tablet, and upgraded internal camera technology that can scan food labels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/79KG0pY6l4dQ_uu7f2W2VBXp3_k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130176/Bespoke_French_Door_Refrigerator.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jazz up your smart fridge in combination of 12 colors and two finishes. Glass finishes are available in sunrise yellow, clementine, morning blue, pink, charcoal, gray, and white glass. Metallic options are emerald green, navy, matte black, tuscan, and regular old stainless steel. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ESwkQG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22745664/samsung-smartthings-matter-support-products-galaxy"&gt;As previously announced&lt;/a&gt;, the new Family Hub fridge will have Samsung’s SmartThings Hub software built in. The smart home platform allows you to connect and control smart home devices such as thermostats, door locks, and cameras right from the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CnWv7"&gt;The SmartThings Hub software is not a replacement for SmartThings Hub hardware, which allows connections to Z-Wave and Zigbee devices. So, you will still need a separate physical hub to control those devices if they are part of your smart home setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Skhlw2"&gt;Samsung made no mention of Matter support for the smart fridge, although the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;new smart home interoperability protocol&lt;/a&gt; that the company helped found is not due to launch until mid-2022. Samsung spokesperson Liv Ren told me there will be more details on software enhancements for the Family Hub closer to the availability of the product in the US, which is slated for the first half of 2022. There are no details on pricing yet, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0TukkF"&gt;The Family Hub did receive a number of software updates this past year that added to existing features — which include widgets for calendars, sticky notes, shopping, and To Do lists. The most notable was the addition of Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, meaning the fridge can now be a giant Echo speaker — playing music and controlling devices with voice commands. Alexa sits alongside Samsung’s Bixby — giving you a choice of virtual assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nU1ibiqVguzDSgb02NFPEyeIcJM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130182/CES2021_SmartThings_Cooking_UI_2.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SmartThings Cooking app lets you input food preferences and can curate recipes and meal plans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SmartThings Cooking is an AI-powered cooking app available on the Family Hub Fridge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AY1OGt"&gt;While primarily a tablet slapped on the side of a fridge, the Family Hub does have some AI capabilities that take advantage of its placement. The three, built-in cameras can analyze the contents of your fridge (as long as the cameras can see the items) and offer up recipe and meal plan suggestions based on what ingredients you have. This uses the built-in SmartThings Cooking app, powered by the Whisk smart food platform owned by Samsung, which can also learn your food and dietary preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BzVYUi"&gt;Plus, with its somewhat limited knowledge of what’s in the fridge (it can only see items in the main compartment that aren’t hidden behind other things or stashed in Tupperware), the app can suggest missing ingredients for those recipes and automatically add them to your online grocery cart. SmartThings Cooking supports Walmart, Kroger, Instacart, and Amazon Fresh online shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8jPGl"&gt;Another updated feature is the ability to manage expiration dates: the fridge scans the food labels using the cameras and pops up an alert when your milk is about to go bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pku3lB"&gt;These features are still limited in their functionality, but this type of intelligence in our appliances does feel like a solid step toward the smart kitchen of the future. And while slapping on some stylish pastel shades to broaden the appeal of technology in the kitchen doesn’t add much to the utility, clearly Samsung is hoping it will convince a few more people to add it to their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D5dT6Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Series X is available at Best Buy right now </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-0jTxER0HjVZKJoyM3eP737ZoP8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70323820/vpavic_201103_4275_0182.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jqdX7h"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series X keeps coming and going, but the next-gen console remains tricky to get a hold of. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22823914/microsoft-xbox-series-x-console-restock-costco-availability"&gt;just saw it go up for sale at Costco&lt;/a&gt; this morning but it did not last long before it sold out. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22848656/ps5-holiday-restock-best-buy-playstation-5-console"&gt;after a PS5 drop earlier&lt;/a&gt;, another chance has sprung up at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI1ZxG"&gt;Right now, you can queue up for the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggdSQwET4b" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X from Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The retailer is just selling the console — no bundle required — and it is open to anyone, including those who are not Best Buy Totaltech subscribers. Just click the “Add to Cart” button and be patient while you are put in a digital line. As of right now, Best Buy appears to be releasing stock in waves, meaning you may have a second opportunity even if the console appears to be sold out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L3wZBm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox is letting more people test the very latest console features","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812230/xbox-skip-ahead-alpha-testing-sign-up-open-microsoft"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7YZCN6"&gt;Also, be ready for Best Buy’s site to ask you to verify your information and, if possible, make sure your account is logged in on another tab while you wait in line. Once you’ve added a console to your cart, you’ll be given about 10 minutes to complete your purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8NlDK"&gt;These consoles may need to be a late Christmas gift at this point, but, hopefully, you may have some good fortune with a local, in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sDcWMo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10909049"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CqIeky"&gt;Xbox accessories and games to go with your console&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDGCni"&gt;If you did manage to secure Microsoft’s next-gen console, there are a couple of accessories we recommend picking up alongside the Series X, whether you’re looking for a next-gen shooter, a wireless headset, or this year’s best racing title.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 is available right now at Best Buy  (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I9K7PJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:59PM ET, December 28th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Best Buy has sold out of PS5s for now, but &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22857179/microsoft-xbox-series-x-console-restock-availability-check"&gt;&lt;em&gt;it has started selling the Xbox Series X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uC7IsM"&gt;If you’re currently shopping for a PlayStation 5 console and have been recently striking out with restocks at Walmart, Costco, and other retailers, you have another chance right now at Best Buy. The electronics retailer just opened up a fresh batch of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcljGhDR4o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 consoles for $499.99&lt;/a&gt;. Best Buy is only selling the disc-based version, however, not the Digital Edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4DCfC"&gt;Be sure to log in and queue up on Best Buy’s site, with your billing and shipping info saved. Click the “Add to Cart” button on the right to jump into the waiting line, and stay calm. You don’t need to refresh the automated system, though, you may be prompted to verify your account when it’s your turn. After that, you should be able to see if there are any PS5 consoles available in your area. If you strike out, stay vigilant, the store tends to restock in waves so there may be more consoles in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1URumo"&gt;We are continuing to track restocks as they roll out at various retailers. Be sure to also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe to the &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for the latest tech and gadget savings we can find and deliver right to your inbox twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kRs6ae"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why the PS5 paywall may not pay off at Amazon, Walmart, or Best Buy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="xvWX9b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="82lPGd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UAvH7w"&gt;We’re wishing you all of the luck in getting a PS5 today. As usual, signing into your account ahead of the restock, and making sure that all of the pertinent shipping and payment info, can only help your chances of success. But generally, once you’re in the queue for a console, just hang tight and maybe cross those fingers that you actually get a console today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MWcsCA"&gt;Some must-have PS5 accessories and games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1BKh8"&gt;Whether you end up getting a PlayStation 5 today or not, it might not be a bad idea to stock up on some essentials that you may want to have on Day One with your console.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Costco members can order the Xbox Series X right now (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N2yvOx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:58PM ET, December 28th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Costco has sold out of consoles for now, but &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22857179/microsoft-xbox-series-x-console-restock-availability-check"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Buy is now offering them&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUzMqs"&gt;The Xbox Series X console has remained hard to come by, and with the holidays looming the window to get one in time is narrowing. Many retailers have turned to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"&gt;charging for the chance&lt;/a&gt; just to buy a console via subscription-based memberships, which is a game that Costco has been playing from the beginning. The warehouse retailer has gotten its fair share of console restocks, and today it has Microsoft’s flagship console available for its members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI1ZxG"&gt;You can order the &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-series-x-1tb-console-with-additional-controller.product.100691493.html"&gt;Xbox Series X from Costco&lt;/a&gt; right now (or &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-series-x-%E2%80%93-halo-infinite-limited-edition-bundle.product.100821614.html"&gt;the Halo Edition&lt;/a&gt;, if it’s available in your area), which is only sold as a bundle with an extra controller (if you’re signed in, then you can add it directly to your cart by clicking &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/OrderByItemsDisplayView?catalogId=10701&amp;amp;storeId=10301&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;krypto=AsPTBQRWKp4jSH6gFtKqg3xrRQicAEXbqVDBminWxLJK60ZbV2I4eYEGX9gvYtcpo%2FjiXzUmiJvE3aLeIBIt%2FRKylgQypTUVFv2l5xLMMme0QroSuU2wA1E00gqHxD4GtNIAf8JRN0nMogVRIpvrlw%3D%3D&amp;amp;ddkey=http%3AOrderByItemsAdd"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). You need a paid Costco membership to order this, which you can get &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/join-costco.html?redirectLogin=true"&gt;here at the retailer’s site&lt;/a&gt; for a minimum of $60 per year. While some video games and accessories can be purchased online from Costco by non-members at the cost of an additional fee, consoles are for members only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z86GFW"&gt;These restocks at Costco often sell out quickly, so if you don’t manage to get it this time around be sure to prep your account for success next time by saving your billing and shipping info into your account. Also, be sure to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;subscribe to our &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to get the latest tech deals from our team, direct to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alexa told a child to do potentially lethal ‘challenge’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mmE9AXJyBCLtzmpIJ6uvaTE3Mgk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70323607/cwelch_191016_3738_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VMnoaX"&gt;Amazon’s Alexa told a child to touch a penny to the exposed prongs of a phone charger plugged into the wall, according to one parent who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klivdahl/status/1475220450598924297?s=20"&gt;posted screenshots of their Alexa activity history&lt;/a&gt; showing the interaction (&lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/amazon-alexa-slammed-for-giving-lethal-challenge-to-10-year-old-girl/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The device seemingly pulled the idea for the challenge from an article describing it as dangerous, citing news reports about an alleged challenge trending on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4babCT"&gt;According to Kristin Livdahl’s screenshot, the Echo responded to “tell me a challenge to do” with “Here’s something I found on the web. According to ourcommunitynow.com: The challenge is simple: plug in a phone charger about halfway into a wall outlet, then touch a penny to the exposed prongs.” &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59810383"&gt;In a statement to the BBC&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon said: “As soon as we became aware of this error, we took swift action to fix it.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klivdahl/status/1475616003996459016?s=20"&gt;Livdahl tweeted yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that asking for a challenge was no longer working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T8ceVS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;OMFG My 10 year old just asked Alexa on our Echo for a challenge and this is what she said. &lt;a href="https://t.co/HgGgrLbdS8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HgGgrLbdS8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kristin Livdahl (@klivdahl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klivdahl/status/1475220450598924297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kh42SI"&gt;Amazon isn’t the only company to run into issues trying to parse the web for content. In October, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/soft/status/1449406390976409600"&gt;a user reported&lt;/a&gt; that Google displayed potentially dangerous advice in one of its featured snippets if you Googled “had a seizure now what” — the info it showed was from the section of a webpage describing what &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do when someone was having a seizure. At the time, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confirmed the user’s report, but it appears to have been fixed based on tests we did today (no snippet appears when Googling “had a seizure now what”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DozykA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Google search summary vs the actual page &lt;a href="https://t.co/OJxt1FrBqh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OJxt1FrBqh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ウィアブー リンデン (@soft) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/soft/status/1449406390976409600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OXtS70"&gt;Users have reported other similar problems, though, including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amyhoy/status/1445514300345307142/photo/1"&gt;one user who said&lt;/a&gt; Google gave results for orthostatic hyp&lt;strong&gt;o&lt;/strong&gt;tension when searching for orthostatic hyp&lt;strong&gt;er&lt;/strong&gt;tension, and another who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lilsinnsitive/status/1472629416853389316"&gt;posted a screenshot&lt;/a&gt; of Google displaying terrible advice for consoling someone who’s grieving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vUS4G"&gt;We’ve also seen warnings about dangerous behavior amplified to make the problem bigger than it originally was — earlier this month, some US school districts closed after self-perpetuating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840621/tiktok-december-17-school-threats-district-cancellations-alleged-shootings"&gt;reports about shooting threats being made on TikTok&lt;/a&gt;. It turned out that the social media firestorm was overwhelmingly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22841370/why-tiktok-school-shooting-warnings-went-viral-december-17"&gt;caused by people talking about threats&lt;/a&gt;, far more than any threats that may have existed. In the case of Alexa, an algorithm picked out the descriptive part of a warning and amplified it without the original context. While the parent was there to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klivdahl/status/1475609607724806150?s=20"&gt;immediately intervene&lt;/a&gt;, it’s easy to imagine a situation where that isn’t the case or where the answer shared by Alexa isn’t so obviously dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Hiogt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klivdahl/status/1475594121163194376?s=20"&gt;Livdahl tweets&lt;/a&gt; that she used the opportunity to “go through internet safety and not trusting things you read without research and verification” with her child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgTgnC"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately reply to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot Games will pay $100 million to settle discrimination lawsuit</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ahT0Rd"&gt;Riot Games has struck a &lt;a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/riot-settlement"&gt;$100 million settlement deal&lt;/a&gt; in a discrimination and harassment lawsuit brought by female employees. The &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Valorant &lt;/em&gt;publisher will pay at least $80 million to members of the settlement class and around $20 million in legal fees, and it will agree to workplace changes that include greater pay transparency and three years of third-party monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEwLmr"&gt;The settlement covers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18069714/league-of-legends-riot-games-sued-gender-discrimination"&gt;a 2018 class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed by current and former Riot employees in the wake of &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-the-culture-of-sexism-at-riot-games-1828165483"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; detailing systemic sexism and unfair treatment. The suit described an environment where male employees made derogatory sexual comments about female colleagues and passed them over for promotion, creating a company-wide “unwritten policy and practice of preferring men to women in the hiring, promotion, and compensation of its employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhfoyH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/2/20992317/riot-games-settlement-details-harassment-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;Riot agreed to&lt;/a&gt; a $10 million settlement in 2019, but the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) and Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) blocked the agreement, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-01-21/riot-games-gender-discrimination-settlement"&gt;saying women at the company&lt;/a&gt; could be entitled to up to $400 million. The &lt;a href="https://www.dfeh.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2021/12/RiotGamesPR12.27.21.pdf"&gt;DFEH endorsed&lt;/a&gt; the latest settlement in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kppglM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An earlier settlement would have provided $10 million&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYOWjW"&gt;According to the DFEH, the suit covers approximately 1,065 female employees and 1,300 female contractors at Riot. Women who worked for Riot in either capacity since November of 2014 may be eligible for damages if a court approves the settlement. In a letter &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/12/27/riot-discrimination-100-million-settlement/"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Riot leadership told employees that “the final details of the agreement came together quickly,” resulting in an unexpected end-of-year announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPOBI9"&gt;“This is a great day for the women of Riot Games — and for women at all video game and tech companies — who deserve a workplace that is free of harassment and discrimination,” said attorney Genie Harrison, who began representing the plaintiffs in 2020. “We appreciate Riot’s introspection and work since 2018 toward becoming a more diverse and inclusive company, its willingness to take responsibility for its past, and its commitment to fairness and equality in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQjDhV"&gt;The new Riot settlement comes shortly after a court stopped the DFEH from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834691/judge-denies-california-dfeh-block-activision-blizzard-eeoc-lawsuit-settlement"&gt;intervening in a settlement&lt;/a&gt; over similar gender discrimination claims at games company Activision Blizzard. It doesn’t cover a separate 2021 complaint alleging that Riot’s CEO Nicolo Laurent harassed a former employee — a claim that Riot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334483/riot-games-ceo-nicolo-laurent-harassment-discrimination-investigation-closed"&gt;denied in March&lt;/a&gt; after conducting an internal investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1hDNf"&gt;In a statement, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22856713/riot-games-lawsuit-gender-discrimination-settlement"&gt;Riot Games said&lt;/a&gt; it hoped the settlement “properly acknowledges those who had negative experiences at Riot and demonstrates our desire to lead by example in bringing more accountability and equality to the games industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Committed adult smokers who start vaping more likely to drop cigarettes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="e-cigarettes" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jI20HGmP67jVY5odQmKCt1eCGQM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70323421/acastro_190916_1777_vape_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VM7h9h"&gt;Adult smokers who say that they don’t plan to quit smoking but who start using e-cigarettes are more likely quit than those who don’t start vaping, according to a new study. People who say they’re not trying to quit often aren’t included in studies of the potential benefits of e-cigarettes for adult smokers, and the new data shows that the group should be considered during that type of analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhA9Y9"&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.40880?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=122821"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published Tuesday in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, researchers evaluated data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, which is run by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Participants were interviewed about their tobacco use four times between 2014 and 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ac7xOU"&gt;Of the study group, 1,600 people said in initial interviews that they didn’t use e-cigarettes and didn’t plan to ever quit smoking cigarettes. By the next set of interviews, around 6 percent of that group had stopped smoking traditional cigarettes. Participants who’d started using e-cigarettes daily during that time were much more likely to be in that 6 percent than participants who hadn’t — 28 percent of the group using e-cigarettes had stopped smoking cigarettes, compared to just under 6 percent of the group not using e-cigarettes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXhwFw"&gt;The relationship might be because smokers who start using e-cigarettes tend to shift toward planning to quit smoking, the authors suggest, a pattern seen in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460321003099?via%3Dihub"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; from the PATH Study and in other experiments. The new analysis didn’t untangle whether people’s decisions to quit came after they started smoking e-cigarettes, so it can’t pinpoint the cause of the change. The switch, though, is likely beneficial — some &lt;a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2020-11-18/e-cigs"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows e-cigarettes are less harmful than traditional cigarettes, even if they’re &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/5-truths-you-need-to-know-about-vaping"&gt;not harmless&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9e7NTo"&gt;The study was released while the FDA is still reviewing some e-cigarette related products, including those made by Juul. The agency has blown past its September deadline to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665333/fda-vaping-flavors-authorization-juul"&gt;evaluate applications&lt;/a&gt; from e-cigarette companies — after a yearlong period without enforcement, companies now need authorization before they can market their products. The only e-cigarettes the FDA has authorized so far are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723175/fda-first-vaping-authorization-vuse-tobacco-flavors"&gt;tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; from the RJ Reynolds Vapor Company. At the end of December, it had rejected &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HkAaRvI6xXZzhGhzeNMg9IYXeHOW-7TV-O5UJR3Zsoc/edit#gid=2126642116"&gt;260 applications&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgwfUr"&gt;The FDA says its focus is on figuring out whether a vaping or e-cigarette product has benefits to adult smokers that outweigh the risks to kids and teenagers, who started vaping in huge numbers in 2018 and tend to be attracted to flavored products. The new research indicates that smokers who say they don’t plan to quit should be included in those risk-benefit calculations, the study authors note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMULx3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
