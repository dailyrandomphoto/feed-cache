    <title>Boring Company proposes massive Vegas expansion following monorail bankruptcy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nhPd6FCcH4OBphWB_-7St7ML3eo=/169x0:1816x1098/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518938/Screen_Shot_2020_12_15_at_4.03.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c9w46l"&gt;Elon Musk’s tunneling venture, The Boring Company, is planning a massive &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173076/63996761.pdf"&gt;citywide expansion&lt;/a&gt; of the currently modest underground transportation system it’s building in Las Vegas. The startup now wants to build a 10-mile sub-surface “loop” that serves the famous Las Vegas Strip of casino hotels and reaches the city’s downtown area as well as McCarran International Airport, all with Tesla vehicles. The Boring Company also wants to build an additional loop that connects properties owned by Caesars Entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtyMuK"&gt;The proposed new tunnels would make it possible to go from the Las Vegas Convention Center to Mandalay Bay in just three minutes, as opposed to 30 minutes by surface roads during peak traffic hours, &lt;a href="https://www.lvloop.com/vegasloop"&gt;the company claims&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O55D4I"&gt;The plans, &lt;a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/the-strip/borings-vegas-loop-plans-reveal-2-separate-routes-envisioned-2218996/"&gt;first reported by the &lt;em&gt;Las Vegas Review-Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, were detailed in proposals submitted to Clark County officials on Monday. The Boring Company’s expansion push comes just days after the Las Vegas&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) finished &lt;a href="https://www.ktnv.com/news/lvcva-deal-complete-with-las-vegas-monorail"&gt;buying the Las Vegas Monorail&lt;/a&gt;, which filed for bankruptcy in September after shutting down in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vna4kh"&gt;Following the acquisition, the LVCVA killed a noncompete agreement that had previously kept The Boring Company from digging any tunnels that served the same areas reached by the monorail. The monorail is not expected to reopen until at least May 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HrukZu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Boring Company is still completing its first Tesla-powered people-mover in Las Vegas&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VJiQHF"&gt;The Boring Company is still working on making its first underground people-mover open to the public in Las Vegas, located underneath the Convention Center (which is owned by the LVCVA). While it was originally slated to open in January 2021 in time for the yearly Consumer Electronics Show, the trade show’s shift to a virtual event (and the pandemic in general) has muddied those plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4jD4Z"&gt;LVCVA president and CEO Steve Hill &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21257849/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-tunnel-finished-digging"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in May&lt;/a&gt; that they would likely wait until the next available trade show to open the so-called Convention Center Loop. On Tuesday, LVCVA senior vice president of communications Lori Nelson-Kraft confirmed that this is still the most likely plan, saying she’s “unsure at this time if we’ll open up the system prior to the first large show we have inside our building.” The Boring Company did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7lRWdy"&gt;The Boring Company plans to shuttle up to 4,000 passengers per hour through its tunnels using Tesla Model 3s, Model Xs, and a “tram” built on the Model 3 platform that can fit between 12 and 16 people, Hill told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;back in May. While the goal is for those cars to eventually operate autonomously, they will have drivers at the outset. Hill said that the people mover will evolve to following a “conduit” and sensors being laid in the tunnels before actually driving themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adW5sY"&gt;The LVCVA announced that first project with the Boring Company in 2019 and is paying Musk’s startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18636326/las-vegas-people-mover-lvcc-boring-company"&gt;$48.6 million&lt;/a&gt; to build the tunnels running under the convention center. Since it’s meant to be an amenity for convention-goers, Hill explained in May that he considered the full price tag of $52.5 million to be a sunk cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhkrti"&gt;But the expansion, if approved, will be funded differently. The Boring Company will pay for the cost of constructing the main tunnel of the new citywide loop, according &lt;a href="https://assets.simpleviewcms.com/simpleview/image/upload/v1/clients/lasvegas/2Posted_Agenda_Book_November_10_2020_BOD_7680b353-e24d-4e68-8668-7a5cd3afb018.pdf"&gt;to a presentation Hill gave in November&lt;/a&gt;, while casinos and other properties along the route that want a station will have to pay to have them built. The company will present its proposal in front of the Las Vegas City Council on Wednesday and before county officials in February. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s not just you, Google says Gmail is messed up right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q90TphPk8CdZVscZdQE7icK1gVA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518536/acastro_180424_1777_gmail_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vUAAel"&gt;Google says that a “significant subset” of Gmail users are running into errors with the service right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJZcLL"&gt;While users can access their inboxes, they may encounter “error messages, high latency, and/or other unexpected behavior,” the company wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=issue&amp;amp;sid=1&amp;amp;iid=a8b67908fadee664c68c240ff9f529ab"&gt;a message&lt;/a&gt; on its service status page. The errors come just a day after many Google properties, including Gmail, YouTube, and Google Docs, were hit with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173803/gmail-youtube-google-assistant-docs-down-outage"&gt;a widespread outage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOzper"&gt;Shortly before 6PM ET, Google said it expected to the resolve the issues “for all users in the near future.” Service had already been restored for some, Google wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fmTpt"&gt;Downdetector, which monitors reports of website issues, shows a spike of problems &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/gmail/"&gt;impacting Gmail&lt;/a&gt; starting around 3PM ET. Users have reported being unable to access their inboxes, while others have said they’re receiving bounceback messages when trying to email someone with a Gmail address. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ProtonMail/status/1338969496283963392"&gt;ProtonMail said&lt;/a&gt; that emails sent to Gmail users are “permanently bouncing,” returning error messages to the original sender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tk4htV"&gt;Stadia, Google’s game streaming service, was also having issues this afternoon, but it’s unclear if they were related. The company said a problem was “prohibiting some users from launching games.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08uyDb"&gt;Google now tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the issue with Stadia has been resolved and “users should be able to play games as usual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqNq69"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 15th, 5:55PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google said that it’s beginning to restore service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let the dulcet tones of Google’s Blob Opera ring in the holiday season with machine learning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QhAwsEmAxIMKpoyBDlELXptzE9A=/101x0:1682x1054/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518472/Screen_Shot_2020_12_15_at_2.57.43_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ir2cb9"&gt;Hark! The blobs sing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3VFWD"&gt;Or at least, they do in Google’s latest machine learning experiment, &lt;a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/blob-opera/AAHWrq360NcGbw?cp=e30."&gt;the awe-inspiring Blob Opera&lt;/a&gt;, which will see a chorus of four adorable, colorful blobs serenade you with spine-tingling operatic music. Drag a blob up or down, and you’ll change what pitch they sing in; drag them from side to side, and you’ll change the vowel sound. Each blob will also harmonize with the others, in what can only be described as magical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhOy91"&gt;The Blob Opera just sounds &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;, with soaring harmonies ringing out from each blob. Four actual opera singers — Christian Joel (tenor), Frederick Tong (bass), Joanna Gamble (mezzo‑soprano), and Olivia Doutney (soprano) — recorded 16 hours of singing (Ingunn Gyda Hrafnkelsdottir and John Holland-Avery also contributed), but it’s not their actual voices you’re hearing when the blobs sing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOvINJ"&gt;Rather, the team trained a machine learning model on those voice recordings. The blobs are singing what the algorithm “thinks” opera sounds like, based on what it learned through the training. An additional model works to enable the harmonizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P06BjM"&gt;Created by &lt;a href="https://david.li"&gt;David Li&lt;/a&gt; working in collaboration with Google’s Arts and Culture team, the Blob Opera isn’t just a cute toy — it’s a great example of how machine learning can be levered to create something new and unexpected out of existing data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUTjQ4"&gt;The machine learning-based nature of the opera is why the blobs are limited to vowel sounds instead of actual words, but the random noises still manage to approximate the gist of a true opera, in spirit if not lyrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JotRXs"&gt;But the best part of the Blob Opera isn’t just the lovely harmonies or adorable characters — it’s the “holiday surprise” that’s activated by clicking the Christmas tree icons, which will give you the option to let the blobs sing any number of popular Christmas carols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrb2cR"&gt;Joy to the world, indeed. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Surface Duo gets better TikTok support and availability outside the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hrg3xi3gfzvPDZjbGqBk-xV4hfQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518392/akrales_191002_3704_0376.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="igSwLe"&gt;Microsoft announced &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2020/12/15/the-year-ahead-for-surface-duo/"&gt;in a blog today&lt;/a&gt; that its dual screen phone, the Surface Duo, will be getting an “enhanced” TikTok app that takes advantage of its design. The company also announced the Duo will be available outside the US in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O169FZ"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;reviewed the Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt;, we liked the hardware of the device, but had concerns with its modified Android software. The Duo was buggy at release and didn’t feature many non-Microsoft apps that took advantage of the dual screen setup. The Surface Duo can run normal Android phone apps on either screen, but using the split-screen features Microsoft designed requires specific tailoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koHI8P"&gt;The group of apps that use Microsoft’s “postures” and multitasking features remains small, but TikTok is a major social media addition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e8DhKXvfdOYJVSv6qqJse-0t8NA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22172811/TikTok_SurfaceDuo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new TikTok experience on the Surface Duo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rbiNaO"&gt;The company says that TikTok will use both of the Duo’s screens, allowing you to watch the “For You” feed on one screen, while browsing hashtags and searching for videos on the other. Microsoft highlighted the Spotify and Kindle apps when the Duo launched, but TikTok is one of the biggest apps to add full support since then. (Microsoft itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21360130/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-bid-rejection-bytedance"&gt;attempted to purchase the company from ByteDance&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALJOne"&gt;In addition to the new app, Microsoft says the Surface Duo will be available for purchase in Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom in early 2021. The company says they’ll have more to share “at the beginning of 2021,” so expect a more specific release date or maybe even an update on the Duo’s larger sibling, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20889000/microsoft-surface-neo-windows-10x-hands-on-features-price-photos-release-date"&gt;the Surface Neo&lt;/a&gt;, in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgDrwC"&gt;The “enhanced” TikTok app should be available now for Duo owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQeo1k"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oculus is shipping the Quest 2 Elite Strap again and extending its warranty after quality issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oculus Quest 2 with Elite Strap" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xGWbFLwWGPDaqb5Isk-A41AGzmI=/320x0:3776x2304/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518263/Quest_2_with_Elite_Strap_accessory.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Oculus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v0SexV"&gt;Oculus is resuming shipments of its Quest 2 Elite Strap accessory and extending the warranty after reports of defective straps. &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-pauses-quest-2-elite-strap-quality-reports/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; reported earlier&lt;/a&gt;, the Facebook-owned virtual reality company paused Elite Strap shipments in November, saying a small number of users had reported them snapping after use. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-elite-strap-sales-resume-after-initial-quality-control-issues?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+androidcentral+%28Android+Central%29"&gt;it tells &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it’s pinpointed the issue as a “processing inconsistency with some early units,” and the product is going back on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcpNmk"&gt;Oculus maintains that the Elite Strap problems affect a “very small percentage” of customers. But it’s increasing the standard one-year warranty to a two-year period, during which Oculus will replace broken straps free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F4CZWe"&gt;The $49 Elite Strap (and a $129 version with an external battery and carrying case) replaces the standard cloth strap of the Oculus Quest 2 VR headset. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21432628/oculus-quest-2-accessories-headstrap-usbc-fit-pack-price"&gt;a major upgrade&lt;/a&gt; that makes the $299 Quest 2 far more comfortable, and although it’s still not available for purchase through the Oculus store or Amazon, it’s apparently a viable option once again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Siri can now play animal sounds and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_IPFpP_OAf3SYAARwGpaSOoYYFY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518259/acastro_180510_1777_siri_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nH9583"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22163752/ios-14-3-proraw-airpods-max-fitness-plus-available-now-download"&gt;yesterday’s release of iOS 14.3&lt;/a&gt;, Siri got a new trick: the ability to play real-world sound samples on command. Ask “Hey Siri, what does _____ sound like?” and it will start playing the sound for you. If you ask on an iPhone or iPad, it will show you a picture as well. Google Assistant has been able to do this for a few years now, but now it’s available for the iPhone, iPad, and HomePod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g02Lar"&gt;Apple hasn’t announced how many sounds it’s added, but it’s been able to handle most of the animals I asked about (except for some obscure ones that I’m not sure have a real distinctive noise, like an anteater). At the moment, it seems like the sounds are limited to animals, vehicles, and musical instruments. I tried asking for some nature-y sounds, such as thunder or a waterfall, and Siri didn’t play anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yPvTa"&gt;This feature is probably best heard, rather than read about, so I made a video in which I ask Siri to play different sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q1WYBe"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Siri Sounds|99868" data-volume-uuid="05c0ff26a" data-volume-id="99868" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-525" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I asked Siri what several things and animals sound like. (Warning: this may activate any iOS devices if they have “Hey Siri” turned on.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sm5Q31"&gt;Interestingly, it’s got samples for different breeds of dog, so you can hear what a mastiff sounds like compared to a Shih Tzu. There are obviously quite a few things that Siri doesn’t have sound samples for, and in some cases (like when I asked what humans sound like), it doesn’t even try. As you can tell from the end of the video, Siri is Siri — technical imperfections and all. (At one point, Siri started answering the question, stopped, said it was sorry, and restarted its answer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y1MlQw"&gt;I know I’m going to be asking Siri for random sounds every now and then, trying to figure out what it has sounds for and what it doesn’t. If you’re not as easily amused as I am, the feature could also be useful if you have kids, who I’ve heard are always asking what things sound like. It’s also useful for when someone in your household says that foxes sound like people screaming, and you just have to know if they’re right. (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/zBpZTo1dlPM?t=24"&gt;Here’s a YouTube link&lt;/a&gt; so you can see as well as hear it.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An IV medication drip." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DpET60dbR66PsTaaoxoX9Xvw1P8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518215/HH_IV_3.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QbQnMB"&gt;The majority of the doses of COVID-19 antibody drugs sent to states have not been used, Moncef Slaoui, head of Operation Warp Speed, the US government’s coronavirus vaccine effort, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/1338904444772225025"&gt;told CNBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Around 65,000 doses of the drugs, which can help protect people at high risk of severe COVID-19 from developing serious cases of the disease, go out each week. Only 5 to 20 percent end up going to patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikfYJf"&gt;It’s disappointing, Slaoui told CNBC&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; because the drugs could help keep COVID-19 patients out of the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKTGGX"&gt;Doses are going unused because administering them is complicated. Ongoing surges in COVID-19 cases across the country mean states don’t have the resources to sort through those logistics. The Utah Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575207/antibody-treatment-distribution-limited-dose-coronavirus-treatment"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in November that the state had to focus on keeping hospitals afloat, and couldn’t devote the time to organizing distribution of the antibody drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZIvmGn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a giant failure that we need to remedy.&lt;br&gt;It is also a failure that many predicted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have the tools now to end suffering from covid. We just need to find a way to get them to patients. &lt;a href="https://t.co/XZULmqpSam"&gt;https://t.co/XZULmqpSam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Walid Gellad, MD MPH (@walidgellad) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/walidgellad/status/1338906649466167297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QPv0eB"&gt;Despite the thousands of unused doses, the antibody drugs, made by the pharmaceutical companies Regeneron and Eli Lilly, are in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575207/antibody-treatment-distribution-limited-dose-coronavirus-treatment"&gt;limited supply&lt;/a&gt;. Each state gets a set amount each week based on the number of COVID-19 cases it’s reporting each week. Then, the state has to decide how to divvy it up between hospitals. It’s not a readily available resource, so doctors aren’t relying on it as a standard treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQ45hS"&gt;Another challenge is that the antibody drugs have to be given to patients soon after they contract COVID-19. Timing is everything. If patients aren’t getting tested or don’t get test results back within a short window after they fall ill, they can’t benefit from the drug. Even if they do get diagnosed with COVID-19 quickly at a testing site, they may not start to feel seriously ill or call a doctor until they’re outside that window. Without that contact, they might not know about or be offered the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJAYtN"&gt;In addition, the drug has to be given intravenously — so patients who are in the early, most contagious stages of their disease have to go to a hospital or outpatient facility where they will interact with nurses and doctors. States and health care organizations have to set up safe places for patients to receive the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12u07f"&gt;Slaoui told CNBC that Operation Warp Speed may be able to help states work through those logistics. But for now, they’re still&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a barrier stopping thousands from receiving treatment for COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will resume political ads just for Georgia’s Senate runoff election</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wtg78bP9CC-Pfp2_WEBmsVcLBo8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518179/mdoying_180118_2249_facebook_0581_1stills.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DHcdwL"&gt;Facebook on Tuesday said it would make an exception to its political ad ban to let campaigns and other political organizations run advertising for the upcoming Georgia runoff elections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXrTNX"&gt;The Senate races, which will determine which US political party controls that chamber of Congress under President-elect Joe Biden, take place on January 5th. Facebook says advertisers authorized to run ads on social issues, elections, or politics will be allowed to run those ads starting tomorrow, December 16th at 12PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgZ1dY"&gt;Facebook initially faced pushback over the political ad ban and its implications for races as vital as the Georgia runoffs. Democratic campaign officials &lt;a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/11/10/social-media-ad-ban-hampers-georgia-senate-runoff-efforts/"&gt;criticized the platform&lt;/a&gt; for hampering its efforts to fight misinformation about the election and voting fraud, while Republicans expressed concern that a lack of advertising would leave them flat-footed in efforts to register voters and combat their own brand of online misinformation &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/06/georgia-republican-election-official-says-trumps-false-voter-fraud-claims-undermine-democracy.html"&gt;encouraging Republicans to abstain from voting in protest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="liwYqd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We agree that our ad tools are an important way for people to get information about these elections.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iq8hj2"&gt;“In recent weeks we’ve heard feedback from experts and advertisers across the political spectrum about the importance of expressing voice and using our tools to reach voters ahead of Georgia’s runoff elections,” writes Facebook product manager Sarah Schiff, in a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/update-on-the-georgia-runoff-elections/"&gt;blog post announcing the exemption&lt;/a&gt;. “We agree that our ad tools are an important way for people to get information about these elections. So we have developed a process to allow advertisers to run ads with the purpose of reaching voters in Georgia about Georgia’s runoff elections.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCa7AE"&gt;Facebook’s ad ban, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21506798/facebook-ban-political-ads-after-us-presidential-election-trump-biden-results-notification"&gt;announced back in October&lt;/a&gt;, is only a temporary measure the social media giant implemented “to reduce opportunities for confusion or abuse.” It was a prescient approach, given how President Donald Trump has spent nearly every day since the election spreading false or misleading information about the results of the race. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560969/facebook-political-ad-ban-extended-trump-2020-election-concede-misinformation"&gt;said last month&lt;/a&gt; after Election Day it would extend the ban for about a month, in response to Trump’s refusal to concede and rampant online misinformation from the president, right-wing media, and other conservative sources about unsubstantiated election fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3qHS1"&gt;It’s not clear how long Facebook intends to keep the ad ban in place, as it’s been more than a month since its last extension. But the company says it is taking measures so that its exemption for the runoff elections doesn’t result in any unintended consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLAMZH"&gt;For instance, Facebook says it will outright reject any ads targeting locations outside Georgia, or that try to address other political issues outside the scope of the runoff races. It’s also keeping in place its ban on ads with any claims or other content that includes information debunked by its partner fact-checkers, or that “delegitimizes” the races. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj89g1"&gt;Facebook also plans to label any content that “tries to delegitimize voting in these elections” with false claims about fraud and other conspiratorial misinformation. “And, if someone goes to share the content we have labeled, they will first see a message directing them to our Voting Information Center, which provides reliable election information,” says Schiff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5siDc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is shutting down its Periscope apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YaJNggjL84ZSz6OmaLtqQbBxodE=/110x0:1291x787/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68517908/0_rNGSqodt790lkpl_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ANRjjQ"&gt;Twitter has &lt;a href="https://periscope.medium.com/farewell-periscope-164db2742b7c"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be shutting down Periscope as a service, with the company set to discontinue the Periscope applications by March 2021. Twitter will, however, continue to offer live video streaming through its integrated Twitter Live feature within the main Twitter app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLDD1o"&gt;“The Periscope app is in an unsustainable maintenance-mode state, and has been for a while,” the company explained in a blog post. “Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen declining usage and know that the cost to support the app will only continue to go up over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sdkWY"&gt;While Periscope won’t be fully shut down until March, the company is already blocking any new account signups starting in the latest update to the apps, which is rolling out today. Users will have the chance to download an archive of both their Periscope videos and their data before the app is shuttered next year. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.periscope.tv/periscopeco"&gt;the Periscope website&lt;/a&gt; will remain active to serve as a “read-only archive of public broadcasts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cI4nDm"&gt;Periscope will also be “relaxing our requirements” for users to apply to become “&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/super-broadcaster"&gt;Super Broadcasters&lt;/a&gt;,” the company’s term for select users who are given the opportunity to cash out tips given to them by followers. Broadcasters will have until April 30th, 2021, to finish cashing out their tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCGgtT"&gt;Twitter bought Periscope back in March 2015 before the service even launched, back in the heyday of live broadcasting (arguably started by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/9/8164893/meerkat-live-video-streaming-twitter-yevvo-periscope"&gt;Meerkat&lt;/a&gt;, a once-viral streaming service that has since pivoted over to developing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/28/13081014/meerkat-houseparty-video-app"&gt;Houseparty&lt;/a&gt;). Periscope would launch later that month, with all of the force of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/26/8293353/periscope-live-streaming-twitter-meerkat"&gt;Twitter’s considerable social presence&lt;/a&gt; behind it. But for all of Periscope’s popularity at the time, it wasn’t a staying force, in the same way that other live streaming services — like the juggernaut of Twitch — would become. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QK5t28"&gt;Twitter would go on to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/14/13942840/twitter-live-video-periscope-integration"&gt;integrate live video into the main Twitter app&lt;/a&gt; in December 2016, in a feature that was described as being “powered by Periscope.” According to Twitter, the company has since moved “most of the core capabilities of Periscope” into Twitter Live, with the shuttering of Periscope as a separate service allowing it to better focus on further building out that live streaming functionality in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest OBS update includes support for stripping out audio from VODs on Twitch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mjo6ddAIakzjiZkBOFa8SBDwlas=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68517861/acastro_200410_1777_OBS_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hmLqEQ"&gt;The new Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) update is out, and as per usual it includes a bunch of changes and fixes that will make your streaming life just a little bit better. The biggest change in this version of OBS is support for the feature that Twitch debuted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495243/twitch-soundtrack-streaming-music-soundcloud-distrokid-facebook-gaming"&gt;Twitch Soundtrack&lt;/a&gt; — the ability to play music in a second track while you’re streaming to Twitch, so that it can be stripped out of your recorded broadcast, or VOD (video on demand). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i4i2KP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This release adds a second audio track when streaming to Twitch which will be saved to the VOD instead of the stream audio. You can enable this feature in Output settings when streaming to Twitch. Special thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Twitch&lt;/a&gt; for assisting during the development of this feature!&lt;/p&gt;— OBS (@OBSProject) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OBSProject/status/1338651935356973057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8HxOQv"&gt;For the uninitiated: it’s normal to play music in the background of live streams, but issues around copyright mean that it can be dangerous. Twitch has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562372/twitch-soundtrack-riaa-music-youtube"&gt;engaged in an extended battle with the music industry&lt;/a&gt; because streamers habitually play copyrighted music on-stream that they don’t have the rights to; it came to a head earlier this year, when streamers were flooded with copyright takedown requests from the music industry. Those requests were based on copyrighted music found in clips from streams and full recorded broadcasts — which is what Twitch Soundtrack, and by extension this feature, are meant to solve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csL5Bz"&gt;OBS pointed out that Twitch helped with the development of the feature, which is interesting because the company already has Soundtrack. I can only imagine it means that this is the latest front in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562372/twitch-soundtrack-riaa-music-youtube"&gt;Twitch’s fight with the music industry&lt;/a&gt; — because if streamers get used to stripping music from their VODs as a general practice, the problem of people broadcasting copyrighted music on Twitch might eventually solve itself. Though, personally, I believe that’s wishful thinking. Either way, OBS implementing the feature means that more streamers will use it.&lt;/p&gt;
