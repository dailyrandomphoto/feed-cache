    <title>Microsoft to reveal its next generation of Windows on June 24th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-jrtbXMucjY78phoBwkPDHxA75w=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377629/RWF5uB.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yzcD95"&gt;Microsoft is planning to detail its “next generation of Windows” at an event later this month. The software giant has started sending invites to media for a Windows event on June 24th. Both Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and chief product officer Panos Panay will be presenting &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fevent" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at the Windows event&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft’s Windows event will start at 11AM ET / 8AM PT on June 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92bDwc"&gt;The invite comes just a week after Nadella &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453222/microsoft-windows-next-generation-announcement-sun-valley-build-2021-keynote"&gt;teased a “next generation of Windows” announcement&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is expected to detail its next significant changes to Windows, and they will likely include a number of visual enhancements. We’re expecting to see some significant UI changes to Windows under something codenamed “Sun Valley.” Microsoft’s event invite even appears to tease a new Windows logo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U712g6TA9t0NHxXYidE5Reo_Qcc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554963/image001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Windows invite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Pn6KYs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442421/microsoft-windows-10-x-canceled-official"&gt;Microsoft confirmed last month&lt;/a&gt; that Windows 10X, its OS originally built for dual-screen devices, will no longer ship. The company is now rolling the visual elements of Windows 10X into the main version of Windows 10 instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HedK09"&gt;A lot of the visual work has already started, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313037/microsoft-windows-10-new-system-icons-ui-overhaul-sun-valley"&gt;new system icons&lt;/a&gt;, File Explorer improvements, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422553/microsoft-windows-95-era-icons-removal-windows-10-update-sun-valley"&gt;end of Windows 95-era icons&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is also focusing on improving the basic foundations of Windows, with fixes for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407995/microsoft-windows-apps-rearranging-sleep-resume-fix-directx-12"&gt;rearranging apps issue&lt;/a&gt; on multiple monitors, the addition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336240/microsoft-windows-10-auto-hdr-pc-gaming-directx-11-12"&gt;Xbox Auto HDR feature&lt;/a&gt;, and improvements to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410088/microsoft-windows-10-bluetooth-aac-support-update"&gt;Bluetooth audio support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShBLeO"&gt;Nadella has also promised to unlock a better economy for developers and creators within Windows itself, so we’ll likely get a closer look at the store changes coming to Windows. Microsoft has been working on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393655/microsoft-windows-app-store-overhaul-apps-games-rumor"&gt;new app store for Windows&lt;/a&gt; in recent months, and rumors have suggested Microsoft will open its store up to all apps and rival payment platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n65598"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering Microsoft’s Windows event on June 24th, so stay tuned for all the latest news.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eufy’s new battery-powered security cameras have local storage and don’t require a hub</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FPfOAAVD9Azh3Sf-diS0siLCk6o=/0x667:4000x3334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377517/SoloCam_E40.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pHAhQR"&gt;Eufy, the Anker-owned smart home brand, is announcing a new SoloCam line of battery-powered security cameras that have local storage and are designed to operate without connecting to a separate hub. The new lineup will include two “Essential” (standard) cameras, two spotlight cameras, and one solar-powered camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugyDWf"&gt;The standard and spotlight SoloCams will be offered in 1080p or 2K resolution models, and Eufy says that you can get four months of battery on a single charge. All of the cameras also offer 8GB of local storage, which Eufy estimates should hold at least two months of video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVOMwd"&gt;You’ll be able to preorder all of the models of the SoloCam on Wednesday, but they’ll be shipping out at different times over the next couple months. Here are the availability dates and pricing for each of the cameras, as shared by Eufy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ntDIZY"&gt;SoloCam 1080p Essential (the E20): out in mid-June for $99.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O5sekj"&gt;SoloCam 2K Essential (the E40): out in late June for $129.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="knTlIw"&gt;SoloCam 1080p Spotlight (the L20): available via “online channels” in mid-July for $149.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="94Cp05"&gt;SoloCam 2K Spotlight (the L40): available via “retailer partners” in late July for $169.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uK4C2G"&gt;SoloCam Solar (the S40): available in mid-August for $199.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Agadab"&gt;Eufy is launching the cameras following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440298/eufy-privacy-glitch-server-error-camera-feed-exposed"&gt;a security incident in May&lt;/a&gt; that let some users of the company’s home security cameras see video from other users’ homes. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444164/eufy-security-camera-glitch-privacy-feed-exposed-statement-details"&gt;In an apology&lt;/a&gt;, Eufy said that the issue happened during a software update and that 712 people were affected.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KpYNgs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s Anker’s apology after 712 Eufy customers had camera feeds exposed to strangers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444164/eufy-security-camera-glitch-privacy-feed-exposed-statement-details"},{"title":"Server glitch allowed Eufy owners to see through other homes’ cameras ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440298/eufy-privacy-glitch-server-error-camera-feed-exposed"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>PS4 and PS5 gaming subscriptions are up to 27 percent off today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mmGoFseDYItFrufha4WfcbTIDCA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377461/vpavic_4278_20201030_0247.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qCY2YS"&gt;Deals from the last week or so have been especially kind to gamers who have a PS4 or PS5. Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/days-of-play/"&gt;Days of Play sale event&lt;/a&gt; has discounted many games, and today there are price cuts on subscriptions that will help you get more enjoyment out of your console. At Newegg, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fsony-12-months%2Fp%2FN82E16832886006" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a one-year subscription to PlayStation Plus is $44&lt;/a&gt;, down from Sony’s usual $60 price. It’s just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Days-Digital/dp/B095QN8KH1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one dollar more at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, if you’d prefer to shop there. This service will allow you to play online multiplayer games, and it’ll make you eligible to download some complimentary games every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVQlEv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aTf841"&gt;Another useful service that’s more affordable today is PlayStation Now, which is effectively Sony’s take on Xbox Game Pass. It lets you download some of the games in its library, while it resorts to cloud game streaming for others. That service is usually $60, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Now-Month-Days-Digital/dp/B095QK3PQF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but Amazon has it available for $45&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most appealing features of PS Now is that you can play on a PlayStation console, &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-now/ps-now-on-pc/"&gt;as well as on PC via an app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n5KpnW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10530177"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VJ7khG"&gt;Amazon has knocked $100 off the cost of Insignia’s 43-inch 4K TV that has Fire TV hardware built in. Normally $320, it’s $220, but you have to be a Prime member to get this deal. This is likely just a tease of more deals to come during Prime Day 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;which was just confirmed this morning to be happening on Monday, June 21st and Tuesday, June 22nd&lt;/a&gt;. If you want more deals, be sure to join us for in-depth deal coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DwgRQc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10530201"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="akx2JC"&gt;If you have a Roku streaming device and wish that the remote had more buttons to control your TV’s base features as well as your entertainment center, you should snag this handy gadget from Sideclick. It’s a programmable remote that snaps onto your remote and adds the ability to turn on your TV, switch inputs, adjust the volume and channels, and to control things like a Blu-ray player, soundbar, and more. It usually costs $30, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742303278719026640#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has it for $20&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XjlCyB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10530228"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Olympics’ vision of gaming looks very different from the biggest esports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AD2GxSsl8tffuyy42IvEF-axYBs=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377455/i1UKGEKECdhvMz.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Gran Turismo Sport&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0g7VEo"&gt;The Olympics is currently hosting its first-ever virtual sporting event series, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396751/olympic-virtual-series-tokyo-gran-turismo"&gt;the Olympic Virtual Series&lt;/a&gt;, where competitors can play in virtual versions of five different physical sports: motorsport, cycling, baseball, sailing, and rowing. The cycling competition, for example, takes place in Zwift, which lets you pair your bike and a bike trainer with your computer, phone, or tablet. The motorsport competition takes place entirely inside &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo Sport&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QNMad"&gt;You might notice that none of those are games you might typically associate with esports, such as &lt;em&gt;Overwatch, &lt;/em&gt;which has previously hosted &lt;a href="https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/overwatch-world-cup"&gt;World Cup-style tournaments&lt;/a&gt; where players represented their countries. At least for now, though, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is intentionally choosing to host competitions in virtual versions of physical sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GzHxmt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We remain a sport-based and sport-focused organization”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kriB07"&gt;“I think it’s fair to say that we remain a sport-based and sport-focused organization,” the IOC’s sport director, Kit McConnell, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview. “We’re looking to keep the Olympic Virtual Series focused around sport titles.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSY747"&gt;While that might sound like the IOC has shut the door on keeping esports out of the Olympics, the Olympics still plans to stay in touch with the esports community, especially since more athletes are playing video games. “We don’t think there’s any mutual exclusivity between the esport community and the traditional sport community,” McConnell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRgMvG"&gt;The IOC also wants to find ways to help support esports players similarly to how it supports athletes in traditional sports. “As elite esports and gaming competitors are relatively new to the highly competitive environment, they have more limited access to resources than athletes in traditional sports,” the IOC says in its &lt;a href="https://stillmed.olympics.com/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/IOC/What-We-Do/Olympic-agenda/Olympic-Agenda-2020-5-15-recommendations.pdf"&gt;latest strategic roadmap&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/olympic-agenda-2020-plus-5"&gt;released in March&lt;/a&gt;. “The IOC recognises these challenges and aims to adapt various existing tools and resources to support them in different fields such as gender equality, mental and physical health, competition integrity and career transition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v9e5ys"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 2028 Olympics could have a virtual version of a physical sport&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cDS2gM"&gt;And the IOC sees virtual sports continuing to play a growing role in the Olympics. While the Olympic Virtual Series isn’t a medalled event, there is a possibility that a virtual representation of a physical sport could become one as early as the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Games, according to that roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r3lDGr"&gt;To be clear, the actual language in the roadmap does not make that a sure bet. The roadmap has a “recommendation” to “consider the addition of physical virtual sports in the Olympic Programme in cooperation with the respective International Federations.” But if that became a reality, you could expect to see it take a similar form to what’s being done for the cycling and rowing events for the Olympic Virtual Series, McConnell said. (Of the five sports in the Olympic Virtual Series, only those two require players to compete on physical hardware.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdhK5S"&gt;So while we may not see a &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; team adorned in Olympic gold medals anytime soon, virtual sports might actually become an official Olympic event someday. And the Olympic Virtual Series could be a preview of what that may look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CSGmmh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Gran Turismo will be featured in an Olympic competition this year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396751/olympic-virtual-series-tokyo-gran-turismo"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>An ongoing Apple Card outage may keep you from making payments or managing your card</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q4n0npO9Hc_laGzjqgNIRTMSivI=/201x0:2349x1432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377427/Screen_Shot_2019_03_26_at_1.49.46_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QPBOUA"&gt;The Apple Card is experiencing an outage today that may affect your ability to make payments, manage your card, and see recent transactions, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupport%2Fsystemstatus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F2%2F22465000%2Fapple-card-outage-cant-make-payments-recent-transactions" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s status page&lt;/a&gt;. Interruption in service appears to have started at 6:17AM PT today and is still ongoing over two hours later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2J5kgD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18277417/apple-pay-credit-card-announcement-goldman-sachs-event-2019"&gt;Apple’s credit card solution&lt;/a&gt; is managed almost entirely through the built-in wallet app in iOS, where users can pay off their credit card bill, see recent transactions, and make payments through Apple Pay. Apple says that all users are affected by today’s outage, though it’s not clear if every user will experience all of the possible issues the company has reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCZcu2"&gt;We’ve reached out to Apple for more information and will update if we learn more or the outage ends.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Donald Trump has shut down his blog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - May 18, 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KaYI5CnWgvHcswUppm6f6yFElx8=/0x196:4729x3349/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377268/1318749429.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IYyiLS"&gt;Former President Donald Trump’s blogging days are officially over. On Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/02/trump-blog-page-shuts-down-for-good.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Trump’s blog has shut down less than a month after its launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ee4l9r"&gt;The blog, “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump,” launched May 4th as a substitute messaging platform for the former president after he was banned from Facebook and Twitter earlier this year. But as of Wednesday, the blog had been completely removed from Trump’s website. Jason Miller, senior aide to Trump, confirmed to CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Wednesday that the site “will not be returning.” The old blog posts are now archived as press releases in a separate section of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="puBaBy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The site ‘will not be returning’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GP9Sym"&gt;Trump was banned from Facebook and Twitter in January after a deadly right-wing riot broke out at the US Capitol as lawmakers were set to vote to certify Joe Biden as president. Shortly after the ban, Trump announced that he would be launching his own competing social media platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDVIHB"&gt;When the blog launched last month, Miller tweeted that the “website is a great resource to find” Trump’s latest statements, but that it wasn’t his long-promised “social media platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1l1r9"&gt;“We’ll have information coming on that front in the near future,” Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iSuJT"&gt;As of Wednesday, Trump’s office had no new details related to the platform. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-considers-contenders-to-be-his-new-social-media-outlet-after-big-tech-crackdown-11621013567"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Trump has engaged in talks with platforms like CloutHub and FreeSpace to become his new favored messaging platform. The &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;said that Trump isn’t looking for equity in the new company, but what could be a licensing fee if he decides to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbLPmc"&gt;Much of Trump’s success can be attributed to his social media following. But his blog struggled to find the audience his Twitter feed did. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trumps-blog-isnt-lighting-internet-rcna890"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the blog gained only 212,000 total engagements, a much lower engagement rate than the former president’s tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTbcJJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8WhEG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei teases its upcoming P50 flagship phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Huawei P50" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wwJ9hdrUkEV_R4Nm77RuwLEJxBs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377115/huaweip50.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behold, the P50’s mammoth-sized camera array&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lXhnzs"&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22227756"&gt;Huawei’s HarmonyOS&lt;/a&gt; livestream, the company provided a first look at its upcoming P50 series phone. Few specs were given, and it didn’t talk pricing or tease a release date, but the sizzle reel did reveal a close-up look at its interesting camera array. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPYJGs"&gt;Four camera lenses are visible, along with two flashes. It’s tough to say exactly what we’ll be getting with this phone in terms of megapixel count and sensor size; the photo below confirms that Huawei is working alongside Leica with its optics. We’ll have to wait to see if Huawei improved on its periscope telephoto lenses that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21444946/huawei-p40-pro-plus-vs-iphone-pixel-10x-zoom-camera"&gt;my colleague Sam Byford saw great results with on the P40 Pro Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Huawei P50" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z2YxM8rkri-ytMpf8ftE2x6ax28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554597/huaweip50lens.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The teaser hinted at Huawei’s continued camera partnership with Leica.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eDsTGF"&gt;The company claims it will “lift mobile photography to a new level.” Given that the size of the camera bump seems to have increased compared to the P40 Pro Plus (which we deemed “the smartphone zoom king”) it seems reasonable that Huawei might have crammed some even larger sensors and lenses in the P50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zmz3VF"&gt;You can see the tease time-stamped in the YouTube video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="04bL1K"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y2101ics8jc?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=7039&amp;amp;start=7039" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9UadeN"&gt;As for the rest of the phone, all we have to go on so far is what Huawei executive Richard Yu said during the livestream: that it will have a “lightweight design” and an “iconic” design language. The P50 will likely ship with Huawei’s new HarmonyOS operating system built in, but it didn’t confirm it in video (or even show the display powered on, for that matter). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvZbXc"&gt;As for when it might release, the company said that it is “trying to figure out how to make this great product available to you.” That reads to me as Huawei — like all tech companies right now — dealing with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363232/global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-pandemic-consoles-cpus-graphics-cards-cars"&gt;impacts of a global semiconductor shortage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21360598/huawei-chips-us-sanctions-trump-china-privacy-smartphone"&gt;US sanctions placed on the company have slowed its production of in-house parts&lt;/a&gt;, which might also be causing supply strains around its Kirin processors. To that end, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463666/huawei-matepad-pro-harmonyos-tablet-features-specs"&gt;the MatePad Pro tablet&lt;/a&gt; it announced today has a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor instead of one of Huawei’s own processors.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei announces HarmonyOS update for its smartphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bpl6v5xN7q1wNLOHD-XmJNtn_gM=/90x0:1038x632/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377091/u970l2SYwX.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Huawei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="96iVZo"&gt;Huawei has announced that its HarmonyOS operating system is coming to its smartphones via a forthcoming update. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/y2101ics8jc?t=6792"&gt;Huawei’s consumer business CEO Richard Yu says&lt;/a&gt; the company is updating around 100 of its devices globally to the new operating system, which also includes tablets like the MatePad Pro. In theory, it’s a big change from its previous phones, which have run the open-source version of Android with Huawei’s own services replacing the Google software it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension"&gt;been unable to include&lt;/a&gt; on new devices as a result of US sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YFibo"&gt;HarmonyOS will initially come to recent flagships like the Mate 40, P40, and Mate 30 series, before releasing on more devices later in the year. Older phones like the Mate 9, Mate 10, P20, and P10 will receive the update in the first half of next year, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZLvmRm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The update is coming to recent flagships as well as older models&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7h0hNo"&gt;The company advertises that HarmonyOS allows its phones to offer more seamless connectivity across different devices, including easier pairing with compatible headphones and speakers via a drag-and-drop interface. There’s also improved support for homescreen widgets, Huawei says, which have a similar look to what we saw with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451018/ios-ipados-14-review-iphone-ipad-features-widgets-app-library-scribble"&gt;iOS 14 last year&lt;/a&gt;. The operating system is also said to be better at returning to previously opened apps without losing your place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXFO41"&gt;The Chinese tech giant first announced HarmonyOS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798251/huawei-harmonyos-hongmengos-smartphones-internet-of-things-operating-system-android"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and the first device announced with the operating system was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/10/20798260/huawei-honor-smart-tv-vision-pro-harmonyos-china"&gt;Vision TV&lt;/a&gt; from its then-sub brand Honor (it later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;sold off the brand&lt;/a&gt; due to the pressures created by ongoing US sanctions). However, at last year’s Huawei developer conference, its consumer business CEO Richard Yu hinted that the operating system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430275/huawei-harmonyos-smartphones-release-date"&gt;could appear on smartphones in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlzd7a"&gt;Despite being marketed as a brand-new operating system, reports have suggested that HarmonyOS shares a lot of code with the open-source version of Android that it’s replacing. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/harmonyos-hands-on-huaweis-android-killer-is-just-android/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica &lt;/em&gt;did a deep dive into HarmonyOS&lt;/a&gt;, and reported that it “is essentially an Android fork.” Huawei did not respond to our requests for comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4LaOS1"&gt;As well as phones, Huawei has also announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22227707"&gt;new MatePad tablets running HarmonyOS&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the new HarmonyOS-powered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22227570"&gt;Huawei Watch 3 smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s E3 event will be ‘focused exclusively’ on Switch games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jEVC3jIoNUtYaAcogdVZCT-sk4A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376995/jbareham_1492_170228_0173.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DEHJHo"&gt;Nintendo is holding an E3 event on June 15th, and the company promises it will be “focused exclusively on Nintendo Switch games mainly releasing in 2021.” The Nintendo Direct presentation will begin at 9AM PT / 12PM ET on June 15th, and Nintendo will hold three hours of gameplay deep dives once the event has concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfhNu9"&gt;Nintendo’s wording suggests we won’t be seeing any hardware announcements at the company’s E3 show. A “Switch Pro” has been rumored for months, with recent reports suggesting it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22456160/new-nintendo-switch-release-date-september-e3-announcement"&gt;may be announced ahead of E3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cRbH4-P0zAvsylqnolbCXbVKay4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554599/NOA_Lead.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo’s E3 event starts at 9AM PT / 12PM ET on June 15th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eU8x2r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;has previously reported that this new Switch model will use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346041/oled-nintendo-switch-dlss-nvidia-chip-report"&gt;more powerful silicon from Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; that supports DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling). The updated Switch is also said to support 4K output when connected to a TV and reportedly includes a seven-inch OLED display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6CuMm"&gt;If a new Switch is imminent, Nintendo’s E3 show would be the perfect opportunity to show how games run at 4K and to demonstrate the power of Nvidia’s latest chip and DLSS support. As E3 kicks off in virtual form on June 12th, there are only 10 days left to see if Nintendo is ready to announce an updated Switch ahead of E3.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This scientist shoots trees to study how they migrate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KvfXikZzFrayfhGf0IUxW6EJmAk=/15x0:2040x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376928/Container.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZ7xjG"&gt;In Black Rock Forest, just north of New York City, Angie Patterson aims a shotgun at a northern red oak tree. Patterson is a plant ecophysiologist, and the leaves that she’s shooting out of the canopy will give her data to understand how and why trees migrate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRzD23"&gt;Trees have been on the move since at least the last ice age. As their native habitats become inhospitable, tree ranges shift, slowly, to areas they can thrive. But climate change is disrupting the process, scientists say. As of 2019, the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/"&gt;IUCN Red List categorized&lt;/a&gt; more than 20,000 tree species as threatened, and upward of 1,400 as critically endangered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l68bsI"&gt;As scientists scramble to learn more about what drives tree migration, others are planning for the future. To preserve biodiversity, both citizens and researchers are employing interventionist tactics once steeped in controversy like “assisted migration” — taking tree seedlings and planting them in new locations. Rising global temperatures may force wildlife agencies and forest managers to decide what to save and what to leave behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ri6H9E"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; video team trekked into the woods with “the shotgun scientist” to learn how and why trees move to new locations. Can we do anything to help the trees? And what tough calls will we have to make if we can’t? Watch our latest video to see what we discovered. &lt;/p&gt;
