    <title>TCL aims to build a better budget phone with the 20 Pro 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lCZilEyPsfqjlhmV6PBSvFSapXY=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69124944/TCL_20_Pro_5G_design_14.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YetCgh"&gt;TCL has announced the rest of its 20-series lineup, with the 20 Pro 5G leading the way. Along with the 20L and 20L Plus, the phone joins the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219101/tcl-20-5g-20-se-android-phone-price-specs"&gt;two devices announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; at CES, the TCL 20 5G and 20 SE, all of which prominently feature the company’s display technology. TCL says the 20 Pro 5G and 20S (a regional variant of the 20L Plus) will come to the US this summer, though the company hasn’t confirmed prices yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lk7kQb"&gt;The TCL 20 Pro 5G offers the most advanced specs of the bunch, with some refinements over last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21257398/tcl-10-pro-review-release-date-specs-features-camera-screen"&gt;good-not-great 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. It offers a 6.67-inch 1080p OLED with HDR10 support and includes the latest generation of TCL’s NXTVISION technology to identify on-screen content and adjust color, contrast, and sharpness accordingly. The 20 Pro 5G uses a Snapdragon 750G chipset — a step up from the 10 Pro’s 600-series processor — with 6GB RAM, ships with Android 11, and offers a 4,500mAh battery. Sub-6GHz 5G is supported, but TCL says it can adapt to include other 5G bands depending on the carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1HbzjVkiVB0lvVWnta7m8ROdjbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441810/TCL_20_Pro_5G_6.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 20 Pro 5G will come to the US this summer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PNeHDG"&gt;The phone’s main camera uses a 48-megapixel sensor with a small but important addition: optical image stabilization. It’s a feature that should help reduce blur in lower-light conditions, and it wasn’t offered on any of last year’s 10-series models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBhCb0"&gt;The standard wide camera is accompanied by a 16-megapixel ultrawide, 5-megapixel macro, 2-megapixel depth-sensing chip, and 32-megapixel selfie camera. For biometric unlock, the 20 Pro includes an in-display fingerprint sensor. We’re pleased to report that the 3.5mm headphone jack remains, and a microSD card slot is available for expansion on the 256GB of built-in storage. The 20 Pro 5G goes on sale tomorrow in the UK, Italy, and Portugal for €549 (about $655).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C9Qmm2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10444791"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h8XOQi"&gt;The TCL 20L and 20L Plus are more budget-oriented devices. They both offer a 6.67-inch 1080p LCD, a 5,000mAh battery, and a Snapdragon 662 processor. The 20L offers 4GB of RAM in its base model, while the Plus model starts at 6GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnwNfh"&gt;The 20L Plus also features a 64-megapixel main camera, while the 20L includes a 48-megapixel main sensor; both devices include an 8-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro, 2-megapixel depth sensor, and 16-megapixel selfie camera. Both phones also use circular polarization display technology, so that the screen is visible from any angle when viewing it with polarized sunglasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekN725"&gt;The 20L and 20L Plus go on sale tomorrow in the UK, Italy, and Portugal, starting at €229 and €269, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQ0clq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram will test letting users toggle public like counts on and off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_LZVg2CeDJ9vG4mtlOyDrmv6Pk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69124949/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1rf1B9"&gt;Instagram will test giving people more control over where they see like counts on posts. The company announced a “small global test” that will present users with three options when it comes to the like count: choosing not to see like counts on anyone’s posts, turning them off for their own posts, or keeping the original experience. It also said it was “working on a similar experience” for Facebook, but it hasn’t clarified what that might look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aD0MNF"&gt;This builds on an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964865/instagram-test-hide-like-counts-expands-us-globally"&gt;initial Instagram test&lt;/a&gt; that hid the public like count for certain users around the world. In that case, users didn’t have a choice about whether they saw the like count or not. Instagram told users at the time that it wanted people to “focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get.” Influencers initially worried this could impact brand deals because their engagement rates wouldn’t be public, but that reality hasn’t played out because they’ve been able to view their own like counts privately and share them with brand partners. Still, providing a more custom experience might be the right direction for the platform to move toward, giving people who are aware of how public like counts make them feel a chance to escape them, while also allowing people who want to keep track of the counts able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbVdti"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20885990/facebook-hide-public-like-count-test-user-experience-australia"&gt;also initially&lt;/a&gt; tested hiding the public like count in 2019. That test hid public like, reaction, and video view counts. It’s unclear whether this new test could apply to all of those surfaces or just the like count on posts. That Facebook test isn’t live yet, and Facebook says it’ll be learning from this new test and will “have more to share soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fantasian isn’t just charming; it’s the most approachable JRPG I’ve ever played</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/njTuZ7AstBp42XSX-yvsdfDl-Nw=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69124668/6_4k.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PhEgjr"&gt;Before &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; launched on Apple Arcade, most of the discussion centered on how it looked. There was a good reason for that. Mistwalker, the studio helmed by &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;pioneered a new technique that involved crafting more than 150 incredible, charming dioramas&lt;/a&gt;, which were then photographed to become the locations you explore in the game. Whether you’re venturing through a wind-swept desert, luxury cruise ship, or robot metropolis, every area you visit in &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; was handcrafted from real-world materials. It not only looks amazing, but it lends the game’s fantasy world a very particular vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUWwVE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; is also just a great game. It’s not particularly original, hewing very closely to the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; games that Sakaguchi built his career on. But it also takes those ideas and mechanics and changes them just enough to feel fresh, while also making some notable quality-of-life changes. &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just an adorable handcrafted game from the creator of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;; it’s the most approachable Japanese RPG I’ve ever played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mkWP5q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10432584"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyieFJ"&gt;The premise is, admittedly, not very original. If you’re played a JRPG any time over the last two decades, it’ll probably feel familiar. You play as Leo, a hero who has lost his memory and quickly gets pulled into a quest for the fate of the world. It’s hard to talk too much about details of the story since, for most of the game, Leo doesn’t even know what’s going on. Early on, you’re mostly just following leads, as Leo goes pretty much anywhere he can in order to potentially learn more about who he is. You’ll explore mysterious and well-guarded vaults, visit gorgeous cities on the water, and eventually be transported to a mechanical realm ruled by robots. It’s a lengthy adventure, though what’s available now is actually only the first of two parts, with the second expected to release later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PRG7QF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ePFgyBtvqQU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I8cGkR"&gt;The story itself is… fine. &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; certainly doesn’t live up to its spiritual predecessors in that regard. I never felt any real sense of urgency as I saved the world, and few of the main cast of characters are very memorable. It’s cute at times, and there are some interesting surprises and worldbuilding details to dig into. Mostly, it just gets the job done. &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; is much more about the vibe than the narrative. I loved poking around each and every location, seeing the buildings and landscape from different angles. I didn’t really care &lt;em&gt;why &lt;/em&gt;I was doing it. The handmade diorama art style is reminiscent of the pre-rendered backgrounds from the PlayStation era, except with a much finer level of detail. An incredible soundtrack from frequent Sakaguchi collaborator Nobuo Uematsu only adds to the nostalgia. It’s a world you want to linger in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hotmEF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t just look and sound familiar; it also plays a lot like the classics it’s inspired by. That means random battles, turn-based combat, and a relatively straightforward character customization. The battles, in particular, do some interesting things. While there are familiar elements — like enemies with elemental weaknesses and bosses that change forms mid-fight — there are also some nice twists, like spells and weapons that you can aim to maximize your attack by hitting as many enemies as possible in one shot. It makes battles, particularly bosses, feel more strategic and less mindless. It’s really satisfying when you line things up &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pgu6QD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Arcade finally got the boost it needed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0O2xDv"&gt;Perhaps the best addition is the awkwardly named dimengeon — a portmanteau of dimension and dungeon — that lets you put off random battles for a short period. Essentially, when you turn the feature on, any monster you come across gets trapped in this device, and it can hold up to 30 of them at a time. Whenever you want — or whenever it’s full — you can then take on all of the trapped monsters in one giant brawl. It’s a great feature for when you just want to explore without fighting or when you’re in a rush to get to a save point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Q324r"&gt;There is a handful of other quality-of-life tweaks — plentiful save points, locations that are big but simple to navigate, touch and gamepad controls that work equally well, little need for grinding — that add up to an incredibly accessible take on the classic formula. &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; streamlines the genre, keeping the parts that work best, while updating the rest for modern tastes. There are a few small hiccups, like flat cutscenes and some jarring difficulty spikes toward the end. But at its best, &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; is everything Sakaguchi does best, just in a slightly smaller and more refined package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWs2oB"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Fantasian &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available now on Apple Arcade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How CO2 sensors might help us return to ‘normal’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gRdJocWNv1qH5XJa_oVPVfLoItA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69124596/CONTAINER.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="63Tmg5"&gt;One of the things we’ve learned over the past year is to be wary of the air around us — especially indoors. If other people are around, exhaling, they’re filling the space with their breath. If one of those people has COVID-19, they could be filling the space with &lt;em&gt;infectious&lt;/em&gt; breath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NUWnp"&gt;There’s a way to make indoor spaces safer, though: improving the ventilation to make sure the air doesn’t stay trapped. That way, any potentially infectious particles&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;quickly gust away, instead of lingering for someone else to breathe in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOTz9i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/02/10/carbon-dioxide-device-coronavirus/"&gt;Experts say one way to measure&lt;/a&gt; how well-ventilated certain spaces are is by checking how much carbon dioxide is in the air. People exhale carbon dioxide, so the amount of it in a room gives you an idea&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;how much of the air is made up of other people’s breath. It’s not a perfect measure of danger — it won’t tell you if there is actually virus around — but it’s a pretty good proxy for how risky a room could be. It’s easy to check a room’s carbon dioxide levels: all you need is a small, portable monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKFyz0"&gt;To test this idea, the &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;Science&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;team took one of those monitors all around Brooklyn, New York, to check out the ventilation at local grocery stores, bagel shops, and bars. Watch our latest video to see what we found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rR3CsP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic’s tool that lets you make realistic digital humans is now in early access</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RjlXEEtkAqGojSJ0z3P_LU32Rgk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69124602/MHC_Preset_Example_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RtRGuJ"&gt;Last February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276265/epic-games-digital-human-creator-unreal-engine-realistic-human-faces"&gt;Epic Games wowed us&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/digital-humans"&gt;the MetaHuman Creator&lt;/a&gt;, a new cloud-based app that lets people make highly realistic digital humans that can be rigged and animated in Unreal Engine. At the time, the tool wasn’t out yet, but today, Epic is opening it up in early access. It won’t be available for everyone to use right away, though — you have to register your interest first, and then Epic has to grant you access, though the company says it will move quickly to let everyone in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVaGI3"&gt;If you didn’t catch the announcement of MetaHuman Creator in February, I strongly recommend that you &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mAF5dWZXcI"&gt;watch this video&lt;/a&gt; of two MetaHumans talking about themselves to see them in action. The digital avatars move in a stunningly realistic way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="133NgK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6mAF5dWZXcI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="38bLRe"&gt;You can also get an idea of how the MetaHuman Creator tool works in this new video from Epic. The app looks to offer an impressive level of customizability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L01VI5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OeUBATSJSr0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SgqQgK"&gt;And if you want to take a look at some still images of MetaHumans, take a look at this gallery with some examples from Epic — there’s an incredible level on these avatars. I’m particularly impressed by the way hair looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eTCNO3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10445046"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Automatic gender recognition tech is dangerous, say campaigners: it’s time to ban it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R531P8Ybim4BJzB_20lgqE3nIcE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69124485/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Simplistic gender binaries infringe on the right to self-expression&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="UGhIaO"&gt;Dangers posed by facial recognition like mass surveillance and mistaken identity have been widely discussed in recent years. But digital rights groups say an equally insidious use case is currently sneaking under the radar: using the same technology to predict someone’s gender and sexual orientation. Now, a &lt;a href="https://act.accessnow.org/page/79916/action/1"&gt;new campaign has launched&lt;/a&gt; to ban these applications in the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVJwpV"&gt;Trying to predict someone’s gender or sexuality from digitized clues is fundamentally flawed, says Os Keyes, a researcher who’s &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274357"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://logicmag.io/nature/the-body-instrumental/"&gt;extensively&lt;/a&gt; on the topic. This technology tends to reduce gender to a simplistic binary and, as a result, is often harmful to individuals like trans and nonbinary people who might not fit into these narrow categories. When the resulting systems are used for things like gating entry for physical spaces or verifying someone’s identity for an online service, it leads to discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAZpSv"&gt;“Identifying someone’s gender by looking at them and not talking to them is sort of like asking what does the smell of blue taste like,” Keyes tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The issue is not so much that your answer is wrong as your question doesn’t make any sense.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rojzwN"&gt;These predictions can be made using a variety of inputs, from analyzing someone’s voice to aggregating their shopping habits. But the rise of facial recognition has given companies and researchers a new data input they believe is particularly authoritative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KBHI3d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These systems don’t just fail to recognize that trans people exist they literally &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; recognize that trans people exist.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="foCe4R"&gt;Commercial facial recognition systems, including those sold by big tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft, &lt;a href="https://www.morgan-klaus.com/pdfs/pubs/Scheuerman-CSCW2019-HowComputersSeeGender.pdf"&gt;frequently offer gender classification&lt;/a&gt; as a standard feature. Predicting sexual orientation from the same data is much rarer, but researchers have still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16332760/ai-sexuality-gaydar-photo-physiognomy"&gt;built such systems&lt;/a&gt;, most notably the so-called “AI gaydar” algorithm. There’s strong evidence that this technology &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/03/05/ai_gaydar/"&gt;doesn’t work&lt;/a&gt; even on its own flawed premises, but that wouldn’t necessarily limit its adoption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NgcP5"&gt;“Even the people who first researched it said, yes, some tinpot dictator could use this software to try and ‘find the queers’ and then throw them in a camp,” says Keyes of the algorithm to detect sexual orientation. “And that isn’t hyperbole. In Chechnya, that’s &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46871801"&gt;exactly what they’ve been doing&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s without the aid of robots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFhtTU"&gt;In the case of automatic gender recognition, these systems generally rely on narrow and outmoded understandings of gender. With facial recognition tech, if someone has short hair, they’re categorized as a man; if they’re wearing makeup, they’re a woman. Similar assumptions are made based on biometric data like bone structure and face shape. The result is that people who don’t fit easily into these two categories — like many trans and nonbinary individuals — are misgendered. “These systems don’t just fail to recognize that trans people exist. They literally &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; recognize that trans people exist,” says Keyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRgzpy"&gt;Current applications of this gender recognition tech include &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/the-bus-stop-that-knows-youre-a-lady/253365/"&gt;digital billboards&lt;/a&gt; that analyze passersby to serve them targeted advertisements; digital spaces like “girls-only” social app Giggle, which admits people &lt;a href="https://joinagiggle.com/faq/"&gt;by guessing their gender from selfies&lt;/a&gt;; and marketing stunts, like a campaign to give &lt;a href="https://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/mitte/bvg-gibt-frauen-heute-160-euro-rabatt"&gt;discounted subway tickets to women&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin to celebrate Equal Pay Day that tried to identify women based on facial scans. Researchers have also discussed much more potentially dangerous use cases, like deploying the technology to limit entry to gendered areas like bathrooms and locker rooms. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xoz8vTDjN1tM7ogrzQbzZSBmnmo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22442990/giggle_selfie_verification.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Giggle&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Giggle is a “girls-only” social app that attempts to verify that users are female using selfies. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GVeJBx"&gt;Being rejected by a machine in such a scenario has the potential to be not only humiliating and inconvenient, but to also trigger an even more severe reaction. Anti-trans attitudes and hysteria over access to bathrooms have already led to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/5/18/11690234/women-bathrooms-harassment"&gt;numerous incidents of harassment and violence&lt;/a&gt; in public toilets, as passersby take it upon themselves to police these spaces. If someone is publicly declared by a seemingly impartial machine to be the “wrong” gender, it would only seem to legitimize such harassment and violence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXizVv"&gt;Daniel Leufer, a policy analyst at digital rights group Access Now, which is leading the campaign to ban these applications, says this technology is incompatible with the EU’s commitment to human rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Irxsjv"&gt;“If you live in a society committed to upholding these rights, then the only solution is a ban,” Leufer tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Automatic gender recognition is completely at odds to the idea of people being able to express their gender identity outside the male-female binary or in a different way to the sex they were assigned at birth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="6Gns1V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Automatic gender recognition is incompatible with self-expression, say campaigners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gnYJDd"&gt;Access Now, along with more than 60 other NGOs, has sent a letter to the European Commission, asking it to ban this technology. The campaign, which is supported by international LGBT+ advocacy group All Out, comes as the European Commission considers new regulations for AI across the EU. A draft white paper that circulated last year &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-considers-temporary-ban-on-facial-recognition-in-public-spaces/"&gt;suggested a complete ban&lt;/a&gt; on facial recognition in public spaces was being considered, and Leufer says this illustrates how seriously the EU is taking the problem of AI regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5O2poc"&gt;“There’s a unique moment right now with this legislation in the EU where we can call for major red lines, and we’re taking the opportunity to do that,” says Leufer. “The EU has consistently framed itself as taking a third path between China and the US [on AI regulation] with European values at its core, and we’re attempting to hold them to that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlzeHp"&gt;Keyes points out that banning this technology should be of interest to everyone, “regardless of how they feel about the centrality of trans lives to their lives,” as these systems reinforce an extremely outdated mode of gender politics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9kUrP"&gt;“When you look at what these researchers think, it’s like they’ve time-traveled from the 1950s,” says Keyes. “One system I saw used the example of advertising cars to males and pretty dresses to females. First of all, I want to know who’s getting stuck with the ugly dresses? And secondly, do they think women can’t drive?” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gender identification can be used in unrelated systems, like facial recognition tech used to verify identity at borders. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5csShW"&gt;The use of this technology can also be much more subtle than simply delivering different advertisements to men and women. Often, says Keyes, gender identification is used as a filter to produce outcomes that have nothing to do with gender itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dCDkIJ"&gt;For example, if a facial recognition algorithm is used to bar entry to a building or country by matching an individual to a database of faces, it might narrow down its search by filtering results by gender. Then, if the system misgenders the person in front of it, it will produce an invisible error that has nothing to do with the task at hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eyFdNH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Algorithmic transparency would be needed to enforce a ban&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P2plbH"&gt;Keyes says this sort of application is deeply worrying because companies don’t share details of how their technology works. “This may already be ubiquitous in existing facial recognition systems, and we just can’t tell because they are entirely black-boxed,” they say. In 2018, for example, trans Uber drivers were &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/08/transgender-uber-driver-suspended-tech-oversight-facial-recognition.html"&gt;kicked off the company’s app&lt;/a&gt; because of a security feature that asked them to verify their identity with a selfie. Why these individuals were rejected by the system isn’t clear, says Keyes, but it’s possible that faulty gender recognition played a part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NxjGq"&gt;Ultimately, technology that tries to reduce the world to binary classifications based on simple heuristics is always going to fail when faced with the variety and complexity of human expression. Keyes acknowledges that gender recognition by machine does work for a large number of people but says the underlying flaws in the system will inevitably hurt those who are already marginalized by society and force everyone into narrower forms of self-expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxpL8t"&gt;“We already live in a society which is very heavily gendered and very visually gendered,” says Keyes. “What these technologies are doing is making those decisions a lot more efficient, a lot more automatic, and a lot more difficult to challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The lowest you can grab a pair right now is for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.staples.com/apple-airpods-pro-mwp22am-a-in-the-ear-bluetooth-headset-white/product_24422954?storeId=10001&amp;amp;AID=10921729&amp;amp;PID=4485850&amp;amp;SID=fa73db569d2011eb83a05281c35caba30INT&amp;amp;cvosrc=affiliate.cj.4485850&amp;amp;cvo_campaign=Coupon&amp;amp;cm_mmc=CJ-_-4485850-_-4485850-_-10921729&amp;amp;CID=AFF%3A4485850%3A4485850%3A10921729&amp;amp;CJPIXEL=CJPIXEL&amp;amp;cjevent=faa926699d2011eb824c01890a82b82a&amp;amp;dclid=CO2H2dLk_e8CFcmnnwod0Y4CCQ&amp;amp;userEnv=&amp;amp;tenantId=StaplesDotCom&amp;amp;locale=en-US&amp;amp;zipCode=21638&amp;amp;channel=WEB&amp;amp;encode=" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$199 at Staples&lt;/a&gt; or $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Amazon announces new Echo Buds with more powerful ANC and better comfort</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TCgxHY5qFkH_GVl1gUcO9I322J8=/0x37:2040x1397/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69124148/Echo_Buds__Glacier_White__Bag.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wRTvaz"&gt;Amazon is today introducing its &lt;a href="http://amazon.com/echobuds"&gt;second-generation pair of Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt;. The new true wireless earbuds improve on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937559/amazon-echo-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-features-bose-noise-reduction-price"&gt;the originals&lt;/a&gt; with a more comfortable design — they’re now 20 percent smaller — and enhanced active noise cancellation. But Amazon is staying aggressive on price: the 2021 Echo Buds are priced at $119.99 for the earbuds and a USB-C charging case or $139.99 for an upgraded case with wireless charging. For a limited time, both are being discounted. The regular set drops under $100 to $99.99, with the wireless charging pair costing $119.99. The new Echo Buds will be released on May 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtTyaZ"&gt;Aside from shrinking them down, Amazon has also made comfort-focused design changes to the Echo Buds. They now have a vented design (like the AirPods Pro, Pixel Buds, etc.) to reduce unwanted ear pressure. The company has shortened the nozzle so that the Echo Buds don’t sit as deep in your ear canal, and the external depth has been reduced for a more flush fit. The ear tips — four sizes come included — are now oval-shaped, and you also get two sizes of optional wing tips in the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwsEj0"&gt;Instead of a glossy touch surface like on the original Echo Buds, the outside-facing exterior is now all matte. But Amazon has slapped its logo onto the earbuds this time around, which I could’ve done without. They now come in white in addition to black.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="sfEBBU"&gt;With the first Echo Buds, Amazon borrowed some of Bose’s noise-reduction technology. But this time, it’s doing everything itself.  The company says that the second-gen earbuds “cancel twice as much noise” as before. When in passthrough mode, you can adjust the amount of ambient noise you want to come through. Sound quality has also seen some improvements, according to Amazon’s press release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AvudKC"&gt;Echo Buds deliver crisp, balanced sound with extended dynamic range — so you get the most out of your music, regardless of genre. The premium speakers are optimized for increased fidelity in bass and treble, which reduces distortion during media playback, delivering vibrant melodies and clear spoken word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="I9v6V4"&gt;The second-gen Echo Buds are rated IPX4 for water and sweat, which Amazon says should cover any exercise and “light rain.” And Amazon says the microphones on these earbuds — three on each bud — are improved, too; they’re “optimized to capture lower frequencies compared to the prior generation,” which apparently results in better quality for voice calls. Either bud can be used standalone in mono mode.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbAkuz6pIiQnerqX5yhqMfKmqiE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22442019/Echo_Buds__Black__Staircase.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon has made comfort a big priority with the second-gen Echo Buds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QdITFh"&gt;Battery life is estimated at five hours of listening with noise cancellation enabled, with two additional full charges in the case for a total of 15 hours. (The case now has status LEDs for each individual earbud, which is a handy addition.) If the battery runs low, charging over USB-C for 15 minutes should get you around two hours of playback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7AbOry"&gt;To see just how aggressive Amazon is on pricing, let’s compare the Echo Buds against the wider market of popular true wireless earbuds. Most of these have noise cancellation, though some (like the Pixel Buds) don’t:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfEKJe"&gt;$279 Bose QuietComfort Earbuds&lt;br&gt;$249.95 Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2&lt;br&gt;$249 Apple AirPods Pro&lt;br&gt;$229.99 Jabra Elite 85t&lt;br&gt;$229.99 Sony 1000XM3 earbuds&lt;br&gt;$199.99 Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;br&gt;$179.99 Google Pixel Buds&lt;br&gt;$179.99 Jabra Elite 75t&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$139.99 Amazon Echo Buds with wireless charging ($119.99 for a limited time)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;$129.99 Anker Liberty Air 2 Pro&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$119.99 Amazon Echo Buds with USB-C ($99.99 for a limited time)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiHHdA"&gt;Just like the first model, Amazon hopes a big part of the appeal with the Echo Buds will be the ability to use Alexa everywhere you go. You can ask for a specific artist or song, of course, but Amazon also added the option late last year to ask for music by activity type. You can control your smart home, play an Audible audiobook, ask for transit directions, or even use Alexa’s local search powers to find the nearest COVID-19 testing site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ey7WIB"&gt;You can also ask any nearby Alexa device to find your buds, and they’ll play an audible chime to help make them easier to locate. Amazon says “later this year,” it will add the VIP Filter feature that debuted on its Echo Frames, which allows you to choose the notifications you want to hear and avoid the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DdZUk"&gt;If the noise cancellation improvements are as significant as Amazon claims, the second-generation Echo Buds could prove quite compelling — especially at their low price versus the competition. Stay tuned for a full review in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber is licensing its ride-hailing software to three more public transit agencies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9wqwmzBCA-GeQJEGabnaimBiArk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69124143/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yltmov"&gt;Uber is expanding its software as a service (SaaS) business with three additional public transit partnerships. The ride-hailing company announced that it would be selling the software that powers its ride-hailing business to transit agencies in Denver, Colorado; Cecil County, Maryland; and Porterville, California. The news comes amid Uber’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21126283/uber-commuters-schedule-rides-lirr-train-public-transportation-caltrain"&gt;broader push&lt;/a&gt; into public transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvSwmV"&gt;Denver’s Regional Transportation District will start using Uber’s management software this week to manage its fleet of wheelchair-accessible vehicles, while Cecil Transit and Porterville Transit will follow in the weeks to come. For a subscription fee, these transit agencies will be able to use Uber’s “matching and marketplace technology to facilitate on-demand community rides using their own transit fleet,” the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="13E4wp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber announced its first SaaS transit deal with Marin County in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2020&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M9dtox"&gt;Uber announced its first transit deal with Marin County in the San Francisco Bay Area in July 2020. As part of that deal, the Transportation Authority of Marin pays Uber a subscription fee to use its software to facilitate requesting, matching, and tracking its vehicle fleet. Cape May County in New Jersey is also a customer of Uber’s SaaS program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9koZqu"&gt;Starting in late April, Ceil Transit will use Uber’s software to transport “riders in recovery seeking access to employment, essential services, appointments, and recovery programs,” Uber says. The service area is a closed loop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcpJ3i"&gt;Porterville Transit, based between Fresno and Bakersfield, will roll out transit vehicles with Uber’s software to members of its community in early May. Porterville previously had used a software company called Transloc, which is owned by Ford, but switched to Uber for “enhanced reliability.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XX2dB"&gt;Over the years, Uber has been accused of &lt;a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2019/01/22/study-uber-and-lyft-are-responsible-for-u-s-transit-decline/"&gt;directly competing with and poaching riders from subways, trains, and buses&lt;/a&gt;. Declining bus and subway ridership has been pegged to the rise of app-based ride-hailing in dozens of cities across the US. Recently, Uber has added transit directions and ticketing to its app in some cities in the hopes that by giving transit equal footing in its app, it can blunt that criticism. It also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326823/uber-routematch-acquire-public-transportation-software"&gt;acquired an Atlanta-based company called Routematch&lt;/a&gt;, which sells software to public transit agencies for data management, dispatching, trip booking, and ticketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdPUpa"&gt;Last year, Uber announced it would begin selling train and bus tickets through its app for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18526126/uber-denver-public-transportation-ticket-buy-app"&gt;customers in Denver&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20884800/uber-app-announcement-ubereats-safety-transit-updates"&gt;integrated public transportation schedules and directions&lt;/a&gt; into its app for over a dozen other cities. Less than a year later, Uber says that “over 2 million riders” have tried Uber Transit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Can Clubhouse keep the party going?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hlDN3fncOEon7GTQS8nc1qOrByM=/1x0:2040x1359/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69124160/jbali_20201010_4526_0071.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comedian Leah Lamarr has gained over 195,000 followers on the app in only a little over four months.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Fake laughs, imposters, and scams — behind the invite-only audio app’s most obsessive users&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="BJNlL6"&gt;For the first time since the pandemic started, I had big Friday night plans: a VIPs-only mansion party. The who’s who of 2003, like Elton John, Howard Stern, Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, and Lindsay Lohan would supposedly be attending. Some guy Nick owned the mansion, apparently, and to get through the door, everyone had to pass a vibe check by answering a question, like: would you rather have a cat that acts like a dog or a dog that acts like a cat? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNqwAo"&gt;So I stayed up late — midnight on the East Coast — and got ready to attend. I donned my usual sweatpants and hoodie, got into bed, pulled up my comforter, and opened the Clubhouse app on my phone. That night, the social audio app greeted me with a page of chat room possibilities. I could join the lullaby room where musicians would sing in their softest voices to coo me to sleep, or I could join a trivia game with model Amber Rose and hosted by Jigsaw, the murderer clown from &lt;em&gt;Saw&lt;/em&gt;. I could, in what’s basically a room archetype at this point, debate the merits of Clubhouse. I popped into those three rooms as a warmup to the mansion party and my real Friday night plans. This was Clubhouse’s shot to show me it could become my entertainment — I skipped my Netflix time for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0X1BCG"&gt;Clubhouse has turned millions of people onto the idea of spending their time talking to strangers. The invite-only app, which is only accessible through iOS devices, debuted in March 2020, exactly when people started mandatorily staying at home. Now, even as places open up more broadly, the app continues growing, although seemingly at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1377332954007957508"&gt;a much slower pace than before&lt;/a&gt;. More than ten million people have reportedly downloaded it from around the world, and &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/clubhouse-is-said-to-discuss-funding-at-about-4-billion-value"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; it’s valued as high as $4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFyF8t"&gt;I first logged on this past January, despite hearing about Clubhouse for months. My first impression came from stories about rooms being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495419/clubhouse-conversation-antisemitism-content-moderation"&gt;anti-Semitic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7w3zw/silicon-valley-elite-discuss-journalists-having-too-much-power-in-private-app"&gt;adversarial to the media&lt;/a&gt;. As a Jewish journalist, those are two things that would immediately disqualify me from having a good time. And even now, after spending much time in the app, I find many of the rooms boring, chaotic, self-indulgent, or, at worst, scammy. Some rooms, for example, are “silent” with the idea being that you join and follow everyone. They’ll then follow you back. Other rooms peddle vague ideas about entrepreneurship and becoming a millionaire, likely hosted by someone who isn’t actually a millionaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eOp4x8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Airport bar of the internet”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QFVsPY"&gt;But still, even with these turnoffs, I was determined to learn what made Clubhouse addictive to so many people, and why it’s valued at billions of dollars. One frequent user described the app as the “airport bar of the internet,” which felt accurate in describing both my experience using Clubhouse and my questions of why anyone would ever enjoy that. To be clear, I’ve had some fun on Clubhouse, but almost exclusively when I find something unexpected and not for the reasons venture capitalists tout the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FB8ftn"&gt;The app’s grabbing headlines with appearances from the kinds of people VCs love — Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg — and its vibe of SXSW meets TED Talk meets staring at your phone. But the most compelling instance for me — the moment I knew something truly weird was happening — wasn’t hearing a Tesla founder talk about Tesla stuff. It was when I finally dropped in on that mansion party and discovered that Howard Stern was, in reality, some rando named Matthew Friend. And that every celebrity there was an imposter — well, an impressionist — and what I had stumbled into was not a mansion party but a bizarre roleplay of a mansion party, where people were perfecting their fake voices. Deep down I knew these stars couldn’t possibly be in one room, but the revelation surprised me nonetheless. (They were very convincing!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOlkeF"&gt;The VCs might love the platform’s self-aggrandizing “entrepreneurial” spirit. But the thrill of Clubhouse right now is in all the rooms where users are dating, playing, experimenting — where you can watch people try to figure out what the hell Clubhouse is in real time. These users have dedicated hours to the app, almost turning it into a full-time job. Many hope this is their chance to get in on the ground level of the next big platform and find success — something that’s almost impossible to do on the big, established platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqPQ7t"&gt;Clubhouse isn’t without its problems, however, although these are the natural growing pains of any social network. If anything, they demonstrate how authentic of a platform Clubhouse actually is and that it’s likely to stick. The biggest issue facing Clubhouse now is the race to innovate and beat its competitors, most of whom already commend sizable user bases and massive engineering teams. Twitter, for one, has already launched its social audio competitor Spaces on both iOS and Android with plans to bring it to the web, beating Clubhouse to Android devices. Facebook is reportedly putting its offering together, although it debuted an app called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372190/facebook-hotline-clubhouse-competitor-q-and-a-app-test"&gt;Hotline&lt;/a&gt; that fuses live audio with video. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; have all also announced their plans for similar products and functionality. Social audio is clearly here to stay, even when the pandemic wanes, but will Clubhouse make it through? And will these users, who’ve put hundreds of hours into the app see no future return from it, except the friends they’ve made along the way? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeEDJx"&gt;“The way I think about it is that every social media platform has a particular kind of archetype that’s going to thrive and do well there, which is how you see it map out,” says Maceo Paisley, who has over 80,000 followers on Clubhouse. Visual artists do well on TikTok and Instagram, for example, while writers prefer Twitter, he says. “And then you have Clubhouse, which is for people that were good in dialogue and that was their medium.” That could be community leaders, mentors, or just people who consider themselves conversationalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="veDUtC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I wanted to get out of there and get back on Clubhouse so quickly, you have no idea.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6FsSyB"&gt;And luckily for Clubhouse, it came about during the pandemic when everyone craved an interaction with someone, &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;, outside their immediate home. Talking to a celebrity would be cool, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bJUav"&gt;“In some cases, you can hop on stage with Malcolm Gladwell and ask him a question about his work, and he has nowhere to go,” Paisley says. “He’s like, ‘Well I’ve never thought of that,’ and you’re like, ‘You’re Malcolm Gladwell, you’ve never thought of it? That’s what you do, you’re a thought leader.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELLGuc"&gt;The pandemic eventually gave way to a second, critical factor for the app’s success: screen fatigue. Most people would do anything to not stare at a screen more than they already do. We’re almost always looking at them, and any time we might have had away prior to the pandemic is now severely limited, if it exists at all. For me, walks in my neighborhood are some of my only respite, but even then, I’m usually on the phone or listening to a podcast — anything to keep me from being, god forbid, alone with my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYy5YL"&gt;The real question for Clubhouse is whether it’ll maintain its appeal after the pandemic. Can it compete with brunch plans, weddings, and real-life parties? From my conversations, it seems like yes. People can’t pull themselves away, even when IRL plans are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84uuWx"&gt;Comedian Leah Lamarr, who has 195,000 followers on the app, did her first live show since the pandemic in early February where she got to schmooze with other comics&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in person. But throughout the night, a thought kept nagging at her. “I wanted to get out of there and get back on Clubhouse so quickly, you have no idea,” she tells me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyduzy"&gt;Lamarr’s built a loyal following on Clubhouse where she hosts a variety of rooms, including live standup sets, and has found fans through the app. She and her friend Nicole Behnam, who has 156,000 followers, tell me they even work together to bring friends onstage during these comedy rooms where they specifically instruct them to unmute their mics only to laugh or clap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bNIvey8SDLQuy2RrwLhOXn4fE3A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441711/jbali_20201010_4526_0085.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leah Lamarr says fans came to her in-person show after learning about her through Clubhouse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JKL1ue"&gt;I asked her how long she spent on the app daily, and she says it’s a triggering question. “I get anxiety when I’m not on it. I have Clubhouse FOMO.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FEUpOE"&gt;She’s not the only one that’s hooked. She says friends of hers “blew out their vocal cords” from talking so much. Behnam tells me she had to cut back on her app time from an initial 12 to 14 hours per day to just four to six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4IUtM"&gt;“I definitely realized that it could become an addiction for anybody,” she says. “When I realized that, I started meditating and going in nature more. There was one point, it’s funny, but I hadn’t listened to music in so long, I finally turned Clubhouse off and listened to music, and I literally felt like I was in another world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adZGkf"&gt;But Clubhouse isn’t always a great time. In Lamarr’s case, she says she’s asked big-name comedians, like Tiffany Haddish, to participate in her biweekly stand-up room only to be turned down because of concerns over joke stealing. (Joke stealing is already a problem on Twitter, which has a searchable, written history. Now imagine how that could happen on a live app with no native recording function or archive.) Paisley adds that people even steal room ideas, which recently culminated in two different feuds. In one, a group of Black users claim they pioneered the concept of &lt;a href="https://influence.co/nofilter/clubhouse-shoot-your-shot-nyu-girls-roasting-tech-guys-black-users"&gt;“shoot your shot” rooms&lt;/a&gt; where someone can get onstage and ask another user out, but that the idea only got widespread attention when white NYU students imitated it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxMezw"&gt;“HOW INTERESTING is it that after months of black people hosting shoot your shot rooms and getting suspended for it, Clubhouse gives a bunch of white NYU girls the ‘shoot your shot’ club &amp;amp; they get monetized. joke,” one person tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jUSI4"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3vd7y/inside-the-clubhouse-room-where-people-moan-like-whales"&gt;a separate incident&lt;/a&gt;, a group claims it came up with the original concept for a “whale moaning room” where people, of course, moaned like whales. But, it says, the idea was co-opted, again from users of color, and used by white influencers to gain power and reach on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="j24MtA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Then, there are the scammers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ik8YGF"&gt;Room stealing might seem trivial, but it’s the closest thing the app has to intellectual property. A brilliant format could draw in listeners and mint a new way for the app to function. This happened most famously in December when a group of users came together to put on a rendition of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Lion King&lt;/em&gt;. They popularized the idea of “PTR,” or pull to refresh, meaning room attendees could pull down on their screen to see profile photos change to different scenes and characters. Now, PTR is regularly referenced in rooms. I PTR’d during the mansion party to see which celebs people would impersonate next, for example, and I PTR’d during a live art auction in which artists changed their photos to the art they were selling. The first room like this sold $10,000 worth of art, says Casey McBride, who hosts and started the auctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GY1nL"&gt;Then, there are the scammers — and the community policing them. Rahaf Harfoush, who has 133,000 followers, chronicles the scams she and her club members find weekly as part of the “anti-grift squad,” as they refer to themselves. They’ve found plenty to keep them busy. One example Harfoush tells me about is a “startup” room where people pitch their ideas for a business. The people running the rooms might feign interest, but in actuality, they go and buy the domain names associated with the ideas, essentially ensuring that the entrepreneurs have to pay them to own it. Other scams include people claiming that users have to pay for a Clubhouse moderator badge — that’s not true — or rooms that attempt to sell a product, like consulting packages. The hosts of the product room will bring supposedly enthusiastic users onstage to hype up the item, but in reality, they profit from any sales made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLiQlO"&gt;“It’s fascinating to me because it’s just the iteration of all the scams that exist elsewhere,” Harfoush says. She notes that misinformation is also rampant with people spreading conspiracy theories and anti-vax rhetoric. Her group doesn’t mention scammers’ names specifically because coordinated harassment campaigns are already happening, too. The scammers have retaliated by getting a group together to report a user en masse, resulting in a Clubhouse ban. (Those reporting tools themselves &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/on-community-moderation"&gt;were created&lt;/a&gt; as a result of harassment on the platform with no way for members to insulate themselves.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="aeubXX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One person pretended to be Brad Pitt talking about climate change for over an hour&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cpcpuu"&gt;All of this is to say, Clubhouse is starting to experience many of the same problems as its biggest competitors, like Facebook and Twitter. There are scammers, moderation issues, problems with accreditation, and even impersonation. Yes, the celebrity impersonators from the mansion room were obviously doing a bit, but other people have attempted to straight-up dupe people. One person &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2021/02/16/the-curious-case-of-brad-pitt-on-clubhouse/?sh=19abf4dd13ef"&gt;pretended to be Brad Pitt&lt;/a&gt; talking about climate change for over an hour and only copped to it when someone asked him point-blank whether he was really Brad. He even had the username @bradpitt. (Clubhouse doesn’t have any sort of verification system, like blue checkmarks, meaning you have to hope the person you’re seeing on the app is who they say they are.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYNKme"&gt;Clubhouse attempts to address these issues weekly during a town hall, where its co-founders announce product changes and answer users’ questions. Now that it’s facing competition from seemingly every major tech company, however, its problems are more dire. A new social app is always exciting — a wacky world to explore is where the internet really thrives — but as Clubhouse matures, it loses that initial creative energy and replaces it with bad actors, boring normies, and the dreaded brands. Twitter and Facebook already know how to anticipate the problems Clubhouse faces. They’ve dealt with these issues on their own platforms and hired accordingly. Clubhouse isn’t even widely available, let alone staffing entire moderation teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="f4y3e9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Why are they advertising Twitter on Clubhouse?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LDk2vE"&gt;The onslaught of the brands could be the worst of Clubhouse, though. Branded rooms could sanitize Clubhouse of the fun it once had and replace it with forced conversation and promotion — like a radio station that only plays commercials. Entire agencies are even popping up to help Clubhouse influencers connect with brands, and already, companies like IHOP are using the platform. In IHOP’s case, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210413005282/en/IHOP%C2%AE-Unveils-New-Steakhouse-Premium-Bacon"&gt;hosting a day-long room&lt;/a&gt; where people can hear the sound of sizzling bacon on repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHBsXV"&gt;Also take, for example, The Cotton Club. Lots of stories mention the group, which hosts a weekly room that pretends to be the famous jazz bar in Harlem. Users change their photos to black and white images of jazz musicians and come onstage to chat. A bartender mixes drinks and changes their profile photo to match what they’re making. It’s genuinely inventive, and the creator of the club, Bomani X, was even the app’s icon for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JFdMK-FyAMoVs1aQbocdgDLfTTo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441726/jbali_20201009_4526_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clubhouse user Kiarash Behain will put on a Jigsaw mask to get into character for his trivia show.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ntBZAW"&gt;But now, The Cotton Club has been branded. I joined the room once in February only to see it advertising the Hulu movie &lt;em&gt;The United States vs. Billie Holiday&lt;/em&gt;. The partnership makes sense; it’s brilliant, actually, but hearing the hosts shout out a hashtag felt wrong. Why are they advertising Twitter on Clubhouse? They also brought director Lee Daniels onstage and asked about the film. Maybe that’s interesting to some people, but it pushes the boundaries of how much promotion people really want to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcatQQ"&gt;Prior to my mansion party, I stopped into the &lt;em&gt;Saw&lt;/em&gt;-themed trivia room. Kiarash Behain impersonates the movies’ murderous clown three times a week and, to get into character, he turns the starry lights in his at-home recording studio red and ominous. He hooks his phone up to his computer so he can control his voice through a soundboard, which allows him to use effects. He’s devised a wide list of ways he could “put people in the dirt,” aka send them back to the audience when they miss a question, and outlines the show ahead of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsbETH"&gt;His show’s been copied in different ways, and he doesn’t sweat it. “My job is just to create a really, really great experience to the point where maybe it can’t be matched,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3qOTCmE_7DsMIXm2tiZ47aYWVSM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441735/jbali_20201009_4526_0015.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“My job is just to create a really, really great experience to the point where maybe it can’t be matched,” says Kiarash Behain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7d46pz"&gt;And when he thinks about the possible branding deals or scammers that come to the platform, cementing the app’s place in the digital creator ecosystem, he says Clubhouse has a key advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKQwsq"&gt;“You can really read somebody’s voice as if it’s like DNA,” he says. “So if somebody is lying you can tell. If somebody is pure and has great intentions, you can tell through their voice and Clubhouse really, really sells that dynamic very well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="aosC8f"&gt;I loved the &lt;em&gt;Saw &lt;/em&gt;trivia room when I dropped in, but I wonder how long the novelty will last, particularly as Clubhouse becomes more of a corporatized machine. I can imagine a world, for example, where the owners of the &lt;em&gt;Saw&lt;/em&gt; franchise issue a takedown request against Behain for using their intellectual property — if the shtick doesn’t get old by then. Maybe the thousands of people who join the room might actually want to go to trivia at a real bar when this pandemic ends. Or perhaps the platform gets eaten by Facebook or Twitter. It’s easy to envision these possibilities when various platforms have already played out the trajectory. They all set out to change how we communicate, and ultimately, their stories end up sounding exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
