    <title>Google HR reportedly advised mental health leave in response to complaints of racist or sexist behavior</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFuzJs"&gt;Several current and former Google employees say the company’s human resources department would often suggest mental health counseling or leave in response to complaints about racist or sexist behavior in the workplace, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/google-advised-mental-health-care-when-workers-complained-about-racism-n1259728"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBj8L6"&gt;The workers described encounters with coworkers that included racist comments about skin color and hairstyles, as well as sexual harassment. When they contacted Google’s human resources department, each was encouraged to take mental health leave, even when their complaints were unrelated to mental health concerns, according to &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ee9qYa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Timnit Gebru was fired from Google — then the harassers arrived","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22309962/timnit-gebru-google-harassment-campaign-jeff-dean"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gdZRKY"&gt;The report follows the December firing of Google AI ethics researcher Timnit Gebru, who refused a manager’s request to retract a paper that described the dangers of language models like the ones Google relies on to power its search engine. Gebru wrote an &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical"&gt;email to the Brain Women and Allies listserv&lt;/a&gt; describing her frustration over the paper, and mentioned her doubts about Google’s commitments to diversity and inclusion. She says Google told her the email was “inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.” Google’s head of AI claimed Gebru resigned, which she has vehemently disputed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEk5bs"&gt;And April Christina Curley, a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/second-top-black-female-google-employee-says-she-was-ousted-n1252277"&gt;Black woman who worked as a diversity recruiter&lt;/a&gt; for Google, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RealAbril/status/1341135824730013696"&gt;said she was fired in September&lt;/a&gt; after being denied promotions and having her pay cut, despite her strong work performance and her successful recruitment of hundreds of students from historically Black colleges and universities to Google’s engineering department. Curley told &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt; she was also encouraged to take mental health leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k94uS1"&gt;Google did not immediately reply to a request for comment Sunday, but a spokeswoman told &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; that “all concerns reported to us are investigated rigorously, and we take firm action against employees who violate our policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xuPj25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple mixed-reality headset likely coming sometime in 2022, analyst predicts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GM6j7JAfkcWWDb-2Kqv5qjSxH0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68925839/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rC9zwg"&gt;Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts in a new research note that Apple will release a “helmet-type” mixed reality headset next year, augmented reality glasses in mid-2025, and an AR contact lens product by 2030-2040, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/07/kuo-apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jLmg9"&gt;“We foresee that the helmet product will provide AR and VR experiences, while glasses and contact lens types of products are more likely to focus on AR applications,” Kuo writes in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAGYsV"&gt;While several prototypes of Apple’s mixed reality headset weigh between 200 and 300 grams, Kuo says, if Apple can solve some technical problems the headset could end up weighing between 100 and 200 grams, &lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reported. He added that the headset will likely be priced in the $1,000 range in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERZ1mP"&gt;The headset will be able to offer an immersive experience Kuo says will be “significantly better” than those on the market now, with Sony micro-OLED displays, and should be able to run independently of an iPhone, “more like a portable product” than a mobile one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8b5abT"&gt;Kuo’s note is mostly in line with other predictions of a headset &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;hitting the market sometime in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, but with the price tag closer to $3,000. &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last month that Apple was using a fabric mesh material to reduce the weight of the headset, and had a rendering based on “internal Apple images of a late-stage prototype” that showed what the headset might look like. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says Tesla is expanding its Full Self Driving beta to more drivers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YjcbGl3YN-MVwupcqS-ueHAg8YA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68925714/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sHoO9G"&gt;Tesla is expanding its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) beta, CEO Elon Musk said, doubling its size with a new software update, and eventually increasing the number of participants tenfold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6S441d"&gt;“Still be careful, but it’s getting mature,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1368017749851598850?s=20"&gt;Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Friday. He said Saturday that Tesla would add a “download beta” button to Tesla displays in the coming days “due to high levels of demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iiLwMh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Due to high levels of demand for FSD Beta, adding “Download Beta” button to Service section of car display in ~10 days &lt;a href="https://t.co/D6M3ZiMarG"&gt;https://t.co/D6M3ZiMarG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1368329387733512193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hOxxvV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527577/tesla-full-self-driving-autopilot-beta-software-update"&gt;Tesla first introduced the FSD beta in October&lt;/a&gt; to vehicle owners in its Early Access Program. At the time, Musk said the company was handling the software update “very cautiously.” Drivers still are expected to keep their hands on the steering wheel and should be prepared to assume control of their Tesla at any time. Tesla uses the data from the FSB beta to improve performance, and &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/05/elon-musk-tesla-doubling-size-full-self-driving-beta-program/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Electrek.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Musk said last month there were about 1,000 vehicles in the beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FofUkD"&gt;Musk noted that in Tesla’s case, the term “beta is used to reduce complacency in usage and set expectations appropriately. All software is first tested by Tesla simulation and QA drive teams.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRUACv"&gt;He added that availability of the FSD beta will vary by region, due to what he called regulatory approval delays and Tesla’s own internal development and testing. Tesla’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1368249032783491079?s=21"&gt;director of AI tweeted Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla owners interested in participating in the beta should email earlyaccess@tesla.com,  which he says the company is using to coordinate the program&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tom King’s Vision comics are the perfect follow-up to WandaVision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPw5KBlv6BG4uqk8z5WNrLaO3GY=/0x2:975x652/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68925488/vision.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f6wu9V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comics have never been bigger: with Marvel TV shows, DC movies, and indie adaptations growing by the day, comic books have never been more prominent in pop culture. This weekly Verge column recommends comic series new and old, whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bivWz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315094/wandavision-finale-marvel-mcu-scarlet-witch-doctor-strange-captain"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s season finale has hit Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’ve got a hankering for more surreal suburban comic book drama, look no further than &lt;em&gt;Vision&lt;/em&gt;, a 12-issue run from writer Tom King and artist Gabriel Hernandez Walta, which explores further the idea of a superhero trying to step back and start a family — no matter the cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQefD6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vision&lt;/em&gt; is a 12-issue comic series. While it lightly ties into the character’s past history over decades of comics, it’s largely a standalone story: Vision moves to the DC suburbs, and (literally) makes a family: a wife, Virginia, and two teenage kids, Viv and Vin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmuT7m"&gt;Issue one drops readers right into the mix alongside the newly minted synthezoid family. Vision is trying to juggle his work as an Avenger (and as the superhero group’s government liaison) and as a new father and husband; Virginia works to fit into the neighborhood; and the twins struggle with teenage drama of trying to fit in at school (which is particularly hard given their robotic nature and superpowers). Later issues also include Sparky, a particularly adorable synthezoid dog. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZlpKp3XkG8WoorLhshA7V_WduLQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348250/vdc1250_107_comp_v004_r709_a3f29eea.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GHAMCj"&gt;It’s the kind of series that sees Vision battling a gigantic monster alongside the Avengers while also chatting on the phone with Virginia to sort out drama with the twins at school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXoa9R"&gt;But throughout it all is a creeping sense of horror and dread, helped by an unseen narrator that promises throughout the issue that Vision’s seemingly perfect suburban life will end in tears. Things start out relatively benign, like neighbors who are unnerved by the family or a mean spray-painted slogan on the garage, but things quickly devolve into murder cover-ups as Vision and his new family start to get stuck in a web of lies, misunderstandings, and revenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2DVYM"&gt;If you enjoyed the slow burn of &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1008466/9358?subId1=VergeTomKingComics030521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WandaVision&lt;/a&gt;, with super-heroic drama sandwiched between an unnerving illusion of home tranquility, &lt;em&gt;Vision&lt;/em&gt; #1 (and the rest of the run) should offer plenty more fodder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dthY6X"&gt;The series is great for newcomers to Vision as a character, too: interspersed across the run is a reexamination of pivotal moments in the artificial hero’s career, including his relationship with Wanda, their desire for a family, his time as a familiar-looking White Vision that has lost all his memories, and more. For MCU fans that are more familiar with Vision’s on-screen origin, it’s a good look at the original version of the character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVe3Mp"&gt;Ultimately, &lt;em&gt;Vision&lt;/em&gt; is a compelling look at the foibles and follies of people, and an examination of what someone would be willing to do to protect their family. What could be more human than that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yhH1r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s it by?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Vision &lt;/em&gt;was created by writer Tom King (also known for his recent run on &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt; and his acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Mister Miracle&lt;/em&gt; series), artist Gabriel Hernandez Walta, and colorist Jordie Bellaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tg7Okv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"So you want to start reading comics? ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22303444/comics-buying-guide-subscription-comixology-marvel-unlimited-dc-universe-infinite"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wrP0fY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I read it?&lt;/strong&gt; The entire twelve-issue run is available on the &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/unlimited"&gt;Marvel Unlimited subscription service&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vision-Complete-Directors-Cut-ebook/dp/B077ZG3HY4/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;sr=&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;digital collection&lt;/a&gt; is also available from Kindle / Comixology for $6.49, along with paperback and hardcover collections (which are a little pricier and harder to find). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Russian intelligence reportedly used fake news sites to spread misinformation about coronavirus vaccines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fP-Yqerd7gOtIuMxHPHNm49OyAI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68925480/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E5cuEJ"&gt;Four online publications linked to Russian intelligence agencies have been spreading false or misleading information about coronavirus vaccines, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-disinformation-campaign-aims-to-undermine-confidence-in-pfizer-other-covid-19-vaccines-u-s-officials-say-11615129200?mod=e2tw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, citing an official at the US Department of State’s Global Engagement Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZNXSs"&gt;The sites, identified as New Eastern Outlook, Oriental Review, News Front, and Rebel Inside, have emphasized the side effects of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine as well as other western pharma companies’ vaccines, stoking concerns about whether the vaccines are effective or had been rushed through the US approval process, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lbQqG"&gt;The sites don’t have large audiences, but officials said their false stories are often picked up and circulated by international media. They typically focus on true news reports about rare side effects of the vaccines, but fail to provide accurate context that shows the vaccines are safe for most people. “Russian intelligence services bear direct responsibility for using these four platforms to spread propaganda and lies,” a State Department spokesman told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSIICA"&gt;In addition to the campaign to discredit Western vaccines, Russia’s state media and Twitter accounts connected to the Russian government are also trying to boost the profile of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWOF25"&gt;A spokesperson for the Kremlin denied the allegations to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCw3wX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/russia-s-claim-successful-covid-19-vaccine-doesn-t-pass-smell-test-critics-say"&gt;Russia announced in November&lt;/a&gt; that its Sputnik V vaccine had efficacy of 90 percent, but critics said the clinical trials of the vaccine on patients were too small. However, British medical journal &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00191-4/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last month that larger-scale testing had found Sputnik V was safe, and had a 91 percent efficacy rate. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-global-trade-middle-east-diplomacy-moscow-e61ebd3c8fe746c60f5ecc1ec323c99a"&gt;According to the&lt;em&gt; Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; as of late February only 4 million people in Russia— about 3 percent of the population— had been vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The most powerful Wear OS watches are held back by Wear OS</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Android users still can’t get anything as good as the Apple Watch&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8JIy2S"&gt;For the past month, I’ve been testing the two most powerful Wear OS watches you can buy: the TicWatch Pro 3 from Mobvoi and the Fossil Gen 5 LTE. They’re not spec-for-spec identical, but they do share a basic shape: big, chunky, round, and black. If you’re using Android and want a smartwatch, they’re at the top of a persistently tiny list of top-flight smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7Zd3b"&gt;Despite Wear OS’s reputation, both watches are perfectly competent and can do the basics of what many people want out of a smartwatch. Both also offer what I’d characterize as acceptable battery life: a full day most of the time, two at a stretch. The TicWatch can actually go much longer, thanks to a clever second screen layered on top of the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCNKNu"&gt;But Wear OS does have that reputation: for years, watches that ran it have been slow, ran out of battery life quickly, and suffered from a tiny ecosystem of apps. Some of those problems have been solved, but that doesn’t mean that these watches (or, honestly, any smartwatch available to Android owners) lives up to the polish and features iPhone users can get with the Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1vJz9"&gt;The Apple Watch comparison isn’t really useful for Android users — it’s not and probably never will be an option. Instead, let’s just look at these two watches on their own terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Mobvoi TicWatch 3 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kts0fR4e5rhqCadWxU7nIfmFjCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21998689/dbohn_201028_4270_0002.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mobvoi TicWatch 3 Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jjI83C"&gt;TicWatch Pro 3 review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="j02eF6"&gt;At $299.99, the TicWatch Pro 3 is not an impulse buy. But the price is about right for what Mobvoi has created. It has pushed the limits of what Wear OS can do in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ni0LzI"&gt;First, it has crammed the best technology it could get for a Wear OS device in here. One big differentiator for the TicWatch Pro 3 is that it is the only watch using Qualcomm’s latest smartwatch processor, the Snapdragon 4100. (More from Motorola and possibly OnePlus have been rumored to be coming this year.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="gihATw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374880"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1rlNQ9"&gt;That processor makes the watch faster than other Wear OS devices — though it still can sometimes feel a step behind both Samsung’s Tizen-based watches and even Fitbits. It also accounts for some of the TicWatch’s battery life, which I’ve found can last two and even three days with all the bells and whistles turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qfPhz6"&gt;The second thing Mobvoi has done to push Wear OS is add a bunch of bells and whistles to make up for the platform’s missing features. The main thing it’s done is put an LCD panel on top of the regular OLED screen. This allows the TicWatch to go into a low power mode when it’s on standby and a super-low power mode when you need it to last for more than a few days on a charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tl87Ni"&gt;Wear OS powers its fitness offerings with Google Fit, which has seen a few updates but is very far behind Apple’s fitness offerings. Mobvoi can’t fix that, but it has tried to fill in the gaps with its own suite of fitness apps on the watch. It even includes a blood oxygen sensor — though it’s no more accurate than the norm for smartwatches, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21504023/apple-watch-ekg-blood-oxygen-fda-clearance"&gt;which isn’t very good&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xe5bop"&gt;However, using them requires you to place a large amount of trust in Mobvoi the company — as the watch makes perfectly clear when you try to launch these apps, there’s no way to do that without sharing a bunch of information with Mobvoi. I applaud the transparency, but that still wasn’t enough to make me comfortable with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W34wt2"&gt;One thing to keep in mind with the TicWatch Pro 3: its aesthetics. It’s unapologetically a big, chunky watch. I don’t have huge wrists and it absolutely feels dominated by this thing. It is “honest” in its design, at least, in that it isn’t trying to look like a fancier watch than it is — right on down to the matte plastic lugs that hold the replaceable straps in place. I also wish it had a rotating crown for scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woqBmV"&gt;I ended up using the TicWatch Pro 3 like a bog standard Wear OS watch in the end, turning off its extra screen and sticking to Google Fit for fitness data. It absolutely did the job, but at $299 I think most people would be better off considering other options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUPAkp"&gt;There is only one spec that the TicWatch lacks: LTE. For that, you’ll need to buy the Fossil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fQOuBy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10374869"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Fossil Gen 5 LTE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JIBXFfhClMo137vzp0QgkihCHqk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22346215/DSC02572_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fossil Gen 5 LTE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6aYjUT"&gt;Fossil Gen 5 LTE review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="r3UOSx"&gt;I reviewed the original &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20835364/fossil-wear-os-smartwatch-android-gen-5-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Fossil Gen 5 smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, and I called it the “best of a Wear OS situation.” I think that (dubious) honor now goes to the TicWatch Pro 3, but if you need LTE, the $349 Fossil Gen 5 is one of two options you’ve got on Android (the other is Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 3 LTE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9grr4o"&gt;Fortunately, the Fossil Gen 5 is essentially unchanged by the addition of LTE. If you’re willing to pay your carrier the extra monthly charges to turn it on, using the Gen 5 with LTE felt virtually the same as using it with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvz6s1"&gt;Even battery life didn’t seem to be a problem. I did notice the watch was more likely to hit two full days with LTE turned off, but I usually didn’t manage to drain it in a single day even when using mostly LTE. Sadly, Fossil also feels as though it needs to make up for Wear OS’s shortcomings by keeping its entirely too complicated battery saver features. A watch should never require users to dig into granular radio toggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ji1cnG"&gt;It does still use the older Snapdragon 3100 processor, though it didn’t feel particularly slow as a result. Aesthetically, it’s very slightly different from the regular Fossil Gen 5 Carlyle that I own and it’s not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much smaller than the TicWatch, but subtle differences make it look just a little more premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erRx07"&gt;All in all, if you must have an LTE smartwatch and you use Android, this is your best option if you really prefer Wear OS to Tizen. If you’re agnostic, I think the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368752/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy Watch 3 with LTE is probably a better choice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="JuXsr6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374915"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="2LQ1WT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10374870"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Wear OS watches" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QkEjmOfbSAu7BNtY6H9bDrOcmas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22346216/DSC02550_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wear OS watches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7B4rWR"&gt;As I’ve been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17277608/android-wear-os-gear-sport-fitbit-versa-skagen-smartwatch"&gt;harping on for three years now, every smartwatch for Android involves some kind of compromise&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ueQnD"&gt;Samsung watches need a lot more apps and require you to install a lot of extra stuff on your phone to get them working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nzk8F7"&gt;Fitbits are great for fitness but not so great at integrating into Android. There’s also the not-so-little matter about the company now being owned by Google’s hardware division. The future of the entire Fitbit ecosystem is sort of up in the air right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PlRVEt"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Android deserves better smartwatches. Here’s why|37724" data-volume-uuid="af3b4b5b6" data-volume-id="37724" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-893" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mkqVcE"&gt;And honestly, the future of Wear OS is also up in the air. There’s little movement lately in app support and though Google has done a decent enough job keeping the OS from falling into utter decay, it hasn’t done much more than that. It’s overdue for an overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7iYHj"&gt;There are likely more Wear OS watches coming that might be worth waiting for, but the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 remains the best option for traditional smartwatch stuff. At the end of the day, it’s difficult to recommend anybody spend three or four hundred dollars to get on board the rudderless Wear OS boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="vhGwiu"&gt;Both the TicWatch Pro 3 and the Fossil Gen 5 LTE are good enough smartwatches for what they are. It’s just that what they are is the best of an old platform with a questionable future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft starts testing Edge Chromium browser on Xbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ng0C_Ke6FR5p2_gqweU0iLn3OA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68925221/acastro_180604_1777_xbox_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yzft4k"&gt;Microsoft has started publicly testing its new Edge Chromium-powered browser on Xbox consoles. Xbox testers in the Alpha Skip-Ahead group can now access the new Microsoft Edge on Xbox One or Xbox Series S / X consoles. While full mouse and keyboard support is still missing, the browser works as you’d expect with an Xbox controller, albeit a little buggy in this initial test version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMHTpc"&gt;A Chromium browser on Xbox is a boost for those wanting to access websites through their console. Edge will also now provide access to Google’s Stadia streaming service, thanks to the improved compatibility support with Chromium. It should also improve compatibility with browser-based games, and services like Skype or Discord through the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QF2cOt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;the latest Xbox Alpha skip ahead build includes the Chromium version of Microsoft Edge &lt;a href="https://t.co/C34d59UYuJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/C34d59UYuJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1368016548082941955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hMq7xZ"&gt;This early test version appears to include the same sync engine used across Edge, with support for extensions, vertical tabs, Collections, and most Edge desktop features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLYSoY"&gt;Support for the existing legacy version of Microsoft Edge on Windows desktops ends on March 9th, and Microsoft’s testing of this updated browser suggests it will arrive on all Xbox consoles soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What we actually want from an upgraded Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VrIqmvcGTcDrifL0I5ZeYDH6Was=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68925147/jbareham_1492_170228_0097.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TEl2ba"&gt;Rumors about a long-desired upgrade to the Nintendo Switch have been swirling for some time, and this week, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported that this fabled new Switch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;might actually be coming soon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mT4Nzi"&gt;This upgraded Switch will apparently have a 7-inch 720p OLED screen that can output 4K graphics when connected to a TV, according to the report. An OLED screen would be a major upgrade from the Switch and Switch Lite’s LCD, likely providing deeper colors and darker blacks. And the 4K output would be a big jump, too; right now, the current Switch &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/tech-specs/"&gt;tops out at a 1080p resolution&lt;/a&gt; when hooked up to a TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky1T2z"&gt;But a lot of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; still like our existing Switches quite a bit, even those of us with the launch model that debuted four years ago this week. The changes we’re clamoring for aren’t necessarily an OLED screen or additional performance. (In fact, it might be annoying if additional horsepower led to Switch Pro-exclusive games &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:New_Nintendo_3DS_games"&gt;like when Nintendo introduced&lt;/a&gt; the New Nintendo 3DS.) And while more battery life would always be appreciated, we’re mostly hoping it just doesn’t dip below the bar Nintendo set &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20802539/nintendo-switch-v2-new-updated-battery-console-how-to-buy"&gt;with the Switch v2 revision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUf6DV"&gt;Here’s our list.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W0fWBZVTS0YjRJz2rio_rmdQ-i4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8070163/jbareham_1492_170228_0216.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HB40R0"&gt;Better Joy-Cons (and more colors)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0uOWsN"&gt;The Switch’s Joy-Con controllers, while a creative design that offers more ways to play the console &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a handy way to get two controllers in every box, have notoriously unreliable thumbsticks, with many users reporting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained"&gt;joystick drift&lt;/a&gt; issues over time. Nintendo &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-president-apologizes-joy-con-drift-161644217.html#:~:text=Nintendo%20President%20Shuntaro%20Furukawa%20apologized,input%20and%20cause%20%E2%80%9Cdrifting.%E2%80%9D"&gt;has said little&lt;/a&gt; about what appears to be a widespread problem, but the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20707849/nintendo-will-reportedly-fix-joy-con-drift-for-free-even-out-of-warranty"&gt;did implement a free repair policy in 2019&lt;/a&gt; for users having issues. Nintendo also didn’t use the launches of the Switch Lite and the second revision of the current Switch to fix drift issues, so they’re still ongoing — this could be another chance for Nintendo to make it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PY528o"&gt;Other changes could simply make the Joy-Cons better controllers. Putting a real D-pad on the left Joy-Con, similar to the D-pad on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Nintendo Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt;, might make playing platformers and fighting games a lot easier than mashing the left Joy-Con’s current four-button design. Slightly bigger shoulder triggers could make the Switch easier to hold in your hands. And I’d really like more colors — perhaps Nintendo could offer an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451767/xbox-design-lab-temporarily-shutting-down-october-14-microsoft"&gt;Xbox Design Lab-like&lt;/a&gt; way to deck out my Switch and its Joy-Cons when I buy it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pftzyD"&gt;Bluetooth headphone support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ShudNn"&gt;Using Bluetooth headphones with your Switch is surprisingly hard: you’ve got to buy and plug a third-party Bluetooth adapter into the headphone jack, the console’s USB-C port, or the Switch’s docking station. (Even though &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/3/7/14842312/nintendo-switch-joy-con-controller-pc-mac-android"&gt;the Joy-Cons use Bluetooth&lt;/a&gt;, the Switch has never come with Bluetooth audio support.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0knA3M"&gt;The demand for Bluetooth audio was so strong a whole cottage industry of third-party adapters has sprung up — just search “Nintendo Switch Bluetooth adapter” &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=nintendo+switch+bluetooth+adapter&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1"&gt;on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; to see some of the many offerings available. But even if you buy, most of these dongles awkwardly stick out of the console’s USB-C port, requiring you to remove them to charge, and some feel like they could snap off if you aren’t looking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFfeH3"&gt;A Switch with native support for Bluetooth headphones might be particularly nice for playing in bed, no extra dongle or wired earbuds required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tqK4oN"&gt;A Quick Resume-like feature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="V5XwjF"&gt;We’ve really liked &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/game-setup-and-play/get-back-to-your-game-instantly-with-quick-resume"&gt;Quick Resume&lt;/a&gt; on the Xbox Series X / S, which lets you swap between games without having to boot them from scratch before getting back to where you left off. We think the Switch would really benefit from a similar feature, especially since it has so many games that you can jump into for a few minutes at a time. Imagine hopping from a visit to your friend’s &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; island to a &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; run to a quick bout in &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, all without having to wait for the games to cold boot each time — sounds great, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QERgdp"&gt;One &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor would also really, really like not to have to find a save point in his JRPG every time their partner wants to tidy up their &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; island.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pCgmGY"&gt;A better kickstand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6SKe6w"&gt;The current Switch’s kickstand seemed like a good idea at first, but in practice, it isn’t quite as useful as we had hoped. It’s small, unstable, only clicks into one angle, and, terrifyingly, snaps off rather easily (though it’s easy to put back on). That means the kickstand works best on flat and still surfaces at only one angle — which hasn’t been all that great for many situations where we’ve actually wanted to stand up the Switch, like on an airplane or in the backseat of a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eICfug"&gt;One thing many of us really want is for Nintendo to fix this with a bigger, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10"&gt;Microsoft Surface-style kickstand&lt;/a&gt;. Not only would that make the console much more stable stood up, but it could also be adjusted to many different viewing angles, which could be really handy for things like backseat &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt; races.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6gFFjvyQoBV_dNtlxay9Juqcxv0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8070167/jbareham_1492_170228_0173.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zEvCSD"&gt;Glass screen and smaller bezels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OHrr2A"&gt;The current Switch has a plastic screen that scratches very easily — many &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers have immediately slapped inexpensive tempered glass screen protectors on their consoles to avoid permanent scuffs. A lot of us are hoping Nintendo adds a glass screen to this new model that’s more scratch-resistant so we don’t need to add our own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LdY8y"&gt;A bigger screen hopefully means that we’ll see smaller bezels, too, which would give the console a more premium feel. The current Switch has giant black bezels that reveal just how much space &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; still be filled by screen. And if you’ve used the Nintendo Switch Lite, while it has a smaller screen, the bezels also aren’t as prominent, which makes the Lite’s screen’s smaller size less obvious. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TMLUphZCH0sdV_e6GNIUR9XijzE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10545513/jbareham_1492_170228_0078.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HradIB"&gt;An upgraded dock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5fdY50"&gt;The Switch’s current dock works well enough — it gives the Switch a place to charge and helps the console connect to the TV — but we’d like it more if it was smaller, had magnets to make the Switch just a bit more secure, and a built-in Ethernet port, since plugging in a USB-A to Ethernet adapter to get wired internet is a clunky solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="at8wD8"&gt;A good name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="L8m9br"&gt;Nintendo isn’t exactly known for easy-to-remember hardware names. This is the company that signified an entirely new console generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/18/3658130/nintendo-wii-u-review"&gt;with the letter U&lt;/a&gt;, released a handheld called the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/5/15549048/new-nintendo-2ds-xl-video-photos-preivew-vs-3ds-xl"&gt;New Nintendo 2DS XL&lt;/a&gt;, and released a smaller version of the Switch that can’t actually “switch” at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJDEB6"&gt;While it seems likely Nintendo will just call it the “Switch Pro” or “Switch Plus” or maybe the “Super Nintendo Switch” for fun, we thought we’d also come up with a few names Nintendo can throw in the trash right now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Jpy5Yy"&gt;Nintendo Switch Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CKsU8V"&gt;New Nintendo Switch i XL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mw7wBd"&gt;Nintendo Switch VII Remake Intergrade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y03VOz"&gt;Nintendo Switch HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue 358/2 days χ[Chi] øø™&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bAO526"&gt;$witch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="a6WW2T"&gt;The SwitcherU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NdSvIx"&gt;2 Nintendo 2 Switch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u7J7k3"&gt;Nintendo Swiitch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OjELV1"&gt;Nimtenbo Swantch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ilx9Xn"&gt;Nintendo Switch 3(+ months between game releases)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BA2Dc0"&gt;Swii&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T9Jwr5"&gt;Netflix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="O8IY1W"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, which turned four years old this week, still doesn’t have a Netflix app. Perhaps the added potential horsepower of a 4K-enabled Switch means we’ll finally be able to watch &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California gives OK for Disneyland and other theme parks to reopen April 1st, with restrictions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SBoOB8"&gt;Disneyland, Universal Studios other theme parks, and sports stadiums in California can reopen beginning April 1st, the California Department of Public Health said Friday. But there are caveats: the health department is requiring “significantly reduced capacity, mandatory masking and other public health precautions” due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhdl2X"&gt;How many people will be allowed in the parks depends on the number of COVID-19 cases in the counties where they’re located. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X05Wzk"&gt;For amusement parks, counties in the “red” tier of &lt;a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/"&gt;California’s four-tier reopening risk system&lt;/a&gt;— red is the second-highest risk category— will be limited to attendance of 15 percent capacity. In the orange tier, the limit increases to 25 percent capacity and in the yellow tier, to 35 percent. Attendance will be restricted to in-state visitors. Disneyland is in &lt;a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/"&gt;Orange County&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently in the highest-risk “purple” tier, but &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/orange-county-tier-oc-covid-when-will-move-tiers/10382796/"&gt;local news reports suggest&lt;/a&gt; it may soon move down to the red tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqJFMJ"&gt;Outdoor sports and live performance venues in California have a slightly different set of reopening criteria, and some will be able to reopen even if their counties are in the highest-risk purple tier, but with similar limits on capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mawxdu"&gt;“With case rates and hospitalizations significantly lower, the arrival of three highly effective vaccines and targeted efforts aimed at vaccinating the most vulnerable communities, California can begin gradually and safely bringing back more activities, especially those that occur outdoors and where consistent masking is possible,” Dr. Mark Ghaly, secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndyJwM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21176494/disney-parks-world-land-coronavirus-covid19-closure-california-florida-paris"&gt;Disneyland closed March 14th, 2020 &lt;/a&gt;as coronavirus cases spread across the US. &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disneyland-to-furlough-more-employees-including-executives"&gt;Disney laid off thousands&lt;/a&gt; of theme park employees, and has taken a significant financial hit as a result of the closures. In its most recent fiscal quarter, revenue for Disney’s parks division revenue was down 53 percent, to $3.6 billion, the &lt;a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2021/02/q1-fy21-earnings.pdf"&gt;company reported&lt;/a&gt;. The company said during a February call with investors that it estimated “the total net adverse impact of COVID-19 on segment operating income in the quarter was approximately $2.6 billion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NfwOw"&gt;Disney World in Florida also closed last March and reopened in July in limited capacity and with restrictions. But California has taken a more cautious approach to rolling back pandemic restrictions than Florida, even as Disney executives have been &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disneyland-v-gov-newsom-when-will-the-standoff-over-reopening-end?"&gt;pushing California officials&lt;/a&gt; to allow theme parks and other venues to reopen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KodPfO"&gt;Ken Potrock, president of the Disneyland Resort, said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DisneyParksNews/status/1367974539397795844?s=20"&gt;statement posted to Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that with the new reopening date, Disneyland would be “getting thousands of people back to work and greatly helping neighboring businesses and our entire community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sregNO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos Roam will include Auto Trueplay and new ‘Sound Swap’ feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FrL_ophK17SeThnILXlfk7LY75A=/0x0:2228x1485/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68923126/RoamMove.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zLT5J8"&gt;On Tuesday, Sonos will introduce its latest product called the Sonos Roam, which &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313451/sonos-roam-leak-features-specs-price-release-date"&gt;extensively detailed&lt;/a&gt; a couple of days ago. Now I’m able to share a bit more about new functionality that will debut first on the tiny, take-everywhere speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35YEEt"&gt;My previous report laid out the core specs of the Sonos Roam. Measuring 6.5 inches long and weighing around a pound, the portable speaker will offer up to 10 hours of battery life on a charge. Just like the Move, it will support voice commands for either Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. Sonos plans to sell it for $169, and the Roam will ship in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzQ1oG"&gt;But now on to the new stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jCVYTL"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Sonos Roam will include automatic Trueplay.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like the pricier, larger Move, Sonos is building its Auto Trueplay audio tuning feature right into the Roam. The speaker will use its built-in microphones to calibrate performance based on its surrounding environment. This can make a real difference in echoey rooms. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LPZZTH"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You can play songs over Bluetooth to your entire Sonos system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sonos has designed the Roam so that it can use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth simultaneously (with the Move, you had to choose one or the other). Connecting to both at once will allow you to play a song from your phone or another device nearby to the Roam over Bluetooth — and that music can then also be played across the rest of your Sonos multi-room system. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aosi8C"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“Sound Swap” will let you pass off music from the Roam to another Sonos speaker. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another new feature that’s exclusive to the Roam is what Sonos will call Sound Swap. If you hold down the play/pause button, the Roam will send the music it’s currently playing to whatever Sonos speaker is nearby. I don’t know the full details on this one, but my guess is that it involves using Bluetooth Low Energy to figure out which speaker is closest. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ShxfCF"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Roam is rated IP67 for dust and water resistance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;This means it is fully dustproof and waterproof in up to one meter of water for up to 30 minutes. That puts the Roam on equal footing with the popular UE Wonderboom speaker. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Fc2z5"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;No, you can’t use it as a surround speaker for the Sonos Arc or Beam.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Roam can’t be used as part of a Sonos home theater setup. That’s not altogether surprising, since the same was true of the Move. If you’re looking for cheap surrounds for a Beam or Arc, your best options remain the One SL or the Ikea Symfonisk bookshelf speakers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="wLvbjG"&gt;The photo at the top of this story is another new image that makes for an easy size comparison between the Roam and the larger, more expensive Sonos Move. And here’s what the optional wireless charger looks like: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iVdxg7JJW1av5x3MYjAvFrnsvQ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22350345/roamwirelesscharger.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AnETdy"&gt;The biggest question I can’t answer is how this thing sounds. Can Sonos make good on its sound quality track record with a speaker this small? I’m optimistic the answer will be yes — but don’t expect miracles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvxSKd"&gt;Automatic Trueplay could help the Roam set itself apart from many of the Bluetooth speakers it will compete against. A UE Boom or JBL Charge will always sound the same no matter where you place them. But if the Roam can adapt in noticeable ways to its surroundings, that’ll be a differentiator. And that Sound Swap trick sure sounds like it would be useful for an eventual pair of Sonos headphones...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryMO8h"&gt;We’ll be covering any other news Sonos has to share on March 9th. Just in case there are still some surprises on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
