    <title>Fortnite teases concert series with ‘record-breaking superstar’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S0YbpdPk_mGiwovKAZxmVdcfS0w=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69650412/en_17br_rifttour_announce_02_social_1920x1080_5b4f459e74fc.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h1XhRD"&gt;The next big &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; concert is happening very soon — but who will be performing remains a mystery. Developer Epic &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-presents-the-rift-tour"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; an event called the Rift Tour, which will take place from August 6th to the 8th, with a series of events across different time zones. It’s described as “a musical journey into magical new realities where &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and a record-breaking superstar collide.” Epic previously teased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595880/fortnite-alien-event-date-chapter-2-season-7"&gt;an alien-themed event&lt;/a&gt; happening on August 6th with an in-game countdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fE66zF"&gt;Who that superstar is remains to be seen. &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-20-huge-fortnite-leak-points-to-upcoming-ariana-grande-concert"&gt;Recent rumors&lt;/a&gt; suggest that Ariana Grande could be the next performer to take &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s virtual stage. She would join the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208223/fortnite-epic-games-marshmello-concert-exciting-bizarre-future-music"&gt;Marshmello&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; performances have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233946/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-record-breaking-player-count"&gt;some of the most popular in-game events to date&lt;/a&gt;. Epic says that “we’ll be sharing more big news on the Rift Tour” on August 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGFZZU"&gt;In the meantime, starting today there are a series of in-game challenges — one of which involves visiting a “party UFO” — where players can unlock concert-related freebies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb’s new tool makes it easier for hosts to list Wi-Fi speeds for remote work getaways</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bsscWF3CzQrinBs5MQ-zlMqaXk=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69650314/Airbnb_Logo_Over_Gradient.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eG3iXu"&gt;Airbnb is &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/new-tool-check-the-wifi-speed-in-your-airbnb-listing-before-you-book/"&gt;adding a new tool for hosts&lt;/a&gt; that will let them easily test and list their Wi-Fi speeds on listings. The new addition is in recognization of the fact that — particularly with the current remote work and school model — customers are renting Airbnb properties not just for vacations but for working trips that provide a change of scenery. In that vein, knowing that you’ll actually be able to have strong internet when you’re booking is a useful feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6N7Bm"&gt;While it’s been possible for hosts to list Wi-Fi speeds or share screenshots of speed tests before, the new tool is &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fhelp%2Farticle%2F3003%2Fverify-your-internet-speed&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;integrated directly into Airbnb’s app&lt;/a&gt; (using &lt;a href="https://www.measurementlab.net/"&gt;M-Lab’s open-source software&lt;/a&gt;) and allows for Wi-Fi speed to be displayed directly on a listing alongside other information about a property.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b1y5dHHYjBCQFcZXswM8LeYBtZc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748230/Screen_Shot_2021_07_29_at_10.24.37_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hlHYCi"&gt;And by utilizing a standardized test that’s built into its app, Airbnb can help make sure that customers will actually be getting an accurate picture of what to expect at the property: hosts can only display the results that the Airbnb app’s speed test actually finds, instead of inflating or rounding up numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c80phD"&gt;The new speed test feature is rolling out now in the US and will expand globally “in the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jodie Whittaker’s run on Doctor Who will end in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/47nc7WafCxH7MhnRQPgBqnhJS3A=/57x0:672x410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69650300/2g90j0k80001000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: BBC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1YBZ4o"&gt;The Thirteenth Doctor is set to step away. Today, the BBC announced that Jodie Whittaker, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/16/15973556/jodie-whittaker-bbc-doctor-who-thirteenth-series-eleven-2018-tardis"&gt;who took over as the first female lead in Doctor Who in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, will end her run on the show in 2022. Showrunner Chris Chibnall will also be leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ORFIV"&gt;“My heart is so full of love for this show, for the team who make it, for the fans who watch it and for what it has brought to my life,” &lt;a href="https://www.doctorwho.tv/news/?article=jodie-whittaker-chris-chibnall-leave-doctor-who#_"&gt;Whittaker said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “And I cannot thank Chris enough for entrusting me with his incredible stories. We knew that we wanted to ride this wave side by side, and pass on the baton together. So here we are, weeks away from wrapping on the best job I have ever had. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to express what this role has given me. I will carry the Doctor and the lessons I’ve learnt forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="79K2Ml"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“My heart is so full of love for this show.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cg2eUw"&gt;That said, there’s still plenty of Whittaker-led &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; in store between now and then. At SDCC, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/25/22593232/doctor-who-series-13-teaser-trailer-story"&gt;it was revealed that the show’s delayed Series 13 would tell a single story&lt;/a&gt;; it’s expected to debut later this year, though there’s no specific date yet. In addition to that, there are two specials planned for 2022, and the BBC said today that the broadcaster “has now asked for an additional final feature length adventure for the Thirteenth Doctor, to form a trio of specials for 2022, before the Doctor regenerates once more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jveEZW"&gt;Now comes one of the most exciting parts of being a &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; fan: speculating who will take over next.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airports have a wildlife problem (and vice versa) </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IUf2cQuNQFE8NbdmEAi-VURlhUY=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69650024/VRG_SCI_207_AirportWildlife_v5.01_06_27_22.Still020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HvslAz"&gt;Every summer, hundreds of diamondback terrapins crawl over to New York’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;John F. Kennedy International Airport to lay their eggs. In past years, the turtles have been so obstructive, they’ve caused &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/turtles-turn-jfk-air-traffic-crawl/story?id=13957355"&gt;flight delays&lt;/a&gt;. To manage situations like these, airports&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;like JFK&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have entire departments dedicated to keeping wildlife and planes out of each other’s way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0gqhl"&gt;While keeping the tarmac clear of turtles allows airports to operate smoothly, the real danger looms in the skies. On average, over 10,000 wildlife strikes are reported each year to the Federal Aviation Administration, most of them birds. As more planes take to the skies&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the number of bird strikes has&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wildlife.faa.gov/home"&gt;trended upward&lt;/a&gt; at an alarming rate,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;threatening to damage planes, or worse, cause catastrophic engine failure during takeoff, like the infamous &lt;a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR1003.pdf"&gt;American Airlines Flight 1549&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y3lw1d"&gt;To keep interactions between planes and wildlife&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;from turning deadly, specialists employ a range of tactics from habitat management to sequencing bird DNA. But can they keep up with the pace of travel? &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;joined a wildlife biologist on the runway at JFK, and an expert in feather forensics at the Smithsonian, to find out. Check out our latest video to see what we found — and learn what the word “&lt;em&gt;snarge&lt;/em&gt;” means.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use the PS5’s M.2 SSD expandable storage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m6g0PyyXCb4yHzBhx98T53vBM5Y=/6x0:1994x1325/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69650005/ps5ssd1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PS5 software beta now supports M.2 SSDs.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EqbNni"&gt;Sony has started beta testing the first software update for the PS5 today, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599593/sony-ps5-m2-ssd-support-beta-features"&gt;includes M.2 SSD expandable storage support&lt;/a&gt;. The long-awaited feature is available for testers right now and will launch on all PS5 consoles later this year. We’ll need to test a variety of drives with the PS5, but right now Sony requires at least a PCIe Gen4 SSD, with a minimum capacity of 250GB. Sony is also recommending a drive capable of 5,500MB/s, but slower Gen4 drives may still be supported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLcFL2"&gt;I’ve tested Corsair’s Force MP600 (2TB) with the PS5, which has lower read speeds (4,950MB/s) than Sony recommends, and it’s very easy to get it all up and running in less than two minutes. Here’s how it all works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ctqldW"&gt;To use the expandable storage in the PS5, you’ll need to remove the side panels from the console. Make sure you’ve unplugged the power cord, and then follow this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHZugP--N8Q"&gt;really useful YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; on how to remove the side panels correctly. It’s a little fiddly, but the PS5 is sturdy, so don’t worry you’re not going to snap the panels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LysnTI"&gt;Once you’ve removed both panels, you need to locate the M.2 SSD slot. It’s on the left-hand side of the fan; that’s on the side where the PS5’s disc drive resides. You’ll need a screwdriver to unscrew the cover on the M.2 SSD slot, and to remove a screw that fixes your drive into place. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wKZCeaVSSok78P7ezvnFbOO-aMk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748000/ps5ssd2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s M.2 SSD slot has a screw to fix your drive into place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zeAaai"&gt;Once the cover has been removed, you’ll find a black screw that Sony has supplied at the very top inside the slot. Unscrew this and use it to hold your SSD into place. Sony recommends using an M.2 SSD with a heatsink, so if you’ve purchased a Gen4 one without one, there are a variety of heatsinks you can purchase to affix to SSDs that will help with cooling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vMKAy3"&gt;Now that the M.2 SSD is in place, you can put the cover back on the slot and then gently slide the side panels back into place on either side. Reconnect the power cord, and boot up your PS5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-pUtS16ODVV1WvJqvxenGHAyRcM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748004/photo1627558599.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your SSD isn’t compatible, you’ll get this message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vi3lgH"&gt;If your M.2 SSD isn’t compatible, you’ll be met with a warning from your PS5 that you need a Gen4 drive with at least 256GB of space. Otherwise, you’ll need to go ahead and format the drive for use on the PS5. Make sure you’ve backed up any data on the drive if you’ve been using it in other systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tRftou"&gt;Formatting took less than 10 seconds on my Corsair Force MP600 (2TB) drive. Once formatting has been completed, the PS5 will quickly test the drive speed and warn you that if you have issues with a game installed on the M.2 SSD, try moving it to the internal storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="F0ii6C"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="PS5 M.2 SSD support|103227" data-volume-uuid="0b152b0a2" data-volume-id="103227" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-176" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="TFM16M"&gt;You can then freely move installed games over to the M.2 SSD storage, or install new games from the PlayStation Store directly to the storage. During testing, it took around 30 seconds to move &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; from the internal storage to the Corsair Force MP600 Pro (2TB) drive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="CUsdKa"&gt;Sony’s new PS5 M.2 SSD support is in beta, so we’re still waiting to hear from SSD manufacturers about all the drives supported. Seagate is the first to confirm FireCuda 530 drives are compatible with the PS5, and we’ve tested Corsair’s Force MP600 to confirm it also works fine on the PS5 (albeit without the heatsink attached). We’ll have more details on supported drives as and when manufacturers confirm their list of SSDs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nikola founder charged with securities fraud over allegedly fake truck demo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n3dLD6koAhhBYEdpXstiChiKKLE=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649948/nikola_world2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2jkAnO"&gt;In Southern District of New York federal court on Thursday, Nikola founder Trevor Milton was &lt;a href="https://t.co/JkbIeBYqqM"&gt;charged with securities fraud&lt;/a&gt;. The charges allege that Milton made a series of materially false claims which portrayed the electric vehicle company Nikola as far closer to releasing a functional product than it actually was, and raising more than $500 million of investment in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3PDD0"&gt;“Milton sold a version of Nikola not as it was – an early stage company with a novel idea to commercialize yet-to-be proven products and technology – but rather as a trail-blazing company that had already achieved many groundbreaking and game-changing milestones,” the indictment alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IkGnwT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Behold, the Nikola One in motion”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oEeeP1"&gt;Specifically, the indictment argues Milton used a staged video to create the false impression its Nikola One semi truck prototype was capable of moving under its own power, when in fact the vehicle was simply rolling downhill. Additionally, Milton falsely claimed the company was producing its own hydrogen fuels at below-market rates and had obtained “billions and billions and billions and billions” of dollars worth of committed truck orders, according to the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nB9u1I"&gt;A nominal rival to Tesla, Nikola &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162886/nikola-public-nasdaq-merger-hydrogen-electric-trucks"&gt;rose to prominence in 2020&lt;/a&gt; with plans for a pickup truck and tractor trailer cab powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Excitement around the trucks peaked that September, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427009/gm-nikola-acquisition-electric-hydrogen-truck"&gt;General Motors announced a $2 billion deal&lt;/a&gt; to acquire an equity stake in the company and assist in the release of its Badger pickup truck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsqY2y"&gt;The excitement was short-lived: less than a week after the plans were announced, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436126/nikola-fraud-allegation-hindenburg-short-seller-electric-truck"&gt;a report from short-seller firm Hindenburg Research&lt;/a&gt; accused the company of fraud. Based on conversations with an anonymous former employee, the report alleged that a much-publicized demonstration had been stage-managed to give the impression that Nikola’s truck was capable of moving under its own power. Instead, the report claimed, “Nikola had the truck towed to the top of a hill on a remote stretch of road and simply filmed it rolling down the hill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUXmYH"&gt;The indictment echoes this claim. “A few weeks before the event, Nikola’s chief engineer informed Milton that the truck would not be functioning at the unveiling event unless the event was postponed,” prosecutors allege. “Milton made the decision to proceed as scheduled with the knowledge that the vehicle to be unveiled would not be functioning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vl5eU3"&gt;The indictment confirms that the truck’s movement was the result of rolling from the top of a hill, and claims the “towing-and-rolling process” was repeated three times to generate footage for the company’s commercial. Some footage was also sped up in editing, which “had the effect of making the Nikola One appear to move faster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuAd4A"&gt;The final version of the video was posted to Nikola’s official YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter accounts with the caption, “Behold, the Nikola One in motion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScynTx"&gt;The indictment also gives more detail on precisely how nonfunctional the vehicle was. Prosecutors say all electrical components in the truck were powered externally (rather than from the truck’s battery), neither the fuel cell nor hydrogen gas storage tanks had been installed, the air compressor and turbine had not been commissioned, the gearboxes had not been assembled, and the vehicle-level controls were not complete. The dashboard interface that Milton appeared to use to start the truck was an off-the-shelf tablet and was not integrated into the vehicle’s systems in any way, the filing also alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0L4lWO"&gt;Hindenberg claimed in the report that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating Nikola, although the SEC declined to confirm the investigation at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lv0cnH"&gt;Fallout from the report was swift and devastating. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726594/gm-nikola-deal-equity-badger-truck-hydrogen"&gt;General Motors backed out of the equity deal&lt;/a&gt;, and Milton stepped down as executive chairman shortly afterward. The company has continued operation but scaled down its ambitions significantly. In February, Nikola &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301823/nikola-powersports-shuttered-nzt-wav"&gt;halted work on its planned electric ATV and motorboat&lt;/a&gt;, a decision that cost the company $14 million according to regulatory filings.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber teaming up with Rosetta Stone to offer free language courses to drivers </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mf6RRVI-NIqX6h_LTUaU85V1-x4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649758/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RQFz5C"&gt;Uber is teaming up with popular language service Rosetta Stone to provide free classes to drivers and couriers, the company announced Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnF2lz"&gt;The deal is being extended to drivers and delivery workers in select markets where Uber operates. Rosetta’s digital language learning programs, which cover 24 languages, will be fully integrated into the Uber app used by its workers. And the company is working with Rosetta on developing language skills directly related to their work as ride-share drivers and delivery workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tgHMC"&gt;Drivers have previously been able to take English-language courses as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/1/18047746/uber-driver-high-performing-earnings-free-college-tuition-pro"&gt;Uber Pro&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s rewards program for drivers. The new language services are part of a broader effort by the ride-hailing company to improve relations with its drivers, as well as offer incentives to sign on to the platform amid a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371850/uber-lyft-driver-shortage-covid-bonus-stimulus"&gt;nationwide shortage of Uber drivers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W0jKtU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Part of a broader effort to address a nationwide shortage of drivers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ij2Brw"&gt;In many cities, a majority of the people who drive for Uber are immigrants. In London, 82 percent of drivers are immigrants, while the number in New York City is 90 percent. Uber says it wants to give its workers the ability to learn a new language on the job, which could help them secure more full-time employment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkHdJ5"&gt;To further help drivers in finding a new job, Uber is offering letters that describe the work they’ve done while working for the company. The letter, which will be on Uber’s letterhead, will include details such as when they first signed up to use the app, the number of trips or deliveries they’ve done, their average customer rating, and top feedback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMk87n"&gt;But naturally, Uber would prefer people stay logged on to its app, and the company is offering cash payments as an added bonus. Earlier this year, the company said it would spend $250 million on a “stimulus” for drivers in the hopes of luring COVID-wary workers back to the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9zeyk"&gt;Language services are certainly one piece of this effort; Uber’s head of driver operations told &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-lyft-sweeten-job-perks-amid-driver-shortage-lofty-fares-11625223601"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; recently&lt;/a&gt; the company would fund education and career-building programs for drivers in an effort to address the shortage of workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzZJIi"&gt;Uber drivers are independent contractors who lack many of the benefits and protections of salaried employment. The company argues this gives drivers the flexibility to work at their leisure and be their own boss, but some drivers feel as if they’re at the mercy of Uber’s algorithm. US-based drivers seeking to be reclassified as employees have been stymied by &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-02-03/california-supreme-court-throws-out-prop-22-challenge"&gt;the courts&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;the ballot box&lt;/a&gt;, but some are still seeking better protections. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The children of tech’s guest workers are pushing for immigration relief</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x6B9reJsgkzffx2kNfFhvez12VA=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649699/VRG_4679_TechWorkers_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘Documented Dreamers’ have few good options after aging out of dependent visas&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="9qFiD0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="uZqmaP"&gt;As a kid, Naga Sreeram would spend all his time at his friend’s garage in San Jose, California, building Lego machines and coding them for his school robotics team. In high school, he taught himself web development and created apps that won competitions. But despite his passion for computer science and presence in Silicon Valley, his dream of working in the global tech hub remains on shaky ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7aJ3v"&gt;Sreeram came to the United States from India in 2007, at age seven. He was accompanying his father, who had obtained an H-1B work visa, as foreigners employed in the U.S. tech industry often do. Now, at 21, Sreeram has aged out of his dependent visa and has no clear pathway to citizenship. His only options are to “self-deport” and return to a country he no longer knows, or scramble for legal ways to stay that are neither easy nor guaranteed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36Iauo"&gt;“I’m scared that I will have to leave the country without ever even working in Silicon Valley,” he says, “and that would be a huge disappointment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9nSddI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No one seems to understand how it’s possible to grow up in this country with a documented status, but still have no clear path to citizenship.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mXUDGg"&gt;An estimated 200,000 children of foreign workers are in the same situation: They grow up in the United States but fall through the cracks of a broken immigration system. Realizing that they’re facing a dead end, many of these young people have banded together to work for lasting change in the immigration system, putting new pressure on Congress and the White House for a path forward. It’s not at the center of anyone’s immigration reform plan — but for this cohort of young people, it’s a political fight that will shape the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TX16l"&gt;Sreeram and others in this demographic call themselves “documented dreamers,” positioning themselves similarly to undocumented activists who came here as children, called “Dreamers” after a bill first drafted in 2001 that sought to provide them relief. While conceding that they may be better off in some ways, “documented dreamers” argue that they, too, are the victims of an unfair system and should be included in any existing and future fixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4G0XmW"&gt;“No one seems to understand how it’s possible to grow up in this country with a documented status, but still have no clear path to citizenship,” says Lakshmi Parvathinathan, 18, a sophomore at Drexel University majoring in biological sciences. Parvathinathan first came to the United States with her H-1B holder parents when she was three years old. “Everyone kind of just assumes, like, ‘Oh, you’ve been here for your whole life, you’re set,’” she says. “But unfortunately, that’s not the case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6bZyGM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A critical mass of young people with similar experiences&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XFzi4z"&gt;Both Parvathinathan and Sreeram have joined advocacy efforts at “Improve the Dream,” a coalition of young people hoping to garner more attention for this issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqzyKJ"&gt;The group was started by Dip Patel, who was born in India but naturalized in Canada. His parents came on an E-2 investor’s visa around 15 years ago, which allowed them to start a small business — a convenience store in southern Illinois. But it soon became clear to him that he was approaching the end of the line as far as immigration was concerned. When Patel was in high school in 2010, a version of the DREAM Act passed the House, but it &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2010/12/dream-act-dies-in-senate-046573"&gt;failed in the Senate&lt;/a&gt;. He was crestfallen because he had wrongly assumed that he, too, qualified for relief under that legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ioUfB4"&gt;In 2012, the Obama administration launched the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative, offering the temporary ability to stay and work for certain eligible undocumented immigrants. Again, Patel found that the protection did not apply to him. “Improve the Dream” was born in 2017 as a culmination of these incremental realizations that the policy solutions out there did not extend to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wX5khZ"&gt;Over the years, Patel has brought together a critical mass of young people with similar experiences through digital outreach. One of the first online platforms where he connected with other “documented dreamers” was a Facebook group meant for their parents. Later, through WhatsApp networks, Patel shared &lt;a href="https://www.improvethedream.org/survey"&gt;surveys&lt;/a&gt; to gather data on the experiences of such immigrants. Now, there’s a Slack with over 300 young immigrants working together on awareness campaigns and sharing information. Many — from India, Zambia, Mexico, Colombia, and South Korea — feature prominently on the group’s website, telling their stories. Others contribute behind the scenes as well; Sreeram, for example, helped code the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="o14LJd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We must not leave these young people and their valuable contributions to our communities behind.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sr8rvR"&gt;Congress alone can implement permanent fixes, which is why Patel and the others have been sending emails, making phone calls, and holding in-person and virtual meetings to educate congressional staff for years. This year, these efforts have borne fruit: the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ImproveTheDream/status/1367274089153495041"&gt;American Dream and Promise Act of 2021&lt;/a&gt;, the latest version of DREAM legislation, protects not just undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children, but also those who came on temporary visas. It passed the House &lt;a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/03/18/house-passes-immigration-bill-to-help-dreamers/"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;. The White House endorsed the legislation, &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/18/statement-by-president-biden-on-the-american-dream-and-promise-act-of-2021/"&gt;calling it&lt;/a&gt; a “critical first step in reforming our immigration system.” Despite the fact that the Senate version of the bill does not yet include children of visa holders, this was a big win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVgnX4"&gt;Then, in April, for the first time, the issue was the &lt;a href="https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=112515"&gt;subject of a House Judiciary Committee hearing&lt;/a&gt;. In July, a bipartisan group of House representatives introduced &lt;a href="https://ross.house.gov/media/press-releases/representatives-ross-miller-meeks-krishnamoorthi-kim-introduce-bipartisan"&gt;separate legislation&lt;/a&gt; specifically addressing children of visa holders.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The $3.5 trillion reconciliation agreement on infrastructure between the Democrats and the White House in July will also contain language from H.R. 6, the House version of the American Dream and Promise Act, according to the office of Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), although it’s not clear whether that  includes protections for “documented dreamers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78bylC"&gt;The easiest and quickest stopgap measure, however, could come through the Biden administration. Tweaking the language of the DACA guidelines so that children of visa holders could also apply is the top recommendation some House Democrats have made in &lt;a href="https://ross.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/ross.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Documented%20Dreamers%20Letter%20to%20DHS%206.25.21.pdf"&gt;a recent Congressional letter&lt;/a&gt; to the Homeland Security secretary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6Mf0M"&gt;Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California whose district includes Silicon Valley, signed on to the letter and says he’ll continue to push the issue in Washington. “Immigrants have brought to Silicon Valley and communities across America transformative ideas that are helping to change the world,” Khanna told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Documented dreamers are no exception, and like traditional Dreamers, Documented Dreamers know America as their only home, but are not eligible for protection under DACA. We must not leave these young people and their valuable contributions to our communities behind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzEKfQ"&gt;Around 70 percent of the 500-plus “documented dreamers” Patel surveyed are children of H-1B workers, stuck in a &lt;a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/immigration-wait-times-quotas-have-doubled-green-card-backlogs-are-long"&gt;decades-long employment-based green card backlog&lt;/a&gt; with their parents. In 2020, over &lt;a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/employment-based-green-card-backlog-hits-12-million-2020"&gt;1.2 million&lt;/a&gt; applicants were in this queue — a majority of them from India and China, according to an analysis by David Bier, a research associate at the libertarian Cato Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIJGPz"&gt;When they “age out” at 21, kids of these green card holders are ejected from the queue. To stay, they have to apply for other types of temporary visas, each with its own set of complications. If they spring for a student visa, they have to prove “&lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/isso/travel-visas/apply-for-a-visa/initial-visa-application/intent/"&gt;nonimmigrant intent&lt;/a&gt;” — meaning they have to demonstrate they want to return to their country of citizenship. Apart from being a cruel twist of irony, this is a tall order, as these applicants are often deeply rooted in the United States. If they apply for the H-1B, these young people have to face an unpredictable annual lottery through which the visa has been doled out in recent years. Even if they get lucky in this lottery, they’re doomed to walk in their parents’ footsteps, potentially ending up in the green card backlog again many years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KG1CTc"&gt;While they navigate this Sisyphean mountain of paperwork, these young immigrants lose money, time, certainty, and opportunities. They are often disqualified from in-state tuition, jobs, and fellowships. Parvathinathan remembers how the full weight of the restrictions on her future hit her in high school, and none of the adults around knew how to help. “It was just really a stressful time, growing up, because my future in this country wasn’t guaranteed,” says Parvathinathan, who lived outside of Philadelphia at the time. “And it didn’t seem like there was anything that I could do to make it guaranteed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qtbPQ6"&gt;Congress hasn’t passed significant immigration legislation since the 1990s, and one of the many consequences is the legal limbo that young people like Parvathinathan find themselves in. “What it shows about the legal immigration system is that it is incredibly constrained and woefully outdated,” Bier says. “And much of the many problems in the immigration system are products of neglect, rather than conscious design.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is Beast Canyon, the evolution of Intel’s modular mini gaming PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LDQ3RODbacggp73sYtyGsVLd1PA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649707/shollister_210727_4681_0033_3x2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;This 8-liter desktop upgrades in a snap&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QxEiue"&gt;Building your own gaming PC is a labor of love. It’s not something that needs to be “easier,” exactly. But from the moment I set a screwdriver to Intel’s new NUC 11 Extreme, aka “Beast Canyon,” I couldn’t help marveling at how brilliant a eight-liter gaming machine can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4iBJwj"&gt;Beast Canyon is Intel’s fourth attempt to design a more compact gaming PC than most gamers could dream of building on their own, and paradoxically, it’s Intel’s biggest chassis yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21051879/intel-pc-nuc-9-extreme-ghost-canyon-element-hands-on-teardown-ces-2020"&gt;Like last year’s Ghost Canyon&lt;/a&gt;, it’s attempting to change the way mini-PCs are built with its Compute Element cartridges, which contains a miniaturized motherboard, CPU, memory, storage, and ports you can swap all at once. That way, you can theoretically upgrade your entire system just like you’d upgrade a graphics card, right down to plugging it into a PCI-Express slot. (As I’ll explain, the truth may be a little more complicated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="1BwlMt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10675233"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VNws3a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NUC 8, “Hades Canyon”","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/14/17346234/intel-nuc-8-pc-gaming-amd-vega-review"},{"title":"NUC 9 Extreme, “Ghost Canyon”","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21051879/intel-pc-nuc-9-extreme-ghost-canyon-element-hands-on-teardown-ces-2020"},{"title":"NUC 11 Enthusiast, “Phantom Canyon”","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231244/intel-nuc-11-pc-announcement-includes-mini-gaming-computer"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VyfdU5"&gt;Where Ghost was a 5-liter rounded rectangular prism that barely fit an 8-inch-long graphics card, the 8-liter Beast lives up to its name with room for 12 inches of GPU power and an included 650-watt 80+ Gold power supply. It was enough to let me &lt;em&gt;easily &lt;/em&gt;fit and sufficiently power one of the most powerful GPUs on the market, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founder’s Edition, and it instantly takes this box’s gaming cred far beyond Intel’s previous attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhyWWx"&gt;That extra room and power is important, because the upgrade options for a smaller 5-liter box like the Ghost haven’t been looking that hot. While some of Nvidia and AMD’s most powerful cards in prior years have shrunken down to fit tiny cases, the latest batch of RTX 3000 and AMD 6000 series GPUs have gone the opposite direction, with most OEMs opting for oversized cards even compared to Nvidia’s own Founder’s Editions. Last I checked, the most powerful card that will fit the Ghost is EVGA’s RTX 3060 Ti, but the Beast can hold practically every dual-slot graphics card up to a 350W TDP, which just so happens to be where the RTX 3080 Ti tops out anyways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="iiNlF3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10675221"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4kMyog"&gt;That might make this 8-liter box one of the smallest competent 4K gaming PCs you can buy — in benchmarks with a pre-production sample of the Core i9-11900KB, I saw the Beast post numbers within a stone’s throw of those my colleague Tom Warren saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463608/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;when he reviewed the 3080 Ti with his full-size desktop&lt;/a&gt;. I can’t call today’s article a full review without lots of testing on a full production board, but based on the numbers I’m seeing in demanding games like &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; (which fell just short), most other titles should average over 60 frames per second at 4K with maximum settings sans raytracing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8VNlf"&gt;And while you could probably build a more satisfying, less plasticky and skull-laden rig with boutique cases like the 8.2-liter Louqe Ghost S1 and 7.2-liter Dan A4, most prebuilt mini gaming rigs are far larger, like the 12-liter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/8/18216789/corsair-one-i160-gaming-pc-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Corsair One&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps more importantly, I doubt any of them are as effortless to work inside. (I love my 12.7-liter Ncase M1, but even it’s a squeeze sometimes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0anr18"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10675223"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hxH9CS"&gt;It’s not just the fact that Intel’s modular Compute Element cards let you theoretically swap a bunch of components at once. The internal layout also just &lt;em&gt;makes sense. &lt;/em&gt;Instead of having to pivot-pivot-pivot your GPU in and out of the system (or physically remove part of the internal frame, like Intel’s Ghost) you can flip up the entire top of the Beast, triple-fan-array and all, to easily swing a full-size graphics card in and out of the machine. The whole top pivots on a hinge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UosrsU"&gt;The Beast also has perfect-length power cables for its fully modular SFX power supply, special wire channels for its Wi-Fi antennas and fan cables to go just they need to be, and spring-loaded screws with their own retaining clips. It’s not the prettiest build, inside or out, but there’s loads of utility. Also, you can turn off the LED lighting with a dedicated hardware button on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MPqE8dFmrwpczlX4O_6Ws3pF67w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22747179/shollister_210727_4681_0034.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The extra-long 110mm PCIe NVMe Gen 4 drive slot, and a button to turn off the LED lighting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5TGOe7"&gt;Like previous Intel NUCs, there’s above-average connectivity and expandability, too. Ports include eight full-size USB 3.1 plus additional headers inside the case, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, 2.5Gbps Ethernet, HDMI 2.0, an UHS-II SD card slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. I just wish one of those USB-C ports was on the &lt;em&gt;front&lt;/em&gt; of the case for easier access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ymm2y"&gt;Oh, and there’s room for up 64GB of DDR4 memory and &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; full-length M.2 slots for your stick SSD storage — three M.2 2280 slots inside the Compute Module and a rare 110mm long M.2 slot with Intel Optane support on the bottom of the case. Two of them can do PCIe NVMe Gen 4 storage, the other two offer your choice of Gen 3 NVMe or SATA 3. Also, the entire NUC chassis is five PCIe slots wide instead of four, giving you room for an additional single-slot card — or the included CPU fan shroud for better ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="JopsMH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10675185"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JubGUQ"&gt;Despite all this goodness, I’m not sold on Intel’s Beast, and it comes down to three things: 1) I’m a cheapskate who knows I can generally get more for my money if I don’t lock myself to a single brand, 2) finding &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; graphics card is an exercise in frustration right now, much less a dual-slot, and 3) I still don’t trust Intel, or anyone, to keep pumping out modules for as long as I’d like to upgrade such a computer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Abv2Vc"&gt;To be fair, Intel’s doing better than most in that regard. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;While Alienware broke its upgradable promise entirely with the Area-51m&lt;/a&gt;, Intel says the 11th Gen Compute Element &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;work in last year’s Ghost Canyon — kinda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQwM7S"&gt;The new module “will be able to technically plug into the NUC 9 Extreme Kit, but Intel will not be providing interactive support for that usage model,” a rep tells me, adding that “There were some design decisions necessary that remove certain features such as front panel audio and PCIe Gen4 is also not a certain guarantee.” It’s also not guaranteeing any support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055164/cooler-master-nc100-enclosure-intel-modular-gaming-pc-nuc-price-ces-2020"&gt;Cooler Master’s NC100&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309439/razer-tomahawk-mini-gaming-pc-for-sale-shipping"&gt;Razer Tomahawk&lt;/a&gt;, both of which used an NUC Compute Element as their brains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVznnP"&gt;In case you’re wondering, the Compute Element from my Beast Canyon wouldn’t even power on in the Ghost Canyon, something Intel proactively warned us about, and says will be fixed in production. It fits fine physically, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="goimEw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10675229"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="M4FM5J"&gt;In a more perfect world, maybe Intel, AMD, and other PC giants would join forces to turn this kind of PC into a new industry standard, a replacement for the 20-year-old Mini-ITX motherboard layout that dominates small-form-factor PCs today. That’s what I’d like to see. And maybe a larger, better window to show off my graphics card, instead of &lt;a href="http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649060/shollister_210727_4681_0033_3x2.0.jpg"&gt;mesh with an odd array of square cutouts&lt;/a&gt; underneath.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nothing Ear 1 earbuds review: almost something</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Standout design, noise cancellation, and wireless charging for $99&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="88KQhG"&gt;There’s a lot riding on the Ear 1 wireless earbuds, which are the first product to come from Nothing — a new company created by OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei. Backed with investment from GV, Tony Fadell, and influential creators like Casey Neistat, Nothing is aiming to build out an entire family of products that follow the design ethos debuting with the Ear 1. Transparency is at the heart of that: the Ear 1s have a clear “stem” that lets you peer at their internal components, and the unconventional charging case has a transparent lid to keep the buds in view at all times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzPGaQ"&gt;Pei has said his motivation for starting Nothing was a consumer tech industry that felt stale, unimaginative, and awash in gadgets that all feel very same-y. I don’t really buy into that viewpoint; sure, AirPods clones are everywhere, but the best earbuds from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and other big players are all visually distinct. Regardless, Nothing doesn’t see itself as “an audio company,” according to Pei, but the booming true wireless earbuds market seemed like an advantageous place to start. He’s also aiming to capture the same price-to-performance magic that was associated with OnePlus in its early days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AHScYa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10674787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TLb4Jn"&gt;At $99, the Ear 1s include active noise cancellation, wireless charging, IPX4 water resistance, and smaller conveniences like in-ear detection — features that cost anywhere from $150 to $300 from Nothing’s big brand competitors. Their sound has been tuned by Teenage Engineering, a company well versed in audio electronics. They’ll go on sale widely starting August 17th, but you can grab a pair early from Nothing’s website on July 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVLlJK"&gt;Like all transparent tech, the Ear 1s are fun to examine up close. On the outward-facing part of the stem, you can see the voice / ANC microphones, touch sensors, and a dot — red (right) or white (left) — to indicate which ear that bud is for. On the side facing your ear, there’s some circuitry, magnets, and the pins where the earbuds connect to the charging case. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k7WK0eaW7d1xhkIr1MKHtDYydsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746907/DSCF4391_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The outside of the Ear 1 casing reveals microphones, touch sensors, and a dot to indicate which ear that earbud is for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ke5V59"&gt;Nothing says it was so obsessive over small details (like polishing the magnets) that some manufacturing plants turned the startup away. Finding the right glue to bond the two sides of transparent casing together without leaving any ugly remnants behind was also apparently quite a challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L7055hWzYH9hYKZUtxwp0LzFNLM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746903/DSCF4362_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From some angles, the Nothing Ear 1s really are quite striking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Da4L4W"&gt;The Ear 1s definitely look &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt;, but do they come off as radically different? I’m not seeing it. If the clear stem were opaque white instead, these earbuds would look just like Apple’s AirPods Pro or any number of competitors. Nothing’s early concept images &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320915/nothing-true-wireless-earbuds-teenage-engineering-concept-1"&gt;showed a more unorthodox design&lt;/a&gt;, but the final product looks mostly normal with a dash of unique style — and maybe that’ll be enough to sell some people on them. Not reinventing the wheel makes for good comfort, at least. Three sizes of silicone tips come in the box, and I found that the Ear 1s have a similar in-ear feel to the AirPods Pro. They fit snugly, feel airy light (each earbud is 4.7 grams), and didn’t come loose during runs or while I was eating, which are two scenarios where true wireless buds sometimes get dislodged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/weIkNSF-iGIznfNqCXShjTrtlQ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746904/DSCF4370_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting a glimpse at all the internals takes some direct lighting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O6UISkdmgr8rJ8jTEitKinCt9BA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22747162/DSCF4404.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ear 1s are very light and comfortable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="myID1q"&gt;The charging case is where Nothing definitely gets more out there with design. It’s a squished-down square with rounded corners that opens and closes with satisfying spring tension. There’s a USB-C port for wired charging, and you also get Qi wireless charging; that’s always nice to see at this price. But for all the visual flair, it feels like I’m doing more work to seat the Ear 1s back in their case compared with other earbuds I’ve got around. The magnetic hold isn’t particularly strong, and laying the earbuds flat instead of plopping them into deep charging cradles takes more direct attention. The big dimple in the top of the case helps keep the earbuds in place, with a side effect of turning the case into a fun thing to fidget with and twirl around in your fingers. Still, I think Nothing could’ve come up with something more efficient and compact. This case is form over function and obviously intended to showcase Nothing’s transparent aesthetic. Just don’t expect it to stay pristine: my review unit has already collected scratches on the case’s bottom, and it’s only a matter of time before the top picks up some, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s9Jr9X3Imygh7eNOCIm6UQgfIZc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746902/DSCF4331_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From afar the stem looks mostly black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SlD4yh"&gt;In terms of sound, the Ear 1s and their 11.6-millimeter drivers don’t pull off any huge upsets against more premium competition. But they also don’t sound &lt;em&gt;bad &lt;/em&gt;or “budget.” They’ve just got some weaknesses that earbud enthusiasts will pick up on. The treble and high end — particularly on acoustic-driven tracks — can occasionally come off as excessively sparkly. I listened through John Mayer’s 1980s-influenced &lt;em&gt;Sob Rock&lt;/em&gt; and while Nothing’s earbuds punched slightly above what I’d expect for $99 and had good clarity and a nice thump-y bass riding beneath everything, their warmth and detail don’t measure up to earbuds in the $200-300 range. But they’re still an enjoyable listen in many cases, which came through when I switched over to “Stop Making This Hurt” by Bleachers. The Ear 1s presented well with good stereo separation and nothing sounding muddled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Twn0c-dBoERdfppSqd1NX8_jGMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746960/DSCF4386_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The earbuds lay flat in the charging case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DPnh21"&gt;Nothing’s companion mobile app is available for both Android and iOS and has simple EQ adjustments for “more treble,” “more bass,” and “voice,” but you can’t take full control over the sliders yourself. You might find yourself turning to that bass boost now and then. Nothing has said it and Teenage Engineering aimed for a natural, balanced sound signature, but don’t confuse that with flat or colorless. The earbuds support AAC and SBC Bluetooth codecs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hkxgmo"&gt;Noise cancellation is… passable. On the “max” setting, it could eliminate low-frequency hums inside my local coffee shop, but I never really forgot about my surroundings. Overall noise isolation was solid thanks to the good seal I got from the ear tips, and I’d reach for these before the $99 Pixel Buds A-Series, which require me to crank the volume to overcome nearby noise. But Nothing isn’t on the same level as the similarly priced Amazon’s Echo Buds 2 when it comes to noise cancellation — not a surprise since this is the company’s first swing at it. Transparency mode is adequate, but doesn’t match the natural feel of the Echo Buds or Apple’s AirPods Pro. Nothing does include some nice tricks; if you take one earbud out, the other will switch into transparency mode until both are back in your ears. And they’ve got auto-pause / resume when an earbud is removed, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y4sFsOb4_3pT2MfnSOA3_mMhvi4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746906/DSCF4377_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The earbuds have small vents to alleviate ear pressure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQ7GC-rLuBx_sHQWlKqT5JR--n0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22747169/DSCF4407_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case has a USB-C port, pairing button, and wireless charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ojMLGO"&gt;Despite having three microphones and algorithms meant to help isolate your voice from background noise, the Ear 1s were a disappointment for voice calls. My voice came through muddled and warbly even in a quiet room when recording to voice memos, and people I called had difficulty hearing me clearly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tOVru"&gt;Nothing says the Ear 1s can last for four hours of continuous playback with ANC on, and the case has enough for 24 more hours. If you leave ANC off, those numbers increase to 5.7 hours and 34 hours, respectively. The battery estimates for listening time have seemed on point in my tests so far. The earbuds use tap controls for most functions: you tap twice to play / pause, three times to skip forward or go back to the previous song (depending on side), hold to toggle NC modes, and so on. But there’s also a swiping gesture up or down the stem to adjust volume, which has worked reliably and feels intuitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVgG8Q"&gt;Nothing is still working on the Ear 1s as they approach release. In my time testing them, I’ve certainly encountered bugs and sporadic issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="24TNLm"&gt;Transparency mode has gone on the fritz from time to time. Sometimes it activates unexpectedly when I’m on a call. In other, stranger instances, I’ve heard brief boosts of ambient sound when turning my head. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5oRkki"&gt;I’ve noticed the earbuds seemingly switching modes between NC on and off on their own. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="76GEx5"&gt;Android Fast Pair isn’t yet functional. Nothing says this will be working by the time the Ear 1s ship to customers in mid-August. I’ll update the review once that happens. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Fha2eA"&gt;I encountered odd charging behavior with the case, where the LED wouldn’t reflect that anything was happening. A recent firmware update seems to have cleared this up for the most part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="lqlAdZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10674672"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fpQT7CfT9FwmZzy0mKv08NvJYdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22747060/DSCF4365_20Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothing has said its future products will look at home next to the Ear 1s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x3UAD6"&gt;Nothing has already pushed out a couple firmware updates during my review period, and I’d expect more before the Ear 1s arrive to buyers. But these are my impressions as of the company’s late-July review embargo; I’ll update to mention any changes or improvements when the earbuds ship in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="YgD6h9"&gt;With their full potential unrealized and performance still on the buggy side, it’s difficult to conclude whether the Ear 1s are putting Nothing on the right track as a new consumer tech brand. These earbuds offer an ambitious bundle of features for $99, and they’re inevitably going to get buzz and attention thanks to their transparent design (even if they resemble AirPods in other ways) and presence in swanky fashion storefronts like &lt;a href="https://kith.com/"&gt;Kith&lt;/a&gt;. The Ear 1s are the new hypebeast earbuds and have a fun air of freshness. But right now, their individual parts — sound quality, noise cancellation, etc. — fall short of excellence and leave plenty of reason for sticking with one of those “boring” established players.&lt;/p&gt;
