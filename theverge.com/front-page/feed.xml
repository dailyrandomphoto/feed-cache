    <title>Wonder Woman 1984 and Hamilton’s three biggest lessons for streaming</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="avXMD1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21504152/wonder-woman-1984-release-delay-new-date-warner-bros-disney-black-widow-dune-tenet"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318731/disney-hamilton-streaming-numbers-parks-world-reopening-bob-chapek-meeting"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;were two of 2020’s biggest films — at least where streaming was concerned. Recent third-party data suggests both releases drove crowds of subscribers to their streaming platforms (HBO Max and Disney Plus, respectively). More than any other movies that debuted online this year, &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;drove the most initial signups, according to new data from research firm Antenna. Data from research firm Screen Engine &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/wonder-woman-1984-shows-promise-for-hbo-max-audience-survey-finds"&gt;found similar results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hf1GoP"&gt;But digging into the data shows the successes of both releases are more complicated than they look. Unlike a conventional box office release, streaming success is measured not just in how many people saw the movie, but in how many people stuck around afterward. Measuring that success is much harder, but with this lesson, three new rules of the streaming game are already becoming clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xtQjO6"&gt;Blockbuster releases drive immediate signups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uFXTTP"&gt;This one is kind of obvious, but it’s nice to see it spelled out in the data. &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;led the pack for the most signups over a film’s opening weekend on streaming services, with &lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;generating 71 percent as much and &lt;em&gt;Soul &lt;/em&gt;35 percent as much. Although, &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;was HBO Max’s first major release, while &lt;em&gt;Soul &lt;/em&gt;premiered after &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s second season. (Its overall weekend signup numbers may be lower because people already had Disney Plus.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ng7o8P"&gt;Determining the value of “biggest” on streaming platforms is complicated. Neither WarnerMedia (HBO Max’s parent company) nor Disney shares data for their films’ performances. While those numbers would allow reporters and analysts to see total subscriber numbers and determine how much a single movie drives in subscription revenue, they’re not the most important figures. (It’s also difficult to translate streaming success into box office performance as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21526664/netflix-movies-billion-dollar-box-office-blockbuster-ted-sarandos-earnings"&gt;there are too many variables&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;’s domestic box office revenue in the film’s subsequent weeks following its initial &lt;a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/wonder-woman-1984-box-office-second-weekend/"&gt;release is far from phenomenal&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i9vGJ0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Big movies bring in subscribers, but do they keep them? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WriCEY"&gt;Blockbuster releases don’t always lead to long-term subscriptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fbnpoO"&gt;Getting people to sign up is one thing; keeping them is another. Arguably, keeping them is also the most important part. Think of the United States. Once the majority of households have signed up for a service, it’s much tougher to continue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21142065/netflix-streaming-wars-subscriber-growth-disney-international"&gt;growing at scale in that region&lt;/a&gt;. What becomes more important than growing in that territory is convincing people to stay. Recurring revenue only makes sense if companies can convince the majority of their customers to continuously pay month after month, year after year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1QmfM"&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;drew in the most subscribers per single title on Disney Plus in 2020, the drop-off rate was higher than average Disney Plus subscribers who signed up for the service before the movie came out. Nearly a quarter of people who signed up for Disney Plus during &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;’s opening weekend canceled within 30 days, according to Antenna. After three months, less than 60 percent of that same subscriber group remained. Comparatively, about 70 percent of people who signed up for Disney Plus in June (about four weeks ahead of &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;’s premiere) remained subscribed three months later. This doesn’t imply that Disney Plus is in trouble — the platform had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165579/disney-plus-86-million-subscribers-netflix-hbo-max-streaming"&gt;nearly 90 million subscribers in mid-December&lt;/a&gt; — but it speaks to the necessity of consistency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjJMzr"&gt;Streaming’s beauty is also a problem to solve: it’s extremely easy for people to sign up, and it’s even easier for people to cancel. While big titles bring in subscribers, it doesn’t necessarily mean people are going to stay subscribed. Take &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;: if people are signing up specifically for the filmed version of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Broadway musical, they may not be as interested in staying for &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; or Marvel films and TV shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAYMfo"&gt;This group of subscribers is important for Disney, as they represent an audience Disney hasn’t already tapped into — but it’s a double-edged sword, as they’re more likely to cancel. People signing up ahead of &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;, however, may watch &lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;when it lands on top of the other Disney properties they initially signed up to watch, but it’s not why they signed up. Figuring out how to keep both groups happy is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NYxx7E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Streaming’s beauty is also a problem to solve: it’s extremely easy for people to sign up and even easier for people to cancel&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KGYfCL"&gt;Retention depends on what else is in your catalog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jRxbrZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;is a more interesting case. It’s too early to tell if people are readily canceling their HBO Max subscriptions after watching &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;, but the type of plan customers are purchasing does provide some insight. While more than 80 percent of people who signed up for Disney Plus to watch &lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;chose the monthly subscription offering instead of annual plans (compared to 69 percent of average Disney Plus subscribers who signed up in June), roughly the same number of customers signed up for HBO Max’s monthly subscription as the six-month plan, according to Antenna. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcBael"&gt;There are a couple of reasons this may be the case — including that WarnerMedia offered a cheaper pricing option for the six-month tier ahead of &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;’s release — but it also speaks to WarnerMedia’s wider plan. Just before &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;came out, WarnerMedia announced that every single Warner Bros. movie in 2021 will be released on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;HBO Max the same day titles&lt;/a&gt; premiere in theaters. Every month, there will be a “theatrical release” available at home for HBO Max subscribers. That’s on top of new HBO shows, a library of popular movies and TV series, and HBO Max originals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wIgmW"&gt;WarnerMedia provided &lt;em&gt;a good reason to keep the subscription&lt;/em&gt;. The same is true for customers who signed up for Disney Plus for &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;’s release. Unlike &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;, customers who signed up for Disney Plus during &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;’s opening weekend bought annual plans on par with those who purchased monthly plans. This comes just after Disney’s massive streaming-focused investor day, where executives touted a number of titles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;coming to Disney Plus in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Like WarnerMedia’s HBO Max announcement, Disney gave people a reason to hold on to their subscriptions and return to the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CiQJGO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;WarnerMedia provided a good reason to keep the subscription&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OteFM6"&gt;Streaming success is a balancing act of acquisition and retention. Subscription streaming is a valuable play for media and entertainment conglomerates because of its recurring revenue. That only happens if customers are routinely happy with a mix of new titles and an impressive library. See: Netflix. Netflix has the lowest churn rate (a term used to describe cancel rates) of any subscriber. There are enough new titles and a concrete enough library to justify increasingly expensive subscription costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOmVsZ"&gt;2021 is an important year for streamers like HBO Max and Disney Plus. Each company has its own strategy, but the biggest takeaway from 2020’s streaming bets is something they both share: people want new things all the time. And with more places to get entertainment than ever before, each company needs to fight to keep their attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSP2qG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uq26o"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nH1T7e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change your video background in Microsoft Teams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Teams stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_9uKpjz3H5m0memBr8NZA6m1u10=/0x0:2502x1668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68623559/microsoftteamsstock.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft Teams&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jMcxpf"&gt;While Zoom remains popular for its ease of use and features such as the ability to pop in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173608/zoom-video-conference-how-to-virtual-background-greenscreen"&gt;different backgrounds&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not the only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286781/best-video-call-apps-free"&gt;video meeting app&lt;/a&gt; out there that lets you do those things. For example, Microsoft’s Teams office communications app also allows you to tweak your meeting background. Here, we’ll show you how to change your background for a Teams videoconference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xsxd5i"&gt;If you want to select a background before you officially begin the meeting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="UnFKTN"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285118/meeting-microsoft-teams-schedule-video-call-group"&gt;Start your Teams video meeting&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll find yourself at the intermediate screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l6pdXu"&gt;Make sure that video is toggled on in the button bar near the bottom of the screen, then toggle on the background settings control (located between the video and audio controls)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pJm16k"&gt;A “Background settings” column will appear on the right. Use that to blur your real background or choose from several different images to provide a false background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Choose a new Teams background from the “Background settings” window" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o_fDwW1cieS5A1hmvVF13txecs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215492/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_1.19.21_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose a new Teams background from the “Background settings” window&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QVRLlT"&gt;If you want to add your own image, click the “Add new” link at the top of the column. You can then choose an image from your computer’s files, which will be added to the available backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FNycRF"&gt;When you do change your background, the change will stay in effect through your other meetings until you change it again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zgPgLI"&gt;If you’ve already started the meeting (or you’ve joined somebody else’s meeting), you can still change your background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="L9PmA6"&gt;Click on the three dots in the middle of the button bar at the bottom of the screen and select “Show background effects.” You’ll get the same “Background settings” column on the right, with the same ability to blur your background, change it, or add a new one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can preview your background before using it" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yIYtDGy9D_OtPbjK-R-_ZOGw8BI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215496/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_1.22.51_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can preview your background before using it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="e4jGrh"&gt;If you’re in the middle of a meeting and want to test the background, click on “Preview” in the “Background settings” column. You’ll be able to see the effect in a small window at the bottom of the column; nobody else in your meeting will see it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bjsHS2"&gt;Once you’re happy with your new background, click on “Apply” (or just select “Stop preview” if you want to go back to your previous background)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="pdiq0u"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 5th, 2021, 2:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on April 14th, 2020, and has been changed to include updates in the software.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon just bought a bunch of used commercial jets for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Prime Air Boeing 737" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xNEp1LC5ICa4mZapNUqM8FBfbrA=/0x0:4600x3067/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68623267/1155787631.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="awEbXi"&gt;Amazon announced it purchased 11 used Boeing 767-300 jets from Delta and WestJet, a first for the e-commerce giant. The company has been steadily building up its air cargo capacity over the years through leasing agreements, but this is the first time Amazon has ever owned its own aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqyND2"&gt;The deal comes as airplane prices have dropped due to the coronavirus pandemic. Airlines have been rushing to shrink their fleets as passenger demand plummets amid lockdown orders across the globe. The purchases include seven aircraft from Delta and four aircraft from WestJet, which will join Amazon’s network by 2022, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJvAxa"&gt;“Our goal is to continue delivering for customers across the U.S. in the way that they expect from Amazon, and purchasing our own aircraft is a natural next step toward that goal,” said Sarah Rhoads, vice president of Amazon Global Air, &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-continues-expand-its-transportation-fleet-purchased"&gt;said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Having a mix of both leased and owned aircraft in our growing fleet allows us to better manage our operations, which in turn helps us to keep pace in meeting our customer promises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hrebnL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon launched its air fleet in 2016&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s2ebzW"&gt;Amazon launched its air fleet in 2016, under the assumption that by 2022 it will have more than 85 planes, both leased and owned. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/13/21020938/amazon-logistics-prime-air-fedex-ups-package-delivery-more-than-50-percent"&gt;According to a year-old analysis&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon delivers more than half of all of its packages in the US as it accelerates its push to own the entire logistics chain and end its relationship with companies like FedEx and UPS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6OB4o"&gt;The newly bought planes are intended to help speed the delivery of packages purchased through Amazon, which has seen record demand as a result of the pandemic. The company says it will continue to rely on third-party carriers to operate these new aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rT1Rrm"&gt;Amazon is quickly becoming a major player in the world of transportation. Obviously, as one of the largest delivery and logistics firms in history, Amazon was always destined to play a huge role in the way people and things move across the globe. But some of the company’s more recent deals suggest Jeff Bezos’ company has ambitions that extend beyond just package delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQY5VH"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304111/amazon-zoox-acquisition-self-driving-car-autonomous-vehicles-startup-robotaxi-bi-directional-vehicle"&gt;recently acquired&lt;/a&gt; the self-driving car startup Zoox, which just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173971/zoox-amazon-robotaxi-self-driving-autonomous-vehicle-ride-hailing"&gt;unveiled its omnidirectional prototype robotaxi&lt;/a&gt;. The company has also participated in multiple funding rounds for electric vehicle company Rivian, which is designing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507495/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-date-specs"&gt;battery-powered van&lt;/a&gt; for the delivery giant’s last-mile deliveries, and contributed to driverless car and truck startup Aurora’s $530 million funding round. (Aurora just acquired Uber’s self-driving car division.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ASu8s"&gt;And of course there’s the company’s interest in drone delivery. The company was recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408646/amazon-prime-air-drone-delivery-faa-clearance-approval-health-safety-alphabet-wing"&gt;given approval by the Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; to operate as a drone airline in the US, paving the way for it to start offering commercial deliveries on a trial basis. The FAA said that the ruling allows Amazon to “safely and efficiently deliver packages to customers” and let its drones carry packages outside of the operator’s visual line of sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjyJKP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose’s latest sport earbuds won’t block out the outside world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cZ1UUvv6SAgxQYP-b4UDzCQyWTo=/1x0:2989x1992/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68623026/Bose_Sport_Open_Earbuds__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;By sitting above rather than inside the ear, the earbuds let you hear what’s going on in your environment.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bose&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jUuqXR"&gt;Bose’s latest true wireless earbuds, the Sport Open Earbuds, are designed to keep you aware of your surroundings while you listen. While most other earbuds sit inside the ear canal, blocking out at least some ambient noise, the Sport Open Earbuds instead sit outside it. Bose has officially announced the earbuds a little over a month after their existence was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150405/bose-sport-open-earbuds-fcc-leak-photos"&gt;leaked via a Federal Communications Commission filing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4gwAyD"&gt;A design that lets in ambient noise might sound unintuitive, given how headphone manufacturers (including Bose) spend so much money trying to do the exact opposite with noise-canceling tech. But there are plenty of instances where being aware of your surroundings is a very good thing, like when you’re cycling through traffic or going on a run after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f_JtjgpHeVo7S4aXBWiuiVrn_k4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215377/Bose_Sport_Open_Earbuds.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bose&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The earbuds charge via an included charging base.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RjHNLC"&gt;Different headphone manufacturers have used a variety of approaches to achieve a similar effect. For example, bone conduction headphones, like those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20706156/aftershokz-aeropex-bone-conduction-headphones-wireless-review"&gt;produced by Aftershokz&lt;/a&gt;, vibrate against the sides of the wearer’s head, allowing them to hear music without having earbuds in their ears. It’s also becoming common for earbuds like the AirPods Pro to include some kind of “ambient” or “transparency” mode, where they use their microphones to hear ambient noise and mix it with music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P28NqS"&gt;Bose’s approach is a little different. Rather than sitting inside the ear like most earbuds, the Sport Open Earbuds “gently grip the ear’s outer ridge” and sit above the ear canal. Bose claims this allows them to work with “no ear tip, virtually no skin contact, and without the squeezing and vibrations from bone conduction.” It adds that only the wearer should hear what the earbuds are playing, even at high volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZMqiQ"&gt;In terms of specs, Bose is promising the earbuds will provide eight hours of battery life on a charge, have a dust and water resistance rating of IPX4, and support Bluetooth 5.1. They can be controlled with a button on each earbud (one for activating a paired phone’s voice assistant and one for controlling playback), and there are microphones built into them for making calls. They come with a carrying case and charging base and can be controlled with the Bose Music App. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Y9UMY"&gt;Bose is only releasing the Sport Open Earbuds in the US for now, where they’re available in black and retail for $199.95. Preorders open today, and the earbuds will be available starting in mid-January.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s what we know about the Google union so far</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lTXnOp"&gt;On Monday, roughly 230 Google employees announced they were forming a union with the Communication Workers of America (CWA). It’s open to employees and contractors at Alphabet, Google’s parent company. As a minority union, it doesn’t need to go through a formal legal process in order to exist. It just needs to announce itself. That part is done. World, meet the &lt;a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/"&gt;Alphabet Workers Union&lt;/a&gt; (AWU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhNlj6"&gt;The news prompted a wave of support from organizers like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1346125551539548162"&gt;Sen. Bernie Sanders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ekp/status/1346120251109359618"&gt;Ellen Pao&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1346050124544233473"&gt;Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&lt;/a&gt;. It also led to some questions. What is a minority union? Isn’t 230 members rather small? Why is CWA involved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bj902G"&gt;Here’s what we know so far about the Alphabet Workers Union — and what we are still waiting to find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSLnao"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where did this union come from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSF6gX"&gt;Over the past three years, Google employees have been organizing major walkouts and protests to oppose the company’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/1/17418406/google-maven-drone-imagery-ai-contract-expire"&gt;work with the Pentagon on targeted drone strikes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage"&gt;pay former executive Andy Rubin $90 million after he was credibly accused of sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/google-s-project-dragonfly-censored-search-engine-triggers-protests-n960121"&gt;design a censored search engine for China&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, employees have stood up against &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;Google’s firing of prominent AI ethicist Timnit Gebru&lt;/a&gt;. Now, union organizers want to unite all of those efforts under a single umbrella. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleWalkout/status/1346104231938416641"&gt;The Google Walkout Twitter account is publicly supporting AWU&lt;/a&gt;, although the efforts aren’t one and the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmrDRj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a minority union?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRNThA"&gt;As a minority union, or a solidarity union, AWU doesn’t need to go through the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and hold a vote to convince the majority of employees to sign on. With the announcement, “Google workers are taking immediate advantage of the power of a union,” &lt;a href="https://collectiveaction.tech/2021/the-abcs-of-googles-new-union/"&gt;according to Clarissa Redwine in Collective Action in Tech&lt;/a&gt;. This structure puts the emphasis on employee organizing, rather than politics and negotiations, which can come later. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html#click=https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2Fm2Qmjwz32V"&gt;Workers told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that it was “primarily an effort to give structure and longevity to activism at Google, rather than to negotiate for a contract.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3ji3E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the benefit of that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGyGYU"&gt;The structure allows AWU to welcome Alphabet contractors as well as employees. At Google, temporary workers outnumber full-time staff but often receive just a small fraction of the benefits. AWU wants to unite the interests of janitors and cafeteria workers with those of engineers and product managers. This would be difficult to do with a majority union. “Organizing Google as a labor union via existing labor laws would be next to impossible,” says Veena Dubal, a law professor at Hastings. “Google would have so many advantages to avoiding recognizing any kind of majority union.” Dubal also says that Google’s use of temporary workers is likely strategic. “We can understand Google’s use of temporary workers as part of their effort to avoid unionism,” she says. “It’s an effort to divide workers, and avoid having to work with the majority bargaining unit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5fxSI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else like this in tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lipmsy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://collectiveaction.tech/2021/the-abcs-of-googles-new-union/"&gt;As Redwine wrote&lt;/a&gt;, this isn’t the first time Google workers have unionized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pbay2z"&gt;In 2017, Security guards at Google and Facebook had their union recognized and fought through a long contract negotiation. In 2019, Google cafeteria staff employed by vendor Bon Appetit won their union election. In September 2019 a group of 80 contract office workers in Pittsburgh voted to join the United Steelworkers, forming Google’s very first office worker union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mSSVEG"&gt;In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/kickstarter-workers-vote-form-first-union-tech-industry-n1138006"&gt;workers at Kickstarter unionized&lt;/a&gt;, too, becoming the “first union comprised of white-collar, full-time employees in the technology industry,” &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/kickstarter-workers-vote-form-first-union-tech-industry-n1138006"&gt;according to April Glaser at NBC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6Kw2s"&gt;But Kickstarter is a small company with fewer than 200 employees. Google, in contrast, has 123,000 full-time staff and more than 130,000 contractors, making AWU’s effort unprecedented. If it’s successful, it will likely be a bellwether for organizing efforts at big tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cc2w5c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Communication Workers of America?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9car8"&gt;CWA is one of the largest unions in the US, with 700,000 members. It was formed by telecom workers but has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055445/game-workers-union-cwa-union-partnership-tech-video-games-organizing"&gt;branched out into game developers&lt;/a&gt; and, more recently, tech employees. The Google union is affiliated with &lt;a href="https://www.code-cwa.org/"&gt;CWA’s Coalition to Organize Digital Employees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9WbXr"&gt;Google employees organized in secret for almost a year before deciding to go public with the support of CWA. As a minority union, it doesn’t need the backing of a larger organization. Part of the point, after all, is to avoid the bureaucracy that comes from working with a big institution. But CWA’s experience will likely come in handy when going up against Google management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBym8O"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And people like CWA?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrwJlG"&gt;Not everyone is happy about CWA’s involvement. Amr Gaber, an engineer who helped organize the Google walkouts in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the organization was “more concerned about claiming turf” than listening to the needs of workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8swzrE"&gt;Kathryn Spiers, a security engineer who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22047383/google-spied-workers-before-firing-labor-complaint"&gt;wrongfully fired from Google in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, according to the NLRB, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/computerfemme/status/1346144349218889728"&gt;wrote that CWA has&lt;/a&gt; “a tendency to jump the gun and announce things early (they put my name in a press release without my permission) and this feels similar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsyuuE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what are the goals of the union?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57yP17"&gt;AWU hasn’t published a list of demands. As a democratic organization, it wants to hear from new members before deciding on major initiatives. But organizers have hinted that they’re not stopping at pay disparity. “Our goal with the union is to ensure that tech companies use their technology to make the world a better place,” says Alan Morales, a Google engineer and AWU organizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nLqSV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can a union with only a few hundred members be effective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGabhR"&gt;The short answer is probably not — but AWU isn’t expecting to stay at just a few hundred. When the union went public, it had about 230 members. Less than 24 hours later, it has more than 400. Organizers anticipate the membership base will continue to swell. “We are expecting more members over the few coming weeks, now that the union is public, possibly in the thousands,” Morales says. Still, with roughly a quarter of a million Google workers, AWU has a long way to go to reach a critical mass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ao62Zi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We started today with 200+ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AWU?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AWU&lt;/a&gt; members, the result of more than a year of intense discussions, one-on-one's, &amp;amp; other organizing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We ended today, our first day as a public group, with over 400 members.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's the first Monday of 2021. We're going to keep it up this whole year.&lt;/p&gt;— Alphabet Workers Union (@AlphabetWorkers) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1346254041714593792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K9dtxM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has Google responded to the union?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcyHSR"&gt;Google issued a statement yesterday saying “of course our employees have protected labor rights that we support.” But if AWU continues to grow, the company will likely change its tune. Google already &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/technology/Google-union-consultant.html"&gt;hired IRI consultants&lt;/a&gt;, a firm widely known for its anti-union sentiment, in 2019 in the wake of employee organizing efforts. That same year, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22047383/google-spied-workers-before-firing-labor-complaint"&gt;fired four workers who were engaged in employee activism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlCbgG"&gt;This time around, “it’s not necessarily going to be as clear cut as firing individual activists,” says Liz Fong-Jones, a former Google engineer. “Yes, they will continue to fire individual activists, but I think the more likely thing is that activists will face negative performance reviews, being told that they’re not team players or that they’re not positive about the company. We saw some of those things with Dr. Timnit Gebru.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkFr4E"&gt;That’s going to be especially true if the union starts going after major strategy initiatives, like the company’s government contracts. But that’s also kind of the point. Meredith Whittaker, one of the organizers of the 2018 Google walkout, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: “I’m not interested in a movement about what kind of tea workers have in the free snack kitchen. This is a fight for power over everything at Google — what they build, how they treat people, whether certain parts of the company should exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjJihS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Google employees. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft commits to fix Xbox Series X controller disconnects in a future update</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jFSs1HlgvWHx2bWdg3O3bk_Nk5Y=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68622942/twarren_xboxseriesxcontroller_VLS_3632_2_11.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yDG3Gl"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; feels like a huge PC-like upgrade for your Xbox games, but a fraction of buyers have been experiencing an unusual &lt;em&gt;downgrade&lt;/em&gt; as well — the new Xbox Series X gamepad doesn’t seem to stay connected to the console in some games and some situations, &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/xba_console/xbox-series-x-controller-keeps-disconnecting/16d9f462-57c0-4b6c-93fd-b03711e632ee?page=1"&gt;according to a 40-page thread in Microsoft’s help forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7x2hp"&gt;The good news: Microsoft knows about the issue, and a fix is on the way. “We are aware some players may be experiencing disconnects with their new Xbox Wireless Controllers and our teams are actively working on a solution to be included in a future update,” a company spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SfQc1"&gt;Again, it’s not clear how widespread this issue truly is — though nearly 1,700 co-signers on a 40-page forum post is enough to show it’s definitely a concern, that’s a tiny fraction of the million-plus units these consoles &lt;a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/446290/xbox-series-x-and-s-sold-an-estimated-12-to-14-million-units-on-launch-day/"&gt;were estimated to have sold at launch&lt;/a&gt;. And some of those reporting the issue say it only happens in certain games, &lt;em&gt;like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as you’ll see if you read through the forum or &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/jsj02i/series_x_controller_disconnecting/"&gt;Reddit threads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8J0khW"&gt;Even a couple of the video clips we’ve seen of the issue don’t seem to necessarily be showing off the same problem: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/k3737h/xbox_series_x_controller_disconnecting/"&gt;one of these&lt;/a&gt; is a controller that doesn’t seem to be syncing to the console at all, while &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mjallemand/status/1344461330997252099"&gt;the other&lt;/a&gt; is paired but not successfully sending inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8lxSxN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My kingdom for a Xbox controller that doesn’t disconnect at random. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NBfubjWnC5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NBfubjWnC5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Milton Allemand (@mjallemand) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mjallemand/status/1344461330997252099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 31, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="naggvq"&gt;Either way, it sounds like Microsoft will sort it out. And if you’re experiencing controller disconnects on a Windows PC over Bluetooth (rather than an Xbox console), there may already be a fix for that. &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/known-issues-on-xbox-series-xs/221c9d7f-dc91-4067-ba81-33ab671179b5"&gt;There’s a Windows Update you can download&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mKWlFS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Microsoft, we put all of our products through rigorous quality assurance testing and are committed to providing customers with an unparalleled gaming experience.

    <title>Microsoft’s ambitious Minecraft Earth game is closing down on June 30th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xLpqGseSUsWrSscholUlT90gwGE=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68622838/minecraftearth.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0kk4b4"&gt;Microsoft is closing down its &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; mobile game in June, due to the ongoing pandemic. The ambitious game had aimed to rival &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; and cover the world in virtual blocks for players to meet and play together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ul3t7p"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; was designed around free movement and collaborative play – two things that have become near impossible in the current global situation,” &lt;a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-earth-coming-end"&gt;says the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; team&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, we have made the difficult decision to re-allocate our resources to other areas that provide value to the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; community and to end support for &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; in June 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lmb5Y1"&gt;The final build of the game is being released today, which reduces the amount of time it takes to craft in the game and the cost of certain materials. It’s designed to let players craft and build more easily and safely at home in the coming months before the game is disabled on June 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHXx6q"&gt;Players will no longer be able to download or play &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; after June 30th, and Microsoft is deleting player data on July 1st. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S2P1bg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18627341/minecraft-earth-ios-android-free-ar-game-features-pokemon-go"&gt;Microsoft first unveiled &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; in May 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The idea was to recreate the experience of playing &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;in the real world through augmented reality and to allow players to build virtual buildings out of materials. The game focused on social interactions with others, and it was part of a bigger effort across Microsoft to leverage the help of the HoloLens and Azure cloud server teams. Before the game’s release, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650201/minecraft-earth-demo-apple-wwdc-2019-microsoft"&gt;Apple even invited Microsoft onstage&lt;/a&gt; at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) to demonstrate the new title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irH6he"&gt;Players will now no longer be able to purchase items in &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt;, and any paid ruby balances will be converted into Minecoins which you can use to buy skins, maps, and mini-games in the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5G54LA"&gt;“We’re eternally grateful for the amazing talent in the Minecraft community,” says the Minecraft team. “This was not an easy decision, and we’re doing everything we can to make sure you get the most out of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; before it sunsets.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook ads made News Feeds in Georgia more partisan and less informative</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ITyr2uQ9uyIp_fMX9eiQKvJtKzo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68622689/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bCOkVm"&gt;When Facebook lifted its ban on political ads in Georgia, local News Feeds became dramatically more partisan and less informative, according to research published &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/01/05/in-georgia-facebooks-changes-brought-back-a-partisan-news-feed"&gt;on Tuesday by &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkiTRW"&gt;Facebook banned US political advertising in the wake of the November 3rd presidential election as part of its broader effort to fight election misinformation. However, the platform partially lifted the ban on December 16th, allowing ads specific to the Georgia runoff on January 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vp27TJ"&gt;To study the effect of those ads,&lt;em&gt; The Markup&lt;/em&gt; paid 58 Facebook users in Georgia to provide data on the content that appeared in their News Feeds in the weeks leading up to the runoff election. The resulting data (which is &lt;a href="https://github.com/the-markup/citizen-browser-georgia"&gt;available on Github&lt;/a&gt;) showed a huge change in users’ feeds when Facebook reopened political advertising in Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AQ1jia"&gt;&lt;q&gt;news content was overwhelmed by paid political content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bUldmA"&gt;When the ban was in place, most political content on users’ feeds was from news organizations like the &lt;em&gt;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&lt;/em&gt;, CNN, or &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. Once political ads were restored, that content was overwhelmed by paid political content from Raphael Warnock’s Senate campaign, VoteGOP, or other political groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJp4iB"&gt;Notably, &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; also found a specific instance in which Facebook was paid to promote false claims. The report highlights a $25,000 ad buy from incumbent Senator David Perdue claiming his opponent, Jon Ossoff, “is China-bought and would provide our adversaries with just another way to threaten our national security.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zrSZ9"&gt;As a documentary filmmaker, Ossoff &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/does-ossoff-think-china-documentary-113001723.html"&gt;received some China-linked payments&lt;/a&gt; when two of his films were licensed for broadcast by a partially state-backed TV station in Hong Kong. But the broadcasts were only a small portion of the overall licensing business, and the claim that his campaign is funded or endorsed by the Chinese government has been &lt;a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/verify/jon-ossoff-chinese-government-claims-debunked/85-09658a41-08b7-4682-abec-92b4c862c2ea"&gt;labeled as false by fact-checkers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UoAIS"&gt;Reached for comment, Facebook emphasized the relatively small part paid political content plays on its network, outside of exceptional events like the Georgia runoff. “In an election where millions of people have already voted, even this tiny sample size has reinforced a basic truth about politics: the closer you get to Election Day, the more political content everyone is likely to see - whether it’s online, in the mail or on TV or radio,” a representative told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epFOut"&gt;The report comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213670/facebook-political-ads-georgia-republican-senate"&gt;multiple reports&lt;/a&gt; of demonstrably false ads being promoted by Facebook, often receiving promotion even after moderators had removed an earlier version of the ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvIWYH"&gt;Facebook has long struggled with political ad policies, particularly during the 2016 presidential election when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/6/16263704/russia-election-hacking-facebook-ad-spending"&gt;a Russian influence operation&lt;/a&gt; successfully promoted multiple campaigns on the site. Competing platforms like Twitter have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20966854/twitter-super-pacs-political-ads-facebook-climate-change-abortion-paid-promotion"&gt;disallowed campaign ads entirely&lt;/a&gt;, but Mark Zuckerberg has defended the importance of allowing political ads on the platform on free speech grounds, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/30/zuckerberg-defends-facebooks-political-ads-approach-after-twitter-ban.html"&gt;telling investors&lt;/a&gt;, “I don’t think it’s right for private companies to censor politicians and the news.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccT1bc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA tells US health providers not to modify COVID-19 vaccine dose schedule</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="People queue at NHS Covid-19 vaccination centre in London as..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xlPOAgsPmucOyvKgniPhERF40XQ=/1x0:4249x2832/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68622259/1230430316.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VKkE7l"&gt;Health care providers in the United States should stick to the two-dose schedule for both authorized COVID-19 vaccines, the Food and Drug Administration said in a statement this week. Some experts have suggested that delaying the second dose could stretch limited quantities of the vaccines further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2T3ROr"&gt;Any dose adjustments&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;could be evaluated in clinical trials, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn and Peter Marks, the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-statement-following-authorized-dosing-schedules-covid-19-vaccines"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “However, at this time, suggesting changes to the FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence,” they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9mG01"&gt;Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine takes two doses given 28 days apart, and the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 includes two doses given 21 days apart. Data from the clinical trials suggested that people had some protection against COVID-19 after the first shot, but the trials were not designed to test if only one dose worked. Still, the evidence was enough for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bob_Wachter/status/1345911427278671872"&gt;some experts&lt;/a&gt; to say that we should get a first dose to as many people as possible, and then give a second shot when more supply is available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cc5qd8"&gt;The United Kingdom, which is currently battling a frightening COVID-19 surge driven by the more-contagious coronavirus variant, is &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/04/britain-takes-a-gamble-with-covid-19-vaccines-upping-the-stakes-for-the-rest-of-us/"&gt;taking that approach&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/dec/31/covid-vaccine-uk-doctors-criticise-rescheduling-of-second-doses"&gt;Health authorities there said&lt;/a&gt; that people should delay the second dose for up to three months. More controversially, they’re also allowing providers to mix-and-match vaccine brands in some circumstances — someone could get a first shot of Moderna and a second shot of Pfizer, if it’s the only one available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WZjyP"&gt;One concern in delaying a second dose is that a single shot could give only partial immunity. Without a subsequent booster to lock in protection, the virus could still infect people who have only gotten one shot and could hypothetically mutate into forms that escape the vaccine. “You are essentially maximizing the opportunity for the virus to learn about the human immune system,” Paul Bieniasz, a virologist at Rockefeller University in New York, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/04/britain-takes-a-gamble-with-covid-19-vaccines-upping-the-stakes-for-the-rest-of-us/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LiVaVz"&gt;Sudden changes to vaccine recommendations could also shake fragile public trust in the COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C4VLZe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Regarding last-minute changes to vaccination strategy, I'm going to keep beating the same drum for a while. Please don't underestimate the importance of the public having *trust in the process* for long-term success. Social scientists - we need you! &lt;a href="https://t.co/IeiDZty4IN"&gt;https://t.co/IeiDZty4IN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Natalie E. Dean, PhD (@nataliexdean) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nataliexdean/status/1346191710888448000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1A3MtP"&gt;The FDA statement should settle the debate in the US for the time being. “We know that some of these discussions about changing the dosing schedule or dose are based on a belief that changing the dose or dosing schedule can help get more vaccine to the public faster,” Marks and Hahn said in their statement. “However, making such changes that are not supported by adequate scientific evidence may ultimately be counterproductive to public health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chmy9L"&gt;Right now, the limiting factor for vaccination in the US isn’t doses — it’s the delivery of those doses. Over 15 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines have been distributed, but &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;only 4.5 million people&lt;/a&gt; have gotten their first dose. Making more doses available won’t solve the current problem of getting shots in arms. The rollout has been slower than promised — the federal government left state and local health departments to figure out the logistics of vaccination programs, and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccines-slow-rollout-could-portend-more-problems-11609525711?reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;the process&lt;/a&gt; has been inconsistent and confusing for both patients and health care providers. &lt;/p&gt;
