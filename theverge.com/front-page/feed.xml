    <title>You too can own a stonks figurine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yUBeDc_Jyo6EIJA81nmYcdPYZnQ=/0x0:1124x749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757567/01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3pmU3"&gt;He’s real, he’s here, and I am so happy. &lt;a href="https://youtooz.com/products/stonks"&gt;The stonks guy is now a five-inch-tall, $30 thing you can buy&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a line graph that’s forever up 69 percent. It first debuted last July, but don’t let that stop you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTQuhV"&gt;Officially his name is Meme Man, and he’s the wonky former mascot of &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/756598251050956/photos/pb.756598251050956.-2207520000.1457643821./756599924384122/?type=3&amp;amp;theater"&gt;at least one surrealist meme page&lt;/a&gt;, though he began his life as &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/meme-man"&gt;a failed model of a human head&lt;/a&gt; over at 4chan’s 3D modeling board. Meme Man, however, has transcended his origins. You probably know him best in his banker config, confidently and wordlessly asserting that the Line Will Go Up and that numbers, by extension, can be trusted. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aajEDYims8yC2kjo8DzmVZE2tS4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275799/926e5009_c10a_48fe_b90e_fa0760f82fcd.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lbuPqt"&gt;I’m not gonna lie to you: I have never wanted anything so dumb so badly before. Possibly that’s because of the climate. A pack of wild redditors nearly bankrupted at least one hedge fund last week; the memes (and Meme Man) were naturally omnipresent. The frenzy of posts was intoxicating, and people were hopeful that by buying GameStop stock they might change the balance of our hopelessly broken financial system. It wasn’t silly, either; hope springs eternal from the human breast, and what’s a market if not the reification of people’s hopes and desires? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPtpo2"&gt;Anyway, Youtooz, the company behind the figurine, has written an incredible backstory for their product. “On the NASDANQ ^ NDQA 0.69USD (+69%), it’s always a bull run. Standing at five inches tall, Stonks has been immortalized in vinyl form,” the company writes. “Dressed in a black tailored suit and tie, you can be sure that this investor knows what he’s talking about.” And they’re right. Who knows more about the stock market than a guy in a black suit and tie? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkvRE4"&gt;However, the situation seems a little dark, at least for today. $GME is down many, many percentage points; it looks like the frenzy is starting to calm, and that the lines are righting themselves. Things are returning to the mean. The correct lines are going up again, and the invisible hand has returned to its invisible position. (It had previously halted trading on GameStop stock in Robinhood because of that app’s liquidity crisis brought on by retail redditors.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtY26O"&gt;The stonks guy, however, holds. Because playing the market isn’t about today — it’s about tomorrow, and the day after that, and the months and weeks and years it takes for storylines about property and capital to play out. The market is about the belief in a better future for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;; investing is a fundamentally individual pursuit. The stock market is as good a place as any to place your fears and dreams about the future, though its abstraction might prevent you from looking at the world around you and wondering how everything was assigned its value. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Millions is giving away $1 million — but who’s the real winner?  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CuGOyoNIk5Xu298d6zOuPnveu6c=/0x70:1440x1030/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757496/Millions_Ticket.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z5tgeB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://millions.app/"&gt;Millions is a new startup&lt;/a&gt; with a big promise: simply pick six numbers on its website, follow the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/millions"&gt;@Millions Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, and you could win $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eYYuk"&gt;It’s not some kind of scam, either: it’s being funded by same big names, like Biz Stone (one of the co-founders of Twitter), Joey Zwillinger (an Allbirds co-founder), Dave Gilboa and Neil Blumenthal (co-founders and CEOs of Warby Parker), Jeff Raider (who helped found both Warby Parker and Harry’s), and Daniel Greenberg (who helped found the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21320127/mschf-products-jesus-shoes-puff-chicken-office-business"&gt;viral internet firm MSCHF&lt;/a&gt;) among others. And the company — whose actual team is staying anonymous for now — is going to do 10 lottery drawings for the big $1 million prize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4sAxv"&gt;It sounds too good to be true. A free million-dollar giveaway being run by an anonymous new internet startup, all for just following them on Twitter? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WRddex1fg7_qqHbwR5D38Vi3hTk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268714/Screen_Shot_2021_01_29_at_2.50.13_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PWMEsp"&gt;Well, that’s because it sort of is: Millions isn’t promising to actually give away $1 million. It’s effectively holding a standard pick-six lottery, similar to things like the &lt;a href="https://www.powerball.com/games/home"&gt;Powerball&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.megamillions.com/how-to-play"&gt;Mega Millions&lt;/a&gt; lotteries. &lt;em&gt;If &lt;/em&gt;someone actually wins that lottery, the company will pay up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jEijp"&gt;But it turns out, that’s a big &lt;em&gt;if.&lt;/em&gt; The Millions lottery is actually &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; much&lt;/em&gt; harder to win than even the biggest real-world games because it has users pick six balls from 1-99, instead of the 1-69 or 1-70 pools that the traditional games require. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T03Cxf"&gt;It’s not a perfect analog since both Powerball and Mega Millions have players match five balls, and then also correctly guess a 1-26 or 1-25 Powerball / Mega Ball number, instead of a straight pick-six format here, but the odds speak for themselves. Winning the Powerball jackpot is about a one in 292,201,338 chance. Winning the grand prize in the Mega Millions lottery is about one in 302,575,350. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zbdRIE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Winning the $1 million jackpot in Millions is 1 in 1,120,529,256 chance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JieTEa"&gt;Winning the $1 million jackpot in Millions? One in 1,120,529,256. Mathematically speaking, your chance of winning a major lottery (already infinitesimally small) is still nearly&lt;em&gt; three times as likely&lt;/em&gt; as winning the jackpot in Millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxlKd4"&gt;Of course, the organizers behind Millions seem well aware of this: when asked about the low chances, the Millions organizers told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the “odds of winning the Weekly Prize are slim. But hey, all it costs is a Twitter follow!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJpolo"&gt;Looking at the official rules, the $1 million prize isn’t even listed as the “grand prize” of the competition. It’s a secondary, weekly prize that the company will give out if — and only if — someone hits the over one in a billion shot of matching all six numbers in one of the 10 weekly drawings. On the off chance that multiple winners hit that number somehow, it’ll get divided up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsarvq"&gt;The “real” prize is a far more modest $10,000, which will be randomly given to one of the entrants at the end of the 10 weeks — a sizable prize, to be sure, but a far cry from $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbi8Ty"&gt;The difference, of course, is that even with Millions’ one-in-a-billion odds, it’s still free to enter. Buying a lottery ticket costs $2; entering the Millions giveaway is free — or at least, free in terms of actual money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIuBL8"&gt;So, why bother? Well, because it seems that the actual point of Millions is to build up a brand and Twitter presence for the new company. The initial $1,000,000 giveaway is just the theoretical starting point; as the site explains, “Millions builds products that give away money to people. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Millions"&gt;@Millions&lt;/a&gt; is the first of such experiences.” The company has already been giving away smaller prizes on Twitter for the past several weeks as a soft launch, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBYSri"&gt;In essence, the big Millions giveaway is just another standard lottery — but instead of buying a ticket with cash, you’re paying with a Twitter follow and your contact information, valuable data that the company can use to help build its brand and launch future products down the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gj3usn"&gt;Millions could easily parlay this first venture into hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Twitter followers, all for the low cost of $10,000. And it’s easy to imagine future lotteries that then leverage that user base down the line for other ventures that may actually make money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7ZeaJ"&gt;Of course, someone might win that $1 million prize. Millions is doing 10 drawings, one every week over the next ten weeks. Depending on how popular the service gets and how lucky everyone is, someone could actually get paid. But the odds are certainly not in anyone’s favor — except for Millions’, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram’s ‘recently deleted’ feature lets you change your mind about deleting a post</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AkP9MdURVtZ5qOnWIowQbBo5ask=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757513/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9ZsiAN"&gt;Instagram is making it easier to bring back deleted posts. The company is rolling out a “recently deleted” feature in the app that’ll allow you to review content you’ve deleted, including photos, videos, reels, IGTV videos, and stories, and restore them. Instagram is positioning this feature as helpful against hacks, particularly if hackers gain control of an account and start deleting content. Starting today, users will need to confirm they’re the account owner through either text or email in order to access the feature or to delete content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFAPUG"&gt;Deleted items will stay in the folder for 30 days, and if not touched, they will automatically delete after that point. Deleted stories are the exception, however: they will only stay in the recently deleted section for 24 hours before they’re permanently removed. To access the folder, navigate to Settings &amp;gt; Account &amp;gt; Recently Deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqelnN"&gt;Clearly, Instagram wants to give people chances to keep their content before permanently removing it. The app already offers an archive, or a way to keep posts without them being publicly available, and with this feature, it’s allowing people to keep their posts as an option, even if they want to initially delete them. Instagram benefits from having more content, and thereby more data, on users. The more it can encourage people to keep their posts, the better it is for the service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition cuts multiplayer in favor of single-player improvements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Po-a5wtjsREc_Fob1jw3mwe1x44=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757109/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition__EDENPRIME_3840x2160.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rnEauq"&gt;When the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21518322/mass-effect-legendary-edition-original-trilogy-remaster-announced"&gt;enhanced remake&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect &lt;/em&gt;trilogy arrives, it won’t include multiplayer. According to longtime &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect &lt;/em&gt;developer Mac Walters, the team would have had to put in an immense amount of effort to bring the feature to the &lt;em&gt;Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;. “At some point we had to draw a line,” the project director said in a briefing about the game. “We’ve talked about doing the remaster for some time now, and at least at one point in time everything was on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2riBX"&gt;BioWare introduced multiplayer to the final installment of the trilogy, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt;. Although “these aren’t insurmountable challenges,” Walters said, they would have required focus on features outside of the single-player experience: how to incorporate crossplay or what to do with people who still play &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt;’s multiplayer today. “How do we honor that, how do we bring them in, can we somehow bridge that gap,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pIcsF"&gt;When the game launched in 2012, multiplayer served a narrative purpose as well. The game’s ending is partly dependent on the player’s “galactic readiness,” a combination of factors like player choice, resources, and success in competitive matches; a high readiness level helps usher in the game’s top-tier endings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nEzPy"&gt;Speaking with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Walters said the game has been rebalanced. Not only is multiplayer removed as a factor, but players who choose to skip directly to &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3 &lt;/em&gt;without playing previous games won’t be penalized. “It is intended to get those best endings, or the higher tier endings — I won’t say which one is best or worst — but obviously playing will be easier,” he said. “We just basically took that section out and redistributed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4n6s4F"&gt;Although some players might be disappointed by the game’s missing multiplayer, Walters said that, ultimately, it came down to creating the best-possible cohesive story experience. “The overall &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; is a better representation of the original trilogy because we’re able to focus on those single-player moments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBfEa6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; will launch May 14th on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BioWare is finally improving Black character customization in Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xPHm34M9UYCjnh46wCb39zS3TUE=/559x0:3799x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757137/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition__OMNIBLADE_3840x2160.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sAMgYe"&gt;Although the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; trilogy allowed players to create their own Shepard, the game had  limited options for making non-white characters. Environment and character director Kevin Meek told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that improving options for people of color was one of its top priorities when it came to &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming remastered collection. “If you have type 4 hair or a really dark skin tone or if that’s the Shepard you wanted to play as, you just did not really have that option in the original Mass Effect,” Meek said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWMsS7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; packages all three games with all of their corresponding DLC. Although the game won’t add new story content, it does overhaul its graphics and expand some gameplay elements to make them more modern. In returning to the series, BioWare had an opportunity to fix its shortcomings in the game’s original design. “There are certain hairstyles that just don’t work, especially for the female Shepards,” Meek said. “There was very little there that supported that at all. There was long flowing hair options, you can color it black, but those didn’t really work.” The team began by making a list of hairstyles it was missing, then working out textures. “You can’t put a really tight, really clean buzzed cut with shiny, shiny hair,” Meek said by way of example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tak0iU"&gt;In deciding which hairstyles to incorporate into a modernized game set in the future, the developers aimed for more “timeless” options. “The difference between style and fashion,” Meek said. Part of the improvements to the game’s fade hairstyles, for example, includes “sci-fi futuristic patterns” buzzed into the sides. “You don’t want to grab people’s attention, you just want it to fit within the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect &lt;/em&gt;universe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdNDYL"&gt;In addition to new hairstyles, skin tones, and more, the game is also improving on its “iconic” FemShep — a player-voted model that didn’t appear until the trilogy’s final installment. The canon character model’s late inclusion was “really limiting” for many players. “It’s pretty unfair for the people playing as females, you go through all of these moments throughout &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt; and then you get to &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt; and you’re just given this choice of do you want to continue with your Shepard, or do you want to switch your visuals completely,” Meek said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v94a6I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; will launch May 14th on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Asffpw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QnMcR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition won’t add new content — or more gay romances</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a3xWK-nyyZImHZKQ07Ml6jHDxF8=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757112/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition__THANE_3840x2160_LEGENDARY.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gmkUk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21518322/mass-effect-legendary-edition-original-trilogy-remaster-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will stick to a faithful retelling of the game’s story and already-made DLC, with no new narrative elements on the way. Speaking about the enhanced trilogy during a briefing, project director Mac Walters said while the team did consider incorporating new content, ultimately, BioWare decided against it. “Honestly we had looked at, is there stuff on cutting room floors and things like that that we could bring in?” Walters said. “And a lot of times that isn’t really in a state where you can just resurrect it and use it. It actually would require rebuilding from scratch and at that point you’re diverting effort away from the remastering of everything else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pchLBR"&gt;That also applies to hopes that the game might incorporate more queer romance options. “We’re not changing anything in the story or the way the characters or the plot points worked out,” Walters told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a separate interview. Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mass-effect-2-jack-gay-pansexual-fox-news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheGamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported that &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 2&lt;/em&gt;’s crewmate, Jack, was originally conceived as pansexual. &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 2 &lt;/em&gt;writer Brian Kindregan told the outlet that “the short version is, a lot of us were asked pretty late to focus the relationships on a more traditional kind of vector.” On &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GameAnim/status/1354195336953139201"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, former BioWare cinematic animator Jonathan Cooper said that another crewmate, Jacob, was also once intended to be romanceable for same-sex characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Fgzr2"&gt;Asked about the allegedly cut relationships, Walters said that “no one ever said we couldn’t do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Gs5EZ"&gt;“Honestly the writing team generally, and all the creators, are given a ton of freedom in bringing their vision — obviously we compromise with each other,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “You work together to sort of build a great character or story moment or something like that and there’s compromise there.” In regards to media scrutiny from outlets like Fox News, Walters said that it would have “probably spurred us on to do other things” in the series. “No one has ever come to me and said we can’t do this because the media says so,” Walters said. “Never.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JV09uB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; will launch May 14th on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition brings a much-needed overhaul to the trilogy on May 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6-HzZPQ9RW1pK6BILGjP7GjzxY8=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757117/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition___REAPERS_3840x2160.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vjwzN4"&gt;Remastering a series like &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; — not quite a full remake of the trilogy, but more substantial than a port — is a thorny task. It requires work on all three games and dozens of downloadable content packs. There are fan expectations, from players who want to see a beloved universe preserved to those who are still salty about how it all ended. As Mac Walters, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition &lt;/em&gt;project director, put it: “We talk about it sort of like we were restoring a beautiful, beloved car. But then it quickly turned into sure, if that car had been buried in cement, and every time you tried to clear off some of the cement you were worried about dinging the paint, or ripping off a mirror.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmCeuE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21518322/mass-effect-legendary-edition-original-trilogy-remaster-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, coming May 14th for PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and backwards-compatible with current consoles, packages the Shepard trilogy into one game. That includes over 40 DLC packs released during the series’s run, as well as &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/5/2927531/mass-effect-3-extended-cut-announced"&gt;extended cut&lt;/a&gt;. The game’s story will stay intact, including its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/5/2927769/bioware-mass-effect-3-finale"&gt;controversial ending&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking about the extended cut of &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt;, Walters referred again to developers caught in a cycle of always wanting to fix one last thing. “The extended cut was really that opportunity for us to add a little bit more love and a little bit more context around the ending,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sziJGK"&gt;The first &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; game launched in 2007, and the final game came out in 2012. There are more than a few elements of the game that are dated. “The opportunity now to be able to go back with all of those lessons learned and with all of the advancements … [has] been a dream for me,” Walters, a longtime developer on the original series, said. That includes returning to familiar characters and worlds. “You don’t often get a chance to revisit a lot of these things.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B9puXb4i-9PMXav1gw1uq8V4MPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268932/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition_ILLUSIVEMAN_3840x2160.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lSL6BB"&gt;When it comes to making games, Walters said that developers have to learn to eventually let go. “You have to kind of say we’re done with the game and we’re moving on.” With &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; being a trilogy, the team was able to take that “developer angst” and use it for the next game. “Over the course of three games, we were fortunate enough to sort of build on that and really bring the game and the franchise kind of to where we saw it in our minds’ eye at the very beginning.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnQoKV"&gt;In the new remaster, all three entries can be accessed from a single menu, with players able to start from any game they choose. The tweaks range from a more convenient, comical ability to skip through elevator rides faster to overhauling the look of entire levels like Eden Prime, the very first world players are introduced to in &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 1&lt;/em&gt;. “Ultimately what this was about was bringing this forward onto the current gen and for future generations as well, with the kind of fidelity and taking off some of the edges that people would expect with that,” Walters said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xMcUg5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Eyelashes like spider legs or potato-shaped heads&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U6kVVX"&gt;The changes throughout the series, especially in the first game, are hard to miss. In a presentation offering a direct comparison, characters who previously had curious features — eyelashes like spider legs or potato-shaped heads — now look sleek. Game textures, a well-known buggy feature of &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 1,&lt;/em&gt; in particular, have been fixed to actually resemble the materials they’re meant to be. The team has apparently squashed hundreds of bugs that stuck around throughout the original trilogy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVSpbZ"&gt;“It wasn’t that long ago that if you made a very expansive, large playbox kind of game, you could be excused for all sorts of bugs,” Walters told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a separate interview, reflecting on the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/3/16/14944840/mass-effect-andromeda-animations-final"&gt;memeable nature&lt;/a&gt; of bugs these days. “They expect a lot. They expect us to do our jobs, and part of our jobs is shipping a game to quality, bug-free as much as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GTbiUA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8i53TtQ6IQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T9lbf1"&gt;But it’s not always so simple. Walters compares it to trying to take a family photo with every relative, plus their pets. “You can imagine that you’re gonna take about 1,000 photos near the end, and one of them’s going to work. That’s the one you ship, and it’s as close as possible.” But look closely, and you start to see that someone has their eyes closed. And in the photos before and after, someone’s passed out in the background. “There’s a lot of challenge there, but no excuse,” Walters said. “I think the expectation from fans more and more is that you ship a quality game period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy2QJ0"&gt;As for whether he enjoys all of those memes? “It’s funny if it’s someone else’s bug,” Walters said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHDhXH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will pay $61.7 million to Flex drivers after wage theft allegations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sAHqZ-ADHZjMPEhy91HzRTVf9Co=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756983/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jIdNkl"&gt;Amazon will pay $61.7 million to Flex drivers to settle allegations of stolen tips, after &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/02/amazon-pay-617-million-settle-ftc-charges-it-withheld-some"&gt;an extensive investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The figure represents the total amount of allegedly withheld tips over the two and a half years that Amazon Flex’s controversial base pay system was in place. Amazon also agreed to new restrictions on how it communicates wage information to drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJ2SMy"&gt;“In total, Amazon stole nearly one-third of drivers’ tips to pad its own bottom line,” FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra said &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1587003/20200102_final_rchopra_statement_v2.pdf"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;, accusing Amazon of “expanding its business empire by cheating its workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Y8ekB"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u4dkyk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In total, Amazon stole nearly one-third of drivers’ tips to pad its own bottom line”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ppzcn"&gt;Instituted in late 2016, the variable base pay system came under scrutiny after &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-amazon-drivers-tips-20190207-story.html"&gt;reporting by the&lt;em&gt; Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;’ Johana Bhuiyan in February 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon initially defended the practice, saying drivers still received 100 percent of the tips sent by customers, even in instances when those tips displaced base pay that would otherwise have been provided by Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6v6HVP"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/amazon_flex_complaint.pdf"&gt;the FTC complaint&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon used this ambiguity to recruit drivers with promises of high base wages and the potential for significant tips — then pad its own bottom line by using tipped income to make up much of the paid base wage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G73iuu"&gt;In hiring materials materials, workers were told they would keep 100% of their tips, and separately guaranteed a base wage between $18 and $25 per hour. The drivers were not informed that the tips would sometimes be used to reimburse the base wage, resulting in some of the tipped amount going to Amazon rather than the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dANprM"&gt;“Amazon received hundreds of complaints from drivers after enacting the change, as drivers became suspicious when their overall earnings decreased,” the commission said in its official statement. “Drivers who complained received form e-mails falsely claiming that Amazon was continuing to pay drivers 100 percent of tips.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdguCQ"&gt;Amazon became aware of the FTC’s investigation in May of 2019, when the commission issued a civil investigative demand for records relating to the Flex program. Amazon discontinued the practice &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20828550/amazon-delivery-drivers-tips-end-base-salaries-flex"&gt;in August 2019.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITfLxh"&gt;The two years during gave Flex an advantage over competing delivery services, allowing the company to recruit a significant base of drivers by advertising the inflated base pay. “By the time this scheme was exposed in late 2019, Amazon Flex was far more established,” wrote Commissioner Chopra. “This conduct raises serious questions about how Amazon amassed and wielded its market power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euNYP0"&gt;Amazon reported $11.6 billion in profits over the course of 2019, with the Flex program accounting for just a tiny portion of the company’s operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WLUVPo"&gt;DoorDash and Instacart both maintained a similar base-wage system, although neither company is part of today’s settlement. Instacart reversed its policy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/10/18218329/doordash-amazon-flex-instacart-tipping-policies-controversy"&gt;in February 2019&lt;/a&gt;, shortly after the&lt;em&gt; LA Times&lt;/em&gt; reporting brought it to light. DoorDash &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/nyregion/doordash-tip-policy.html"&gt;made similar changes&lt;/a&gt; the following July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ic3gAf"&gt;Notably, the settlement only includes the money that was withheld from drivers, as the FTC does not have legal authority to impose punitive fines on companies that break the law. But in a press conference announcing the settlement, FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips called on Congress to grant the commission greater enforcement powers so that it could institute more severe penalties in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50emks"&gt;“Prevailing law does not provide for penalties for conduct like this,” said Phillips told reporters. “We’re calling on Congress to give us the authority to go after companies with more tools, specifically penalties and rule-making, so that we can better deter conduct like this from ever occurring in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s next headquarters is a glass poop emoji covered in trees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HoOoKxF_ZeIwM0Qpj967WsCZBHU=/0x158:1920x1438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756973/aerial_reduced.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Helix proposal at Amazon’s Arlington, Virginia campus. | Image: NBBJ / Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Yq8uB"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/amazon-offices/the-next-chapter-for-hq2-sustainable-buildings-surrounded-by-nature"&gt;unveiled the design&lt;/a&gt; for the next portion of its Arlington, Virginia headquarters, and one building stands out far from the rest: a swirling glass tower covered in trees that rises to a point above the rest of the city’s skyline. Amazon calls the building “the Helix” because its corkscrew shape is supposed to take inspiration from “the natural beauty of a double helix.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VY7ZSP"&gt;It also — it must be said — bears a distinct resemblance to the swirling poop emoji, though with some healthier colors mixed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SIdPw"&gt;On the inside, the Helix will be filled with a “variety of alternative work environments” that Amazon employees can use. On the outside, there’ll be two sets of spiraling paths dotted with local plants that you’ll literally be able to hike up. (Though you may want to bring a water bottle — the renders seem to show stairs along the whole route, suggesting it’s a steep path up.) The building will be 350 feet tall, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-unveils-outdoorsy-new-hq2-renewing-its-commitment-to-offices-11612267200?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon says that it plans to offer public tours on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AmYL_W4YIkzmhwcHYPXzf7Hl6uY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275666/mt_vernon_trail_reduced.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A render of Amazon’s Helix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cpwJpm"&gt;Amazon has a similar standout structure at its Seattle headquarters. There, it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/29/16944706/amazon-mini-rainforest-workspace-spheres-seattle"&gt;the Spheres&lt;/a&gt;, three connected glass globes filled with greenery. Its design is echoed in the similarly glass-and-green Helix, albeit at a much larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0kpIO"&gt;The Helix is still just a proposal, so Amazon will need to get local approval before construction on the building can start. The building and surrounding campus were designed by the architecture firm NBBJ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/81464DMFaEMMvohbCshBFu_W0m8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275667/dogpark_reduced.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A render of the park within Amazon’s Arlington headquarters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gxX5Xu"&gt;Along with the Helix, Amazon also unveiled plans for the campus around it. It’s planning to construct three 22-story buildings around the Helix. Between them, Amazon plans to create a plaza filled with green space and a dog run that’ll all be open to the public. The company is planning to make room for retail stores and restaurants, and, of course, food trucks. There’ll also be parking for 950 bicycles, according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. This portion of the campus will be located at Pen Place within Arlington’s Pentagon City neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5VTQ1"&gt;The first phase of Amazon’s Arlington headquarters, located just to the south at Metropolitan Park, &lt;a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2019/12/16/first-phase-of-amazons-permanent-hq2-in-pentagon-city-approved/"&gt;was approved&lt;/a&gt; in December 2019. Construction is &lt;a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/its-been-exactly-2-years-since-amazon-announced-hq2-would-be-built-in-arlington"&gt;now underway&lt;/a&gt; on a pair of 22-story towers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber is buying alcohol delivery service Drizly for $1.1 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ff93fbRwjs80mdvjuOeICx1SSpc=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756963/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xBY8kV"&gt;Uber &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202005693/en/Uber-to-Acquire-Drizly"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s buying alcohol delivery service &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrizly.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F2%2F22262155%2Fuber-drizly-alcohol-delivery-service-eats-postmates#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Drizly&lt;/a&gt; in a deal worth $1.1 billion, as the ride-sharing company continues to build out its stable of food and other delivery services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDUnmd"&gt;The eventual plan is for Drizly’s marketplace of beer, wine, and liquor to be integrated into the existing Uber Eats application, giving Uber users a one-stop shop for both food and drink deliveries. The existing Drizly app will stick around, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IiyziZ"&gt;Drizly is effectively an online delivery storefront for existing local liquor stores. The company partners with local sellers and then enlists delivery drivers — similar to Uber Eats — to handle the delivery. The service is now available in over 1,400 cities across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="inNQlC"&gt;This deal marks the latest delivery-focused move on Uber’s part in recent months, even as it’s begun to sell off the less profitable parts of its business. Last year, Uber sold off its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;autonomous vehicle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22086597/uber-sells-flying-taxi-elevate-joby-aviation"&gt;flying taxi divisions&lt;/a&gt; as it sought to be more profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFa1JV"&gt;Those moves followed Uber’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287128/grubhub-just-eat-takeaway-merger-uber-deal-antitrust"&gt;failed attempt&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21255936/uber-grubhub-offer-buying-all-stock-delivery-service-eats-meals-merger"&gt;purchase GrubHub&lt;/a&gt; last year, along with a successful acquisition of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21312447/uber-postmates-acquisition-announced-food-delivery"&gt;Postmates over the summer&lt;/a&gt; for $2.65 billion. The company has also recently started to move into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315159/uber-grocery-delivery-launch-cornershop-latin-america-canada"&gt;on-demand grocery delivery&lt;/a&gt;, beginning in Latin America and Canada, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fuber-health-expands-to-include-prescription-delivery%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F2%2F22262155%2Fuber-drizly-alcohol-delivery-service-eats-postmates#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;expanded its Uber Health service&lt;/a&gt; to add prescription delivery. The acquisition of Drizly fits neatly into the expanding delivery-focused approach for Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQHCSb"&gt;It’s a strategy that makes sense. While futuristic projects like self-driving cars or on-demand flying taxis sound cool on paper, neither has resulted in any real profitable products. And in a bruising 2020 that saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551683/uber-q3-2020-earnings-revenue-loss-delivery"&gt;Uber post record losses&lt;/a&gt; as travel plummeted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, delivery services remained a bright spot on Uber’s ledger, growing massively, thanks to a similar COVID-induced spike in customers wanting to order in more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sCNY4"&gt;Notably, these new delivery services are all businesses that rely on contract workers. Uber recently spent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551136/uber-prop-22-victory-national-q3-2020-earnings"&gt;millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; as part of a lobbying campaign in California to avoid classifying those workers as employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;through Prop 22&lt;/a&gt;. (A group of Uber and Lyft drivers is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227042/uber-lyft-prop-22-lawsuit-overturn-drivers-california"&gt;currently suing&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that it “illegally” excludes drivers from California’s workers’ compensation program.) That’s in contrast to the parts of the company that Uber is winding down, like the autonomous vehicle program, which relied on full-time employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qau3U9"&gt;Uber and Drizly expect the deal to close sometime in the first half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
