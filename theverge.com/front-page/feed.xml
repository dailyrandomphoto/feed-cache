    <title>Niantic admits it needs to communicate better with Pokémon Go players</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRurPf"&gt;Last month Niantic sparked a backlash in the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; community when it announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605874/pokemon-go-pokestop-distance-halved-us-new-zealand"&gt;reverse some of the changes&lt;/a&gt; it made last year to make the game more playable while staying at home. The company said it would set up a “task force” to figure out the best way to move forward and would announce its findings by today, September 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUoay0"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22642030/niantic-pokemon-go-pandemic-interaction-distance-80-meters"&gt;announced last week&lt;/a&gt;, the first main point of action is that Niantic will keep the 80-meter interaction distance for pokéstops and gyms everywhere around the world, after first saying it’d revert to the pre-pandemic 40-meter distance first in the US and New Zealand. Niantic now says it realizes that altering mechanics like this in a real-time, region-specific manner is impractical, and will apply features in the same way across the globe going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CqScUa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We went through a rough learning experience.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qmcMo1"&gt;“We went through a rough learning experience recently when we had to adjust the game settings for New Zealand quickly in response to their lockdown,” executive producer Steve Wang says in a statement. “This experience taught us that we are not going to be able to effectively adjust the experience on a country-by-country basis in real-time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgCYzC"&gt;Wang says that while the increased interaction distance will stay, the team still believes that discovering things in the real world is an important part of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; and plans to “develop new ways that motivate and reward Trainers for exploring and exercising in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWMetl"&gt;The other main finding of the task force was that Niantic “has a lot of room to grow when it comes to communication with our players.” To that end, the company says it’ll post bi-monthly developer diaries to “share the latest priorities, events, and features,” and will engage in “regular conversations with community leaders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kXUWa"&gt;Niantic isn’t giving a whole lot of new, concrete information here, but it’s quite unusual for a gaming company to call itself out like this. What will ultimately matter most, of course, is how it handles similar situations in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TimTheTatman, one of Twitch’s biggest streamers, moves to YouTube Gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gamers’ Choice Awards 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tbe3QsgVY4hozan7XjnrMVRJs0A=/1x132:1992x1459/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69804097/1077212614.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjn1tr"&gt;Tim “TimTheTatMan” Betar, one of the most popular streamers on Twitch, is leaving &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman/status/1433096643121909766"&gt;to stream exclusively on YouTube Gaming&lt;/a&gt;. His move comes just days after another big streamer, Ben “DrLupo” Lupo, announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal"&gt;he’d be switching from Twitch to YouTube as well&lt;/a&gt;. Betar’s first stream will take place on September 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCusxz"&gt;In moving from Twitch, Betar is leaving behind &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/timthetatman"&gt;the 7 million followers&lt;/a&gt; he’s accrued on the Amazon-owned platform. But he won’t be starting from scratch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/timthetatman"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, where he already has 3.8 million subscribers. YouTube declined to comment on the terms of its deal with Betar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G63l7A"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wRaYM6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/timthetatman-will-leave-twitch-for-youtube-2021-8"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Betar said the move will let him spend more time with his family. “When I started, I had no family obligations and I could [stream] a lot of hours,” he said to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. “The reality is, now that I’ve got my wife and my son, it’s hard for me to stream as much as I did beforehand.” Lupo, in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/08/30/drlupo-twitch-youtube-exclusive-deal/"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, similarly indicated that his YouTube Gaming deal would give him more family time and said that the deal he was presented with would let him be “secure for life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MiaxD7"&gt;Betar and Lupo’s moves follow earlier switches made by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948315/twitch-jack-courage-dunlop-youtube-live-exclusive-deal-fortnite-100-thieves"&gt;Jack “CouRage” Dunlop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063683/valkyrae-twitch-youtube-100-thieves"&gt;Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter&lt;/a&gt; and signal that YouTube Gaming might be investing more in bringing big names to the platform. YouTube Gaming still sees far fewer hours watched than Twitch does, &lt;a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q1-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-eaba2143f492"&gt;according to Streamlabs&lt;/a&gt;, so the signings could help YouTube close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmSbGb"&gt;In an acknowledgment of the move, Twitch shared &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1433101184479399937"&gt;a montage of Betar on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, including the iconic moment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21376298/timthetatman-fall-guys-victory-win-finally-twitch-live"&gt;when he finally won a game of &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tqrbby"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You'll always be a King to us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for everything, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@timthetatman&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/keeZeElnpm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/keeZeElnpm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1433101184479399937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yu1ORR"&gt;“It’s been great to see all that TimTheTatman has achieved since being partnered in 2012 on Twitch — whether it was marrying the love of his life and welcoming an heir to the Tatman throne, or the trials and tribulations of achieving his first Fall Guys crown,” a Twitch spokesperson said in a statement. “It’s been a pleasure being part of Tim’s community, and we are proud of everything he has done for gaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrjvMO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 1st, 1:16PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that YouTube declined to comment on its deal with Betar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Orleans needs a better backup plan for blackouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hurricane Ida Makes Landfall In Louisiana Leaving Devastation In Its Wake" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DRq7T-tuNyRU96oG2wG9chwPgPE=/2x0:4046x2696/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69803850/1337352256.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new gas plant still isn’t enough to solve the city’s power problems &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="QUg67u"&gt;Hurricane Ida thoroughly wrecked New Orleans’ power supply, preying on vulnerabilities that are only likely to get worse in the future as storms like Ida become more fierce. The storm knocked out all eight transmission lines that bring power into New Orleans, plunging the city into darkness. The damage was so intense that a new gas-fired power plant — sold as something that could keep the lights on after big storms — took days to bring power to the nearest neighborhood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LI3tG0"&gt;To keep the lights on in the future, leaders need to abandon old strategies and build up different kinds of energy infrastructure, experts say. The fallout from Ida is yet another reminder of how fragile the country’s existing energy infrastructure is, especially as climate change brings on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;more extreme weather&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4jzorA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can’t depend on the traditional system”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="omm1xc"&gt;“We’ve been saying, you know, we can’t depend on the traditional system,” says Logan Atkinson Burke, executive director of the local consumer advocacy group Alliance for Affordable Energy. “We need to be planning for the kind of climate impacts that we know are coming, and here they are. Having not planned for them, we’re experiencing the kinds of problems we expected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Txxuaj"&gt;Even before the storm, it was clear that power lines were vulnerable, Burke and other energy experts have said for years. And rather than build another big power plant — in a flood-prone area, no less — the city could have distributed more resilient sources of renewable energy across the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WxP8d"&gt;Instead, electric and gas utility Entergy has been fined for delaying maintenance to the area’s energy system, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/31/ida-entergy-hurricane-louisiana-power/?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=154780786&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8AdkpgKv9ozmc2hhkr1zlmgl1kvABybd9jUlZGrnPspOWoPWYHv1SWUxpAAL1Pyj8QiKZ3ebZjD2tRL6zA1rA6rs44NLVLKOX7DQB4yHDcx9xb0a4&amp;amp;utm_content=154780786&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, which can make the grid even more vulnerable when storms strike. In a move that baffled many residents, Entergy built a controversial new $210 million gas-fired power plant in New Orleans that come online last year. The utility said the plant would help keep the lights on in the event of a major storm like Ida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zucA2v"&gt;“Virtually no one” had electricity in Southeast Louisiana after the storm passed, Gov. John Bel Edwards &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LouisianaGov/status/1432340549940490248"&gt;said on August 30th&lt;/a&gt;, and residents could suffer through weeks of power outages. Three days after the storm, made landfall, that plant restored power for “some customers” living nearby, but there’s still too much damage to the grid to easily move power around the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mabd32"&gt;As the blackout continues, residents will&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;endure dangerously oppressive heat without air conditioning. They’ll have trouble charging phones and laptops that allow them to communicate with emergency services or loved ones. With water treatment centers lacking power, many don’t have running water or are under boil water advisories.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Officials are concerned about carbon monoxide poisoning as people turn to portable backup generators. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vehicles drive down Bourbon Street during a city-wide power outage caused by Hurricane Ida in New Orleans on August 29th, 2021. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YWW1kS"&gt;There’s a lot the state could do to make its grid more resilient and prevent blackouts like this one.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Adding more renewable energy is one way to make the grid more sustainable and less likely to fail completely in a catastrophe. And in the case of Ida, upgrading transmission lines that serve as main arteries bringing energy into the city, as well as smaller distribution lines that deliver energy within the city, would have made the grid sturdier — an argument that Burke’s alliance made as it pushed back against plans to build the new gas plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyd4k0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;﻿&lt;/strong&gt;Across the country, there’s been a push to bury transmission and distribution lines to keep them safer from the elements. Embattled California utility PG&amp;amp;E was pushed to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/21/1019058925/utility-bury-power-lines-wildfires-california"&gt;bury thousands of miles of power lines&lt;/a&gt; after above-ground lines sparked horrific fires. The same could be done in Louisiana to safeguard them from severe storms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQcmST"&gt;“Instead, all the money that Entergy has been spending is on their gas infrastructure,”  Burke says. Entergy opened up another new gas plant in St. Charles Parish in 2019. On paper, building a new gas plant might make financial sense for companies. Utility regulation in the US tends to incentivize new capital investments (in things like, say, a new gas plant) over upgrading existing power lines, says Akshaya Jha, an assistant professor of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. That’s hindered improvements to transmission and distribution lines across the nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEjXqj"&gt;“Basically we did not need the plant. And why are you paying for something that we don’t need? It’s just crazy,” Dawn Hebert, president of the East New Orleans Neighborhood Advisory Commission, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; prior to the storm hitting Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHTQRJ"&gt;Residents like Hebert from majority-Black and Vietnamese neighborhoods nearby were concerned about higher utility bills and air pollution because of the plant. Consumer and environmental advocates challenged the &lt;a href="https://www.entergy.com/brightfuturenola/new-orleans-power-station/"&gt;New Orleans Power Station&lt;/a&gt; in court for years. Ultimately, the Louisiana Supreme Court upheld the city council’s decision to approve the plant, and it came online last year. It’s what’s called a “peaker” plant, which only fires up when energy demand “peaks” — or when there’s a major disruption to supply like a hurricane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VFXtL"&gt;“It is important that New Orleans has a source of local generation to aid in storm restoration and prevent extended outages following weather events that could take down transmission lines needed to import power,” Former president and CEO of Entergy Charles Rice wrote in an opinion defending the need for the new plant on &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/opinions/article_29db9f5e-8ebd-5b3c-966b-f10f01a454fc.html"&gt;Nola.com&lt;/a&gt; in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpWWV9"&gt;With Ida, the city’s transmission and distribution lines sustained so much damage, it’s still not clear when Entergy will be able to get power from the plant to more residents. In an update posted on Entergy’s website, the utility said that it is working to repair power lines and substations. Entergy did not immediately respond to a request from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. A spokesperson for the utility &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/31/ida-entergy-hurricane-louisiana-power/?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=154780786&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8AdkpgKv9ozmc2hhkr1zlmgl1kvABybd9jUlZGrnPspOWoPWYHv1SWUxpAAL1Pyj8QiKZ3ebZjD2tRL6zA1rA6rs44NLVLKOX7DQB4yHDcx9xb0a4&amp;amp;utm_content=154780786&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;told&lt;em&gt; The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it had spent $4.2 billion on its transmission lines between 2014 and 2019, although it’s unclear where in Entergy’s large service area (which spans several states) that money was spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwJlfC"&gt;In the short term, repairing downed lines is a priority for turning the lights back on for residents. With those lines back up, the gas-fired peaker plant can provide some much-needed juice. While it won’t be enough to supply the entire city, it can&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;get power to critical infrastructure like hospitals. But even that is dependent on the plant having enough fuel — natural gas — to fire itself up. That doesn’t yet seem to be an issue in Ida’s wake, but that was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287130/texas-natural-gas-production-power-outages-frozen"&gt;major problem&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year when a cold snap left millions of Texans without power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bMjAN4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Long-term solutions will require more imagination&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l4IJBy"&gt;Long-term solutions will require more imagination, experts say. “Looking to the past to give us an idea about the future is not as not as good as used to be,” says Joshua Rhodes, a research associate at the University of Texas at Austin. “We should be taking increased risk from a changing climate into consideration whenever we are replacing this infrastructure or rebuilding this infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pj7GfA"&gt;Climate change is supercharging extreme weather events, a definitive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from the United Nations recently said. Tropical storms are growing more fierce and unpredictable, and that will test anything Louisiana rebuilds. Meanwhile, aging energy systems in the US were built on fossil fuels that exacerbate the climate crisis by&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;producing more heat-trapping greenhouse gases. To get the climate crisis under control, no&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422824/natural-gas-infrastructure-methane-emissions-climate-change-air-pollution"&gt;new gas infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; should be built, says another United Nations report published in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6lach"&gt;There are alternatives to fossil fuel plants that could keep the lights on in an emergency. The way most grids currently operate, huge areas might be reliant on a single plant. So if a disaster strikes that plant or the lines that connect it to homes, the effects are far-reaching. One way to fix that problem, while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions, is to rewire the grid so that renewable sources of energy are dotted throughout communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPN1Jt"&gt;New Orleans offers a perfect example of how this might work. The city already has a lot of residential solar. If those solar panels were&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;paired with batteries, residents could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21523976/virtual-power-plants-solar-energy-grid-resilience-climate-change"&gt;store energy for emergencies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Batteries are still expensive, so it’s something that utilities, regulators, and city planners would need to incentivize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GJGQNB"&gt;“Let’s think about investing our money in ways that the dollar goes farther,” Burke says. “Let’s solve the problem at the root where people live,” she says, because as it is now, “people are being asked to shelter in their homes in hot, humid weather, and with no answer yet as to when there will be electricity.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I completely buy the conspiracy theory that Roy Kent from Ted Lasso is CGI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D12nxpfJHk6eq5e9crJU7HCjJIQ=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69803841/brett_goldstein_ted_lasso.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You want me to believe this is flesh and blood? Absolutely not, but they did a great job with the fabric effects. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M68IVj"&gt;I’ll confess this upfront: I’ve yet to watch an episode of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso. &lt;/em&gt;But I absolutely buy the conspiracy theory that one of the show’s main characters, Roy Kent, is a CGI creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fyzetq"&gt;People on Reddit have apparently been talking about this &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/TedLasso/comments/j268hn/ok_just_started_the_show_and_cgi/"&gt;for months&lt;/a&gt;, but after their discussion was shared on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guymrdth/status/1431693140902219781"&gt;Twitter this week&lt;/a&gt;, the theory about the Apple TV Plus show has gone mainstream. I read some of the threads, googled some screenshots of Kent himself (or &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt;), and I have to agree: the man looks like he stepped straight out of &lt;em&gt;FIFA 21&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A7yoFl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;no more ted lasso discourse it's time for "brett goldstein is cgi" discourse &lt;a href="https://t.co/DkSlFAlNp7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DkSlFAlNp7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— guy (@guymrdth) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guymrdth/status/1431693140902219781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="8MzNmh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;DOES THIS MAN LOOK REAL TO YOU     ☮️ ☮️⚛️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/RlKrqosqOC"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RlKrqosqOC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— asoingbob odenkirk (@imnormalnow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/imnormalnow/status/1415087800546992129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0QCD3J"&gt;When I broached the subject in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Slack, a number of colleagues said they’d already had this exact discussion with friends. “I have thought this since ep 1 and i did not know it was a thing other people thought!” said one, before sharing screencaps of a group chat on the subject, which devolved into a discussion about how &lt;em&gt;furry&lt;/em&gt; Kent is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42U7Z5"&gt;None of us could put our fingers on exactly why Roy (who is “played” by “actor” Brett Goldstein) looks so uncanny, but we settled on the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="AnOTWw"&gt;The man has perfect facial hair. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zx4hoo"&gt;Apple loves using soft lighting that makes fabric and skin look oddly smooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mtEPBk"&gt;The contextual triggers of him being a footballer make one think of &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hyX4Tc"&gt;Is his head maybe quite big in comparison to the rest of his body? Is that rude???&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="8h3jKG"&gt;And in fairness, TV shows and films are blurring the line between CGI and human actors more than ever nowadays. Think about the appearance of a de-aged Princess Leia in &lt;em&gt;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story &lt;/em&gt;or (SPOILER ALERT) Luke Skywalker at the end of the second season of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;. Nvidia even did a recent press conference, which included a CGI version of the company’s CEO, Jensen Huang (though only for a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/nvidia-faked-part-of-a-press-conference-with-a-cgi-ceo/"&gt;single, brief shot&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1Nfx5"&gt;So, yeah, Roy Kent is CGI, I buy it! Why not? For good measure, I’m going to start believing that my boss, family, and close friends are all CGI as well. Maybe one day I’ll be able to join them. At least if I was computer-generated, my beard would look better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>League of Legends is getting a virtual interactive heavy metal concert</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ea9lmoAIH_wBI9_Tp-PQHnEeCbE=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69803797/Copy_of_007_PK_Concert_Environment_Shot.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hiIRpo"&gt;Yet another big game is jumping into the world of virtual concerts. &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; creator Riot is partnering with “virtual entertainment” company Wave for an upcoming event centered on the game’s in-universe heavy metal band Pentakill. The concert is set to take place on September 8th at 1:30PM PT / 4:30PM ET, and it’s tied to the band’s upcoming album release. You can watch it &lt;a href="http://wave.watch/pentakill"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRVCsl"&gt;From the sound of it, the Pentakill show will be a bit more involved than other virtual concerts. It’s described as “an interactive journey through the full concept album,” which will release after the show. (Riot has been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/riotgamesmusic/status/1432719847813787662"&gt;teasing&lt;/a&gt; Pentakill’s third album over the past little while.) Wave says that viewers will be able to “influence the performance in real time” as well through features like voting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BJpKZU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ariana Grande’s Fortnite tour was a moment years in the making","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"},{"title":"Designing League of Legends’ stunning holographic Worlds opening ceremony","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959206/league-of-legends-worlds-2019-opening-ceremony-holograms-holonet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D9p1sA"&gt;Pentakill is one of a small number of in-universe bands for &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, joining the likes of K/DA (K-pop) and True Damage (hip-hop). In the past, Riot has utilized these virtual musicians for IRL shows at showcase events like the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championship; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/31/21541871/league-of-legends-world-championship-worlds-2020-opening-ceremony-ar-kda"&gt;K/DA appeared at the 2020 edition through augmented reality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959206/league-of-legends-worlds-2019-opening-ceremony-holograms-holonet"&gt;while True Damage holograms took the stage the year prior&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvUefZ"&gt;The news also comes as these kinds of virtual concerts are becoming increasingly prominent. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, in particular, has featured some big stars in increasingly elaborate in-game shows, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208223/fortnite-epic-games-marshmello-concert-exciting-bizarre-future-music"&gt;Marshmello&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt;, and — most recently — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max now has a dedicated app on Vizio SmartCast TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wE-J1TJqa1ZiuGE3FyNaYCO8tJI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69803735/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ukfToS"&gt;HBO Max is now available on Vizio SmartCast TVs, meaning users will no longer have to use casting workarounds to access the streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUzEk3"&gt;Prior to today’s announcement, Vizio TVs lacked a native app within SmartCast, Vizio’s smart TV interface. Instead, they’d have to cast its content to their televisions using Apple AirPlay or by casting with Google. The addition of the app directly from the apps menu should make accessing HBO Max far more intuitive for SmartCast users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrUha5"&gt;To mark the launch of the app on its sets, Vizio will also introduce a custom homescreen carousel to showcase HBO Max’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608403/hbo-max-new-subscribers-free-episodes"&gt;new teaser freebies&lt;/a&gt;. HBO Max no longer offers free trials, though it recently announced a limited sampling of the pilot episodes of more than a dozen of some of its most popular series, which can be &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hbomax.com%2Fwatch-free&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22652258%2Fhbo-max-now-vizio-smartcast-tvs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;streamed in-app&lt;/a&gt; without paying for an HBO Max subscription. Vizio users will be able to access these rotating teasers directly from the Vizio carousel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnxc26"&gt;The addition of HBO Max on the Vizio platform comes more than a year after the streaming service’s launch. It also arrives as HBO Max has widened its distribution footprint in recent months, most recently launching on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607655/hbo-max-lg-webos-smart-tv-now-available-united-states"&gt;LG smart TVs&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600943/dish-adds-hbo-max-cinemax"&gt;Dish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648966/hbo-max-youtube-spectrum-tv"&gt;Spectrum TV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fyNKE"&gt;“The launch of HBO Max on VIZIO SmartCast TVs is a terrific addition to the vast distribution of the platform, adding to our connected TV footprint and making it easier than ever for our customers to access HBO Max where and how they want,” Jennifer Mirgorod, head of partner management and partner marketing at WarnerMedia, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CD Projekt Red is targeting late-2021 release dates for Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3’s next-gen upgrades</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Night City overhead view in Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VQfeG5FQmC8vz2kjJtjRSpgWEKA=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69803688/Cyberpunk2077_Above_it_all_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l8s65O"&gt;CD Projekt Red announced that the free next-gen upgrades for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&lt;/em&gt;, meant for the PS5 and Xbox Series X, have target release dates for late 2021 (&lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2021/09/h1-2021-results-presentation.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). The company has been promising that the updates were on their way, but now we have a somewhat more specific window for when they might arrive — and it’s still within this calendar year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1n5FT"&gt;For &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, the upgrade is a big opportunity to bring players back after its December 2020 launch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;which was something of a fiasco&lt;/a&gt;. Releasing a free update to the game that takes advantage of the next-gen consoles’ power could be a way to get players to jump back into it. From &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; launch, PS5 and Xbox Series players have been able to play the game utilizing backward compatibility mode. For PS4 and Xbox One players, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167303/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-console-google-stadia"&gt;running &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; could be a struggle&lt;/a&gt;, while the new consoles can provide reasonable performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jU8xyy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ‘Cyberpunk 2077’ launch was infamously plagued by bugs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h7g5ty"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; infamously had a launch plagued by bugs, poor performance, and crashes, with older consoles suffering the most. It was in such a poor state that it was yanked from the PlayStation Store shortly after launch and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543298/cyberpunk-2077-playstation-store-ps4-warning"&gt;only recently returned&lt;/a&gt;, along with a warning. CD Projekt Red offered refunds to people who were disappointed by the game, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176279/cyberpunk-2077-performance-issues-refunds-microsoft-sony-ps4-xbox-one"&gt;getting them was a bit of a hassle&lt;/a&gt; for a bit. Since then, the studio has worked to improve it with a number of patches and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627096/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-3-reset-perks-mini-map"&gt;has even introduced new features&lt;/a&gt; to help make it easier to jump back into the game for those who gave up on it in frustration or lost interest after a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQB7Ti"&gt;A next-gen version of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; could have the same effect, with people who already played giving it another chance now that it’s more optimized for new consoles. Plus, it could act as a sort of relaunch for the holiday season in 2021 — the list of games that are truly optimized for the PS5 and Xbox Series X is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432601/sony-playstation-studios-ps5-games-25-new-ip-interview"&gt;still pretty slim&lt;/a&gt;, so having &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on it could help entice new players as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6Gcud"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; remains largely beloved years after its release, so a next-gen update is more of a bonus for existing fans or people who haven’t already experienced the game. CD Projekt Red is also preparing some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22567671/the-witcher-3-next-gen-update-netflix-dlc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;free DLCs inspired by the hugely popular Netflix adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; franchise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0Gnt3"&gt;Of course, looming over any next-gen game release or patch is the difficulty of obtaining one of the consoles. Sony has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597784/sony-ps5-playstation-5-sales"&gt;sold over 10 million PlayStation 5s&lt;/a&gt;, but even months after its November launch, it still sells out at lightning speed. Consoles, like seemingly everything else from computers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632330/toyota-production-japan-north-america-chip-shortage-ford-tesla-gm-vw"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;, have been affected by the chip shortage — when that’ll clear is anyone’s guess, though some industry heads have predicted that it could be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578361/tsmc-revenue-surge-chip-shortage-continues"&gt;at least a year or two&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s custom Chromebook CPUs could come as soon as 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Flex 5 seen from the back, open, angled to the left." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5pE4u_mqtOHZ4i0YEatx6GLXmz0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69803529/mchin_210727_4682_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photography by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EFDMRC"&gt;Google’s custom chips could expand past the Pixel 6 to Chromebook laptops and tablets as early as 2023, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Google-developing-own-CPUs-for-Chromebook-laptops"&gt;according to a new report from &lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s expanding emphasis on designing its own processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL0sXk"&gt;The company is already preparing to release its first major custom chip this fall, with the Pixel 6’s upcoming Tensor SoC. The report also lines up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21221062/google-processor-pixels-chromebooks-whitechapel-samsung-qualcomm"&gt;rumors from 2020&lt;/a&gt; that Google was planning in-house Chromebook chips after it debuted the concept on Pixel phones — something we now know is happening in a few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MmII5n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"This is the Pixel 6","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LQpfxg"&gt;But the &lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt; report does note a few additional details, including the aforementioned 2023 timing; a confirmation that, like the Tensor chip, the Chromebook CPUs will be based on Arm; and that Google is looking to develop them for both laptop and tablet-style form factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cz9j2L"&gt;The rumor doesn’t mention what Google’s plans are for its custom Chromebook chips. It’s been nearly two years since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;released the Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt; (the only Google-made Chromebook that the company currently sells) and close to three since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18113447/google-pixel-slate-review-tablet-chrome-os-android-chromebook-slapdash"&gt;its last tablet, the lackluster Pixel Slate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5riUt"&gt;There aren’t a lot of details on what Google hopes to accomplish with its Chromebook chips (for comparison, the company’s Tensor chip for Pixels looks to focus primarily on AI performance), but the &lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt; report does note that the company was particularly inspired by Apple’s success in custom chips for both its iPhone and Mac products. And while it might still be years away from reality, the idea of Google accomplishing a similar feat to Apple’s M1 chips for Chromebooks seems like a very intriguing possibility. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces Surface event for September 22nd</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NtxvH7"&gt;Microsoft is holding a special Surface hardware event on September 22nd. The software maker has started sending media invites for this &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fevent%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fall hardware event&lt;/a&gt;, although it will be online-only and not in person. Microsoft’s invite says “the company will talk about devices and Windows 11,” and we’re expecting to see a successor to the Surface Duo and a new Surface laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTzvUM"&gt;Leaked images of Microsoft’s upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;Surface Duo 2 device appeared online in July&lt;/a&gt;, and we’re expecting to see the official announcement of this Android-powered dual-screen hardware on September 22nd. The leaked images suggest the biggest change will be a triple camera system, complete with telephoto, ultrawide angle, and standard lenses. The Surface Duo 2 is also rumored to include Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor, 5G support, and an NFC chip for contactless payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ka2vlg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You’re invited.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MicrosoftEvent?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MicrosoftEvent&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="https://t.co/tpK3TB8Xxb"&gt;https://t.co/tpK3TB8Xxb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Microsoft (@Microsoft) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/1433082292663209993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cTLNcx"&gt;Alongside the Surface Duo 2, Microsoft is rumored to be launching a successor to the Surface Book 3. &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-book-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft might not name it the Surface Book 4, though. Instead, it’s likely to be a Surface Laptop Pro, or something similar. That’s because Microsoft is reportedly redesigning its high-end laptop to switch to a non-detachable 14-inch display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zw0nss"&gt;A Windows 11 launch on October 5th wouldn’t be complete without an update to the Surface Pro lineup, too. Microsoft launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309005/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus-review"&gt;refreshed Surface Pro 7 Plus&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, but it was only for businesses. We’re hoping to see a more refined Surface Pro design that takes advantage of the latest Windows 11 features. Microsoft’s teaser image even includes a Surface Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjayjy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all of Microsoft’s Surface news live on September 22nd, so stay tuned for the latest.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s Bolt USB dongle bolsters encryption for its new wireless mice and keyboards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/88l-czRbWExFI1u0XuGmLeVmOj4=/0x196:2358x1768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69803267/Screen_Shot_2019_09_03_at_8.52.08_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EAnbNc"&gt;Logitech is known mostly for its consumer-facing products, but it’s making a big play to appeal more broadly to businesses that take privacy seriously. It’s launching a range of mice and keyboards that will include a new Logi Bolt USB-A dongle that aims to reduce latency in crowded workplaces and greatly boost security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OouWs"&gt;These accessories can securely connect to computers and mobile devices via Bluetooth Low Energy — no dongle necessary. Though the Bolt USB dongle is also based on Bluetooth, it will enable a far more secure tether (security mode 1, level 4). Opting for Bluetooth should make the Bolt far less prone to hacking than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/14/20692471/logitech-mousejack-wireless-usb-receiver-vulnerable-hack-hijack"&gt;Logitech’s Unifying 2.4GHz receiver, which was vulnerable to the “MouseJack” hack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAIDfa"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fcontent%2Fdam%2Flogitech%2Fen%2Fbusiness%2Fpdf%2Flogi-bolt-ebook.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22651973%2Flogitech-logi-bolt-usb-dongle-bluetooth-security-le-keyboard-mouse-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s white paper for the Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, it says that security mode 1, level 4 utilizes Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman P-256 (ECDH) and AES-CCM encryption. The company says these measures ensure that “a Logi Bolt wireless product and its Logi Bolt receiver can only communicate with each other.” Logitech is going as far as ensuring that its direct Bolt wireless connections are Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant. These are the standards &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/compliance-faqs-federal-information-processing-standards-fips"&gt;created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology&lt;/a&gt; (NIST) for use within the federal government. If you’re curious about Bluetooth security, &lt;a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-121r2.pdf"&gt;the NIST wrote a guide on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logi Bolt" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wkEAzLNqZATdKqxj7ehvGKs7s1c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819763/logiboltusb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Curiously, Logitech didn’t opt for a USB-C option for the Bolt dongle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mPedAp"&gt;Logitech says its Bolt USB dongle offers a stronger connection, too, at up to 33 feet (10 meters), even if you’re in a congested work environment. One Bolt dongle can connect up to six accessories to your computer. It’s compatible with multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, iOS, iPadOS, Linux, Chrome OS, and Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFRxTR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fmice%2Flogi-bolt-usb-receiver.956-000007.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22651973%2Flogitech-logi-bolt-usb-dongle-bluetooth-security-le-keyboard-mouse-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s listing for the Bolt dongle&lt;/a&gt; says it’s “coming soon” and will cost $14.99. But don’t expect your current Logitech accessories to work with it. Devices that are compatible with Logi Bolt will have a Bolt logo on their underside, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fbusiness%2Fwork-setups%2Flogi-bolt-wireless-technology.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22651973%2Flogitech-logi-bolt-usb-dongle-bluetooth-security-le-keyboard-mouse-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to Logitech’s FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wto51f"&gt;The first accessories that offer enhanced security via Bluetooth LE and include the Bolt USB dongle will launch in September, &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/logitech-bolt-new-wireless-protocol-provides-added-security-for-mice-and-keyboards"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The early lineup includes Logitech’s MX Master Series for Business, comprised of an MX Master 3 and MX Keys. There are also webpages up for business editions of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fkeyboards%2Fergo-k860-for-business.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22651973%2Flogitech-logi-bolt-usb-dongle-bluetooth-security-le-keyboard-mouse-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s Ergo K860 split keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fmice%2Fmx-anywhere-3-for-business.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22651973%2Flogitech-logi-bolt-usb-dongle-bluetooth-security-le-keyboard-mouse-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MX Anywhere 3&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fmice%2Fergo-m575-for-business.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22651973%2Flogitech-logi-bolt-usb-dongle-bluetooth-security-le-keyboard-mouse-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ergo M575 wireless trackball mouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
