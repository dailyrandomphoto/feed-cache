    <title>Dyson’s new V15 Detect vacuum uses lasers to guilt you into doing a better job of cleaning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ykZDY1js0klu5nERhwGkS-l2Y-w=/0x202:1914x1478/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69020705/Screen_Shot_2021_03_24_at_4.34.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6VzVeh"&gt;Dyson has a new flagship vacuum cleaner, the $699 V15 Detect, which adds a laser dust detection system that’s designed to illuminate the dust on your floors so you can better clean it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZAjJz"&gt;Based on Dyson’s images showing how the laser works, though, it looks like the V15 Detect will primarily help you feel a sense of guilt and / or horror at just &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; dusty your kitchen floor is. Unlike most vacuums with lights on the cleaning head — which help you see where you’re vacuuming — the new lasers are designed to help you see &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you’re vacuuming. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WBJjPEVjgucjTbIwAEPgiI4aF0U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395287/Screen_Shot_2021_03_24_at_4.36.14_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1jwGI9"&gt;The new model replaces 2019’s V11 at the top of Dyson’s range. Like that model, this one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516117/dyson-v11-torque-drive-animal-review-cordless-vacuum"&gt;features an LCD display&lt;/a&gt; to convey more information to users, with the ability to display different vacuum modes and how much battery life is left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zwk6pO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dyson’s new $700 vacuum uses a screen to fight range anxiety","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516117/dyson-v11-torque-drive-animal-review-cordless-vacuum"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WuyILi"&gt;The other big addition, aside from the dust-illuminating laser, is a new acoustic piezo sensor, which (combined with a new microprocessor) monitors the air intake of the vacuum to determine both the size and quantity of the dust being vacuumed up. That information gets relayed to the built-in LCD (so you can get an idea of what you’re vacuuming, I guess). More importantly, it also gets relayed to the main motor, which can increase power and suction if the vacuum detects a lot of large dust particles or debris. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9xMB9yCIVkOPiALFmdrIRKv81no=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395289/Screen_Shot_2021_03_24_at_4.37.01_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3deFLp"&gt;The new vacuum is part of a refreshed range of Dyson cleaners that are also set to debut starting today, including a new larger Dyson Outsize model and the Dyson Omni-glide, which offers an almost mop-like cleaning head that can be moved freely in any direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUwLTE"&gt;All three products are available now from Dyson’s website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MrBeast launches $2 million fund to invest in up-and-coming creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of MrBeast." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z1ZDD8zOsJrPZAKr-sL59N6Ouxw=/88x0:1140x701/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69020695/18.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;MrBeast, real name Jimmy Donaldson. | Photo: Night Media&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wow8GJ"&gt;MrBeast said last year that he wanted a way to invest in up-and-coming creators, help them blow up, and get a cut of their business in return — and today, he’s announcing a plan to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeLNV5"&gt;The hit YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is launching a $2 million investment fund that will offer creators up to $250,000 in exchange for a stake in their channels. The fund is part of a new company called &lt;a href="https://getjuice.com/"&gt;Creative Juice&lt;/a&gt;, in which Donaldson is an investor, and which was &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mrbeast-explains-his-plans-to-help-youtube-creators-raise-equity-finance"&gt;announced this afternoon in &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTyauU"&gt;“We’re gonna make sure we find [creators] that actually need a giant cash inflow and aren’t just trying to go buy a Lamborghini,” Donaldson told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XJcttY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Juice is going to change so much you guys don’t even understand. Genuinely excited :)&lt;/p&gt;— MrBeast (@MrBeast) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1374806609604583429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8iRvj4"&gt;Details about the investment fund are limited right now. Creative Juice hasn’t said when it will launch or what type of creators it’s looking to invest in. Donaldson said the idea is to help YouTubers “pour gas on the fire” the way a business might by raising an influx of cash once they’re already growing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBuIcB"&gt;MrBeast is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20924718/mrbeast-youtube-stunts-challenges-money-philanthropy-creators-morgz"&gt;one of the biggest creators on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. He has nearly &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MrBeast6000/videos"&gt;56 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; and gets tens of millions of views per video (his most recent, posted a week ago, already has 35 million views). He’s known for pulling off goofy, supersized stunts — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRwy_rKc7gI"&gt;like making a “2,000 gallon” cereal bowl&lt;/a&gt; — but mainly, he’s known for giving away cars, houses, and cash as part of his videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QENCYp"&gt;The investment fund is just one part of what Creative Juice plans to offer. The company is developing tools to help creators track their performance across platforms. Investors are calling it “Square for creators” and say it plans to launch a suite of products to help creators operate more like small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0eClvs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Like when I see a channel that I think will blow up, I wish I could just like buy shares in it or something lol&lt;/p&gt;— MrBeast (@MrBeast) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1333861470216609794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 1, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Major subreddits are going dark to protest Reddit allegedly hiring a controversial UK politician</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9VmB_dLy6l-sBzJTQ4oJl_O7Fpc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69020639/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O35Lzl"&gt;Hundreds of Reddit communities have locked down to protest Reddit’s handling of a controversy involving former UK politician Aimee Knight. More than 200 subreddits have set their status to private in the past day, including the 27 million-member forum r/Music, as well as large boards dedicated to Apple Mac computers and the games &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EajxTP"&gt;Moderators are demanding a statement about Knight, whom Reddit apparently hired in recent months. Knight was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/12/green-party-failed-to-properly-investigate-child-abuser-report"&gt;previously suspended from the Green Party&lt;/a&gt; after selecting her father — later convicted of violent sexual assault on a child — as her election agent in a 2017 political campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="zHGDCK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reddit says it added filters as a result of harassment and doxxing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy6o4Z"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Blank-Cheque/comments/mbmthf/why_is_this_subreddit_private_see_here_for_answers/"&gt;Reddit moderator Blank-Cheque’s post outlines&lt;/a&gt;, the current controversy exploded yesterday, when Reddit &lt;a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/mbbm2c/welcome_back_subreddit_statement/"&gt;banned a UK politics subreddit moderator&lt;/a&gt; for linking to an article that mentioned Knight. Reddit reversed the ban and posted an explanatory statement, saying it was fighting a harassment campaign against an employee. (The post didn’t mention Knight by name, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/mbqgx2/a_clarification_on_actioning_and_employee_names/gs0bude/"&gt;an administrator wrote&lt;/a&gt; that they were “unable to comment on specific employment details.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRj1Og"&gt;“Earlier this month, a Reddit employee was the target of harassment and doxxing,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/mbqgx2/a_clarification_on_actioning_and_employee_names/"&gt;the post said&lt;/a&gt;. “Reddit activated standard processes to protect the employee from such harassment, including initiating an automated moderation rule to prevent personal information from being shared. The moderation rule was too broad, and this week it incorrectly suspended a moderator who posted content that included personal information.” Reddit didn’t respond to an email requesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qB5VuD"&gt;Reddit said that “our intent was never to remove any and all mentions of this admin’s name.” But Reddit’s statement failed to satisfy several moderators, who noted that Knight had occupied a public political position and the article hadn’t linked her name with her employment at Reddit. “You’ve completely ignored the real issue: the person you have hired is, at best, sympathetic to pedophilia,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/mbqgx2/a_clarification_on_actioning_and_employee_names/grzpzfv/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;one popular comment&lt;/a&gt; reads. “I don’t condone doxxing virtually anyone, but what you’re describing isn’t doxxing. It’s posting the name of a public figure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dWQdtA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’ve completely ignored the real issue”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DwYeyu"&gt;Knight, who is a transgender woman, has previously been targeted for harassment by anti-trans activists. She was a volunteer moderator on subreddits like r/lgbt, and she &lt;a href="https://nowthisnews.com/news/queer-subreddit-attacks-are-forcing-moderators-to-demand-action"&gt;helped write an open letter&lt;/a&gt; to the site’s administrators about anti-LGBT harassment last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZTrDA"&gt;Knight was a Green Party spokesperson and a candidate for deputy leadership. But she was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/31/green-party-launches-inquiry-as-it-suspends-aimee-challenor"&gt;suspended in 2018&lt;/a&gt; amid an inquiry involving her father David Challenor — who was convicted that year of raping and torturing a 10-year-old child. Knight had selected Challenor as her election agent after he had been arrested and charged with the crime in 2016. “On reflection, I can understand that it was unacceptable for me to appoint my dad as my election agent when he had been arrested. I can now understand the potential risks of that decision,” she wrote after the suspension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTKEir"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.greenparty.org.uk/assets/images/national-site/Final%20report%20-%20Executive%20summary-%20cover.pdf"&gt;An independent report concluded&lt;/a&gt; that as a result of Knight and other members’ actions, “someone who had committed serious sexual offenses was given roles of responsibility within the Green Party during a period of almost two years.” Soon after, in 2019, Knight was &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetimes.co.uk%2Farticle%2Flib-dems-suspend-trans-campaigner-over-tweets-jcsg0tdtq&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F24%2F22348255%2Freddit-moderator-blackout-protest-aimee-knight-uk-green-party" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also suspended&lt;/a&gt; by the Liberal Democrats party when her now-husband appeared to post comments about having fantasies involving sex with children on Twitter. &lt;a href="https://coventryobserver.co.uk/news/exclusive-transgender-activist-aimee-challenor-no-longer-in-coventry-lib-dem-post-amid-investigation-into-safeguarding-complaints/"&gt;Knight said&lt;/a&gt; that the account had been hacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="z91eqV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reddit spent years grappling with subreddits that sexualized children&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PmJ66w"&gt;Some of Knight’s loudest critics are anti-transgender writers and activists who have baselessly painted trans women in general as sexual predators. That includes former TV comedian Graham Linehan, who widely publicized Knight’s Reddit employment on his Substack newsletter. Linehan was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/27/twitter-closes-graham-linehan-account-after-trans-comment"&gt;banned from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for posting anti-trans commentary, and his work includes posing as a queer woman on a dating service, then &lt;a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/02/21/graham-linehan-women-her-dating-app-trans-transphobia-backlash/?fbclid=IwAR3sOHeUFNOCN4pdFDvXrQXAQqtnUolo89e2lKQ_P5NTDe9uZyxDu3CXRkU"&gt;publicly posting the profiles&lt;/a&gt; of trans women from the app. Linehan prominently posted Knight’s deadname (or pre-transition name) and referred to her with a hateful term used by anti-trans activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsuEl2"&gt;To some Reddit members, Knight’s alleged hiring echoed a years-long controversy over how Reddit handled child sexualization in the past. Until 2011, the site &lt;a href="https://gawker.com/5842584/americas-most-prestigious-magazine-publisher-returns-to-pedophilia-bait"&gt;hosted a “jailbait” subreddit&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to posting pictures of underage girls, something Reddit’s former general manager defended as “the price of free speech” on the site. The subreddit’s creator, &lt;a href="https://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web"&gt;known as Violentacrez&lt;/a&gt;, allegedly had close relationships with several early Reddit employees. Reddit later banned r/jailbait, and it’s since attempted a major cleanup of the site. Among other things, in 2018, it was one of the first major platforms to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847186/reddit-qanon-milliondollarextreme-ban-sam-hyde"&gt;ban the violent QAnon conspiracy movement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okcjGb"&gt;“This site still has a major pedophilia problem and a person in the role of ‘community management’ has troubling connections to pedophilia,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/mbqgx2/a_clarification_on_actioning_and_employee_names/grzkk64/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;wrote one moderator&lt;/a&gt;. “I don’t think the admin is a pedophile herself, but she has shown in multiple ways that she cannot be trusted to handle the issue properly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R379IB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We as moderators are volunteers, using one of the only tools we have”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0z8DXc"&gt;Reddit moderators are largely volunteers, in contrast with Reddit’s paid administrative staff. And moderators have had a frequently tense relationship with the company — which is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/technology/reddit-chief-financial-officer-ipo.html"&gt;rumored to be considering&lt;/a&gt; an initial public offering. They’ve complained that Reddit offers inadequate tools for keeping subreddits in order and has failed to mitigate harassment from users, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-31-reddit-moderators-speak-out.html"&gt;including sexist abuse and death threats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bs3vyK"&gt;Contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, several moderation teams said they planned to keep their subreddits private until Reddit either responds directly about Knight’s employment or fires her. “What I want is a real response about the process that led them to believe hiring her was a good idea,” wrote Blank-Cheque, one of the blackout’s organizers and a moderator for r/thatHappened, which has 1.3 million members. “My personal aim is to remain locked down until Reddit issues a satisfactory statement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUJnmV"&gt;The moderation team behind r/Music, one of the largest forums on Reddit, said in a statement that they wanted a public promise to sever ties with Knight. They’re also looking for a “considerable contribution” to charities for victims of child abuse. “We as moderators are volunteers, using one of the only tools we have access to invoke change. It’s our responsibility to lead our communities in a way that would elicit meaningful, measurable improvements from the Reddit admins.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus is officially rebooting National Treasure as a streaming TV show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b2dE0oqmoGIw2B5D9LmVH2Hw8Ws=/60x0:708x432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69020607/national_treasure_book_of_secrets_cast_disney.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8stL3D"&gt;Disney is officially bringing back its long-dormant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21251444/national-treasure-disney-plus-series-development-theatrical-movie-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Treasure &lt;/em&gt;franchise&lt;/a&gt; with a new TV series for Disney Plus. &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/national-treasure-tv-series-reimagening-latina-lead-disney-plus-mira-nair-1234720950/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the series has been given a ten-episode greenlight and will reimagine the treasure-hunting franchise with a younger, more diverse cast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AR19rK"&gt;The new series will reportedly feature a new main character, Jess Morales, a twenty-year-old &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAM_Act"&gt;DREAMer&lt;/a&gt; who will (in National Treasure traditional) “uncover her mysterious family history and recover lost treasure.” The show, set to be directed by &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/tag/mira-nair/"&gt;Mira Nair&lt;/a&gt;, is also said to look to examine “issues of identity, community, historical authorship and patriotism.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TqZem"&gt;The original films — which starred Nicolas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates — take a decidedly apolitical stance to American history, using symbols like the Declaration of Independence as Americana-themed clues in the &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt;-esque treasure hunt. A reboot that’s willing to more critically examine America’s place in history could be an interesting new spin on the franchise, depending on how it’s handled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DO6xn3"&gt;Also on board with the project is Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the two original films, and Marianne and Cormac Wibberley, who were part of the writing team on both &lt;em&gt;National Treasure&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bxdwgt"&gt;The new project is also separate from the long-gestating third &lt;em&gt;National Treasure &lt;/em&gt;film, which has been stuck in development hell for over a decade but would — at least in theory — see Cage and the original cast of the first two films return for another adventure. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MyRY1D"&gt;On paper, using a website to schedule your vaccine appointment seems like an easy way to gain access to much needed COVID-19 immunizations. But &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/coronavirus/2021/03/24/we-ran-tests-on-every-states-covid-19-vaccine-website"&gt;a new investigation from &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that state-run vaccine websites are slow to load on mobile devices, compounding what can be an already intimidating sign-up experience for people who are less comfortable online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2nt4r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; conducted its performance tests using &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse"&gt;Google’s open-source Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; tool, in this case relying on the tool’s ability to measure the time it takes for a site to load and be functional. For this test, &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; focused on the performance of the mobile version of sites on the Chrome browser and conducted the tests from three separate locations (New York, Texas, and California). Nevada’s state vaccine site was the slowest to load, taking 15.7 seconds to fully load in comparison to the fastest (Puerto Rico) at 1.4 seconds, and the average (Colorado) at 5.9 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q0GIOLB5iyXEI88RV6iAPWYlpgs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394387/Screen_Shot_2021_03_24_at_9.13.06_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The spread of state vaccine site loading times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T6R0Gr"&gt;The causes for these slowdowns vary, but in the case of the Nevada site, &lt;em&gt;The Markup &lt;/em&gt;suggests that an abundance of interactive, embedded content could be contributing to the slowness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="zskOcg"&gt;Nevada’s vaccination page features several embedded YouTube videos and Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram posts that offer public health information, featuring health professionals answering common questions in both English and Spanish. Our tests show that Nevada’s page has the lowest average performance score of all the sites we examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="q5O8E1"&gt;All of that extra information is great, but I think the confusion also arises for less web-literate people because these sites don’t work like scheduling a traditional doctor’s appointment over the phone. Being presented with a bunch of links from the original site out to other vaccine provider’s websites was intimidating for my grandparents — who often worry about getting “lost” online — and I imagine it would be for many others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAtx1p"&gt;The situation is reminiscent of other times government organizations have been tasked with building out essential online infrastructure, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/8/4814098/why-did-the-tech-savvy-obama-administration-launch-a-busted-healthcare-website"&gt;the rollout of healthcare.gov&lt;/a&gt;. The federal site’s issues have since been resolved, and state health departments are working at a much smaller scale, but some of the problems are similar. It’s not that these departments are incapable of making a website, it’s that time and resources are stretched thin, and many of them have never really been tasked with a project so huge. “They’ve never required the infrastructure that they do now,” Ohio State University health services professor Tory Hogan tells &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMG27e"&gt;Third-party solutions have sprung up in response to these inadequacies, from startups focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320344/dr-b-covid-vaccine-standby-list-coronavirus-immunization-overflow"&gt;connecting people with leftover vaccine doses&lt;/a&gt; like Dr. B, to independent vaccine hunters &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22339959/covid-19-vaccine-appointments-facebook-groups-extra"&gt;booking appointments for strangers&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s no one solution, at least not until President Biden’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22326335/biden-white-house-covid-19-vaccine-federal-website"&gt;promised vaccine finding website&lt;/a&gt; launches on May 1st. Here’s hoping that website works better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The lower-cost OnePlus 9R is official, and it sounds surprisingly strong</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-zItN_GfnjTA-cyQGDGhjtf8Xho=/0x0:1203x802/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69019938/colors_banners_color_1_banner0_pc_ae27cc_crop2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9R will be sold in black or blue color options.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Photo: OnePlus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kw3HcE"&gt;Yesterday’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22340406/oneplus-9-phone-price-release-date-availability"&gt;OnePlus event&lt;/a&gt; covered the high-end 9 and 9 Pro, but outside of that spotlight, the company has quietly revealed a smartly specced, less-expensive model: the OnePlus 9R. CEO Pete Lau &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338504/oneplus-9r-less-expensive-phone-confirmed-india-5g"&gt;confirmed last week&lt;/a&gt; that the 9R was on the way and would launch in India. It’s now &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2F9r&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F24%2F22348430%2Foneplus-9r-specs-price-availability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;listed on the company’s Indian website&lt;/a&gt; starting at ₹39,999, which is about $550. That’s an attractive price indeed, especially considering you’ll get one useful camera feature here that the $729 OnePlus 9 doesn’t have: optical image stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYMf0E"&gt;The 9R doesn’t include the Hasselblad-branded cameras on the 9 and 9 Pro, which isn’t actually a big loss. The 9 and 9 Pro offer newer hardware with features like bigger pixels and a higher-res ultrawide, so you do miss out on some nice upgrades, but the Hasselblad-developed color tuning is nothing special. You do, however, get a stabilized 48-megapixel main camera, which helps reduce blur from camera shake in lower lighting conditions. It’s unfortunately missing from the 9, though it is included on the $969 OnePlus 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r08mIl"&gt;Other cameras on the 9R include a 16-megapixel ultrawide, a 5-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor. This system is borrowed from the OnePlus 8T, which is wholly capable of good image quality, even though its macro and monochrome cameras aren’t very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cPKPAX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uVsRpJ"&gt;There’s a 6.55-inch 1080p OLED with fast 120Hz refresh rate — same as the OnePlus 9 — and a Snapdragon 870 processor with either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. It’s not quite as powerful as the top-notch 888 processor on the 9 and 9 Pro, but it should be more than adequate to keep day-to-day tasks running quickly and smoothly. The 9R is equipped with a 4,500mAh battery with 65W fast wired charging, a handy OnePlus signature feature that delivers a full charge in just under 40 minutes. Wireless charging, however, isn’t offered. Oh, and there’s 5G support, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhBHSr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10410330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4H9RQj"&gt;All told, it looks like a series of smart trade-offs for almost $200 less than the flagship model. Right now, the phone is only confirmed to launch in India, but we’re hopeful that it will make its way to European and North American markets. While OnePlus brought its good &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; to the US earlier this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;midrange Nord&lt;/a&gt; never made it stateside. The 9R looks like an excellent candidate to fill in a wide gap between the budget N10 and the basic flagship model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VL2w2Z"&gt;In the meantime, customers in India can preorder the 8GB RAM / 128GB version for ₹39,999 (~$550) or the 12GB RAM / 256GB model for ₹43,999 (~$600).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon adds annoying streaming service buttons to its Fire TV remote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cu0hMDawE91quN2kOG1psC7fmeA=/0x0:827x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69019922/61_qUrdzXlL._AC_SL1000_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Agpx3p"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08D6WJYD9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is coming out with a third generation of its Alexa Voice Remote&lt;/a&gt;, and it includes some unwelcome new buttons that will take you to the Amazon Prime, Netflix, Disney Plus, and Hulu apps. If you’re one of the people who subscribes to and regularly uses all of those exact streaming services, this remote could be a nice upgrade. But for everyone else, the buttons will only add friction and annoyance to the Fire TV control experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuonV0"&gt;We here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have talked about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/4/24/21232655/netflix-button-tv-remotes-advertisement-marketing-streaming"&gt;why we don’t like these buttons before&lt;/a&gt;. They turn your remote into a canvas for permanent advertising for services you may not even use, and they take up space that could be used for buttons that take you to services you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use. If you, say, don’t subscribe to Disney Plus or Hulu, then the buttons are, at best, useless to you and, at worst, waiting to be accidentally pressed, leaving you to back out of an app that’s begging you to subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFFYbp"&gt;The obvious alternative is to make the buttons mappable to the services you use and not put permanent branding on them. If the remote instead came with four buttons you could use to open your preferred streaming services, this would be a very different story. Alas, it is not. But hey, now the voice control button is an Alexa button for even more branding! (I will concede that this isn’t that bad, given that it was already called the &lt;em&gt;Alexa&lt;/em&gt; Voice remote.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emuyHTwpxWSxzu7vUnxsTE1K5CY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394536/51SgcH5ly_L._AC_SL1000_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The previous generation of the remote (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Alexa-Voice-Remote-with-power-and-volume-controls/dp/B07B6L2QCF/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=alexa+voice+remote&amp;amp;qid=1616603882&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;which is still for sale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;), minus the branded buttons.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E4pUm8"&gt;I don’t want to make it sound like a few annoying buttons (that could actually be useful to some people) are the end of the world or that this new remote has no redeeming qualities. There’s actually one more new button that takes you to a “guide” showing you a cable-esque timeline of all the content available from the live providers you have, such as Sling, Hulu, or YouTube TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohaKGc"&gt;Unlike the branded ones, it’s small and not brightly colored, so it’s easy to ignore if you don’t need it (and it won’t be as prone to accidental presses). I just wish remote manufacturers would let us choose the functions we want on our remotes, especially since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming-wars"&gt;the streaming service landscape is ever-changing&lt;/a&gt;, and people have taken to subscribing to one service for a few months then switching to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7ajfs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how Tesla’s new touchscreen drive selector works</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dtbs-OCvl1zTjJLze44amyn_c6g=/0x0:1686x1124/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69019629/MS_Interior_Carousel_C_Desktop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TLcXUP"&gt;When Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh"&gt;announced a redesigned&lt;/a&gt; Model S sedan and Model X SUV earlier this year, one of the biggest changes to how those cars work was quite literally hard to see: Tesla decided to remove the gear-selector stalk from the steering wheel and is going to try to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256504/teslas-model-s-x-redesign-automatic-shifting-prnd-gears"&gt;automate shifting between park, reverse, neutral, and drive (PRND)&lt;/a&gt;. The company said there would be an option on the touchscreen as a backup, but it wasn’t until today that we had a sense of exactly what that looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRFOMy"&gt;Instead of touchscreen “buttons” for each drive mode, drivers will have to tap-and-drag on a small car icon on the top-left corner of the new horizontal touchscreen. (In fact, that car icon was visible in the photos Tesla released for the refreshed Model S and Model X, though it wasn’t clear what it was for.) Drag up to put the car into drive, drag down to put the car in reverse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Sc1Uvb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ok, so this is how u change gears on the new S/X   &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@elonmusk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@tesla&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/dXtsSzQBAS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dXtsSzQBAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Michael Hsu (@hsumacher) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hsumacher/status/1374585378988953601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SN8l6l"&gt;Neutral is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nickwhoward/status/1374711863842377728"&gt;buried in a deeper menu&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s still unclear how you put the car into park. Perhaps since Teslas can operate without the slow “creep” of internal combustion cars (though there is an option to turn that on), you will be able to just stop the car with your brake pedal and it will stand still, maybe even switch into park when you get out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F4Aymg"&gt;Now, according to Elon Musk, this is all just a backup to the car automatically switching gears for you. “Car guesses drive direction based on what obstacles it sees, context &amp;amp; nav map,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354680585139187713"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; back in January. “After you drive without using a PRND stalk/stick for a few days, it gets very annoying to go back &amp;amp; use a shifter! You can override on touchscreen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCYNLm"&gt;In an internal document obtained by &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/01/27/tesla-new-steering-wheel-force-touch-buttons-autopilot-sensors/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after the announcement, Tesla said a vehicle would “automatically shift to Reverse once the driver presses the brake pedal” if the car noticed it was facing a garage wall, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98TGYs"&gt;Musk was asked about this change when he was on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278792/elon-musk-joe-rogan-tesla-roadster-spacex-hover-thrusters"&gt;Joe Rogan’s podcast in February&lt;/a&gt;, and he said he’d been testing the feature and really enjoyed it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFdC1W"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musk:&lt;/strong&gt; If you just get in, when you press the brake pedal and then press the accelerator, it will figure whether you want to go backwards or forwards based on...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ucQzda"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogan: &lt;/strong&gt;That’s crazy. How’s that possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1O8D1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musk: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, it just looks and sees: is there an obstacle in front? Okay, you probably don’t want to whack it, so you probably want to go backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dntlIm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogan: &lt;/strong&gt;Right, but what if you want to go backwards and there’s nothing in front of you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBkkj2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musk: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, what if it’s ambiguous? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6H7EP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogan: &lt;/strong&gt;Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="su4TkI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musk: &lt;/strong&gt;So it would default to the inverse of whatever you started, and then you can just swipe on the screen and change direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKwIp5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogan: &lt;/strong&gt;But isn’t it easier to just hit like that way to go to reverse, lift up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9tO1a"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musk: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, you’ll see, you almost never...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPuG3c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogan: &lt;/strong&gt;You do it? So this is something you’ve driven and it’s intuitive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQ0Afc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musk: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, once you get rid of the stalk and have the car figure it out, it’s annoying to have a stalk after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keTqdW"&gt;Musk loves to push boundaries with his companies, and this decision definitely represents a big change in what is a basic function for a car. But Tesla is far from the first automaker to tinker with gear selectors. The Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards are more explicit about the order in which PRND are displayed than how a driver selects them, so car companies have tried everything from gear selector buttons to knobs to weird levers that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256504/teslas-model-s-x-redesign-automatic-shifting-prnd-gears"&gt;wind up causing dangerous mode confusion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSI’s GS66 Stealth review: powerful but pricey</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Other laptops with the RTX 3070 perform nearly as well&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6qYdie"&gt;I had hoped that MSI’s GS66 Stealth for 2021 would look and feel a &lt;em&gt;little &lt;/em&gt;different than last year’s model — not that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21348101/msi-gs66-stealth-gaming-laptop-review-rtx-2070-super-300hz"&gt;the 2020 version&lt;/a&gt; was particularly busted in any major way. In fact, the previous model was a few nips and tucks shy of reaching Razer’s high bar for gaming laptop design. But while the outside shell of this year’s model is exactly the same as last year’s, I can live with that because what’s inside is mostly all-new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7c2Bh"&gt;The review unit we tested is the current pinnacle of mobile graphics tech: Nvidia’s new RTX 3080 Max-Q graphics chip, with 16GB of video memory (Nvidia also makes an 8GB variant). MSI also added a gorgeous canvas of a display: a 15.6-inch 1440p (QHD) IPS G-Sync screen with a fast 240Hz refresh rate. The price for this configuration will be $2,599 when it releases in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dVG2z"&gt;The other specs are good, too, but not necessarily cutting-edge. It has 16GB of RAM, a 1TB NVMe SSD, and the same big, four-cell 99.99Wh battery that was in the previous iteration. It is equipped with an &lt;a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/208018/intel-core-i7-10870h-processor-16m-cache-up-to-5-00-ghz.html"&gt;Intel Core i7-10870H&lt;/a&gt; processor, which on paper is a slight step down compared to the &lt;a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/202329/intel-core-i7-10875h-processor-16m-cache-up-to-5-10-ghz.html"&gt;Core i7-10875H&lt;/a&gt; in the previous model I tested, but I didn’t notice a difference in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9QsNMx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10410056"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JW6jh3"&gt;The original first-look at this laptop focused on how good it was at playing games at QHD resolution. Since then, our team has reviewed several other laptops that feature Nvidia’s latest generation of RTX 30-series graphics cards, as well as a few that have QHD screens, too. In that time, we’ve agreed that the RTX 3070, the next notch down on the totem pole of Nvidia’s latest graphics card lineup, is better at QHD gaming than we expected. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315386/razer-blade-15-base-2021-review-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3070-qhd-screen-performance"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Base&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt; are two key examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kywT56"&gt;If it’s confusing to fathom how a lesser GPU could come close to outpacing what’s supposed to be a much better performer, it’s mostly about the thickness of a laptop. Those two examples are a little thicker than the GS66 Stealth and have a similar or higher amount of power level allotted to their GPUs set to a similar or higher boost clock speed. As we saw, that can result in comparable performance, despite costing hundreds of dollars less than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="z5vDb7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nvidia is requiring laptop makers to be more transparent about RTX 30-series specs ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QoqhZj"&gt;On the other side of that coin, the RTX 3080, like the one you’ll find in this laptop, is good at getting you a few extra frames per second over that. But most gamers, especially ones who are trying to save money when possible, will likely still be happy with the performance of a more affordable laptop. MSI makes cheaper variants of the GS66 Stealth that I’ve listed below, but for now, it’s limiting its use of a gorgeous QHD screen for just this high-end model. That’s a disappointment, since other companies like Razer and Asus are including them in more budget-conscious gaming laptops with performance that isn’t too far off from this model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n6tNQ6K8haUWY4MrISWUCGXlQl8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251172/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This year’s GS66 Stealth looks and feels exactly the same as 2020’s, which is both good and bad in some ways.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ0MB9"&gt;Back to the specs, this year’s GS66 Stealth makes the jump up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22212938/wifi-6e-rollout-starting-2021-smartphones-tvs-laptops-vr-routers"&gt;Wi-Fi 6E&lt;/a&gt; compatibility and Bluetooth 5.2. This laptop has an HDMI 2.0 port, so it’s limited to outputting 4K resolution at up to 60 frames per second. Of the things MSI updated in this year’s GS66, the HDMI port should have been a little higher on the list than Wi-Fi 6E. Several other models we’ve reviewed feature HDMI 2.1, allowing 4K output with up to 120 frames per second to really take advantage of the hardware while connected to an external high refresh rate monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlYies"&gt;General performance outside of gaming felt similarly snappy to last year’s model. A big stack of tabs in Microsoft Edge, alongside Slack and Spotify, didn’t slow this machine down. It didn’t perform nearly as well in our Adobe Premiere Pro export test, though. Tasked with exporting a five-minute, 33-second 4K video, the laptop took six minutes, 30 seconds, compared to the three-minute, 14-second export time that we got with last year’s model. The battery life can last for around three hours and change under a light load of applications. That’s less than the roughly five hours of screentime I was getting with last year’s model, but then again, this one has a QHD screen compared to FHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JR0pBRhK98VTDTDYON4JvZlHA6o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251176/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;em&gt; performed the worst of any recent AAA title I tested, but the numbers are still impressive.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="M40Vyy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10301829"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lrHyue"&gt;But the real question is: was Nvidia’s latest high-end graphics chip worth the wait — and can it keep up with a QHD display? The short answer is that, like my colleague Tom Warren saw on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;the desktop version of the RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt;, this mobile variant is a leap over what the last-gen RTX 2080 could provide. Since this is also the first generation of gaming laptops that offer QHD screens, it’s a little hard to compare the two, but there’s no question that games look better than before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNNE23"&gt;The RTX 3080 with 16GB of video memory is capable of running some of the most demanding games in QHD well beyond 60 frames per second — with all graphical settings adjusted to max and with ray tracing and other RTX settings activated, when applicable. That’s an incredible achievement. And if you’re someone who doesn’t always play the latest games as they are released, these specs will afford you even more headroom to power through your backlog, with a fantastic display to enjoy them on to boot. The IPS screen that MSI opted to use is rich with contrast and better viewing angles than I expected, and its G-Sync adaptive sync does a great job of keeping visuals free of artifacts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbjYdT"&gt;I was able to spend time playing &lt;em&gt;Horizon: Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, most of which have ray tracing and / or DLSS (deep-learning super sampling) graphical options to take further advantage of this powerful graphics chip. Since &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;don’t ship with built-in benchmarking tests, I simply ran around a variety of locales to stress-test the hardware (the other games have scripted methods for gathering performance metrics). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kT2h56Oz1XhD3XObu8TXkymHGWA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251173/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I couldn’t stop holding my eyeballs this close to the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o1pUO9"&gt;As someone who’s used to playing games on a 1080p display, I was impressed to see such graphically intensive games run this fluidly, especially at a higher native resolution. However, we know now that this laptop isn’t the only machine on the market that can achieve beyond 60 frames per second in-game performance, and in most cases, you don’t even need an RTX 3080 to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1jfAgm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10301825"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Var6nM"&gt;As I mentioned up top, the design of the 2021 GS66 Stealth is note-for-note the same as last year’s model. The overall look is stellar, though, and I wish every gaming laptop had a trackpad this generously large. It has backlit keys that can be programmed to dazzle with RGB splendor through SteelSeries software, but that’s really the only element that reveals this is a gaming laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFSUis"&gt;Well, aside from the very loud fans. I noted that last year’s model was relatively quiet, even under pressure. I’ve heard laptops louder than this new RTX 3080 version, but the decibel level went high enough so that at times I felt I needed headphones to hear all of the in-game details. Of course, that differed depending on the game. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; made this laptop whir the loudest of the games I tested, while &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;actually ran fairly quietly by comparison. But even when the GS66 Stealth is just idling during a browser, it’s audible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eT4fmVn7Ip2xLZdyMjPb-8cHsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251177/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This QHD screen is pin-sharp, but importantly, it’s really vibrant, and the viewing angles are generous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O3XMlL"&gt;I found other flaws with the design. The keyboard layout is still crowded, with the important function key placed awkwardly next to the control key, making it cumbersome to do simple tasks like adjust the volume and brightness. Also, the bottom of the laptop chassis still flexes in a slightly worrying way. I don’t think it’s liable to break under normal use, but for a pricey machine like this, the design doesn’t inspire confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="GVRJAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10410113"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2Ije5"&gt;If you’re looking to buy one of MSI’s non-QHD models today, there are a number of options. You can get a system equipped with a less powerful RTX 3060 chip starting at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730437098990828811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,799.99&lt;/a&gt;, one with the RTX 3070 for &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1611894-REG%2Fmsi_gs66_stealth_10ug_075_15_6_gs66_stealth_gaming.html%3FSID%3Ds1610634215938lifha52581&amp;amp;xcust=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,399.99&lt;/a&gt;, or with the new RTX 3080 chip starting at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730437267445605394" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,699.99&lt;/a&gt; (that model has a lesser CPU, an FHD 300Hz display, but more RAM than this one). The specs start with a 1080p IPS display with a 240Hz or 300Hz refresh rate. &lt;a href="https://www.msi.com/Laptop/GS66-Stealth-10UX/Specification"&gt;MSI’s product landing page&lt;/a&gt; indicates that it will be possible to upgrade to a 4K 60Hz IPS display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92IlMH"&gt;Just like last year’s GS66 Stealth, this is an alluring package that delivers just about everything that I want in a gaming laptop. Its design is mature, and it has a generous amount of ports. Though, also like last year’s model, it has some flaws, like the over-crowded keyboard and some problem areas on the chassis that flex more than they should. The inclusion of a QHD screen with a capable GPU overshadows most of the issues, making this a stellar machine for gaming and watching movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="MrDxB6"&gt;This is one of the slimmest, yet most powerful laptops available, but it’s tough to recommend outright to most people when some less expensive models, like the Zephyrus G15 or the Razer Blade 15 Base can get you most of the way there in terms of gaming performance, at QHD resolution no less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UeBx6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTEuH3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2:09PM ET, March 24th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSI has released the price for this laptop, so we’ve now added a score, as well as more context surrounding its performance and value compared to other gaming laptops that we’ve recently reviewed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack quickly removes message invites in its new DM feature over harassment concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zeg1Ys5n0Mwhu89m-bhJ-uZBMts=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69019365/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KM5YVb"&gt;Slack became a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348126/slack-connect-direct-messaging-dm-company-feature"&gt;public messaging platform this morning&lt;/a&gt; with the wider rollout of a new cross-organizational direct messaging feature, and now it’s already taking steps to mitigate the dangers of operating such a platform without well-thought-out moderation protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vExEfT"&gt;The company says in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348422/slack-connect-direct-message-abuse-harassment"&gt;concerns the feature could be used to send abusive messages or harassment with relative ease&lt;/a&gt;, it’s now disabling the option to send a message alongside an invite. That way, if someone knows your email address, they can’t spam your inbox with potentially abusive messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUEZct"&gt;“After rolling out Slack Connect DMs this morning, we received valuable feedback from our users about how email invitations to use the feature could potentially be used to send abusive or harassing messages. We are taking immediate steps to prevent this kind of abuse, beginning today with the removal of the ability to customize a message when a user invites someone to Slack Connect DMs,” Jonathan Prince, the company’s vice president of communications and policy, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hu7pTT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We made a mistake in this initial roll-out that is inconsistent with our goals for the product and the typical experience of Slack Connect usage.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="drBGDz"&gt;“Slack Connect’s security features and robust administrative controls are a core part of its value both for individual users and their organizations. We made a mistake in this initial roll-out that is inconsistent with our goals for the product and the typical experience of Slack Connect usage. As always, we are grateful to everyone who spoke up, and we are committed to fixing this issue.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Om0TA"&gt;The overall concern, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/44/status/1374737695444901891"&gt;first raised by Twitter employee Menotti Minutillo&lt;/a&gt;, was that the feature did not have robust opt-out protections for individual users and no way to easily prevent people from spamming you with email invites. That seems benign on the surface; if someone wants to harass you and they have your email address, surely they can just send you a harassing email. But Slack Connect bypasses any filters or inbox protections you may use by sending you an email from its feedback@slack.com address with the DM invite, with the email containing whatever message the sender decided to attach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8Gtbmd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;well that was easy as shit to abuse&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- send invite with nasty language&lt;br&gt;- slack emails you w/ the full content of the invite&lt;br&gt;- can't block the emails because they come from a generic slack address that informs you of invites&lt;br&gt;- abuser can keep inviting w/ abusive language &lt;a href="https://t.co/Mw9W5L251a"&gt;https://t.co/Mw9W5L251a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/dWEAD7ccRO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dWEAD7ccRO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Menotti Minutillo (@44) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/44/status/1374737695444901891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOfNXU"&gt;That means if your organization uses this feature, you can’t filter it out without fear of missing important Slack emails and you also have no easy way to opt out. (It’s not even clear right now whether the feature can be turned off for individual accounts.) &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/slacks-new-dm-feature-connect-is-thankfully-opt-in/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reported this morning&lt;/a&gt; that the DM feature would be opt-in for a company’s or organization’s IT department to enable at its discretion, but that doesn’t mean it would give individual employee’s active control over who could DM them. And there was also no filtering or monitoring in place that would detect whether someone was sending a hateful message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KVnXV"&gt;While Slack Connect is generally designed for enterprise users whose companies pay for premium features, a Slack Standard plan with Connect enabled costs as little as $8 per month per user (or $6.67 per month per user when billed annually). That suggests someone could exploit these issues rather easily and on the cheap if they choose to, even in the absence of the invite message feature Slack just disabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oU5hVm"&gt;There have been new concerns popping up, too, such as being able to view whatever Slack groups individuals are a part of — either paid or free ones — if that person happens to accept an invite from someone using Slack Connect. A Slack spokesperson has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; these fears are unfounded, as that information is only displayed to the person accepting the invite as a method of determining what Slack workspace they’d like to accept the invitation from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RFLtRD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This has been retracted — turns out it was a mistake by the original tweeter.  However, the information leak around profile listings has been confirmed: &lt;a href="https://t.co/ky3qJYCcv8"&gt;https://t.co/ky3qJYCcv8&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ePoDQuU4En"&gt;https://t.co/ePoDQuU4En&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eleanor Saitta (@Dymaxion) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Dymaxion/status/1374786160048898053?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B7FDY2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 24th, 4:12PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added clarification from Slack specifying that the profile information leak concerns regarding DM invites are unfounded, as the information is not made publicly available to the sender. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
