    <title>Microsoft’s feud with Apple over xCloud on iOS got a rival kicked from the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fpd1t7o7MzXlDkz8zfhVU81tQI0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241844/acastro_210429_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="59ak2k"&gt;In 2020, Microsoft was battling to bring xCloud or Xbox Game Streaming to the iPhone and iPad, and the conversations had an unlikely victim: Shadow — a third-party cloud gaming app that lets you stream PC games to an iPhone or iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cZfC5"&gt;Emails between Microsoft and Apple, revealed in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial today, show how the Xbox maker was trying to get xCloud on iOS. Microsoft was trying to figure out how Shadow, Netflix, and other similar “interactive” apps were able to exist in the App Store while Apple was refusing to approve xCloud. Microsoft put forward Shadow as an example of such a service, only to see it suddenly removed from the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSJBCU"&gt;“We were showing two examples where a game or an application was able to exist, and we didn’t understand why we couldn’t,” explained Lori Wright, Microsoft’s head of business development for Xbox, during the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial today. “I believe they [Apple] ended up pulling Shadow out of the App Store based off this email we sent until they submitted changes. That was not our intention of course, it was a byproduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwP09JyRmiWPgyGUd-04tZfidVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22493777/0_yXBrpxirKTDnT7a8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Shadow&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow on iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="REs2dG"&gt;While Shadow’s removal wasn’t permanent, Apple has temporarily removed the app from the App Store twice in the past year. Shadow was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowPC/comments/f9wtjl/shadow_ios_app_removed_from_the_app_store/"&gt;first removed in February&lt;/a&gt; last year, with Apple reportedly citing a “failure to act in accordance with a specific part of the Apple App Store Guidelines.” Apple once again &lt;a href="https://forum.shadow.tech/news-announcements-42/shadow-removed-from-apple-app-store-what-you-should-know-2314"&gt;removed Shadow from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; in February, and the app returned a week later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDi8OE"&gt;Shadow revealed that the app was removed the second time “due to a misunderstanding” around the nature of the app. “Unlike game streaming services, Shadow provides a full Windows 10 PC, rather than a library of games,” explained Luc Hancock, a community manager for Shadow. “This unique approach allows Shadow to comply with the App Store guidelines, so that you can access your Shadow PC on any iOS device to run your favorite games and software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vb5FdM"&gt;Valve struggled for more than a year to launch its Steam Link game streaming service on iOS. Apple rejected the app, likely because it allowed an iOS user to access another app store, Steam, within Apple’s tightly controlled ecosystem. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17430532/apple-app-store-rules-valve-steam-link-game-streaming"&gt;Apple revised its rules&lt;/a&gt; after rejecting Steam Link, and the app was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18627110/steam-link-app-ios-apple-tv-released"&gt;finally approved two years ago in May 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;xCloud on iOS via the web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HOUoIU"&gt;Apple continued to make it difficult for services like xCloud and Stadia to run the way Microsoft and Google wanted to on iOS devices after those conversations, only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;slowly making App Store policy carve-outs&lt;/a&gt; that would let the services operate under severe restrictions. Apple now insists that developers individually submit games as separate apps using their streaming tech, only then bundling them together as a “catalog”-style app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoZYSl"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433071/microsoft-apple-app-store-rules-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-game-pass"&gt;wasn’t impressed with Apple’s approach&lt;/a&gt;, calling it a “bad experience for customers.” This public spat has now boiled over into the courtroom battle between Epic Games and Apple, with lawyers on Epic’s side questioning Microsoft and Nvidia representatives about their struggles to bring cloud gaming apps to iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRnKrD"&gt;Both Microsoft and Nvidia have had to give in to Apple’s restrictions and launch their cloud gaming services &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391561/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-xbox-game-streaming-beta-features"&gt;through the Safari web browser&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook has no reason to ever resolve the Trump ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AgW1WrELnnFDGsPn02JIhq9NZj8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241739/acastro_180501_1777_facebook_dating_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WIpHQY"&gt;After months of waiting, today Facebook’s Oversight Board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"&gt;finally handed down&lt;/a&gt; the biggest ruling of its short existence — the question of whether to uphold the ban on Donald Trump. The verdict? Send the question back to Facebook, and give them six more months to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zak47n"&gt;In fairness, it wasn’t quite that bad. The initial ban was upheld, and the board &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/decision/FB-691QAMHJ/"&gt;made specific rulings&lt;/a&gt; on the questions of whether Trump’s posts were inciting violence, and whether world leaders should get special treatment. For now, Facebook can continue to block Trump, which means that on the face of it, this is a win for anti-Trumpers. Unless you’re visiting his self-hosted website, you’ll remain blessedly safe from Trump posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QiG0V5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“an endless cycle of uncertainty”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UJuF0J"&gt;But the ruling also went out of its way to avoid settling the long-term question of whether Facebook is allowed to permanently ban leaders like Trump. The board found the initial ban was justified since Trump’s January 6th posts really did incite violence — but it wasn’t enough to justify a permanent ban. So even as the board affirmed the initial ban, it called on Facebook to set a new policy for how and when Trump could regain Facebook access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZjw9c"&gt;“It is not permissible for Facebook to keep a user off the platform for an undefined period, with no criteria for when or whether the account will be restored,” the ruling reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCm3aZ"&gt;In practical terms, that means Facebook is going to keep litigating the specifics of the Trump ban for at least the next six months, and probably a whole lot longer. Facebook has until October to come up with a specific policy to justify the ban, to be put in place across the platform. But that policy will likely need more review from inside Facebook once it’s developed, and then another round of appeal to the Oversight Board. Then Trump can try to get back on Facebook (or make just enough effort to justify restarting his feud with the platform), and there will need to be another round of reviews on that, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="yum3oR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Republicans who are mad can make their case to the board and have their opinions heard — whether it does them any good or not&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NZ0o1c"&gt;And of course, because none of the Oversight decisions are binding on Facebook, the company is free to delay past any of those deadlines if it wants more time. In a statement after the decision, the progressive group Common Cause described it as “an endless cycle of uncertainty,” and it’s hard to disagree. The process could easily stretch through the 2024 election, and given the political interests involved, it’s not clear how it could ever fully resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCZBcV"&gt;If you were hoping to stop talking about Donald Trump online, this is close to a worst-case scenario. The moderation merry-go-round is a political liability for Facebook, and the longer it goes unresolved, the more anger will be stirred up against the platform. The point of founding the Oversight Board was to shovel some of that responsibility onto another group, but this decision puts the ball right back in Facebook’s court. You can already see conservative media figures using the ruling to take shots at the company — and I’m sure lots of Facebook employees are shuddering at the prospect of doing it all again in six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phsC3k"&gt;But there’s a deeper logic to the ruling, one that benefits both the Oversight Board and Facebook itself. As &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/05/americans-divided-on-whether-trump-should-be-permanently-banned-from-social-media/"&gt;a Pew Research poll&lt;/a&gt; showed this morning, America is split over the question of whether Trump should be on Facebook, and a final ruling is sure to alienate one side or another. So from Facebook’s perspective, the less final this ruling is, the better. What looks like kicking the can down the road is really just leaving the door open for the losing side. Republicans who are mad can make their case to the board and have their opinions heard — whether it does them any good or not. And the next time Mark Zuckerberg is called before Congress, he can tell Republicans he’s working on a final policy that will get Trump back online. When he’s called a year later (or two years, or five years), he can say the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="UEewBd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Making a decision means taking sides&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SzDkZV"&gt;Platforms love keeping policy questions in limbo this way, in part because making a firm decision is so likely to cause trouble. Look at Twitter, which is always “thinking about” new features like &lt;a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/is-tweet-editing-coming-does-it-really-matter/547614/"&gt;editable tweets&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/twitter-considers-subscription-fee-for-tweetdeck-unique-content"&gt;paid subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;, but never seems to launch them. Or look at Facebook’s own behavior in politically unstable countries like Sri Lanka and Myanmar, where civil society groups said they worked with the platform for years &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/18/17369570/facebook-coalition-myanmar-syria-sri-lanka-moderation-transparency-audit"&gt;without ever getting a real response to their demands&lt;/a&gt;. Making a decision means taking sides — and for a platform built on scale, that gambit rarely pays off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gY5QCd"&gt;You can see the same logic working in the Oversight Board itself. The board is slightly better positioned than Facebook to make unpopular decisions, but it’s still been careful to guard its credibility. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254155/facebook-oversight-board-first-rulings-coronavirus-misinformation-hate-speech"&gt;The rulings so far&lt;/a&gt; have mostly made fine distinctions on existing policies, whether it’s ethnic slurs in Russia or not-quite hate speech in Burma. If the board makes an unpalatable decision — either kicking Trump off the platform permanently or, worse, letting him back on — it would face the same problem as Facebook: potentially losing credibility with an entire portion of Facebook’s user base. Better to kick the can down the road, “keep thinking,” and never land too hard on any one ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DaMBt"&gt;That’s not to say the Oversight Board won’t do anything unpopular. Today’s ruling has already made a lot of conservatives angry, just as the initial ban did. Plotting a middle course doesn’t mean no one will be angry, and there will surely be more moments in the future when Facebook’s refusal to take sides makes one side particularly angry. But if you’re looking for certainty or finality from the Oversight Board’s appeal system, you’re looking in the wrong place. For now, the performative pondering of hard questions is just too convenient to give up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter updates offensive tweet warnings, accepts that you like to swear at your friends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UDYOT-6zV8Y_ZdFhKyxTqO3asaA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241394/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Riigw1"&gt;Twitter is updating its “be nice, think twice” system that prompts users to reconsider when they’re about to tweet a “potentially harmful or offensive” reply. The upgraded feature is now better at spotting “strong language,” claims Twitter; is more aware of vocabulary that has been “reclaimed by underrepresented communities” and is used in non-harmful ways; and also now takes into account your relationship with the person you’re messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOFaLj"&gt;In other words, if you’re tweeting at a mutual who you interact with regularly, Twitter will assume “there’s a higher likelihood [you] have a better understanding of preferred tone of communication” and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; show you a prompt. So, you can call your friend a **** or a ****-**** or even a ****-******* son of a ****-less ***** and Twitter won’t care. That’s freedom, folks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JudW4"&gt;Twitter first started testing this system in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248201/twitter-reply-warning-harmful-language-revise-tweet-moderation"&gt;May 2020&lt;/a&gt;, paused it a little later, then brought it back to life in &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/22/twitter-relaunches-review-before-you-tweet-offensive-language/"&gt;February this year&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one of a number of prompts the company has been testing to try and shape user behavior, including its “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455635/twitter-read-before-you-tweet-article-prompt-rolling-out-globally-soon"&gt;read before you retweet&lt;/a&gt;” message.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X6j91hL3Q9k25ZzPdylAwu74Xns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22493024/pasted_image_0.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sample prompt shown to a user before sending an offensive reply. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XXvRLu"&gt;Improvements to the offensive-tweets prompt will roll out to English users of the Twitter iOS app today and to Android users “in the next few days.” The company says it’s already making a difference to how people interact on the platform, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="itdoQE"&gt;Twitter claims internal tests show 34 percent of people who were served such a prompt “revised their initial reply or decided to not send their reply at all.” After receiving such a prompt once, people composed, on average, 11 percent “fewer offensive replies.” And people who were prompted about a reply (and therefore may have toned down their language) were themselves “less likely to receive offensive and harmful replies back.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gX0O3k"&gt;These “statistics” are as opaque as you would expect from any major internet platform (how exactly has the company quantified “less likely” in that last example? How many people are included in any of these tests? How do we know that people who revised their reply made it less offensive, or did they just use offensive language the system didn’t recognize?). But the ongoing roll-out does suggest that the feature is, at least, not making things &lt;em&gt;actively&lt;/em&gt; worse on Twitter. That’s probably the best we can hope for. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix switches from prestige pics to shredded zombies for its widest theatrical release yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rb6xTYn9GSxdIS6hcPMjG71lMro=/708x0:4188x2320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241389/Screen_Shot_2021_05_05_at_9.42.44_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQMh8K"&gt;Netflix is taking a different route for its new Zack Snyder-directed zombie heist movie, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300924/army-of-the-dead-trailer-zack-snyder-netflix-vegas-heist-movie"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than skip theaters and drop the new thriller directly in subscribers’ laps and homes, the company has reached an agreement with theater chains to screen the movie a week early starting May 14th in around 600 theaters, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/zack-snyder-army-of-the-dead-netflix-theaters-1234966466/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgCMet"&gt;That’s Netflix’s widest US release yet for one of its feature projects, and it positions the film and the company to capture summer theatergoers’ attention and dollars right as screens are beginning to reopen across the country, and newly vaccinated film fans feel comfortable enough to watch how they used to. &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;says Netflix has partnered with Cinemark, Alamo Drafthouse, iPic, Landmark, Harkins, and Cinépolis theaters to make the release happen. Cinemark will reportedly screen &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead &lt;/em&gt;in 200 of its theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89SlsZ"&gt;In comparison to a traditional blockbuster release that can reach thousands of theaters, 600 might seem minor, but this is Netflix, a company that’s usually scorned the traditional theatrical release model. Theaters typically want a 90-day window for theatrical releases so that people have a reason to go see a movie in person. This is why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;Warner Bros.’ same-day streaming and theater release strategy&lt;/a&gt; on HBO Max films stirred up so much controversy. Theaters need a reason for people to show up, especially during the pandemic when they’re at their most vulnerable. Streaming services might not feel so generous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XT4ll"&gt;Past major Netflix releases have only chosen to screen in theaters to qualify for awards like the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20903107/netflix-the-irishman-martin-scorsese-belasco-theater-screening-award-eligibility"&gt;and have sometimes struggled&lt;/a&gt; to find cinemas that wanted to play ball. &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/08/roma-movie-review-alfonso-cuaron.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which won Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards, was only shown in around 250 theaters, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/business/irishman-netflix-theaters.html#:~:text=The%20film%20eventually%20played%20on,them%20in%20the%20United%20States.&amp;amp;text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Irishman%E2%80%9D%20will%20move%20on,short%20of%20a%20major%20release."&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Martin Scorsese’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/27/20887812/the-irishman-movie-review-netflix-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro-al-pacino-joe-pesci-nyff"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; received a limited release in eight theaters initially and hit around 550 theaters at its widest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onE0CY"&gt;There’s only &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H83kjG5RCT8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;’s trailer&lt;/a&gt; to go off of, but shooting for something closer to a big blockbuster summer release seems to make sense for a zombie movie. It could be fun! &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gmlmGs"&gt;The world isn’t mining enough minerals to reach a future that runs on clean energy, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/clean-energy-demand-for-critical-minerals-set-to-soar-as-the-world-pursues-net-zero-goals"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Minerals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel are the building blocks for clean energy economies. Countries can’t meet their new climate goals without them. If supply chains can’t meet skyrocketing demand, mineral shortages could mean clean energy shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q4dFOU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The building blocks for clean energy economies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MzF9ND"&gt;Many of the world’s biggest economies have set goals to nearly eliminate climate pollution from fossil fuels in the next few decades. Leading climate scientists &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; that greenhouse gas emissions need to reach net zero globally by around 2050 to stave off the worst effects of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnqE6i"&gt;Hitting that 2050 target would require six times more critical minerals than are produced today, the IEA found. For some minerals, the gap between supply and predicted future demand is way bigger. Demand for lithium, for example, is expected to grow 70 times over the next couple decades. But the supply from existing lithium mines and projects under construction can only meet about half the projected demand this decade.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oqPDK"&gt;“This mismatch is something that worries us,” Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said at a press conference today. “Our numbers show that the critical minerals are not a sideshow in our journey to reach climate goals. It’s a part of the main event.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDE4ll"&gt;Batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy storage are the biggest factor driving the potential mineral shortage. An EV requires six times more mineral resources than a car that runs on fossil fuels. Cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese are essential for batteries, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OJxn0q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Existing supply chains for these minerals are already vulnerable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lG4bW2"&gt;Wind and solar power generation are also mineral-hungry industries. Wind turbines need rare earth minerals for magnets, while solar panels are made with copper, silicon, and silver. An increase in renewable energy is also spurring the need to modernize electrical grids, which can’t be done without more copper and aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKJHa5"&gt;Existing supply chains for these minerals are already vulnerable, the IEA notes. Mining for certain minerals tends to be concentrated in a few places — sometimes in just one country. About seventy percent of the world’s cobalt came from the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2019, while some 60 percent of rare earth minerals were mined in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkPING"&gt;Relying on a single source for these minerals means that the whole world could be affected by otherwise localized disasters like flooding, drought, or conflict. It can also breed human rights, labor, and environmental abuses. Major tech companies and Tesla have already faced a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/16/apple-and-google-named-in-us-lawsuit-over-congolese-child-cobalt-mining-deaths"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; over children killed while mining cobalt in the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldLFUM"&gt;Leaders will need to grapple with these problems as they work to transition their economies to clean energy. Designing technologies that minimize the use of these minerals could help alleviate some of the pressure on supply chains, according to the IEA. So could more recycling of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20951807/electric-vehicles-battery-recycling"&gt;EV batteries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18018820/solar-panel-waste-chemicals-energy-environment-recycling"&gt;solar panels&lt;/a&gt;, and wind turbines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="j6uRCi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;investors aren’t convinced that world leaders are fully committed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VYN6BD"&gt;Even with that kind of progress, the IEA expects a shortfall unless new mineral deposits are tapped. Production of new critical minerals isn’t ramping up fast enough because investors aren’t convinced that world leaders are fully committed to their climate goals, according to Birol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GI8Zs5"&gt;“If they get from the governments unmistakable signals that clean energy technologies are the technologies of tomorrow, then I believe this investment will flow,” he says. Until then, limited supplies of critical minerals will loom large over any global action on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1I8QQe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JtnL0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse is funding 50 pilot audio shows from creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Clubhouse App Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_3wXEjIlPw_woVRTO4MRw-1zt_o=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241242/1232148642.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FYlVtX"&gt;Clubhouse is funding the creation of &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/blog/meet-the-creator-first-finalists"&gt;50 audio shows&lt;/a&gt; made by creators on its platform. The concepts include everything from an interview series with Taryn Southern to a pair of shows discussing the culture of hairstyles to a game show called “Serial Killer Speed Dating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQyShb"&gt;Participants will each get a $5,000-per-month stipend for three months, plus gear and creative support, to help them create the series. The goal is to develop and pilot each show over the next three months. If shows take off, there’s a possibility Clubhouse will sign some of them to a longer-term deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YnyIjy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clubhouse’s goal is to “support new voices” on its platform&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cvv3WL"&gt;This is the first round of creators to benefit from Clubhouse’s accelerator program, which it says will “help support new voices with tools and resources to unlock their creativity on the platform.” Clubhouse says it’s not taking any ownership of the content or shows that creators develop. “The goal is to ensure that the creators themselves enjoy complete control and ownership over their creative output,” Clubhouse says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dCRHa7"&gt;Clubhouse announced its accelerator program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/14/22330281/clubhouse-accelerator-creators-davison-app"&gt;back in March&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the service’s first anniversary. Its popularity with the Silicon Valley venture capitalist crowd has led to a large amount of early buzz around the service that’s arguably disproportionate to its mainstream popularity. For example, as of this writing, you still need an invite to sign up for Clubhouse, and it doesn’t have an Android app. Despite this, a recent funding round &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Fandreessen-horowitz-values-clubhouse-at-4-billionwith-dst-tiger&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F5%2F22420644%2Fclubhouse-creator-first-pilot-program-season-audio-social" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;valued the company at $4 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tV3Iz8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22362980/clubhouse-social-audio-facebook-twitter-android"&gt;Established tech firms have responded&lt;/a&gt; to Clubhouse with plans to build similar social audio features into their own services. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391551/facebook-audio-podcasts-clubhouse-competitor-spotify-live-rooms"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; have all expressed varying levels of interest in launching their own Clubhouse-style features. With competitors circling, Clubhouse’s success is likely to rely on the strength of the creators found on its platform. Initiatives like its accelerator program appear designed to help with exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkqY4g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction May 5th, 2:02PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clubhouse’s most recent valuation is $4 billion; it was valued at $1 billion in January.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Loki’s show is coming out two days earlier, in the spirit of the trickster god</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AjPkKNnxmhanu6d_OnLw4KpW29Q=/533x0:2336x1202/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241096/Screen_Shot_2021_02_24_at_12.21.03_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EenqOj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;, the upcoming Disney Plus show about the trickster god and brother of Thor, will be coming out slightly earlier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299343/loki-premiere-date-disney-plus-marvel-tom-hiddleston-wandavision-black-widow"&gt;than originally planned&lt;/a&gt;: the premiere date has moved to June 9th, from the 11th. The show will also air on a new day of the week, with new episodes airing on Wednesdays instead of Fridays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3L2MP"&gt;The announcement was made in a video uploaded to Marvel’s YouTube channel. The video starts with a typical Marvel montage, but then is interrupted by Tom Hiddleston talking about how Loki is always left out of superhero montages. (It’s understandable that he’d feel left out — even in articles about a show dedicated to the character, he’s typically described in relation to his brother.) “Wednesdays are the new Fridays,” he says, before the new date is revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jufhUL"&gt;A Disney spokesperson explained the shift as being part of the company’s ongoing experiments with release timing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump objects to continued Facebook ban in email screed calling for ‘political price’ to be paid</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="American Conservative Union Holds Annual Conference In Florida" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ft-rtzlNV9jtjhyXn5q4tMbACgw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241090/1304610267.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zgfNiw"&gt;Former President Donald Trump’s Facebook ban is sticking around for now, following the decision from Facebook’s Oversight Board to uphold its original ban from earlier this year. And Trump is not pleased, according to his first official statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLpams"&gt;“Free speech has been taken away from the President of the United States,” an emailed statement from Trump &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1389962790467620866"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reads&lt;/a&gt;, calling for a “political price” to be paid not just by Facebook, but by Google and Twitter as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TEn1qw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook’s Trump ban can stay in place, says Oversight Board","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5FMU3n"&gt;Facebook’s Oversight Board is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249427/facebook-oversight-board-nobel-peace-prize-instagram-snowden"&gt;panel of independent experts&lt;/a&gt; established to oversee high-stakes moderation and policy disputes on the social media platform.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In its decision, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"&gt;the Oversight Board explained&lt;/a&gt; that while Facebook’s initial decision to suspend Trump’s account following the Capitol Riot was valid, the company’s institution of an indefinite suspension was not. Instead, the Board asked that Facebook “apply and justify a defined penalty” — whether that be permanently banning the former president or instilling a set amount of time before Trump is allowed back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oAvSb2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Trump statement, over email (not his new blog) via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/maggieNYT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@maggieNYT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/mA3MVDCt9Y"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mA3MVDCt9Y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— rat king (@MikeIsaac) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1389962790467620866?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AbRBW8"&gt;Notably, Facebook’s Oversight Board chose to punt the decision over whether Trump should be permanently banned, instead choosing to pass the final call back to Facebook. Per that decision, Facebook will be taking the next six months to “determine and justify a proportionate response that is consistent with the rules that are applied to other users of its platform,” meaning that the former president’s fate on the platform is still up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGj9SY"&gt;Trump’s statement doesn’t actually comment specifically on Facebook’s Oversight Board decision or advocate for Facebook to make any direct changes as it looks to create more concrete rules for how to handle both Trump’s ban and future incidents. Instead, Trump sticks to his typical inflammatory rhetoric and insults, rather than addressing specific policy concerns with the ongoing review process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NT3UnX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Donald Trump’s ‘social media platform’ has launched and it’s just a blog","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419850/donald-trump-social-media-platform-ban-twitter-facebook"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Dy2euQ"&gt;Having access to Facebook is more than just a place for Trump to post content on social media. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-facebook-reinstate-2024-bid-c9e51b54-7b35-4751-b620-0ceccd0979f8.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook is a huge part of Trump’s political strategy and future, giving the former president and his team the ability to specifically target supporters with ad campaigns, in addition to serving as one of the biggest sources of Trump’s grassroots fundraising efforts. And a return to Facebook could be a major factor in whether Trump decides to run for office again in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAfMcK"&gt;In lieu of access to Facebook, Twitter, and other major social media platforms, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419850/donald-trump-social-media-platform-ban-twitter-facebook"&gt;Trump has started a new, short-form blog&lt;/a&gt; that mimics the format (if not the broad reach) of his former Facebook and Twitter accounts. And while Trump is free to post to the internet, it’ll ultimately be Facebook’s decision whether to hand him back the platform that he last used to help incite the Capital riot in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QR65Fg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vOd8h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new 11-inch iPad Pro is already $50 off at Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XhdJUoJIvAT4grCWyb1qUU4JkoU=/0x38:980x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241072/ipad_pro_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="601EPa"&gt;The new 11-inch iPad Pro with the M1 processor costs $799 to preorder at most retailers, but not at Walmart. You can reserve an &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1039828/9383?sharedid=VergeApple11InchPro050521&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Silver%2F307298322&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11-inch model with 128GB of storage for $749&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll arrive at your door on or before June 1st. The step-up configuration with 256GB of storage is $50 off, too, costing $849 to preorder. We’ve seen similar preorder deals on the new iPad Pro from &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexpercom.com%2Fcollections%2Fipad%2Fproducts%2Fipad-pro-11-inch-1%3Fvariant%3D39316139212834#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a site called Expercom&lt;/a&gt;, but it currently offers a vague “3-6 week” estimate for shipping your purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjcFdP"&gt;Granted, it’ll still be another handful of weeks before a purchase from Walmart ships, but at least there’s some reassurance there that it’ll arrive by early June at the latest. At the time of publishing, Walmart says that orders will ship on Monday, May 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dcxYVO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9efM2W"&gt;With this new generation of iPad Pro, Apple uses the same M1 processor that’s found in the MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and new iMac. The company’s tablet and computing lineups are still distinct in the software they use (iPadOS versus macOS), but they’re getting more similar with every new iteration. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396449/apple-ipad-pro-macbook-air-macos-2021"&gt;My colleague Monica Chin thinks Apple ought to just rip off the bandage&lt;/a&gt; and put macOS on the iPad since its hardware is similar in many ways to a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NqS9k4"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin is aiming to launch its first crew of humans to the edge of space on July 20th aboard its suborbital space tourism rocket, New Shepard, the company announced on Wednesday. One seat aboard that flight will be auctioned off to support its Club for the Future foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdfOZq"&gt;“On July 20th, New Shepard will fly its first astronaut crew to space,” the company said in a press release. “We are offering one seat on this first flight to the winning bidder of Blue Origin’s online auction.” The auction starts today, the statement added, inviting the public to place a bid on its website. The statement didn’t include any information on how much each seat will cost going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUKLMG"&gt;Blue Origin said the auction, managed by Massachusetts-based R&amp;amp;R Auction Company, will accept sealed, anonymous bids of any price until May 19th. Any bids after that will be visible to the public (and, of course, must exceed the highest bid to advance in the auction). Then there’ll be a live online auction on June 12th as a conclusion to determine the winning bidder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="12VnL4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On July 20th, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NewShepard?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NewShepard&lt;/a&gt; will fly its first astronaut crew to space. We are offering one seat on this first flight to the winning bidder of an online auction. Anyone can place an opening bid by going to &lt;a href="https://t.co/6DpTdTxo36"&gt;https://t.co/6DpTdTxo36&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GradatimFerociter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GradatimFerociter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jBMFYX7xHg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jBMFYX7xHg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Blue Origin (@blueorigin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1389973625537712135?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vJJpaZ"&gt;Blue Origin made the announcement on the 60th anniversary of the first crewed American flight to space. The company’s first crewed flight will be the culmination of over a decade of rocket testing, which has been set back by delays — the company initially planned to start selling seat tickets in 2019, with a goal to fly its first crew in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32I9y5"&gt;According to the auction’s terms and conditions, the capsule for the debut crewed flight will be dubbed “RSS First Step Crew Capsule” and will include other astronauts picked by Blue Origin. The fine print doesn’t mention the July 20th launch date as mentioned in the press release, but says the flight “is expected to take place within six (6) months after the close of the Auction, and Blue Origin will keep the Astronaut updated as to changes to the date of the Flight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVCCyx"&gt;The fine print also listed physical requirements for the winning astronaut: passengers must weigh between 110 lbs and 223 lbs, and should be between five feet and six-foot-four inches tall. Passengers should also be able to take forces of up to 3Gs for a couple minutes during ascent (or up to three times their weight), and five-and-a-half times their weight (or 5.5gs) “for a few seconds during descent into the atmosphere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqDJnf"&gt;New Shepard — named after the first American to enter space, Alan Shepard — is a 60-foot-tall reusable launcher designed to shoot a gumdrop-shaped capsule with seats for six passengers to the edge of space, about 65 miles above ground. The suborbital rocket has successfully flown 15 tests since its first launch in 2015 but has never flown with a crew on board. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383407/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-new-shepard-launch-first-crewed-flight"&gt;Its most recent flight&lt;/a&gt;, in April, served as an “astronaut rehearsal for future customer flights.” Company executives roleplayed astronauts and ran through a bunch of pre-flight tests but left the capsule before liftoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rf0RWR"&gt;The astronaut capsule is tailored for space tourists — each reclined seat gets its own massive window that stretches over three feet tall. The seats also come with their own push-to-talk buttons so passengers can chat with ground control, as well as tablet-sized screens fixed to the border of each window that shows live flight data and video from the launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qx9o6M"&gt;Near the 65-mile altitude, the capsule separates from New Shepard, which begins its return to land guided by its single rocket engine. Meanwhile, the capsule spends about 10 minutes floating in microgravity where Earth’s atmosphere borders space. At that point, passengers can leave their seats and float around the capsule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApMfNo"&gt;After basking in 10 minutes of weightlessness, the capsule starts to fall back to land, deploying a set of three parachutes to slow its return in the desert of Van Horn, Texas, a few miles from where New Shepard landed. Small rocket motors at the base of the capsule fire milliseconds before landing to soften the impact of touchdown. The capsule’s six seats are supported by a scissor-like mechanism that is designed to absorb the touchdown shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lf9fMI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
