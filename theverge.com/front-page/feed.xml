    <title>TikTok is testing a Twitter-like Repost button for sharing videos </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ippRK5"&gt;The highly addictive clock app is testing a feature that should save you the trouble of having to DM the most share-worthy clips from your For You page with friends. TikTok has introduced a “Repost” button that works a little like Twitter’s retweet feature — but it doesn’t appear to be available to everyone yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CH5y5G"&gt;Several sites &lt;a href="https://www.imore.com/tiktok-testing-repost-button-will-share-content-your-followers"&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.distractify.com/p/tiktok-repost-button"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/20/tiktok-testing-new-way-to-let-users-repost-content-on-the-social-network/"&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt;, and social media consultant Matt Navarra &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1472579035641397252"&gt;tweeted an image&lt;/a&gt; of the button on December 19th. &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;today reported a more &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/tiktok-tests-its-own-version-of-the-retweet-with-a-new-repost-button/"&gt;detailed explanation&lt;/a&gt; of how the tool works in practice, including that it seems to be limited to the For You feed from the share menu rather than throughout the TikTok app. (Videos that are shared can similarly be un-shared from this menu as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMU7oO"&gt;Additionally, videos shared with the Repost button won’t appear in the sharer’s profile — just on their friends’ for For You feeds. According to TechCrunch, the Repost button will only push the video into the feeds of users who follow each other. The feature is reportedly being tested with a limited number of users, and some of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff had access to it while others did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4gLovI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;TikTok is testing a ‘Repost’ button &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;h/t &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adrianokev1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@adrianokev1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Nwbj07GXsK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Nwbj07GXsK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1472579035641397252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8yZBz"&gt;TikTok did not immediately return a request for comment about the feature or how widely it’s available at this time, but the company told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; in a statement that it’s “always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQdctu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports that some users are seeing a “Recommend” button in place of the Repost tool. Both prompt users to share why they’re reposting the video — a step, it’s worth noting, you can skip entirely by simply DMing it. Though again, depending on the pool of mutuals you want to share a video with, that could be a bit of an inconvenience. Keep in mind comments on shared videos can be seen, though they’ll disappear if you un-share a video with your mutuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="miGk3Y"&gt;As I have exactly five (5) mutual friends on TikTok who receive anywhere between two and 20 TikTok DMs a day from me alone, I imagine they’ll be grateful for the shuffle-in alternative to being pinged a dozen times daily if and when they get it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyundai imagines a world in which it has turned everything into a robot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYYqGf2zRzg6nbMgtOJukM29Ohw=/390x0:4610x2813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347904/CES2022_KV_2._MoT_ecosystem.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IJWVdu"&gt;Hyundai has already showed off some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839417/hyundai-mobed-wheeled-robot-mobility-device-ces-2022"&gt;practical robotics concepts&lt;/a&gt; last month in the lead-up to the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show. Now the South Korean automaker is going full galaxy brain with the introduction of a new “Mobility of Things” concept that it claims will power a whole slew of objects, from household plants and book shelves, to ambulances and autonomous passenger pods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfoIKg"&gt;The spectrum of things that can be roboticized (for lack of a better term) is “unlimited,” said Dong Jin Hyun, vice president and head of Robotics Lab of Hyundai Motor Group, in a statement. “The goal is for robotics to enable all kinds of personal mobility, connected to communicate, move and perform tasks autonomously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qIHKFM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The goal is for robotics to enable all kinds of personal mobility”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J6Edrx"&gt;Hyundai says it is developing two different standards: a modular platform called “Plug and Drive” (PnD) that combines steering, electric drive, and suspension hardware; and “Drive and Lift” (DnL) that can lift objects up and down. Combined with the four-wheeled robot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839417/hyundai-mobed-wheeled-robot-mobility-device-ces-2022"&gt;MobED it announced last month&lt;/a&gt;, the two new modular platforms will be able to power a range of objects to move autonomously on their own, from tables and containers, to people movers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/222bQHh0T6lYswYoQgO_BwkTkSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145103/CES2022_KV_3._PnD_Module.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8iLxF4"&gt;Here’s how Plug and Drive will work, according to Hyundai:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GaoAxZ"&gt;The PnD modular platform is an all-in-one mobility solution that combines intelligent steering, braking, in-wheel electric drive and suspension hardware. The single wheel unit uses a steering actuator for infinite wheel rotation, meaning it can turn 360 degrees, which enables holonomic movement, like a figure skater. LiDAR and camera sensors allow a PnD-enabled object to move autonomously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aj39o"&gt;PnD modules can be attached to anything from tables to containers for expandable mobility. Users can select various drive configurations and platform sizes based on their requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42ye09"&gt;“The PnD Module is adaptive and expandable to match human needs. Because in the world to come, you won’t move your things — they will move around you,” Hyun said. “PnD makes normally inanimate objects mobile. It’s this ability that makes changing practically any space possible. It’s a way to configure spaces on demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5uiEu1"&gt;Hyundai claims the modular platforms can be configured to modify office space to make “purpose built spaces” possible. But the more intriguing possibilities are in transportation. The company imagines a “purpose built vehicle,” measuring approximately four feet by five feet, as a “last-mile mobility [solution] for a single passenger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttJSPG"&gt;Sounds cool, but it will depend on how it looks in real life. Hyundai previewed some of these concepts in a glossy video it’s produced depicting a elderly woman retrieving her walking cane from a robotic holder, and then being whisked down the side of her multistory apartment building in an “individualized mobility cabin.” Later, we see her smile contentedly from within a glossy black pod on four wheels as it zooms around the corner of a nameless city. The pod docks with a “mother shuttle” containing a dozen other pods, with a scrolling LED sign meant to look like a city bus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C4l5V9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not exactly dystopian, but it’s not &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;dystopian&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xIRGs2"&gt;It’s not exactly dystopian, but it’s not &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;dystopian, if you get my meaning. Presenting the idea as a mobility solution for people (i.e., seniors) with limited options is a great way to gloss over some of the more disturbing aspects, such as a robot bus packed with human passengers that are trapped inside individualized test tube containers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5Vhap"&gt;Hyundai is clearly excited about the future of robotics. Last year, the company, which has a controlling stake in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22167835/hyundai-boston-dynamics-aquisition-consumer-robotics"&gt;robot maker Boston Dynamics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274297/hyundai-walking-car-tiger-umv-concept-autonomous"&gt;rolled out a new version of its four-legged “walking car” concept&lt;/a&gt; called TIGER, or “Transforming Intelligent Ground Excursion Robot.” It’s the second vehicle to come out of the automaker’s Ultimate Mobility Vehicles studio in Silicon Valley, and the first designed to be fully autonomous, with no space for drivers or passengers. It’s like a real-life Transformer, but without the “bent on world domination” vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unUfXF"&gt;In many ways, this builds on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/4/14172006/hyundai-mobility-concept-smart-home-driverless-car"&gt;concepts introduced by Hyundai at CES in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, when the automaker envisioned a mashup of a smart home with an autonomous vehicle, with futuristic furniture moving seamlessly between both. Tellingly, this vision never came to pass. But as the technology matures, Hyundai is still holding out that its weird robotics concepts can find their footing in the real world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkbJdN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4X5E5H"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All the gaming laptops announced at CES 2022 with the latest Intel, AMD, and Nvidia mobile components</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Alienware X14" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bsBFTNMfPfSmSVMXGKmyfPOXEm0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347778/cfaulkner_141231_4943_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vYefvT"&gt;As is usually the case for CES, there is an abundance of gaming laptops being announced for release in early and mid-2022 that have at least two of the following traits in common: they have Intel’s 12th Gen H-series processors, or they support AMD’s Ryzen 6000-series processors, and they have Nvidia’s new RTX 3070 Ti or RTX 3080 Ti graphics chips. What’s more, many of them will also support DDR5 RAM at 4,800MHz. It’s a great time to be shopping for a laptop, as these seem faster than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbXbph"&gt;There are always outliers we won’t catch, and we’ll be making more passes at this through the week, but there are currently well over a dozen laptops coming that have some combination of these components. We’ve covered the biggest CES 2022 announcements individually, but for others that we didn’t cover elsewhere, let this be your guide to what the biggest names in portable computing are up to for the next few months. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Nitro 5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UmudguSmeJp8U1RqjX77j5ge6A8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23141990/acernitro52022.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OcDhPn"&gt;Acer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2I2KAR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predator Triton 500 SE:&lt;/strong&gt; Acer’s flagship machine for CES 2022 supports up to Intel’s Core i9-12900HK processor and up to Nvidia’s new RTX 3080 Ti graphics chip. It can house up to 32GB of DDR5 RAM clocked at an impressive 5,200MHz. It supports up to 2TB of PCIe 4.0 storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izTQDx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22624397"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nitro 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This model can be configured with up to AMD’s latest Ryzen 6000-series or Intel’s 12th Gen Core i7-12700H processors, and up to Nvidia’s RTX 3070 Ti. This model can be configured with up to 32GB of DDR5 memory clocked at 4,800MHz. In terms of storage, the Nitro 5 has two M.2 PCIe 4.0 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDDPQn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predator Helios 300:&lt;/strong&gt; Acer’s Helios 300 is an Intel-only machine that can house up to Intel’s Core i9-12900H and up to Nvidia’s RTX 3080 graphics chip. It also supports up to 32GB of DDR5 memory clocked at 4,800MHz, and allows for up to 2TB of PCIe 4.0 M.2 storage in RAID 0.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2022)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LNJqy4PlHcFXjPu9oMDaOM70ylU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142265/g14hero.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PUC4rw"&gt;Asus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UZEIkR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22629009"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROG Zephyrus G14 and G15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; The G14 for 2022 is an all-AMD affair, going up to the Ryzen 9 6900HS processor, paired with AMD’s Radeon RX 6800S graphics chip. The G15 can go up to AMD’s Ryzen 9 6900HS, supporting up to Nvidia’s new RTX 3080 Ti. Both can support up to 32GB of fast DDR5 memory clocked at 4,800MHz (up to 16GB of it will be soldered to the board, leaving one slot for you to use later on). You can use PCIe 4.0 M.2 2280-sized SSDs in the G14 and G15, though the G14 has one slot (1TB max) and the G15 features two slots with RAID 0 support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wZ9Qg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROG Flow X13:&lt;/strong&gt; This year’s X13 can be configured with up to AMD’s Ryzen 9 6980HS processor and up to the RTX 3050 Ti graphics chip. The main appeal of this laptop is its XG Mobile connector, which lets it connect to Asus’ external GPU enclosure that can power the tablet with improved graphics (up to the RTX 3080 desktop GPU). The X13 packs 32GB of super-fast 6,400MHz DDR5 memory, with support for up to 1TB of M.2 2230-sized PCIe 4.0 storage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

Despite being a thin tablet, it can support up to 32GB of DDR5 memory clocked at 5,200MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1M0Yes"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROG Zephyrus Duo 16&lt;/strong&gt;: This is one of Asus’ strangest and most powerful laptops. It features two screens (one a traditional 16-inch 16:10 aspect ratio display and the other a half-height 14.1-inch touch panel), and it can be configured with up to AMD’s Ryzen 9 6900HX processor and Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti graphics chip at the highest end. This model has two user-accessible M.2 PCIe 4.0 slots available, each supporting up to 2TB with RAID 0.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade gaming laptops" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LQ6yyHZLwaTtu1xHy2IV4B_O2KE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23129979/bladetri.jpg"&gt;

&lt;p id="kdnQuD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22628919"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aorus 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This model supports up to Intel’s Core i7-12700H processor, and in the graphics department it can be configured with up to Nvidia’s RTX 3070. These will support up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM clocked up to 3,200MHz and offer two PCIe 4.0 M.2 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI Stealth GS66" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IFHVPvRzhTQsw2_rNSkYIN6J9y0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145326/msistealthgs662022.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: MSI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSI’s revised Stealth gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="smu9Ry"&gt;MSI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IxkVf2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stealth GS77 and GS66:&lt;/strong&gt; MSI’s revised Stealth gaming laptops support up to Intel’s 12th Gen Core i7-12900H processor and up to Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti graphics chips. The 15.6-inch GS66 and 17.3-inch GS77 each have two RAM slots and support up to 64GB of DDR 5 memory clocked at 4,800MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQh7YS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raider GE76 and GE66&lt;/strong&gt;: Both the 15.6-inch GE66 and 17.3-inch GE76 will support up to Intel’s Core i9-12900HK processor and up to Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti graphics. Given that the Raider is thicker than the Stealth, expect better performance here. Similar to the Stealth, the Raider series supports up to 64GB of DDR5 RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wke5wx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vector GP76 and GP66:&lt;/strong&gt; This model is similar to the Raider GE’s design but without RGB lights to give it a more professional look. Like the Raider, it supports Intel’s Core i9-12900HK, though it tops out at the RTX 3080, and the RAM is DDR4 clocked at 3,200MHz. Given that this one is using some parts that aren’t brand-new, it’s fair to expect a slightly cheaper price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI Crosshair gaming laptop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9sg88xMeaXzseYdbb_CLYEdog-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145330/crosshair2022.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: MSI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One look should tell you whether you want this laptop, or not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dytFZ2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crosshair 17 and 15:&lt;/strong&gt; While the MSI models above each feature the option to go up to QHD or higher, the Crosshair lineup sticks to 1080p panels. This lineup also uses one of Intel’s 12th Gen Core i9 processors with up to Nvidia’s RTX 3070 Ti graphics chip. Oh, and mind the extreme &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Six: Extraction&lt;/em&gt; branding and matching colorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNdskk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sword and Katana&lt;/strong&gt;: Despite having different names, MSI’s Sword and Katana are similar machines. The Sword comes in white, while the Katana is black with two size options (15.6 inches and 17.3 inches). Both support up to Intel’s Core i7-12700H processor and up to Nvidia’s RTX 3070 Ti graphics chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZYENR"&gt;We’ll be adding more manufacturers as CES 2022 moves along.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Latest Google Pixel update fixes bug that prevents 911 calls with Teams installed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pixel, Android, emergency contacts" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DVGKTVTBuaRoHSxGALtCjHFr9Fk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347707/akrales_190318_3299_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7jFTA8"&gt;Google is bringing an update to older Pixel devices to fix a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826272/911-failure-google-android-microsoft-teams-bug"&gt;dangerous bug that prevents users from calling 911&lt;/a&gt;, as noted by a post on a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/143968432/google-pixel-update-january-2022?hl=en"&gt;Google support page&lt;/a&gt;. The bug stems from an unintended interaction between the Android OS and Microsoft Teams — it only affects devices with Android 10 or later and could occur if you have Teams installed but aren’t signed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZKEH1k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The update resolves the “issue preventing emergency calls in certain conditions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jw2DTf"&gt;On the support page, Google notes that the update resolves the “issue preventing emergency calls in certain conditions while some third-party apps are installed.” It’s available on devices running Android 12 (including the Pixel 3 and up), but the update hasn’t rolled out to the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860191/pixel-6-pro-google-december-feature-update-paused"&gt;Google paused updates for these devices&lt;/a&gt; following reports of dropped calls when it released the December update but says a fix will arrive later this month. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/12/22830599/microsoft-teams-911-calling-bug-update"&gt;Teams also issued an update to its app&lt;/a&gt; to fix the bug, however, it’s unclear whether Google will release a patch for other Android devices that could be affected as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8z7gF0"&gt;Aside from the 911 calling bug, the Pixel update also fixes an issue that causes the navigation bar to disappear when the device orientation is changed, a picture-in-picture (PIP) window rendering glitch, and a memory leak in the system UI. A fix for the problem that causes the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro to drop calls over Wi-Fi is also listed, but that still hasn’t been rolled out due to the aforementioned delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgMnGV"&gt;Google also released a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/91975505/google-android-pixel-security-update-january-2021?hl=en"&gt;separate security update&lt;/a&gt;, offering some fixes for Pixel devices running Android 11 and above, and once again excludes the Pixel 6. This includes a problem that causes certain apps to restart intermittently, an issue that blocks users from making calls on specific MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) networks, and also improves “auto-rotation response in certain device orientations.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NXP’s new tri-radio chip makes it easy to add Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, and Thread to smart home gadgets </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vv7UfEjXiyORoZ0pHgSEWUVdHlA=/6x0:6042x4024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347555/nxp_advances_iot_connectivity_with_industrys_first_secure_tr.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Imagine these devices have NXP’s new IW612 SoC | Image: NXP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IWYfay"&gt;&lt;a href="https://media.nxp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nxp-advances-iot-connectivity-industrys-first-secure-tri-radio"&gt;NXP has a new tri-radio SoC&lt;/a&gt; that it’s announcing at CES 2022 that’s designed to serve as a silver bullet for comprehensive smart home connectivity in a single chip, offering out-of-the-box support for Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth LE 5.2, and 802.15.4 (i.e., Thread) all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qSXVZe"&gt;The idea is that hardware manufacturers building new smart home devices — and especially ones building routers, smart speakers, and hubs that are designed to serve as bridges between different radio standards like Wi-Fi and Thread — can now just integrate a single chipset solution to their products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCjtIU"&gt;That’s especially critical with the upcoming launch of the new Matter standard later in 2022, which aims to provide a single standard to connect all the different smart home software solutions out there from Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung, and other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8ZJTFT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Matter’s plan to save the smart home ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="4hkx0j"&gt;But smart home devices aren’t just fragmented by platform — they also tend to use wildly different connectivity standards. Some lightbulbs have Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, while others use Thread or Zigbee. That’s where NXP’s IW612 SoC comes in: it’ll make it simple for upcoming Matter hub devices to interact with a wide range of smart home devices old and new, which (at least in theory) will help the new standard better integrate with customers’ setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ci3Wsr"&gt;NXP is already sampling the IW612 chip to its customers, and while it’s unlikely that most people buying a smart home product will ever really notice the NXP branding, the new chip could help be a key part of making Matter’s interconnected dream a reality when it rolls out later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Targus built Apple’s Find My tracking tech into its Cypress Hero EcoSmart backpack</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Targus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nZotoS"&gt;In addition to designing several new products for people trying to keep germ-free during a pandemic, Targus is targeting iPhone users &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.targus.com%2Fblogs%2Fpress-room%2Ftargus-showcases-new-product-range-at-ces-2022-to-empower-a-seamless-life-at-home-in-the-office-or-on-the-go&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22866769%2Ftargus-ces-2022-apple-backpack-find-my" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with this new Cypress Hero EcoSmart Backpack that has built-in Apple Find My technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cypress Hero EcoSmart backpack includes Apple’s Find My technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="un67rC"&gt;In turn, users can also use their backpack to track a lost iPhone by pressing a button in the backpack. The backpack has an integrated battery that’s replaceable and can be recharged via USB, which Targus claims will provide better protection from thieves than a simple tag. Like the other bags in the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.targus.com%2Fcollections%2Fcypress-with-ecosmart%3Fnarrow%3D%255B%255B%2522Features%2522%252C%2522filter_features_Eco-Friendly%2522%255D%255D%26sort_by%3Dcreation_date%26utm_source%3Dpress_release%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3DCES_2022_Product_Roundup&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22866769%2Ftargus-ces-2022-apple-backpack-find-my" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cypress Hero EcoSmart line&lt;/a&gt;, Targus says this one is built using approximately 26 recycled water bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EnhdZV"&gt;Currently, there is no specific release date for the backpack, but Targus says that the new product will be available in spring / summer 2022 for $149.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6Nq4w"&gt;Not an iPhone user or don’t want any built-in tracking? Targus is also expanding &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/targus-showcases-new-product-range-at-ces-2022-to-empower-a-seamless-life-at-home-in-the-office-or-on-the-go-301453009.html"&gt;its antimicrobial accessory line&lt;/a&gt; at CES 2022 — a line meant to stand out in a pandemic consumer market in a way that marketing exec Andrew Corkill says will “address productivity, sustainability, and health and wellness initiatives to enable a seamless life.” That includes other backpacks, plus a briefcase, slipcase, and laptop sleeve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CZv7M"&gt;Targus also announced a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.targus.com%2Fblogs%2Fpress-room%2Ftargus-and-synaptics-to-introduce-world-s-first-universal-hybrid-dock-with-bio-authentication-via-built-in-fingerprint-id-at-ces-2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22866769%2Ftargus-ces-2022-apple-backpack-find-my" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;USB-C Hybrid / Universal 4K Quad Dock&lt;/a&gt; with fingerprint ID compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and Chrome OS. It supports either single-display 8K resolution output or four 4K displays. It will be available this month as the Dock720 for $442.99 while a Dock710 without enterprise-grade biometrics capabilities will be available for $372.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQgJQO"&gt;Finally, Targus says &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225509/targus-anti-microbial-keyboard-light-and-backpack-ces-pandemic"&gt;the UV-C LED Disinfection Light it announced at CES 2021&lt;/a&gt; to keep keyboards clean is now “the world’s first certified disinfection unit for commercial use under UL 962” and will be available in February for $299.99. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>John Deere’s self-driving tractor lets farmers leave the cab — and the field</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wb2-0jxzyR_n017uueZkUamC16U=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347450/john_deere_autonomous_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Self-driving tractors could be coming to a farm near you. &lt;/em&gt; | Image; John Deere&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I1x2ca"&gt;Agricultural equipment maker John Deere has announced its latest piece of autonomous farming kit: a package of hardware and software that combines machine learning with the company’s GPS-powered auto-steer features to create a “&lt;a href="http://johndeere.com/CES"&gt;fully autonomous tractor&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhiExx"&gt;The technology to support autonomous farming has been developing rapidly in recent years, but John Deere claims this is a significant step forward. With this technology, farmers will not only be able to take their hands off the wheel of their tractor or leave the cab — they’ll be able to leave the field altogether, letting the equipment do the work without them while monitoring things remotely using their smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxgvIe"&gt;“This is not a demo. It’s not a concept machine. It’s something we’ve had in the field with farmers for years and will be taking to production in fall,” Deanna Kovar, vice president of production and precision ag production systems at John Deere, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zJVyP5nKPqZfXf4eohKN3kOuJVU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144919/john_deere_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: John Deere&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agricultural automation has been improving slowly but surely over the past decades. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0hx7jt"&gt;This may seem like an unexpected breakthrough, but the farming world has arguably made more consistent progress with autonomous driving than automakers or tech startups, mostly due to the simplicity of the task at hand. Although plowing or seeding a field is certainly a difficult job — requiring farmers to navigate the contours of their land while operating complicated equipment — the driving component is relatively straightforward: operators follow set lines without having to worry about pedestrians or other road users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFuZk1"&gt;Because of this, companies like John Deere have been able to automate many aspects of farm driving over the past decades. Mostly, they offer auto-steer systems which use GPS to locate and guide tractors. Farmers first map the boundaries of their fields, often using beacons or by driving around the perimeter, and the software then plots a route. The driver — sitting in the cab of their tractor — can then oversee this path and correct it if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGGMbm"&gt;“We’re not going from no tech all the way up to an autonomous machine,” says Kovar. “John Deere’s AutoTrac solution has taken the job of steering in the field out of the operators’ hands for almost 20 years now.” Today’s announcement, she says, builds on these solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cqBrQ9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re not going from no tech all the way up to an autonomous machine.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sQib0S"&gt;The big difference with this new technology is that drivers will now be able to set-and-forget some aspects of their self-driving tractors. The company’s autonomy kit includes six pairs of stereo cameras that capture a 360-degree view around the tractor. This input is then analyzed by machine vision algorithms, which spot unexpected obstacles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ciQszh"&gt;“All [farmers] need to do is transport [their tractor] to the field, get it set, get out the cab, and use their mobile phone to ‘swipe to farm,’” says Kovar. “And every eight hours, they return to give it fuel and move it from field to field.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTYDuo"&gt;Although John Deere is presenting this as an autonomous system, it’s worth noting that there are humans in the loop, and not just farmers. When the company’s algorithms spot something unexpected, images from the cameras will be sent to “tele-operators” — essentially a call center of third-party contractors who will manually check if the obstacle is a false positive or if the problem has resolved itself. If it’s a real issue, they’ll escalate things to the farmer via an alert on their mobile app. The farmer can then view the images themselves and decide if they want to plot a new course or check the situation in person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktULCn"&gt;“We’ve trained the algorithm to know that those are birds flying, you don’t have to stop for birds. But if you have, say, a dog in the field, then we’ll stop,” says Kovar. “We don’t want to always alert the farmer because this could be two in the morning. Part of the value of autonomy is allowing farmers to focus on other tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pairs of cameras will offer a 360-degree view. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JOY1lT"&gt;This system won’t be able to handle all aspects of tractor work, though. Right now, John Deere is focusing on the job of tillage — preparing soil for cultivation, either by turning over the earth, removing crop residue, or plowing this material back into the field to return nutrients to the soil. This is a “competing priority” job that’s usually done around harvest time, says Kofar, meaning farmers may set it aside in favor of more pressing tasks. That makes it a perfect target for automation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyTo82"&gt;Of course, the proof of the pudding is always in the eating, and despite years of testing, there will no doubt be teething problems when it comes to using this technology in farms. Driving a tractor isn’t just about steering round obstacles, and farmers also have to check that their equipment is working and adjust it to environmental changes. Kovar says the company’s software can monitor some of these variables, like checking that individual shanks on tillage tools are still operational, but there are bound to be other issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mZGZE"&gt;The company will be selling its new autonomy package as equipment to be retrofitted onto a number of its more recent tractors. But it has not released pricing — either upfront costs or annual subscriptions (which it charges for its autosteer products). The underlying equipment, though, is already extremely pricy. A John Deere 8R tractor and chisel plow used for tillage will set farmers back hundreds of thousands of dollars. There’s also the contentious &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22533735/john-deere-cto-hindman-decoder-interview-right-to-repair-tractors"&gt;issue of right to repair&lt;/a&gt;. Deere has been criticized strongly for locking farmers out of their own machines, and adding more computation will only speed this trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mevYoU"&gt;As Kovar says, though, this is just another step in John Deere’s journey towards ever-greater automation in agriculture. “This is a huge fusion of all of the technologies that agriculture has been leveraging for a couple of decades now,” she says. “There’s tons of opportunity for autonomy to stretch all the way through the production cycle, and at John Deere, we’re committed to that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why AT&amp;T and Verizon are feuding with the US government over a last-minute delay to 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="cell tower stock 1024" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UFQfQXD93XobDDTim67oWSDgmfY=/0x0:1008x672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347426/cell-tower-san-jose-3-stock-1024.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A long-brewing battle between wireless carriers and airlines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="r0Xcn7"&gt;The day after New Year’s, the CEOs of the two biggest wireless carriers in America sent &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145232/att_letter.pdf"&gt;a very angry letter&lt;/a&gt; to Pete Buttigieg. The companies had been working for years to launch a new portion of their 5G networks, a launch that had been scheduled for December and then unexpectedly pushed back due to vague air safety concerns. Now, the Department of Transportation was asking for more time, just days before the scheduled launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MQLVp"&gt;“In addition to the tens of billions of dollars we paid to the U.S. Government for the spectrum and the additional billions of dollars we paid to the satellite companies to enable the December 2021 availability of the spectrum,” the CEOs wrote, “we have paid billions of dollars more to purchase the necessary equipment and lease space on towers. Thousands of our employees have worked non-stop for months to prepare our networks to utilize this spectrum.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SACOGz"&gt;As of yesterday, the spectrum launch is back on — pushed first to January 5th, then two weeks later to January 19th — but it’s been an unusually rocky road for US wireless carriers, bouncing between regulators at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and increasingly vocal unions for pilots and flight attendants. At the heart of all of it is a nagging fear that the latest round of 5G spectrum will pose a threat to commercial airlines and their passengers. But it’s such a complicated issue that it’s best to unpack it one piece at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OPgr75"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="hAHNLt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is actually getting delayed here? I already have 5G on my phone. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="STgrVH"&gt;Carriers and airlines are fighting over a particular chunk of spectrum from 3.7 to roughly 4.0 GHz – primarily used by AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon, sometimes referred to as C-band. (T-Mobile is using a separate mid-band patch at 2.2GHz, so it is largely sitting this fight out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AduITk"&gt;This isn’t all the 5G spectrum, but it’s some of the best parts. The most powerful thing about 5G is the ability to transmit huge volumes of data over these mid-band frequencies, and this spectrum is the main way AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are planning to do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jvxMDW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a reason they paid $65 billion for this. They don’t have sufficient mid-band spectrum without it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOOHot"&gt;“There’s a reason they paid $65 billion for this spectrum,” says Public Knowledge’s Harold Feld, who &lt;a href="https://wetmachine.com/tales-of-the-sausage-factory/what-the-eff-faa-my-insanely-long-field-guide-to-the-faa-fcc-5g-c-band-fight/"&gt;wrote about the issue at length in November&lt;/a&gt;. “They don’t have sufficient mid-band spectrum without it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPXPMz"&gt;Crucially, we’re at the last step in a very long process. If you bought a 5G-capable phone, you already own a device that can send and receive on those wavelengths, and there are already cell towers that can manage those signals. All that’s left is to turn them on, at which point the C-band airwaves will get a whole lot busier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="J9Bs6A"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So… why didn’t they switch them on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="iooyzZ"&gt;Airlines are worried those busier C-band airwaves will interfere with their equipment. In particular, they’re worried about radar altimeters — a device that bounces radio waves off the ground to give extremely precise altitude readings. It’s a crucial device for landings, particularly in conditions with limited visibility, and relies on having an empty patch of spectrum to work in. Faulty altimeter readings can also trigger automated responses from autopilot systems, as in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Airlines_Flight_1951"&gt;a 2009 Turkish Airlines crash&lt;/a&gt; that left nine dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KawXA9"&gt;As a result, the entire industry is deeply uncomfortable with anything that might interfere with altimeters. As an airline pilot’s association put it &lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10531182083849/ALPA%20Comments%2017-183%2018-122.pdf"&gt;in a 2018 filing to the FCC&lt;/a&gt;, “the public interest would not be served if tens of thousands of existing aircraft worldwide were inadvertently no longer provided the safety protection enabled by radio altimetry equipment due to interference from adjacent bands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ROUPWl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But they’ve tested this, right? Does it actually cause problems?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="wxLLKc"&gt;This is the 65-billion-dollar question! As one tech trade group is &lt;a href="https://www.5gandaviation.com/"&gt;fond of pointing out&lt;/a&gt;, this spectrum has already been rolled out in 40 different countries without any resulting altimeter failures, although some of those countries are operating it at lower power levels. But the FCC has spent three years going back and forth with various airline groups on this question, and a lot of them are still worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MRw5TF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s not clear how many faulty altimeters are out there or how they’ll respond to a flood of 5G traffic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7sev5I"&gt;The FCC has a number of measures in place to prevent interference. There’s a full 220 MHz of clearance between the spectrum used by the radio altimeters (which starts at 4.2GHz) and the new 5G spectrum (which ends at 3980MHz). The FCC even carved an extra 20MHz from the 5G holdings when this issue was raised in 2018 to give aircraft extra space. There are also several restrictions on how 5G towers should be configured near airports to avoid flooding the airwaves in areas where planes are landing. In a modern plane with a modern radar altimeter, it should be easy to avoid interference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZveuk"&gt;The problem is, not every aircraft has a modern radar altimeter. Both sides acknowledge that at least some altimeters are affected by signals from outside the intended spectrum bands. To be clear, this is a malfunction — but it’s a malfunction that wouldn’t have been relevant before C-band came online. As things stand now, it’s not clear how many faulty altimeters are out there or how they’ll respond to a flood of 5G traffic. And because even a single interference-related crash would be tragic, it’s hard for airlines to feel secure about the rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNOZuy"&gt;For the FCC and wireless industry, the ideal solution would be for the FAA to launch some kind of industry-wide effort to find and replace faulty altimeters. In fact, they would have liked it to launch in 2019, when the rulemaking for the spectrum first began. But that didn’t happen, and it’s unlikely to happen in the next two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="sR7WOS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why don’t carriers give airlines more time to test their equipment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ttkajB"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are coming up against a deadline of their own. 5G-capable phones have been available in the US for two years now, and carriers are expecting a flood of new customers as holiday devices come online. Both networks have some 5G capacity already in place, but without the C-band spectrum, their networks are increasingly stretched thin. In February, AT&amp;amp;T plans to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/offers/network/3g-network-sunset/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shut down its 3G network entirely&lt;/a&gt; as part of the transition to 5G. All that traffic has to go somewhere — and without new spectrum, the result will be spotty, inconsistent service. At the same time, T-Mobile is skating by without any of these problems and has been aggressively marketing its 5G network to draw away customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdvCdf"&gt;Another two weeks isn’t too big of a deal for the carriers, which is part of why they were so eager to accept the deal, but further delays could start to do serious damage to their business plans. With each passing month, the drag on the network gets a little more severe, and the damage from a $65 billion dead asset gets a little harder for shareholders to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlByj9"&gt;“The thing the carriers were really worried about was, how long is this going to go on?” Feld says. “You have this combination of surging demand and concern that you won’t ever be able to use the spectrum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="4OymzH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what happens now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="5rq6zO"&gt;One way or another, AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are planning to switch on their networks on January 19th, and the airlines and pilots will be on high alert for the first sign of any interference. The FAA has promised to use the extra two weeks to craft &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/continued_operation/ad/alt_moc/"&gt;an airworthiness directive&lt;/a&gt; for any planes that might be affected, which will stave off the most severe shutdowns or delays. Given the tight timeframe and mounting pressure, it’s very likely the best the agency can do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="elxW5Y"&gt;But for observers like Feld, the most frustrating thing is how much time agencies have already wasted without addressing the issue. “This shouldn’t have been a problem. Since the FCC started this rulemaking in 2019, we’ve known this was coming. The steps that are necessary to address this are fairly straightforward,” he told me. “It’s unfathomable.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm is working with Microsoft on custom chips for next-gen AR glasses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8wNurw6tJAMWXxYoP9LGQ2snobI=/306x0:2124x1212/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347360/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_2.16.47_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1641324104.279400"&gt;Qualcomm and Microsoft are partnering to develop a new, customized Snapdragon augmented reality chip that’ll power future AR glasses within Microsoft’s ecosystems. The new partnership was announced at Qualcomm’s CES 2022 keynote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuUMHN"&gt;“We’re announcing that we’re developing a custom augmented reality Snapdragon chip for next-generation, power-efficient, very lightweight AR glasses for the Microsoft ecosystem,” said Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon. “And we’re integrating into that chip platform software from both companies: the Microsoft Mesh platform, and the recently announced Qualcomm Snapdragon Spaces XR development platform. Snapdragon Spaces will be fully integrated into Microsoft Mesh, and this platform will be available for next-generation lightweight glasses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlGkl8"&gt;The partnership isn’t too surprising: Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 850 chip already powers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18235460/microsoft-hololens-2-price-specs-mixed-reality-ar-vr-business-work-features-mwc-2019"&gt;Microsoft’s HoloLens 2 headset&lt;/a&gt; from 2019. And Qualcomm has only increased its focus and its development of more specifically AR and VR focused chips in recent years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21147912/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-vr-ar-xr-platform-reference-design-announcement"&gt;including the Snapdragon XR2&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785469/meta-oculus-quest-2-10-million-units-sold-qualcomm-xr2"&gt;powers the Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft and Qualcomm have also worked together on bespoke chips in the past, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Surface Pro X’s&lt;/a&gt; customized SQ1 and SQ2 processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Cs8iog"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Spaces try to make it easier to get apps ready for augmented reality","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771850/qualcomm-ar-sdk-snapdragon-spaces-mixed-reality-metaverse"},{"title":"Microsoft Mesh feels like the virtual future of Microsoft Teams meetings","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22308883/microsoft-mesh-virtual-reality-augmented-reality-hololens-vr-headsets-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hmpbwe"&gt;The inclusion of support for both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22308883/microsoft-mesh-virtual-reality-augmented-reality-hololens-vr-headsets-features"&gt;Microsoft Mesh&lt;/a&gt; and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Spaces XR platform is particularly notable, too. Both platforms offer interesting mixed reality use cases that span multiple devices. Mesh already has a cross-platform VR / AR system for connecting between virtual reality headsets, tablets, smartphones, and PCs, while Spaces aims to specifically integrate Qualcomm-powered smartphones as a “second screen” for mixed reality experiences. And given that Qualcomm specifically highlighted the upcoming chip collaboration as focusing on ultra-light augmented reality glasses, it seems clear that the two companies have big ambitions for integrating future projects into a broader, connected digital world. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OPI announces Xbox-inspired nail polish that unlocks in-game content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RtZHPhiBEmO4cQ1iNrYUebUOxIU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347332/OPI_xbox_Hero_Image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The line consists of 12 colors with cheesy gaming-inspired names.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xbox/OPI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="irA3HC"&gt;OPI and Xbox are &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2022/01/04/xbox-opi-nail-polish-collection-spring-2022/"&gt;collaborating on a new lineup of gaming-inspired nail polishes&lt;/a&gt; that also unlock in-game content for &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;. The vibrant line of 12 nail polish colors is available today in the US at Ulta Beauty. Purchasing colors in the line qualifies for redeemable codes to unlock an exclusive Ford GT livery in &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; as well as an armor coating in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Azl6cm"&gt;The OPI x Xbox collection colors have some unique names, ranging from lighthearted and fun to full-on gamer cringe: Quest for Quartz (rose quartz), Pixel Dust (shimmery mauve pink), Racing for Pinks (crème rose), Suzi is My Avatar (pink-nude), Trading Paint (crème apricot), Heart and Con-soul (crimson), The Pass is Always Greener (pastel green), Sage Simulation (sage green), You Had Me at Halo (shimmery blue and actually clever), Can’t CTRL Me (robin egg blue), Achievement Unlocked (what?), and NOOberry (please stop). They are offered in three different formulas: GelColor, Infinite Shine, and Nail Lacquer. Prices range from $10.50 to $13 each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKBtXY"&gt;The polishes are at first exclusive in the USA to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-nail-lacquer-collection-pimprod2030261&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22866727%2Fxbox-opi-halo-infinite-forza-horizon-5-nail-polish-dlc-news-announcement" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ulta Beauty&lt;/a&gt;, with global availability at more retailers opening up on February 1st — at which point the redeemable in-game content for &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Forza Horizon 5 &lt;/em&gt;goes live&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://terms.snipp.com/Microsoft%20Activation%202005791/Microsoft%20Xbox%20OPI%20US%20-%20Ulta%20Promotions%20T&amp;amp;C's.pdf"&gt;OPI’s terms and conditions&lt;/a&gt; indicate that you have to buy $20 or more of qualifying products to earn the Forza Horizon 5 paint job, and customers have until March 31st to &lt;a href="https://ulta.opixboxrewards.com/"&gt;submit and claim the promo on the entry page&lt;/a&gt;. It is not yet clear how the downloadable coating for &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;can be redeemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qDQXVw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10961225"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zfJTNu"&gt;This collaboration is one of many &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;cross-marketing tie-ins, where buying toys and collectibles like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22820219/guilty-pleasures-ice-halo-dyson-sims"&gt;NERF gun&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HALO-Legends-Master-Spartan-Collection/dp/B085QM1NJX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Master Chief figure&lt;/a&gt; comes with a redeemable code for weapon or armor coatings. Much like the popular &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NERF-NER-Halo-MA40/dp/B08486XL7R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NERF Halo MA40 Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, the best color of the bunch — You Had Me At Halo — is already &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-nail-lacquer-collection-pimprod2030261&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22866727%2Fxbox-opi-halo-infinite-forza-horizon-5-nail-polish-dlc-news-announcement" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sold out at Ulta&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone else considering painting their nails just because that shimmery Spartan armor looks so sick?&lt;/p&gt;
