    <title>Mozilla, Reddit, and Vimeo urge FCC to bring back net neutrality</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ma7LWf"&gt;Tech companies like Mozilla, Reddit, and Vimeo called on the Federal Communications Commission Friday to reinstate the net neutrality rules repealed by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RodApk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382776/Letter_to_the_FCC_to_reinstate_net_neutrality__March_2021.pdf"&gt;In a letter to FCC Acting Chair&lt;/a&gt; Jessica Rosenworcel on Friday, internet companies Dropbox, Eventbrite, Reddit, Wikimedia, and Vimeo joined onto a letter led by Mozilla urging the agency to immediately bring back net neutrality once a third Democrat to the commission, nominated by President Joe Biden, is confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FAthaB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The FCC can help protect families and businesses across the country”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MKxfKi"&gt;“By using its authority to restore net neutrality at the federal level, the FCC can help protect families and businesses across the country that rely on high-speed broadband access and help spark our recovery,” the companies wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ld1W2a"&gt;Net neutrality is the idea that internet service providers, like AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon, should treat all internet traffic equally, codified by specific regulations against blocking, throttling, or prioritizing any specific content or traffic. The FCC first implemented net neutrality during the Obama administration, classifying ISPs as “common carriers” under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, but in 2017, that order was reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2Z0Bx"&gt;With Democrats in control of Congress and the White House, net neutrality advocates are optimistic that their long-fought internet rules will return. “While there are many challenges that need to be resolved to fix the internet, reinstating net neutrality is a crucial down payment on the much broader internet reform that we need,” the companies wrote in their Friday letter to Rosenworcel. “There is no reason to further delay its reinstatement once the FCC is in working order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YuPQa"&gt;Even if the FCC does’t move to reinstate net neutrality on its own, lawmakers are considering their own legislative remedies. Earlier this year, Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) announced that he would be introducing a measure to bring back net neutrality in the upcoming “weeks.” Markey’s previous efforts to codify the rules into law failed, but he could see some success now that Democrats control the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9JJKe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxIhYQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: The Snyder Cut, Samsung Unpacked 2021, and this week in EVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CP-vrhN072gCxPT0sKSdWEJj6mo=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68993607/Image_from_iOS__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League on 12.9” iPad Pro | Dan Seifert&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F9FUQa"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where we discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering our biggest stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3I1qU5"&gt;This week, co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn chat with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; reporter Julia Alexander about the long-awaited release of the Zack Snyder version of &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt; on HBO Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337756/snyder-cut-aspect-ratio-justice-league-hbo-max-warning"&gt;Why is the aspect ratio 4:3&lt;/a&gt;? Julia also explains what’s in store for the next phase for streaming services — like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325831/netflix-password-sharing-test-feature-piracy-security-streaming-video"&gt;password sharing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327217/hbo-max-ad-supported-tier-launch-date-international-price-subscriber-growth"&gt;advertisements&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334540/youtube-shorts-us-beta-tiktok-competition-launch"&gt;competition for TikTok&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibj62m"&gt;In the second half of the show, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior reporter Andrew Hawkins joins in to represent the transportation section of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Andy discusses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22334634/schumer-electric-vehicle-swap-discount-infrastructure-interview"&gt;interviewing Sen. Chuck Schumer &lt;/a&gt;about a new bill in Congress focused on infrastructure and electric vehicles; the various EVs being announced by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331130/kia-ev6-full-images-revealed-design-announcement-date"&gt;Kia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324096/canoo-goev-ev-pickup-truck-specs-photos-revealed"&gt;Canoo&lt;/a&gt;, and others; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295115/ebike-tax-credit-congress-bill-blumenauer"&gt;state of e-bikes in America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhjGuY"&gt;And of course the show was able to fit in some gadget talk, too. The show dedicates some time to discuss &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;Apple discontinuing the HomePod&lt;/a&gt; and what the future of Apple’s smart speaker business looks like with the HomePod mini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfJmda"&gt;Also, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGqvQDtEz-0"&gt;Samsung Unpacked 2021&lt;/a&gt; was this week, with the announcement of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22334392/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-a72-specs-price-camera"&gt;new midrange Samsung phones&lt;/a&gt; with faster refresh rates, expandable storage, and stabilized cameras. Nilay and Dieter discuss what role “flagship” phones play when the midrange phones are getting more sophisticated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQTiSN"&gt;You can listen to the full discussion here or in your preferred podcast player. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The EPA’s website makes climate change a priority again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vice President Harris Swears In Michael Regan As EPA Administrator" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gGgIJ5wG1VbW6BC4z2I7rcJJFfY=/0x0:5500x3667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68993521/1231772853.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 17: Michael Regan is sworn in as EPA Administrator.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RucpQi"&gt;After a four-year hiatus during the Donald Trump administration, the climate change webpage is back up on the Environmental Protection Agency website. Not only is climate change a “priority” once again at the agency, but information about how it affects Americans’ lives is now more accessible, inclusive, and interactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oOcck0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Climate facts are back on EPA’s website where they should be.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="43YOcv"&gt;“Climate facts are back on EPA’s website where they should be,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-reboots-climate-change-website"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oJwbG"&gt;Information about climate change was drastically pared down on federal websites under former president Trump, who also falsely called climate change a “hoax.” The restored webpage is an important source of vetted information for the public, which is especially crucial considering the spread of misinformation about climate change online and on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288439/facebook-label-climate-change-posts-misinformation"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flnH30"&gt;Scientists, teachers, and environmental advocates celebrated the return of the EPA’s climate webpage. “We teach our children that it is important to understand science, to gather facts, to do good research,” Dominique Browning, co-founder and director of Moms Clean Air Force, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.momscleanairforce.org/press-releases/moms-clean-air-force-applauds-the-return-of-science-to-the-epa/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “So you can imagine how pleased Moms are that the agency charged with protecting human health from climate pollution is ​recommitting to understanding science, gathering facts, and doing good research.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBRxPt"&gt;The website has some new features that make it easier to digest climate information. It links to interactive maps and charts that visitors can click through to learn more about greenhouse gas emissions and how that planet-heating pollution affects the environment and people. The climate page is also now available in &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-change"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://espanol.epa.gov/el-cambio-climatico"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;. “There’s more content to come,” the website adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joK0vM"&gt;Regan has also placed environmental justice — the effort to end disparate effects of pollution and climate change on vulnerable communities — &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice"&gt;front and center&lt;/a&gt; on the EPA’s website. “We will put environmental justice where it belongs: at the heart of our plan to tackle climate change,” Regan said in a video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTqew7"&gt;That’s another dramatic turnaround from what took place during the Trump administration. Environmental justice efforts were sidelined at the time, according to former EPA staff who left while Trump was in office. One former staff member &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/science/21562765/joe-biden-climate-change-epa-scientists"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year that he was encouraged to remove the term “environmental justice” from briefing memos because it could “raise flags” for political leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="5HqE8y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Access to as much as 20 percent of the EPA’s website was lost &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MNCsae"&gt;The use of the term “climate change” fell by 40 percent across federal environmental agency websites during Trump’s term in office. And access to as much as 20 percent of the EPA’s website was lost during that time, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://envirodatagov.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Access-Denied-Report.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI). The mostly volunteer group of scientists, academics, and other supporters led a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22313763/scientists-climate-change-data-rescue-donald-trump"&gt;high-profile race&lt;/a&gt; to save climate data and other environmental information on government websites after Trump was elected. Recently, the group has also recommended policies that would limit any future president’s ability to dismantle federal science websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Av8j97"&gt;“Federal government: This was paid for by taxpayer dollars. You don’t really have the right to delete or remove it,” Sara Wylie, an associate professor at Northeastern University and a cofounder of EDGI, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22313763/scientists-climate-change-data-rescue-donald-trump"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OtterBox’s Mobile Gaming Clip is clever but clumsy</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;At $30, it’s still hard to recommend&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="jUZvzD"&gt;OtterBox, the company best known for its ruggedized cases, has developed a $30 clip that can attach your phone to an Xbox controller for playing games. Called the Mobile Gaming Clip, it’s part of a growing trend of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;accessories for playing cloud-based console games&lt;/a&gt; right on your phone. What makes OtterBox’s clip different is it can also work as a phone stand, separate from the controller — although the phone stand feature isn’t quite as robust as what I was hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tnOfy"&gt;OtterBox’s clip is designed specifically for Xbox controllers, and it works with controllers made for the Xbox One, Series X / S, or the Elite Series 2 controller. There’s also a little cutout for the charging port, meaning if you need to connect your Xbox controller to a USB cable, you will not need to remove the clip from the controller. You can also detach the arm from the clip itself and use it as a stand to prop up your smartphone for tabletop gaming, watching movies, or video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W82TUH"&gt;With Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22283739/microsoft-xcloud-web-screenshots-cloud-gaming-streaming-browser-features"&gt;rolling out xCloud&lt;/a&gt;, it’s partnering with multiple manufacturers to make a variety of mobile gaming accessory companies, including OtterBox, Razer’s Kishi, and 8BitDo’s SN30 Pro for Android, provide different experiences. Microsoft is aiming to ensure there is a big ecosystem of gaming peripherals once its cloud gaming service becomes more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The two-piece design makes it easy for playing on a controller or using the product for tabletop gaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setup for the Mobile Gaming Clip is simple and easy to do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TGRcxo"&gt;Setup for the OtterBox Mobile Gaming Clip is straightforward: connect your Xbox controller to your phone, attach the clip to your controller, mount the phone, and start playing. It does require more force than other gaming clips to attach it to the controller. Once you have it properly installed, the clip tightly clasps across the controller, so you don’t have to worry about it getting loose and falling off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFqau9"&gt;Some mobile gaming clips, like PowerA’s MOGA Mobile Gaming Clip, tend to feel unbalanced, particularly with a big or heavy phone or a phone with a bulkier case. OtterBox’s Mobile Gaming Clip has a better distribution of weight, which made the controller feel a bit more balanced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYYaIL"&gt;One reason for that is OtterBox’s Mobile Gaming Clip has a “rapid adjust feature,” which means you can adjust the angle of your phone when using the clip. The clip’s arm can extend a bit, allowing you to experiment with the angles you prefer. There’s also a latch located on the arm of the Mobile Gaming Clip that allows you to lock it in place so it doesn’t shift around while in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Nj5vhn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I had some issues when I tried to mount my phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qof3sJ"&gt;There are three claws to keep your phone in place. The bottom claw extends, allowing bigger phones to fit into the accessory by extending a few centimeters. This makes it easy to fit bigger phones into the gaming clip. The claws don’t block me from reaching the volume or power buttons on my iPhone XR, though it is a bit cumbersome to have to unlock my phone while using the mount because it’s sideways in the mount. The design also makes it easy to use a pair of wired earbuds or connect a charger to charge my phone while I continue gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bWB9e14lPbXj4ZDtjh45ynsYn3o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22378279/tlyles_210312_4360_0034.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I had to remove a case I was using that had a PopSocket attached in order to securely get my phone in place. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ENiFmQ"&gt;I did have some issues when I tried to mount my phone; the phone case I use primarily has a PopSocket attached in the center, and it added too much thickness and made my phone less secure in the clip, even popping out when I moved the clip even slightly. I ended up having to remove the case from my phone every time I wanted to use the clip. If you don’t have an accessory like a PopSocket on your phone, the clip should work with almost any standard case.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNNTJ5"&gt;The most interesting feature for OtterBox’s Mobile Gaming Clip is tabletop mode. You can switch from the controller to tabletop mode by detaching the arm to the clip portion of the accessory, allowing you to use the gaming clip as a viewing stand for gaming or even watching movies and TV shows. The tabletop feature is an ambitious idea, but it ends up being more of a kickstand than an actual stand. You have limited ability to adjust the angle of the phone in this mode, and you can’t raise the phone up off the table in any way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWLRxd"&gt;Yet, the option for a tabletop mode does address one of the biggest problems with mobile gaming clips: hand fatigue from the weight of a controller, phone, and clip combined. OtterBox helps solve this problem by allowing you the ability to take a break from the gaming clip but still giving you that freedom to continue gaming on your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ufvHwxSDXUKZFA5xzq0NYOiatec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22378285/tlyles_210312_4360_0046.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tabletop mode is a great idea that can reduce hand fatigue, but the feature feels mostly like an afterthought. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2Vuf8U"&gt;In the last few years, the cloud and mobile gaming market has become a more exciting space in the industry, with successful free-to-play titles like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Mobile&lt;/em&gt; and Microsoft truly beginning its push into cloud gaming. As cloud gaming continues to grow,  there’s likely going to be a big expansion in the availability and variety of gaming clips like this one. This means if you do not like the current options available on the market, there is a high probability that similar products will be released in the coming months and years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tpES6"&gt;OtterBox’s Mobile Gaming Clip is not the perfect mobile gaming accessory, but it is one of the better mobile gaming accessories available now. It allows me the option to use a controller I own and not one designed for a specific product (aside from the fact that it has to be an Xbox controller). It’s also a bit more flexible in how to use it when compared to other mobile gaming accessories such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;Razer Kishi&lt;/a&gt;, which encloses your phone in a pair of controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2F70T6"&gt;At $30, OtterBox’s clip is less expensive than those solutions, but there are still &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Moga-Mobile-Gaming-Wireless-Controllers/dp/B081C7TLVS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cheaper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Compatible-OIVO-Upgraded-Adjustable/dp/B08R8HV2RL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; if you want to clip your phone to an existing controller. I like how the clip does not feel unbalanced when attached to the controller, and the tabletop mode is interesting. But it ends up feeling like more of an afterthought because of how limited the clip ends up being when used on a table. Yet, the things OtterBox’s Mobile Gaming Clip does right are enough to justify the $5 to $10 price premium compared to other options available on the market. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Inside the massive fandom making Dream SMP YouTube’s biggest hit&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="SlqBt7"&gt;Ollie was asleep at three in the morning when the Discord app on his phone started blowing up. He panicked; many of his friends lived in different time zones, but they knew how late it was for him. The only reason they’d be frantically messaging him in the middle of the night is if something terrible happened. Bolting awake, he checked his messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTa41R"&gt;“OLLIE, DREAM JUST GAVE YOU A SHOUTOUT ON TWITTER!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBXFkZ"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;DREAM SHOUTED YOU OUT!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ugEkJ"&gt;A high school student and artist, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vnzndt"&gt;Ollie&lt;/a&gt; spends much of his free time making fan art about his favorite &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;streamers. In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vnzndt/status/1371667657926189061"&gt;one illustration&lt;/a&gt;, he shows his favorite creator, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DreamTraps"&gt;Dream&lt;/a&gt;, with a green-and-black hoodie, black nail polish on his fingers, and messy black hair — something Ollie had to invent since &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82kJDVvtgok"&gt;no one has ever seen Dream’s face&lt;/a&gt;. Dream, arguably the main character in his &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;universe, known as Dream SMP, has more than 2.7 million followers on Twitter and nearly 20 million subscribers on YouTube. So when Ollie saw Dream tell his followers to check out the art on his account, Ollie burst into tears. His own Twitter account went from around 8,000 followers to more than 13,000 followers in one night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wI9X82"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In that moment, I felt so valued in the community.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzD772"&gt;“In that moment, I felt so valued in the community,” Ollie told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;over Discord. “Not because of the numbers that were coming through with the shoutout, but because of how many people I realized were around me, supporting me, and being such amazing friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9xtGg"&gt;Describing the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/minecraft-dream-smp-political-drama/"&gt;story of Dream SMP&lt;/a&gt; to anyone not paying attention to every stream or YouTube upload can sound like a made-up language. Dream SMP (SMP stands for “survival multiplayer,” a type of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;server) was&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;created by a YouTuber who goes by Dream. Over the last 18 months, Dream has invited other Twitch streamers and YouTube personalities — including TommyInnit, Tubbo, GeorgeNotFound, Punz, and several more — to join in. Together, they get into hijinxes, stage lengthy feuds, and pal around for a combined audience of tens of millions of people. Dream went from 1 million to 15 million subscribers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Dream/status/1344315641298366464"&gt;in one year alone&lt;/a&gt;. Some of it is scripted and planned out, driving a larger story, but many of the reactions and circumstances are totally improvised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2nXIfc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;On the Dream SMP, there’s always something big brewing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5R5uGG"&gt;Like a television show or cinematic universe, Dream SMP found its audience through a series of never-ending epic battles. The “Disc Saga” played &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWPvdw7bOak&amp;amp;list=PL90zg3iCjs9LGwQ4DGNL2lfuPKIul4ApO"&gt;out over countless hours&lt;/a&gt;, turning a game of capture the flag (essentially) into a dramatic tale of good versus evil, as Dream and TommyInnit fought for dominance of the server. Once Wilbur Soot, a 24-year-old YouTuber from Britain and one of the main Dream SMP writers, joined in, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYTqgKWCuF0"&gt;he set up L’Manberg&lt;/a&gt; and created a space for a specific batch of creators. This eventually led to an all-out battle for independence with Dream that enraptured YouTube’s &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;audience. On the Dream SMP, there’s always something big brewing, but it’s also the tiny, funny, and sweet moments that transform each streamer into a character worth rooting for — not unlike comic book heroes and villains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLVUnP"&gt;The only thing more impressive than the elaborate world they’ve created is the fan base that’s sprung up around it. Dream SMP fanfiction writers dominate websites like Archive of Our Own, Dream SMP fan art can be found all over Tumblr and Twitter, and Dream SMP fan songs (including an entire in-the-works musical) get uploaded to YouTube. There is also a plethora of clip accounts that track Dream SMP stories for people who can’t tune in to each stream, full-blown fan-made animated episodes paying tribute to Dream SMP’s ongoing stories that air weekly on YouTube, and even a 24/7 news network devoted to tracking the universe’s story and hijinks. Dream SMP may exist on a tiny &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;server, but thanks to a fan network stretching across the globe, it’s become a worldwide phenomenon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="HyFFHG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QSoJshduVNo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="eniGpc"&gt;Being a member of the Dream SMP community can sometimes feel like a full-time job. For Evan, it’s practically become one. At 16, he juggles attending school and working on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA1mxOwASgWGYkvxN20-MBw"&gt;documentary-style videos for his channel&lt;/a&gt;, he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Each video is designed to provide an entertaining and accurate summary of the various lore that comes out of Dream SMP storylines, and a growing audience tunes in. Evan has nearly 400,000 subscribers, and his Dream SMP videos collect millions of views. Those videos can take Evan more than a month to complete; his last video took more than 120 hours alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mEXoCK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Homework is essentially keeping me from working”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HpLVyO"&gt;“I’m trying to balance videos and homework right now, but it’s weird because I find myself having to work on homework even when the videos make me significantly more money,” Evan told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on a phone call one night. “Obviously, I’m not making anything from school — I wish we got paid to go to school — but it’s like homework is essentially keeping me from working.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1owFkz"&gt;Since the Dream SMP lore is constantly growing, a big part of Evan’s job is trying to piece it all together for newcomers who find his videos, hoping to catch up. In one video, Evan tries to keep track of each time Tommy and Dream stole discs (think CD-ROMs with music on them) from each other and hid said discs far within the block earth that makes up a &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;server. Evan makes it easy to follow, hitting just the right dramatic notes as the story progresses, but he says the work can be exhausting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzLQB7"&gt;As Evan describes it, trying to summarize Dream SMP plots in the simplest way possible is like “trying to explain a movie to someone who’s never seen a movie before.” Evan has also run into newfound challenges that make the job harder. When the Dream SMP creators started streaming more on Twitch, it became more difficult to track down videos to watch after the fact. He, too, has to rely on WikiGuides from devoted fans and popular clips on Reddit to figure out what video he should focus on next.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7R4WaaZNXGAIUYvhzcOcmLBQNTQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380650/ollie_dream.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of Ollie’s depictions of Dream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kbiaor"&gt;“The toughest parts to understand are what’s happening now,” Evan said. “Now, there will be points where there will be multiple streams happening at the exact same time, and both of them have really important stuff being added to the main story.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5K8zs"&gt;With the Dream SMP creators posting fewer YouTube videos and documentarians like Evan taking additional time to get the videos just right, a need has developed for daily updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwLCpV"&gt;Sam, Claire, Kenzie, Mae, Alex, Lilja, and Boston make up a group of mostly teens who run &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/smpupdate"&gt;DreamSMP Updates&lt;/a&gt;, a Twitter account dedicated to updating fans on “who’s live, who’s on each other’s streams, when the members release something, an explanation on the storyline for when people miss live streams,” and more. Basically, it’s a one-stop shop for anyone looking to find up-to-the-minute information about their favorite streamers or check in on the big things that happened on stream if they weren’t able to watch. Sam started it in December, asking friends she met through the community to help out with the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0FOlVo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have a lot of responsibility”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bb6xBM"&gt;The group told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;over a Discord chat that it takes some coordination, but they’ve gotten to the point over the last several months where everyone knows what their role is within the team. It’s a huge responsibility, one that every member takes on without asking for any kind of payment in return. People expect everything to be right 100 percent of the time, Claire said, adding, “We have a lot of responsibility to be the person that people need.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZHd2Q"&gt;Work is divided into sections (often grouped by platforms), and those can change day to day, Alex said. Someone handles keeping up with YouTube uploads, merchandise updates from each creator, ensuring the Twitch bot doesn’t flail when streamers go live, keeping fans updated with creator appearances in separate streamers, etc. Claire and Boston mostly handle tweeting explanations of what happened on the stream and how it pertains to ongoing lore. (“Puffy says she does believe Dream is wrong, that its good he’s in Prison, that he deserves the punishment,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/smpupdate/status/1371324394174222337"&gt;one recent update reads&lt;/a&gt;.) Boston keeps an eye on what’s happening, tweeting updates when needed, while also jotting down live notes about every new lore development. It’s a complicated operation — one the team does because of their love for Dream SMP creators and the community in which they found one another as friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYSZa3"&gt;“One of my favorite things to do on the account is look at DMs and talk to people in DMs,” Kenzie said. “When I see people thanking us for the account, it makes me feel good that I’m helping people out and doing something for the community. That’s probably what motivates me to continue running the account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="CYf4xg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bh4E1VB0iS4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="aV6o0m"&gt;Even after the &lt;a href="https://dreamteam.fandom.com/wiki/Category:SMP_members"&gt;30 or so Dream SMP members&lt;/a&gt; have signed off, fans keep expanding its world. Archive of Our Own, one of the biggest fanfiction sites, is home to &lt;a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Video%20Blogging%20RPF/works"&gt;nearly 106,000 works&lt;/a&gt; listed under Video Blogging RPF (fanfiction about real streamers and vloggers). The biggest fandom under that umbrella is &lt;em&gt;Minecraft. &lt;/em&gt;Wattpad has just under 34,000 works listed under “Dream SMP,” and Tumblr is full of many more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HTnwM"&gt;At one point, fans of the saga “Heat Waves,” one of the most viral Dream SMP fan stories, thought they crashed Archive of Our Own when rushing to read a new chapter. The site’s downtime was just a coincidence, but “Heat Waves” at the time was the “third most kudosed fic on the site,” an administrator told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Adi Robertson. (Kudos are equivalent to a like on Facebook.) The story became so popular that the Glass Animals song “Heat Waves,” which inspired the name of the story, crept into the Hottest 100 tracks in Australia last year, &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/musicnews/hottest-100-win-glass-animals-heat-waves-feature-minecraft-fic/13086032"&gt;partially thanks to the fanfiction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kSMHoJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Dream SMP narrative isn’t fan service; it’s “collaborative storytelling”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OhPpCr"&gt;What’s helped to propel that community is the way Dream SMP has incorporated it into the stories that actually play out on their server. During one arc, fans started using the phrase “welcome home, Theseus” in their art, essays, and songs, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJPvgIMqPYo"&gt;comparing Tommy to the Greek hero&lt;/a&gt; who was exiled. Eventually, the Dream SMP streamer Technoblade actually used the line. “I screamed so loudly I probably did permanent damage to the hearing of the brother sitting next to me,” as one fan, who goes by Teahound, &lt;a href="https://tea-with-veth.tumblr.com/post/637703569706008576/so-technoblade-said-welcome-home-theseus-and-i"&gt;wrote on Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rO5i12"&gt;“I decided to write about how the Dream SMP is a brilliant example of how to do fan service properly,” Teahound continued. “But actually, what is happening on the SMP cannot be described as fanservice. It’s collaborative storytelling in it’s best form.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBhRvu"&gt;The community wouldn’t continue to thrive if there wasn’t a plethora of fans celebrating and boosting people’s work.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Usually, big fandoms are kind of toxic in some aspects. But this community genuinely respects the content creators, and we all genuinely support each other,” Ali Tyler, a college student who has helped create an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjx0jDUp8lkhS7-Y0PZDwCw"&gt;entire musical based on the Dream SMP&lt;/a&gt;, said in a phone interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NE5zfu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When people do listen and are respectful, the community is at its best.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oOcNHB"&gt;Fan creations are mostly positive, but there are more controversial sectors where critics argue a line is crossed. Because the streamers are real people, the stories have faced criticism for sexual depictions of everyday people. “Heat Waves” focuses on Dream and GeorgeNotFound, two prominent members of the Dream SMP world, as they dance around their feelings for each other. In real life, they’re just good friends. But in fanfiction, they often become much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaCRym"&gt;The majority of writers contributing to the Dream SMP fanfiction community “hate to see real people’s boundaries being crossed as well,” says Xetera, who writes real-person fiction within the Dream SMP universe. Newer writers “tend to ask for forgiveness rather than permission,” and that’s something the community tries to push back against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Vxy5J"&gt;“I believe people fight over boundaries more than trying to listen when creators speak,” Xetera said over Discord, noting that “when people do listen and are respectful, the community is at its best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pT688e"&gt;At the center of all of these stories — the artists, writers, YouTube editors, and musical producers — is the community. Beyond the creators they watch, it’s the friends they make, feeling like they’re a part of this rapidly expanding and immersive moment in internet culture. It’s a world all their own, and they want to contribute their little section to the overarching narrative in any way that they can. For Ollie, the first artist that Dream ever gave a shoutout to on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Dream__Fanart/status/1347874095485104129"&gt;from his dedicated Dream fan art account&lt;/a&gt; and who wants to pay it forward by giving new artists their chance in the spotlight, that’s everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Dh21T6"&gt;“If it weren’t for the community that we’ve built, the Dream SMP wouldn’t have the same charm that it does,” Ollie said. “And I think the creators know that, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xE558s"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKEg89"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Nintendo World is sensory overload</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gk9-ZHEWWrdV6tUM25CZmzRBXT8=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68993147/DSCF7612.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Nintendo’s theme park is finally open&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ptHksz"&gt;After years of development and delays, Super Nintendo World finally opened this week at Universal Studios Japan (USJ) in Osaka. The themed area of the park is Nintendo’s biggest swing yet to leverage its most iconic characters beyond their traditional home of video game consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hPubT"&gt;The idea sounds strong on paper. USJ is one of the biggest tourist attractions in Asia, and Universal has experience in the field, having launched the conceptually similar Wizarding World of Harry Potter themed areas at three of its parks, including Osaka. What could go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEHg4X"&gt;Well, a global coronavirus pandemic, for one thing. The park is launching under less than ideal circumstances; it was originally planned to open ahead of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, which were also delayed to this year. And even in more normal times, this would be new ground for Nintendo. Its game design credentials are unimpeachable, but in many ways it’s quite a conservative company, and theme park attractions are not exactly in its wheelhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2oGAJG"&gt;With that in mind, I headed down to Osaka for the opening day to see exactly how Nintendo and USJ would pull this off. The short answer is that they’ve succeeded. Super Nintendo World is a gleefully surreal experience that pushes surprising technological boundaries. Once travel starts to open up again, it’s going to drive a huge number of visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4S4lg_yc_pb6e4l6F1hjLksdMKs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382123/DSCF7662.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="w4N1jo"&gt;Super Nintendo World follows the blueprint set by The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in that it’s housed within the larger theme park but feels entirely separate. Both areas are situated at the end of long entrance paths, and you generally can’t see the rest of the park when you’re inside. Still, a day out at Super Nintendo World starts out feeling like a regular day at USJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSdvsf"&gt;It’s fair to question the wisdom of opening a theme park at all right now, let alone a new area that’d inevitably boost visitor interest. With limits on entry imposed and the fact that USJ and Super Nintendo World are largely outdoors, though, I didn’t feel like this was unusually risky. While some nearby Asian nations have done better, Japan has been hit far less hard by the pandemic than most Western countries without enforcing strict lockdown restrictions. It goes without saying that everyone was wearing masks, though I was surprised to see a designated “mask-free zone” with some spaced-out benches by the waterfront.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CvgTfqoo95GNbR3iyl3DjDAckUw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382124/DSCF7596.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E3E7Wq"&gt;Entry to Super Nintendo World is theoretically covered by a regular USJ one-day ticket, which costs 7,800 yen (about $70) on weekdays or 8,400 yen (about $75) on weekends. I say “theoretically” because once you’re inside, you’ll need to use the USJ app to secure yourself timed entry to Super Nintendo World, and space is extremely limited. If you don’t get one, you’ll have to hope you get lucky with a standby lottery for spaces that didn’t end up getting taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P87RWE"&gt;It is possible to guarantee entry with some of the express tickets that USJ sells online, which give you fast-pass access to a few rides as well as a scheduled time slot for Super Nintendo World, but they can end up more than doubling your total cost of entry. This is the route I went so as to avoid a wasted work trip from Tokyo, but it’s not going to be practical for most people who want to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMicwl"&gt;My Super Nintendo World slot was in the afternoon, so I killed time beforehand by exploring the rest of the park. As you’d expect, it’s also heavily decked out in Nintendo promotion. The gift stores are stacked with Mario and Luigi merchandise, and there’s a new cafe where you can get themed drinks and snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HoH-tHZJA2GhYo4ma2RuUjbqFXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382125/DSCF7593.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Ti0V4uUwXJDHFtaPNceD6CGp_8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382126/DSCF7594.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zvY68wJ5QQYS77ynaB858IK8QqA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382128/DSCF7595.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OBE-PfV_1NsI-uYYUbFo729tWTg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382129/DSCF7604.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0rCgt7"&gt;Super Nintendo World itself is located down a fairly nondescript path that you could easily miss if not for the green pipes and 1UP blocks along the way. It’s overshadowed by the Waterworld attraction, which doesn’t make for an auspicious start. At the end of the path, though, there’s a giant sign and pipe to walk through, and that’s when you’re really in the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Weere"&gt;The experience of stepping through the pipe and into Super Nintendo World is honestly amazing. The architecture is so complete, and your view of it so well-directed, that it really does feel like you stepped into another world. I love that the designers went for a blocky, 2D-esque style for much of the environment — it would have been easy to go with something more conventional given that there are now a lot of 3D Mario games, but this approach is much more evocative. Rather than attempt to replicate a particular Mario game, the mashed-up style just screams “Nintendo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6PijN"&gt;The first thing you’ll want to do inside Super Nintendo World is pick up a Power Up Band. It costs 3,200 yen (~$30) and you don’t strictly need it for most of the attractions, but the park experience is designed around it. The bands are available in six varieties featuring various Nintendo characters like Mario and Princess Peach. I went with Yoshi.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SPV4aGLrcWoKTSSBwDi_dgSlICQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382130/DSCF7667.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ng7Azi"&gt;The band is like a chunky smartwatch that snaps around your wrist with an adjustable metal clasp. You pair it to the Super Nintendo World section of the USJ app with a QR code printed on the back, and from there the watch and app will track your progress through the park. There are lots of stamps to collect for completing certain activities — often this involves interacting with the park itself directly, like by hitting a power-up block with the band to collect coins. High-score leaderboards are displayed in the app and on touchscreens around the park; your “team” is decided by the style of band you chose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVWbbu"&gt;I only got 18 out of 170 stamps in my admittedly fairly hurried time at Super Nintendo World, and the system is clearly designed to encourage repeat visits. For example, there are eight hidden 8-bit sprites that appear on the walls when you activate a switch, but the only one I found was Peach. There are also stamps and awards available based on your performance in the attractions, the most elaborate of which is Mario Kart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eI6Dwo5NyslfvEnQPbVa-j5hqFc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382122/DSCF7616.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NR0MMO"&gt;The Mario Kart ride is the most ambitious attraction I’ve ever seen at a theme park. It’s essentially an AR action game set on a go-kart track, where you’re drifting through the virtual course and firing virtual shells at virtual opponents — as the kart moves through the track in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14cYq1"&gt;The ride is located inside a re-creation of Bowser’s castle, with lots of well-crafted &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt; paraphernalia to look at as you line up. (The queue was fast-moving on my visit and took about half an hour in total, though I imagine wait times will be a lot longer when the park is at full capacity.) Inside you’re given a plastic Mario hat that fits onto your head with an adjustable disc, a little like a PlayStation VR headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcVBdH"&gt;Once you get to your kart, you have to attach a HoloLens-style wired visor to the helmet, which is how you see the AR imagery. The field of view is pretty good, but I found the ride quite disorientating at first. Almost immediately after the car takes off, it comes to a stop at a corner so that you can practice firing off turtle shells at various enemies flying around you. I thought the headset was glitching out at first since some of the enemies were disappearing from view; it took me a while to realize that they were supposed to be passing behind glowing objects that actually existed in real life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hrRbyxGqJcvPvGCZoeLNHUE9M08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382131/DSCF7621.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pXkgpTa-yVrOcUvdzrxJ71FdhnY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382132/DSCF7618.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3FzZ494Nes4ESD5jQUnhnCffm80=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382134/DSCF7623.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/343S_Z9syTindx13PpD6rlzBy7E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382135/DSCF7632.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tYyzCL"&gt;There’s just a lot going on with the Mario Kart ride. It doesn’t move very fast, but it feels like it does because the track is often completely simulated. The Rainbow Road section, for example, is incredibly visually intense. Throughout all this you have to drift on command by using the steering wheel while aiming turtle shells at your opponents with your head and firing them with buttons on the wheel, often as the car itself spins in different directions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amVn0u"&gt;It’s overwhelming but a whole lot of fun, and like the rest of the park it seems to be more rewarding if you try it multiple times. I know I’d get a better score the next time around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sXXgZ"&gt;It’s also designed to get better in the future, rather than some theme park attractions that soon find themselves technically obsolete. That’s why the headset has a modular design, for example. “It has to be modular because augmented reality isn’t going to last as long as most of our 15-20 year ride vehicle experiences,” Universal Creative director of technology Tom Geraghty said during a media roundtable this week. “We know that it’s going to advance and come into your home. So we have plans to iterate the tech to support the creative [vision] that we may change, so that it may be like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ssX2z"&gt;You can definitely see that the Mario Kart ride is pushing at the limits of what’s possible with technology. It’s not necessarily a sleek experience right out of the gate, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487714/mario-kart-vr-arcade-gp-hands-on-tokyo-japan"&gt;Bandai Namco’s spectacular &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the sheer ambition is impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qWd47eqILEieSAzbh5ONNigJGK0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382136/DSCF7629.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AWUmT4"&gt;“The technology was not ready for this,” says Universal Creative SVP Thierry Coup. “But one of the incredible things that Universal Parks &amp;amp; Resorts does, we look forward, and we see a technology that could allow us to deliver an experience, and we grab it and we develop it further and make it happen. There is a bit of calculated risk, but we really think that’s the only way for us to really stay on the cutting edge of the ultimate experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4LNlu"&gt;“We thought AR would be the perfect technology for this; you want to be able to go through some of the items in Mario Kart, you want to collect things, you want to see the characters fly. Certain things you can not do with stereo, 3D, or any other kind of projection. It had to be AR.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V59KAr"&gt;According to Coup, Shigeru Miyamoto, Nintendo’s talismanic designer and creator of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;, was deeply involved in the Mario Kart ride. “We are known for collaborating and partnering with the creators of all of these incredible stories that we’ve brought to life in our parks, but I think this relationship with Mr. Miyamoto and his team has been beyond anything we’ve done before,” he says. “He was involved from day one, and creatively had his hands on everything we’ve worked together on. I think we probably had the most fun out of any of our creations designing this project. Everyone was a Nintendo fan. And because Mr. Miyamoto loves to have fun when he creates, while it was challenging, this was the most fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcDi4Z"&gt;“At the very end of the project, Miyamoto-san shared that we had made his dreams come true,” adds Geraghty. “Which was just a lifetime high moment for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rVlcqoyuavGoy1xzsuasRAu_rK4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382137/DSCF7642.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7gRQT8sSLa-SkNgKf4BPDUHmVSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382139/DSCF7643.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Xzt9BP"&gt;The other ride in Super Nintendo World is Yoshi’s Adventure, which is very much on the other end of the ambition spectrum. It’s a slow-paced train ride that’s suitable for kids and gives you a good view of the park, but otherwise isn’t all that engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzB3Dz"&gt;While the &lt;em&gt;Yoshi&lt;/em&gt; series isn’t known for its challenge, the interactive elements of Yoshi’s Adventure are minimal at best. Basically, you have three colored egg buttons in front of you, and you press them when you see that egg along the track. I’d ride it again for the extra stamps, but there’s not much to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JmLe5W"&gt;Super Nintendo World also has a lot of gift shops with exclusive merchandise as well as food vendors with Mario-themed fare. Here is my Power Mushroom Pizza Bowl, which was pretty good:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WovYICikMD5WDd49zJWoGKLy2Wg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382140/DSCF7672.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DZ8dH1"&gt;One thing you won’t find on sale at Super Nintendo World — or at least I didn’t — is traditional Nintendo products like the Switch or its software. Part of that might be due to currently limited stock, but the official Nintendo stores in New York and the new one in Tokyo offer Switch games as well as the other merch. For now, at least, it seems the company wants Super Nintendo World to serve as an opportunity to showcase its IP on its own terms as opposed to as a vehicle for video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEkUNj"&gt;But if that’s the case, the scope of the park is actually quite limited at this point. It’s called Super Nintendo World, but almost everything in it is related to Mario one way or another. There’s speculation that it’ll expand to include &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/em&gt; at some point — the door below is hidden in plain sight — but even that’s a Mario-adjacent franchise. Anyone looking for references to &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; will be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2lUjG1JphVPegMmLvpWKyMMcuq4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382141/DSCF7652.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="L9I31l"&gt;Still, it feels like a minor miracle that Super Nintendo World exists at all, more than a year into the pandemic. What’s there right now is a great first start with obvious room to grow. Even though attractions like Mario Kart are hugely ambitious, it’s clear that improvements can and will be made to the park’s execution and scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="eyeXMj"&gt;Nintendo’s biggest achievement with Super Nintendo World is the way it gamifies the theme park experience. I love parks like Tokyo DisneySea, for example, but there’s not as much to do once you’ve been on all the rides. With Super Nintendo World, though, I already feel the need to go back. I’m hoping it won’t be too long before my Yoshi band gets another workout.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s high-end Galaxy Buds Pro are $30 off at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4gcPC8sOu5Fei4I70thzJVzrJ5U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68992996/bfarsace_210114_4372_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dYBQ3d"&gt;Woot is offering the first sizable discount on Samsung’s new Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds that were introduced a few months ago alongside the Galaxy S21 phones. Originally $200, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13140759?sid=VergeDeals031921&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-pro-wireless-earbuds-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;they’re $170&lt;/a&gt;, and you can choose between three colors: violet, silver, or black. Samsung makes a few sets of truly wireless earbuds that look similar, but these ones have the best sound quality the company has achieved yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGtuvt"&gt;Some other perks noted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Chris Welch’s review&lt;/a&gt; include a handy voice detection feature to automatically dim the music and switch from active noise canceling to ambient mode when you start talking so you can hear yourself. They also have IPX7 protection against water and sweat (they’re workout-friendly) and improved microphones for chatting on calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SSStjm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vg6qNX"&gt;If you’re hunting for a mesh Wi-Fi system that operates with a tri-band setup and dedicated backhaul to keep things speedy, even when you have many devices connected, check out this other deal at Woot. It’s on Netgear’s last-gen three-piece Orbi system. Originally priced at $600, &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13140759?sid=VergeDeals031921&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fnetgear-orbi-ac3000-whole-home-tri-band-wifi-system-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it costs $320 right now&lt;/a&gt;. These don’t support Wi-Fi 6 that many devices currently can take advantage of, but they’re still plenty fast and capable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FH94UF"&gt;Each AC3000 unit sports one 2.4GHz band and two 5GHz bands with MU-MIMO support to handle streaming to multiple devices simultaneously, so network congestion shouldn’t be an issue. And unlike some competitors in this price range, each of the two satellites accompanying the main Orbi router has two Ethernet ports in case you want to wire in some of your tech directly around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3PZ7CS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603482"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UV77th"&gt;You can still get a $20 gift card included with the purchase of a Nintendo Switch Lite console at several retailers. It costs $200, and since Nintendo rarely discounts the actual price on the hardware, this is as good a deal as we’ve seen for a Switch console. You can keep the gift card for later use, or when you get it, pick up a microSD card to boost your Switch Lite’s storage to fit more games. Keep in mind, though, the Switch Lite can’t connect to your TV or be docked. That feature is exclusive to the bigger, more expensive Switch with detachable Joy-Con controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rJnUZo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10394076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus Watch gets an early reveal ahead of March 23rd announcement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DayZVct8JfUH7CGdKTJzHh0uTN0=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68992937/Ew10MnNXIAAqCju.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/UnboxTherapy/status/1372881459892084736" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unbox Therapy&lt;/em&gt; / Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1yJtJF"&gt;OnePlus’ long-awaited first smartwatch has made its first appearance ahead of the company’s upcoming March 23rd launch event, which is feeling increasingly irrelevant as almost every piece of news about its new product lineup trickles online in bits and pieces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4qMDM"&gt;Revealed fully &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UnboxTherapy/status/1372881459892084736"&gt;for the first time by Unbox Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, the creatively named OnePlus Watch doesn’t appear to break too much new ground when it comes to smartwatch design. Visible are two buttons on the right side of the watch (notably, there’s no scrolling crown-style wheel) on an otherwise normal-looking watch. Also of interest are what appears to be standard watch straps, instead of the proprietary bands that are popular among companies like Apple and Fitbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QzxQIm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's an EXCLUSIVE look at the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnePlusWatch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OnePlusWatch&lt;/a&gt;... &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnePlus9Series?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OnePlus9Series&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@oneplus&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;a href="https://t.co/tKBUcXkuth"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tKBUcXkuth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Unbox Therapy (@UnboxTherapy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UnboxTherapy/status/1372881459892084736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s0PemI"&gt;The image also gives a first look at the Watch’s new OS, which OnePlus CEO Pete Lau confirmed &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/get-ready-for-the-oneplus-watch.1399070/"&gt;in a forum post&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; running Wear OS, but instead an RTOS-style operating system. Lau’s post also promises “seamless connectivity” to OnePlus phones, headphones, and TVs, and an “affordable price point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYg92s"&gt;Smartphone leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1372072726500843522?s=20"&gt;Ishan Agarwal has also revealed&lt;/a&gt; more specific details on the specs of the OnePlus Watch claiming that it will measure in at 46mm, feature IP68 water resistance, and feature a version of OnePlus’ Warp Charge system (promising a week of battery life off a 20-minute charge). It’ll also have 4GB of storage and the ability to see notifications, incoming calls, and automatically detect workouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hYisej"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Exclusive: OnePlus Watch Specifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- 46mm&lt;br&gt;- IP68&lt;br&gt;- Warp Charge (A week of charge in 20 minutes)&lt;br&gt;- Sleep, Stress, Blood Saturation, Heart Rate Monitoring&lt;br&gt;- Check Notifications, Calls&lt;br&gt;- Control OnePlus TV&lt;br&gt;- 4GB Storage&lt;br&gt;- Auto Workout Detection&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More: &lt;a href="https://t.co/m4Cr3ckTWR"&gt;https://t.co/m4Cr3ckTWR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/TP75nMCmXd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TP75nMCmXd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ishan Agarwal (@ishanagarwal24) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1372072726500843522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X8F3gi"&gt;Agarwal also says that the watch will be able to track sleep, stress, blood oxygen saturation, and heart rate — which could correspond to the four colorful tracking bars seen on the watchface in Unbox Therapy’s image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fsPxFz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MatPat looks at YouTube’s biggest changes over the last decade — and what lies ahead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cvXGQanwptuwOgOzAzx9tzscYMQ=/360x0:4248x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68992875/MatPat_headshot.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An interview with one of gaming’s longest-standing personalities&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="MYWjNx"&gt;Matthew &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GameTheorists/videos"&gt;“MatPat”&lt;/a&gt; Patrick was on YouTube for two years before he hit publish on the first entry in the series that changed his life — and YouTube culture as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNJwRl"&gt;“Game Theory,” a series that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Med6Z8-9g"&gt;examines the ins and outs&lt;/a&gt; of popular video game franchises like &lt;em&gt;Five Nights at Freddy’s &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, premiered on April 18th, 2011. The channel quickly found an audience of gaming enthusiasts and industry developers who wanted to learn the secrets behind why certain games became such a hit. YouTubers also looked to him as a model, as Patrick successfully helped to pilot an entire genre of videos, using tricks he had learned while working behind the scenes at a multichannel network (an older YouTube model that has slowly faded away).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSlhGp"&gt;Throughout the years, MatPat’s channel became a go-to open secret for new YouTube creators and game developers. He was one of the first creators to explain why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20996849/minecraft-youtube-rewind-fortnite-grand-theft-auto-roblox-biggest-games-views"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;was so successful on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, for example. By 2017, he became a leading figure within the community, fighting on behalf of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18287318/youtube-logan-paul-pewdiepie-demonetization-adpocalypse-premium-influencers-creators"&gt;YouTubers during the “adpocalypse.”&lt;/a&gt; He even went on to host an interview &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ap6PTQUMf4"&gt;session with YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki&lt;/a&gt; about creator issues.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJyfMQ"&gt;In 2014,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Patrick expanded “Game Theory” into a franchise &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FilmTheorists"&gt;with “Film Theory,”&lt;/a&gt; and “Food Theory” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHYoe8kQ-7Gn9ASOlmI0k6Q"&gt;followed just last year&lt;/a&gt;. His videos routinely pick up millions of views, and he employs a full team to help with editing and creating new episodes. Alongside his wife and channel partner Stephanie, the two are also exploring more charity live streams for causes close to their hearts. In December 2020, one of their charity streams &lt;a href="https://www.stjude.org/media-resources/news-releases/2020-fundraising-news/game-theory-raises-3-million-on-youtube.html"&gt;raised more than $3 million&lt;/a&gt; for St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMi2nN"&gt;With the 10th anniversary of Game Theory approaching, Patrick sat down with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;for an interview about what’s changed on YouTube over the last decade and what’s next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iy4waT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wqb5zi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X9BNqktRdLo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="9hmIxS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first question, which is maybe a big one, but in these last 10 years, what’s the biggest thing that has changed? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unqf8s"&gt;Oh, well! [&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;] It’s pretty massive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNtZVL"&gt;I think the biggest stuff is the idea of being a YouTuber, and being a creator, has fundamentally shaped so much of entertainment, of being a storyteller — of the world ecosystem, in a lot of cases. The idea that anyone with a phone in their hand can not just create something but find an audience somewhere in the millions or tens of millions, and ultimately build a business off of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ys1gbR"&gt;That democratization of entertainment is huge because now you’re giving voice to people who never would have had a platform. You’re giving rise to stories like the Dream SMP, which no television producer in their right mind would ever think to greenlight or understand why it could be so popular — and yet, it’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338418/dream-smp-youtube-minecraft-fanart-fanfiction-video-edits-fandom"&gt;biggest thing happening on YouTube right now.&lt;/a&gt; That sort of fostering of creativity, that explosion of being able to tell your own story is really exciting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsCcAT"&gt;You see those ripple effects happening, too. In the way that the lead shows, especially during COVID, had to film at home and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21179793/coronavirus-late-night-fallon-colbert-wwe-morning-shows-the-view-sports-premier-league-nba-mlb"&gt;become vloggers in their own right&lt;/a&gt;. Gaming has permeated the sports world in a way that 10 years ago would have never existed. Even the evolution of live content, as celebrities kind of tried to try to find their own audiences outside of their individual projects... they’re following the models that YouTubers and digital creators have been pioneering over the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMImnV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You inspired a lot of people to kind of figure out a way to do those types of videos [theories and in-depth explainers] that are really influential and informative. When did you start noticing, like, “Ah, this thing I created is taking off to the point that people want to replicate it?” Imitation is the biggest form of flattery. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2A2nQ"&gt;We were one of the early video essay formats. From the YouTube creator standpoint, I think it was probably about three years into us doing the show that I first started to really take note that other people were attempting the format. I &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce3"&gt;think it was VSauce3&lt;/a&gt;, the pop culture science channel, which was massive at the time. I remember thinking, “Oh, that’s my format. And they’re doing it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nVqCUa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That democratization of entertainment is huge because now you’re giving voice to people who never would have had a platform”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ow5n5r"&gt;That was also the first time that I got really scared. We were still in relatively early days, still finding our audience, and here’s this massive channel that is doing roughly the thing that we’ve been doing for the past three years — hopefully they don’t run us out or whatever. But what we came to learn very quickly was there’s an audience that is big enough for everyone, and everyone kind of tackles that theorizing format in their own unique voice, which is really exciting. You now have a community of theorists all applying their logic in different ways and can create complimentary content, as opposed to content that cannibalizes each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="130T7c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a different version of 2021, if Game Theory didn’t exist, if someone were to come to you and say, “I have this idea for this channel I want to do,” would that be able to find an audience today? Is there room for Game Theory today or is that something that had to happen at the moment it did?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NV3pE0"&gt;It sounds a little bit defeatist, but I think it had to kind of happen when it did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Az1BYZ"&gt;The nature of theorizing does not work well with the modern ecosystem of digital video. Having thoughtful analytical pieces that take a week to put together like our videos doesn’t run with the speed that the internet runs with at this point. Doing this sort of research piece, it’s just hard to do. And you see that too even with educational channels in the space, right? The channels that have been able to survive in 2020 / 2021 are the established ones: the VSauces of the world, the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/physicswoman"&gt;Physics Girls of the world&lt;/a&gt;. These channels that can afford to have a little bit of a delay between their uploads because their audience is already there. That affords them the time to do the research, to do the scripting, to make sure that their facts are correct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzhhZP"&gt;If you’re looking to kind of get some sort of accelerated growth on the platform, that requires a faster cadence of uploads or being able to more closely ride trends. A single creator, doing all the steps on their own, would really struggle to do all of it in the time it takes to be competitive in that landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KfFf69N4dKdcN4h1ihadq9g9HfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380163/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_11.52.33_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N98AHi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the future of gaming videos? Is it more Dream SMP stuff? Or is there a place where people can still do let’s plays and all that with games when YouTube is trying to figure out how to keep advertising going and keep the children’s privacy law COPPA in mind? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKq3VD"&gt;Gaming is stronger than it’s ever been. In 2020, gaming was one of the few fields that didn’t just sustain itself but thrived as more people found gaming to fill in the gaps that the disappearance of reality kind of left in its wake. A lot of people had these gaps in their schedules, gaps in social calendars, and gaming was able to kind of fill those holes. People were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200972/college-students-graduation-minecraft-coronavirus-school-closures"&gt;having graduations in &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, people were going to the museum in &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;. Gaming kind of exploded in the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mviDZx"&gt;I think Dream SMP is definitely one route. It’s not just gaming, it’s narrative storytelling through the lens of gaming. You’re starting to see more people kind of adopt that Machinima idea of, “Hey, here’s a world in which I can treat this not as a game, but as a platform.” &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is doing it a lot of ways to where they have the creative block where you can create whatever you want. That’s really cool. Game developers are recognizing that the game doesn’t end when a player beats it or when the match ends, but it can become an ecosystem, a platform of its own to foster the creativity of its players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="499XjQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; has always had that. That’s one of the reasons why &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; has had such staying power. You’re seeing other gaming companies recognizing this and trying to build in that direction. I can see that being the direction of where gaming content moves from here. It’s less about sitting down on the couch and playing through this narrative story time together, and more sitting down on the couch and creating a world together using the tools of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge1Dg6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you feel like the term “YouTuber” now comes with more authority and more respect than it did in 2011? From your perspective, as someone who is an entrepreneur as well as a creator, how have those conversations changed with industry people that you meet when you say, “I’m on YouTube, I’m a YouTuber?&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6J1rCA"&gt;I think, for a long time, there was this kind of an attempt to educate traditional media about that exact issue. That being a YouTuber wasn’t a dirty word, right? There is a specific connotation attached to that, like a certain tier of creator — an upper tier of creator who is delivering this interesting content. But I think a lot of times, myself included, we got frustrated that a lot of times those conversations tended to fall on deaf ears. The learning process was slower than we hoped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dl3Lwl"&gt;Nowadays, in 2021, it’s one of those things where there’s a division of people who get it and people who don’t. Rather than trying to prove credibility to the people who don’t, the industry is just moving forward. You either get it or you don’t. This is where there is still a division in the ecosystem, people who still don’t respect it or who still kind of look down on the title of YouTuber. But the need to kind of prove that legitimacy has kind of faded away. There’s enough critical movement in the ecosystem, in the traditional space, in the brand space, that it’s like I will find the people who understand me and respect me and move forward with them. If you don’t hop on the train, well, you’re just gonna get left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoWt6e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I often think about not just how much has changed since 2011, but things that I miss from that era. There was a moment of true experimentation for an online video platform. I miss that. There are other things that I don’t miss. It was chaotic, and not always in a good way. Is there anything that you miss about that specific era? And is there anything from that specific era of YouTube that has kind of gone away that you’re happy about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWQjJV"&gt;In the early days of digital video, and in the early days of Game Theory, it was the Wild West. You were able to kind of produce videos on any game, any topic, and there wasn’t a pressure for that upload to perform or there wasn’t an expectation of earning money off of it. You did get a lot of really interesting, really off-the-wall experimental videos that were true expressions of a person’s creativity and you saw stuff unlike anything you would see elsewhere online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TUpkE"&gt;The window of what is acceptable to put on YouTube has really narrowed. You have regulations on one side dictating what isn’t kids’ content, you have rampant demonetization dictating what can or can’t be said or shown in a particular video. There is a certain level of polish that modern YouTube kind of expects of videos for them to kind of get a decent amount of traction on the platform. You lose a lot of the rawness — the bad cameras, the wonky editing, the YouTube slideshows of yesteryear — because the platform does have a standard of quality now that it’s looking to show to audiences around the world. And I understand why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mmCyoi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In the early days of digital video, and in the early days of Game Theory, it was the Wild West”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZSCsI"&gt;But something does get lost for small creators who are still using this as a platform to kind of find their voice, find their audience. I definitely miss that. I miss that idea of community, that idea of anything goes, that idea of chaos. It’s a double-edged sword. As we talked about before, what it means to be a YouTuber is less stigmatized, there is a group of people who understand it. So the ability to build a business on YouTube on one hand is kind of a bummer because it’s no longer one person in the Wild West. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Tyot3"&gt;Now at the very least, I have stability. We’re going on 10 years, and I think for the first five of them, we operated under the motto that this bubble could burst at that moment. The algorithm could shift, advertisers could leave, YouTube could get shut down. Now, YouTube, the ecosystem, how it’s perceived in the world has evolved in such a way that this is a more stable place to build a business. Advertisers come and go, and you will have your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18231561/youtube-child-exploitation-predators-controversy-creators-adpocalypse"&gt;occasional adpocalypse&lt;/a&gt;, but the system has matured in such a way that paranoia of always having to look over your shoulder has started to ebb away a little bit, and you’re able to focus on running your own race and making the stuff that you are able to produce as best as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQR54O"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is something that you’ve seen go around, assumptions that people make, that people actually get wrong?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihJBcA"&gt;There’s a stigma that comes with anyone who’s kind of built out their team and has been public about it. The idea of, “Oh, this isn’t your channel anymore because you have an editor and a researcher, or you have someone who helps you upload the videos.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSrCWY"&gt;What’s exciting to me is that it allows us to do what we love to do at a larger scale and actually stay relevant in 2021 with the kind of faster pace that YouTube expects at this point. Not only that, but also employ like-minded individuals who also are creative and have something that they want to say, or who are theorists like me, who have their own properties that they want to talk about. What a lot of people see is, “Oh, you became corporate” or we became a business. Yeah, we became a business, but that doesn’t lose the core of the creativity that brought us here in the first place. In fact, it’s enabled us to empower other creatives like ourselves to find employment doing the stuff that they love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAG4r3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, last question, and it might be a little tougher. What’s next for you? Is there a future beyond YouTube?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxv0sb"&gt;We just launched Food Theory, and that’s been a lot of fun. That’s been really creatively refreshing for us. You can theorize about things that don’t just exist in the pop culture lexicon, you can theorize about anything in your day-to-day life. We have some thoughts as to what else you can theorize about, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see that one fill in at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QY7cwe"&gt;Our main focus now is doing exactly what we talked about: being an influencer of influencers where we are trying to advocate to YouTube on behalf of creators’ rights and needs. We’re trying to find solutions for channels that are having trouble with monetization, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963459/youtube-google-coppa-ftc-fine-settlement-youtubers-new-rules"&gt;having trouble with COPPA&lt;/a&gt; or things like that to try and help them be able to find the stability that we’ve been able to find. Finding business solutions and creator solutions that work for this kind of next generation of creators. We’ve been really working behind the scenes to make those tools available to creators so that way they can grow their own businesses faster and not have to make mistakes that we made along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="s8PwKS"&gt;The last thing is our charitable work. At the end of last year, we had the amazing ability to raise $3 million for St. Jude along with the help of 50 of our favorite creators across various platforms. We see the importance of using the platform that we’ve been given, that we’re lucky enough to have built over the years, for good. If we can kind of pay it forward and pass along that goodwill and serve as an ambassador for worthwhile causes in order to inspire the next generation of creators to make good use of the fortunate position they’ve been given, that’s great as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UYEt0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gamescom plans ‘hybrid’ event for summer, focusing on superfans (but ignoring superspreaders)</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nHCmZJ"&gt;Video game fair Gamescom is planning to hold a “hybrid event” combining in-person and digital activities later this summer, despite uncertainty surrounding the ongoing pandemic and the risk the trade show could turn into a “superspreader” event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gC9Vtl"&gt;Like many big events that involve hundreds of thousands of people flying in from all over the world to breathe the same air for days at a time, Gamescom decided to cancel its 2020 show and instead held a series of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402923/gamescom-2020-opening-night-live-news-trailers-fall-guys-star-wars-cod"&gt;virtual spectacles&lt;/a&gt;. This year, though, organizers want gamers and industry insiders to return to the show floor, albeit in reduced numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5rxb7T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We will hereby be placing a focus on the superfans”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wbsS4X"&gt;“In late summer, we are striving to make an on-site Gamescom event possible for the gaming fans again at last,” said Felix Falk, managing director of the German Games Industry Association, which co-organizes Gamescom, in a &lt;a href="https://www.gamescom.global/press-creator/press-releases/press-releases-of-gamescom/?fairnumber=0480&amp;amp;fairyear=2021&amp;amp;pressrelease=1&amp;amp;language=EN%20(US)&amp;amp;abbreviation=EN%20(GB)&amp;amp;datei=pm_0480_2021_1_EN%20(US).xml?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=8786&amp;amp;utm_term=foto_announcement_hybrid_20210318&amp;amp;utm_content=0480_20_BW_Core_tw_int"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We will hereby be placing a focus on the superfans and the on-site testing of the latest games this year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lrtxY"&gt;As proof of the event’s safety, organizers are promoting their adherence to so-called “&lt;a href="https://www.gamescom.global/for-visitors/on-site/re-start-koelnmesse/"&gt;#B-SAFE4business&lt;/a&gt;” guidelines outlined by Koelnmesse, the exhibition center in Cologne, Germany where Gamescom is usually held. According to Koelnmess, safety measures include mandatory face masks (except at seating areas for eating and drinking), contact-free navigation through doors, reduced visitor numbers (so attendees can maintain at least 1.5-meter distances from one another at all times), and “sufficient ventilation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0t5efc"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://static-koelnmesse.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cloudfront/gamescom/redaktionell/gamescom/downloads/pdf/aussteller/gamescom_pitch_deck.pdf"&gt;pitch deck&lt;/a&gt; for the event suggests it will take place between August 23rd and 29th, five months from now. And although it’s impossible to predict what the global COVID-19 situation will be at that point, that uncertainty is definitely not in the organizers’ favor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRxaTx"&gt;Just this week, German officials &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bfeeaff9-0d7e-4f3a-bc31-329a3ad5e53f"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; of an “exponential” growth in infections, attributed in part to the spread of the new B.1.1.7 variant. And while Germany still plans to offer every citizen a COVID-19 vaccination &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-germany-target/germany-sticks-to-summer-vaccination-target-document-idUSKBN2BB18B?il=0"&gt;by summer&lt;/a&gt;, there have already been unforeseen obstacles to this goal like the recent suspension of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/16/chaos-in-germany-and-italy-after-suspension-of-oxford-vaccine"&gt;the Oxford / AstraZeneca COVID vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSot9G"&gt;Even if Germany does have the pandemic under control by August, the wisdom of inviting attendees from around the world to share air in a single location is dubious to say the least. It’s been proven that such big gatherings can become superspreader events. A single biotech conference in the US last February is thought to have led to some &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/world/superspreading-boston-biotech-conference-in-february-is-linked-to-1-9-percent-of-all-us-cases.html"&gt;300,000 new cases&lt;/a&gt;, for example. And even small events which test all attendees &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/13/1018374/peter-diamandis-covid-superspreader-a360-conference/"&gt;have led to new cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIqU1R"&gt;Gamescom, though, isn’t the only organization determined to return to “normal” in 2021. Mobile conference MWC is also currently scheduled to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;go ahead in June&lt;/a&gt;, even though &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/mwc-will-take-place-in-person-in-barcelona-but-ericsson-sony-nokia-facebook-wont-be-there/"&gt;numerous firms&lt;/a&gt; — including Sony, Nokia, Ericsson, and Facebook —  have said they won’t attend due to safety concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
