    <title>ZTE’s newest under-display selfie camera looks slightly improved</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nM2raYUHV0eGZkqzuYfIyf_5K6A=/0x0:800x533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69643337/axon_zte_30.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;ZTE’s Axon 30.  | Image: ZTE&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rDdvfn"&gt;Last year’s Axon 20 5G from ZTE was the world’s first commercially-available phone to put a front-facing camera underneath its display. It was an impressive step forward for phone technology but there was one big problem: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;the camera sucked&lt;/a&gt;. It took lousy pictures and the module distorted the display in certain settings. Now, ZTE is trying again with &lt;a href="https://www.zte.com.cn/global/about/news/20210727e1.html"&gt;the updated Axon 30&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to offer some improvements over its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0SLBp"&gt;First, a little spec dump. The Axon 30 has a 6.92-inch AMOLED screen with 120Hz refresh rate and FHD+ resolution, all powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 870 5G chipset. There’s a four-camera array on the rear of the device, with a 64-megapixel main, 8-megapixel 120-degree wide-angle, 5-megapixel macro lens, and an additional depth-of-field lens. The battery has a 4200mAh capacity and 55W fast charging, and, as per &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/zte_axon_30_5g_brings_a_secondgen_ud_camera_snapdragon_870_and_55w_charging-news-50255.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you have the options of 6GB / 8GB / 12GB of RAM and 128GB / 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gddVE9"&gt;But the most interesting updates for the Axon 30 are to the under-display camera. For these under-display modules to work, you have to use transparent materials in that area of the screen, which are a fairly recent development and so lower-quality compared to regular display tech. For the Axon 30, ZTE says it’s doubled the pixel density in this area from 200 PPI to 400 PPI, which should make for a more seamless integration with the display. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_K7PyqiX_ag4Emg6XyhYg34RMIo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745212/gsmarena_011.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A comparison of the Axon 20 (left) and Axon 30 (right) under-display screens. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RKuy1r"&gt;ZTE says it’s also improved the under-display camera itself. You can see in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;our hands-on with the Axon 20&lt;/a&gt; last year that pictures from this camera were hazy and soft in good lighting, and introduced a ton of noise in bad lightning. The camera was a great technical achievement, sure, but not on par with regular front-facing lenses. Based on the shot below, though, from popular phone informant Ice Universe (aka @&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/universeice"&gt;UniverseIce&lt;/a&gt;), there may be some improvements with the Axon 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0iOsD4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a selfie with plenty of light outdoors. &lt;a href="https://t.co/24xEir7E8r"&gt;pic.twitter.com/24xEir7E8r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ice universe (@UniverseIce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1419993869911924740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gTYLjn"&gt;We’ll obviously have to wait to try the phone ourselves to give you a full evaluation, but don’t hold your breath for any miracles. As Ice Universe notes, the picture above was taken outdoors with plenty of light, an in response to a Twitter user suggesting they need to try out the camera in worse conditions, Ice Universe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1419996698449911810"&gt;responds&lt;/a&gt;: “Such a poor performance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iCdyZ"&gt;Another photo from Ice suggests the under-display camera is also visible when the screen is turned off, but that’s hardly a big deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTIfQK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZteAxon30?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ZteAxon30&lt;/a&gt;  But the camera is not completely invisible. When the screen is off, you can see it, just like we can see the fingerprint sensor under the sun. &lt;a href="https://t.co/sNNvReVf3p"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sNNvReVf3p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ice universe (@UniverseIce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1420001203321139209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P4FCjt"&gt;The ZTE Axon 30 is launching in China first, with &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt; reporting that sales will begin on August 3rd. Price start at CNY 2,198 ($338) for the 6GB / 128GB model and CNY 3,098 ($476) for the 12GB / 256GB version. Global availability and pricing will be coming later. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Krispy Kreme is selling Xbox doughnuts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gvpBkiyHTcawgLgX8s6W5VlfSIo=/0x0:5940x3960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69643295/xboxdoughnut.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krispy Kreme’s new Xbox doughnut.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Krispy Kreme&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iie5Bl"&gt;Krispy Kreme has created an Xbox doughnut. The fluffy doughnut is a marketing collaboration with Microsoft to celebrate 20 years of Xbox, and will be sold at Krispy Kreme stores, cabinets, and online across the UK and Ireland between August 2nd and August 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lilyX6"&gt;The doughnuts won’t come equipped with CPUs, GPUs, or SSDs, but you might be able to win that type of hardware in the form of an Xbox Series S. As part of this marketing campaign, Krispy Kreme is also giving away Microsoft’s latest mini Xbox. You’ll need to purchase a dozen of the new Xbox doughnuts for a chance to win a console, and Krispy Kreme will include a month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with every dozen doughnuts bought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CVfx6T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Welcome to the next generation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introducing... The Nexus Level Doughnut&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming Soon  &lt;a href="https://t.co/UVteHkCnjT"&gt;https://t.co/UVteHkCnjT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xboxuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@xboxuk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KrispyKremeXbox?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#KrispyKremeXbox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Xf3hRuKybw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Xf3hRuKybw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Krispy Kreme UK (@krispykremeUK) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/krispykremeUK/status/1420289168920485890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pwxybh"&gt;The doughnut itself is &lt;a href="https://www.krispykreme.co.uk/the-nexus-level.html"&gt;called the Nexus Level&lt;/a&gt;, and is dipped in icing and decorated with the Xbox Nexus design. A single doughnut will be priced at £2.10 (nearly $3), or a dozen will be available for £14.45 (about $20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SCIHE"&gt;Krispy Kreme has even created a playful marketing video, featuring a creative director named “Kristina Kareem” and a quality assurance guru named “Xavier Boxell.” I doughnut believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s paid subscribers hit 165M as podcast listening ‘improved modestly’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SgaxrdrqN27uz0lbDW3Kdj5uYkg=/48x0:648x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69643254/image__12_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify’s latest subscriber numbers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OrmdUj"&gt;Spotify now has 165 million premium subscribers and 365 million monthly active users according to &lt;a href="https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2021/Spotify-Technology-S.A.-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-2021/default.aspx"&gt;a new earnings report&lt;/a&gt; released today. It’s a year-over-year increase of 20 percent and 22 percent respectively, and up from the 158 million subscribers and 356 million MAUs seen last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJXPLu"&gt;Rivals Apple Music and Amazon Music don’t regularly release comparable numbers, but their most recent public figures &lt;a href="https://musically.com/2020/02/19/spotify-apple-how-many-users-big-music-streaming-services/"&gt;compiled by &lt;em&gt;Music Ally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; put them at 60 million and around 55 million paying subscribers, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pS4Sj"&gt;Spotify’s interest in podcasts has showed no signs of slowing this quarter, as it’s continued to make acquisitions and investments in both podcasting content and technology. The company recently acquired the exclusive rights to two podcasts, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534981/spotify-exclusive-podcast-call-her-daddy-alex-cooper"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call Her Daddy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432286/dax-shepard-armchair-expert-spotify-exclusive"&gt;Dax Shepard’s &lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22539794/spotify-podz-acquisition-machine-learning-podcast-discovery"&gt;company Podz&lt;/a&gt; whose technology automates the process of creating preview clips that feature key moments from podcasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TR8yOp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Joe Rogan experience “continues to perform above expectations”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nqa2c9"&gt;According to Spotify, the percentage of monthly active users engaged with podcast content last quarter “improved modestly” compared to the quarter prior, and podcast listening hit an all-time high in terms of its share of consumption hours on the platform. Spotify also says that &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience &lt;/em&gt;“continues to perform above expectations.” There are now 2.9 million podcasts available on Spotify, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-adds-fewer-total-users-than-expected-11627466400"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, up from 2.6 million last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDGDTq"&gt;As well as acquiring exclusive rights to podcasts, Spotify is also enticing other creators onto its platform with paid subscription features. It announced its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;podcast subscription feature in April&lt;/a&gt;, and yesterday said it will allow paid shows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595013/spotify-open-access-podcasts-paid-access"&gt;from platforms like Slate and Acast&lt;/a&gt; to stream through its service. Features like these should make Spotify a more attractive and profitable platform for podcast creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPwuB3"&gt;Spotify’s average revenue per user increased this quarter, reversing recent trends. The figure now sits at €4.29 (around $5.07) per premium subscriber, which is up from €4.12 last quarter. The increase comes after the service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403813/spotify-price-increase-subscriptions-2021"&gt;increased its subscription prices&lt;/a&gt; in the UK and US this quarter. The figure is still down by 3 percent year-over-year however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qMSGM"&gt;Overall, the company made a net loss of €20 million, compared to a net loss of €356 million it made in the same quarter the previous year. Executives have said that the company’s focus is on growth rather than turning a profit on a quarterly basis, the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; notes, while the previous loss was mainly due to taxes the company had to pay related to its Swedish workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaGLYa"&gt;Today’s release hasn’t yet offered any more details about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;Spotify HiFi&lt;/a&gt;, the service’s forthcoming lossless streaming tier. Despite announcing the new tier in February with a provisional release date of later this year, Spotify is yet to announce an official launch date or pricing. In the months since its announcement, competitor Apple Music &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;then released&lt;/a&gt; its own lossless audio streaming feature, which is available at no additional cost. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440058/amazon-music-hd-price-cut-apple-lossless-audio"&gt;Amazon also dropped the premium&lt;/a&gt; it previously charged for its own lossless streams on the same day.) Whether Spotify likes it or not, the lossless streaming market is now a lot more competitive than it was in February.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite’s first multiplayer beta begins on July 29th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I_C7hKtO4BseqlasYb6xy5CoQuc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69642988/a47427df_9cef_4831_85d0_9fa989ce4560.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qtFMT0"&gt;The first &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer technical preview will start tomorrow, July 29th. The beta will run until Sunday August 1st, offering a short chance for those invited to test &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s multiplayer aspects. It’s the first of many technical previews for &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, as Microsoft prepares to launch the free multiplayer game mode later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVmDoN"&gt;The first preview will include testing gameplay against AI bots, with a bot arena to “gather feedback on Bot behavior and online performance,” &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/inside-infinite-july-2021"&gt;according to 343 Industries&lt;/a&gt;. This arena will include the slayer mode across three maps, and a variety of challenges throughout the weekend. “The Bots still have their quirks, which is why we’re flighting them, but they certainly aren’t pushovers. Be prepared,” warns 343 Industries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Md0aMWAQtc0ymTQB3wIgW6TAMhU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745132/4k_haloinfinite_livefire_02_watermarked_bda22d6032e945fb93e52eaff91d5bc7.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Live Fire map for Halo Infinite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MWj58X"&gt;Players will also be able to try the Weapon Drills part of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; this weekend. It’s a way to test weapons before entering arena battles, in a simple firing range. There will be a variety of guns to test, including snipers, pistols, the classic needler, and the MA40 AR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRe4cp"&gt;343 Industries is also testing the UI of Halo Infinite, including how players unlock battle passes, interact with challenges, and use the store inside the game. “This technical preview will feature a truncated Battle Pass and a small fraction of the Customization options planned for launch,” according to 343 Industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tD3zde"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s everything we know about Halo Infinite’s free multiplayer ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22533317/halo-infinite-multiplayer-customizations-game-modes-weapons-features"},{"title":"Here’s a first look at Halo Infinite’s multiplayer mode ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531861/halo-infinite-e3-2021-trailer-demo-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3rtBo1"&gt;This testing will also include the new Halo Waypoint web and mobile app, where you can customize a spartan or view battle pass progress and challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwcDf0"&gt;343 Industries is planning to share more details on the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; technical preview during a live stream later today at 5PM ET / 2PM PT. If you’re interested in testing &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;then you’ll need to &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/community/halo-insider"&gt;sign up to be a Halo Insider&lt;/a&gt;, and receive an invite to participate in testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dS6xL9"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5lRwyV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s multiplayer mode will launch alongside the campaign later this year, and will be a free part of the game open to anyone on Xbox or PC. The game will run at up to 120fps in this mode on the Xbox Series X, and offer classics game modes like capture the flag with new abilities like using a grapple hook to pick up objects. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is shutting down its Dr. Mario mobile game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XlRH_T9_vcNazpoXBJPNxEi-wm8=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69642606/Untitled.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jrIlew"&gt;Nintendo has &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/support/information/2021/0728.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Dr. Mario World&lt;/em&gt;, a mobile take on the puzzle game series, will go out of service on November 1st, with sales of its in-app “diamond” currency ending today. The game was launched a little over two years ago, and is the first of Nintendo’s mobile games to be shut down, unless you count the Mii-themed social network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16930822/nintendo-miitomo-closing-down-date"&gt;Miitomo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtL2NP"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/nintendo-revenue-one-billion"&gt;data from SensorTower&lt;/a&gt; collected around six months after its launch, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Mario World&lt;/em&gt; was by far the worst performing Nintendo smartphone game in terms of revenue performance. That includes &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Run&lt;/em&gt;, whose disappointing sales prompted Nintendo to pursue freemium models in the first place. &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem Heroes&lt;/em&gt; remains the company’s biggest mobile hit by a huge distance, generating more revenue than its other games combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCgtS1"&gt;Nintendo did go out of its way to make &lt;em&gt;Dr. Mario World&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/8/20685938/dr-mario-world-candy-crush-puzzle-game-mobile-free-to-play-loot-box"&gt;potential monetization machine&lt;/a&gt; rather than a direct translation of the NES-era gameplay, but ultimately it seems like not enough players got hooked for it to be worth continually operating. Mobile games still account for a tiny portion of Nintendo’s overall earnings; last year the company attributed just 3.24 percent of its revenue to “mobile and IP related income,” which includes licensing deals. Almost everything else comes from the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Read Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick’s letter addressing the harassment allegations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activision Blizzard CEO Robert Kotick" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IudgEoxxhvwI8sQgxgEwSvhoDCQ=/0x0:4200x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69642330/532417098.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by J. Emilio Flores/Corbis via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9hwZvr"&gt;The evening before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595922/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-sexual-harassment"&gt;a proposed employee walkout at Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, one that at least part of the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596957/blizzard-pto-sexual-harassment-walkout"&gt;is now actively encouraging by providing paid time off&lt;/a&gt;, company CEO Bobby Kotick has issued a letter to all employees — &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/letter-ceo-bobby-kotick-all-employees"&gt;and investors&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210727006194/en/A-Letter-From-CEO-Bobby-Kotick-to-All-Employees"&gt;the public&lt;/a&gt; — who are watching the company struggle with allegations of sexual harassment and workplace discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VckUfx"&gt;At last count, nearly one-third of the company’s employees signed an open letter condemning Activision Blizzard’s initial response to those allegations, and Kotick’s letter addresses that head-on: “Our initial responses to the issues we face together, and to your concerns, were, quite frankly, tone deaf,” he writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orgpea"&gt;Kotick says a law firm, WilmerHale, will immediately review the company’s policies “to promote a respectful and inclusive workplace,” that Activision Blizzard “will continue to investigate each and every claim and will not hesitate to take decisive action,” that it will fire anyone “found to have impeded the integrity of our processes for evaluating claims,” and that it will ensure hiring managers are considering diverse slates of candidates for open jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLgt2X"&gt;Also, the company plans to change its games. “We have heard the input from employee and player communities that some of our in-game content is inappropriate. We are removing that content,” writes Kotick. Blizzard announced earlier today &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597006/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-activision-remove-references-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;that &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; would remove “references that are not appropriate for our world,”&lt;/a&gt; without specifying any particular ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5ks15"&gt;The whole situation strongly reminds of Ubisoft, whose CEO Yves Guillemot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21312022/ubisoft-internal-changes-allegations-employee-misconduct-ceo"&gt;also announced the company would be cleaning house&lt;/a&gt; after an insufficient response to the initial allegations of sexual misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19KkKq"&gt;You can read the full letter below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mvLVKr"&gt;July 27, 2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YaK2JZ"&gt;This has been a difficult and upsetting week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oaIei"&gt;I want to recognize and thank all those who have come forward in the past and in recent days. I so appreciate your courage. Every voice matters - and we will do a better job of listening now, and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CK68Wy"&gt;Our initial responses to the issues we face together, and to your concerns, were, quite frankly, tone deaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxMzMp"&gt;It is imperative that we acknowledge all perspectives and experiences and respect the feelings of those who have been mistreated in any way. I am sorry that we did not provide the right empathy and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OgWtH"&gt;Many of you have told us that active outreach comes from caring so deeply for the Company. That so many people have reached out and shared thoughts, suggestions, and highlighted opportunities for improvement is a powerful reflection of how you care for our communities of colleagues and players – and for each other. Ensuring that we have a safe and welcoming work environment is my highest priority. The leadership team has heard you loud and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5riRaj"&gt;We are taking swift action to be the compassionate, caring company you came to work for and to ensure a safe environment. There is no place anywhere at our Company for discrimination, harassment, or unequal treatment of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJtjXv"&gt;We will do everything possible to make sure that together, we improve and build the kind of inclusive workplace that is essential to foster creativity and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leqFbh"&gt;I have asked the law firm WilmerHale to conduct a review of our policies and procedures to ensure that we have and maintain best practices to promote a respectful and inclusive workplace. This work will begin immediately. The WilmerHale team will be led by Stephanie Avakian, who is a member of the management team at WilmerHale and was most recently the Director of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uj9iPI"&gt;We encourage anyone with an experience you believe violates our policies or in any way made you uncomfortable in the workplace to use any of our many existing channels for reporting or to reach out to Stephanie. She and her team at WilmerHale will be available to speak with you on a confidential basis and can be reached at &lt;a href="mailto:ATVI@wilmerhale.com"&gt;ATVI@wilmerhale.com&lt;/a&gt; or 202-247-2725. Your outreach will be kept confidential. Of course, NO retaliation will be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2tEwp"&gt;We are committed to long-lasting change. Effective immediately, we will be taking the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uF3J1v"&gt;Employee Support. We will continue to investigate each and every claim and will not hesitate to take decisive action. To strengthen our capabilities in this area we are adding additional senior staff and other resources to both the Compliance team and the Employee Relations team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdHA9V"&gt;Listening Sessions. We know many of you have inspired ideas on how to improve our culture. We will be creating safe spaces, moderated by third parties, for you to speak out and share areas for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXB2Wv"&gt;Personnel Changes. We are immediately evaluating managers and leaders across the Company. Anyone found to have impeded the integrity of our processes for evaluating claims and imposing appropriate consequences will be terminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2OFWjD"&gt;Hiring Practices. Earlier this year I sent an email requiring all hiring managers to ensure they have diverse candidate slates for all open positions. We will be adding compliance resources to ensure that our hiring managers are in fact adhering to this directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZZfmg"&gt;In-game Changes. We have heard the input from employee and player communities that some of our in-game content is inappropriate. We are removing that content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qffhVt"&gt;Your well-being remains my priority and I will spare no company resource ensuring that our company has the most welcoming, comfortable, and safe culture possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seqN68"&gt;You have my unwavering commitment that we will improve our company together, and we will be the most inspiring, inclusive entertainment company in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhnujs"&gt;Yours sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZezpG"&gt;Bobby&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workers at a repair facility used by Apple compare conditions to sweatshops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MxZMxUAwaJR3jbZv8zkeTr2yIc0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69642266/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eKwK9I"&gt;Workers at a Houston, Texas facility that processes repairs for Apple, Dell, and Lenovo reportedly say they are working in “sweatshop” conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-repair-workers-sweatshop-csat-solutions-2021-7"&gt;according to a story from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Workers’ toilets are reportedly unsanitary and insufficient, they say they lack air conditioning, and they claim their pay is low at CSAT Solutions, a company that acts as a repair partner for tech companies like Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlrWzk"&gt;In the report, which is &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-repair-workers-sweatshop-csat-solutions-2021-7"&gt;worth reading in its entirety&lt;/a&gt;, employees also reportedly say there aren’t enough bathrooms or parking spots for the number of workers, and that they’re not allowed to use their phones while working, even in the case of family or personal emergencies. One employee told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that she got off work to discover that her son had been taken to the hospital after being burned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Su658a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some employees expected an environment that reflected the prestige of the Apple brand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V4E92a"&gt;The working conditions alleged at CSAT took some employees by surprise, according to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, as they expected an environment reflective of the prestige that comes with the Apple brand. Instead, they reportedly faced quotas that were difficult to meet, and pay that ranged from $12 to $14 an hour, with little hope for raises or promotions. Some employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that they had to work 60 hours a week just to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUWPKl"&gt;CSAT Solutions did not immediately comment in response to an emailed inquiry from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. CSAT representatives told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that the company has high standards for its workplace, and that it investigates employee complaints. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which can be read in full below, Apple said that it will be investigating the allegations, and that its focus is “making sure that everyone in [its] supply chain is protected and treated with dignity and respect.” Dell and Lenovo didn’t immediately respond to request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="73XQaj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Employees reportedly felt like their requests and concerns were unaddressed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kKaZ4E"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, employees felt as if their previous concerns and reports to management had been ignored. Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it has assessed CSAT’s Houston location multiple times in recent years, but didn’t discuss its findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="veJanZ"&gt;The practice of Apple visiting and inspecting suppliers’ facilities, however, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2Fpdf%2FApple-Supplier-Code-of-Conduct-and-Supplier-Responsibility-Standards.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seems to be routine&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) to the point that suppliers may be able to paint themselves in a more positive light. &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;’s report includes stories from multiple employees about being asked to carry out work in a more by-the-book fashion when Apple’s auditors were around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypoowl"&gt;Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it has the highest standards in the industry, and it has a page on its website &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated to talking about supplier responsibility&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the company’s suppliers have faced accusations of poor factory working conditions, with three stories about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22204920/lens-technology-uighur-forced-labor-xinjiang-amazon-apple-tesla"&gt;forced labor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166286/apple-china-labor-violations-temporary-workers"&gt;labor law violations&lt;/a&gt; (where Apple allegedly turned a blind eye), and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/13/22172383/workers-protest-wistron-iphone-se-plant-india-pay"&gt;protests of pay reduction&lt;/a&gt; coming out in December 2020 alone. There’s also recently been the issue of Apple’s own employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453302/apple-culture-secrecy-leak-antonio-garcia-martinez-letter"&gt;fighting for the ability to work remotely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WVeMCI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;CSAT also does work for Dell and Lenovo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VFy9NR"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; report also raises concerns about CSAT’s usage of temp agencies to hire workers. According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2Fpdf%2FApple-Supplier-Code-of-Conduct-and-Supplier-Responsibility-Standards.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s Supplier Code of Conduct and Responsibility Standards&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), its standards also apply to subcontractors, and Apple’s suppliers are responsible for ensuring that the companies they hire are also in compliance. The responsibility, however, is not Apple’s alone — according to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, CSAT also does work for Dell and Lenovo. In particular, Dell’s logo shows up frequently &lt;a href="https://www.csat.com/about/"&gt;in the promotional video atop CSAT’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7d0adt"&gt;Employee reviews for CSAT Solutions on sites like &lt;a href="https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Csat-Solutions/reviews"&gt;Indeed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CSAT-Solutions-Reviews-E483310.htm"&gt;Glassdoor&lt;/a&gt; echo some of the concerns brought up by &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, with many &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW38166423.htm"&gt;comparing working conditions to sweatshops&lt;/a&gt;, warning prospective employees about &lt;a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW47647065.htm"&gt;low pay&lt;/a&gt;, and expressing dissatisfaction with &lt;a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW46375146.htm"&gt;working hours&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW45963998.htm"&gt;quotas&lt;/a&gt;. A few reviews also back up the claims about the cleanliness and availability of the bathrooms, the heat, and broken air conditioners, as well as the strict no-cellphone rules. There are a fair number of positive reviews as well, but many of them are from non-repair employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="odHgic"&gt;&lt;q&gt;60-hour workweeks are often mentioned in CSAT employee reviews&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="As7HOc"&gt;A job listing for a computer repair technician position at CSAT, found on the company’s website, says that candidates must be willing to work overtime, without saying how much. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2Fpdf%2FApple-Supplier-Code-of-Conduct-and-Supplier-Responsibility-Standards.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s standards&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) state that workweeks have to be restricted to 60 hours, including overtime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The job listing includes the line “This position will require the candidate to have some knowledge of computer components and be willing to work overtime.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Gn2i89r01_cYZNsp7M7tIaMmO8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22744454/Screen_Shot_2021_07_27_at_2.10.30_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A job listing from CSAT’s website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C22ptY"&gt;Here’s Apple’s full statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NcrptJ"&gt;We uphold the highest standards in the industry and regularly assess our suppliers to ensure they comply. We have undertaken three assessments at CSAT in Houston in recent years, and Apple members regularly visit the site. We take all allegations seriously and will investigate. As always, our focus is on making sure that everyone in our supply chain is protected and treated with dignity and respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Live Text is no longer an M1-exclusive in Apple’s newest macOS Monterey beta</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fHwoDE"&gt;Apple is expanding which devices can use one of its previously M1-chip exclusive features in the fourth macOS Monterey beta. Live Text, the company’s new image scanning and text identifying feature, now runs on “all Mac computers that support macOS Monterey,” &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-12-beta-release-notes"&gt;according to new documentation&lt;/a&gt; Apple released. As tech video creator &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1420075589617209349?s=20"&gt;Rene Ritchie notes&lt;/a&gt;, that should mean Intel-based Macs. One user &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/khronokernel/status/1420085999376363522"&gt;claims to have gotten it to work&lt;/a&gt; on a Mac Pro from 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpQPUO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522859/apple-live-text-photos-notes-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;Live Text&lt;/a&gt; digitizes the text found in photos, allowing for smart features like making information like phone numbers and addresses searchable and interactive in Apple Photos and the Camera app. The new feature was one of several macOS Monterey highlights &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526224/macos-monterey-best-features-macs-intel-m1-exclusive"&gt;that Apple limited to its newer MacBook Airs, Pros, and iMacs&lt;/a&gt;, marking the company’s first real break in functionality between Macs running its custom-designed chips and those with Intel processors. Now that might no longer be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Text is no longe exclusive to M1-devices in Apple’s fourth beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wDqeqp"&gt;Support for all devices that officially run Monterey should include Macs from as far back 2013, based off &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey-preview/"&gt;Apple’s preview page&lt;/a&gt;. One thing that might have made it easier to bring Live Text to Intel: the Mac and iPhone use the feature in different ways. As Ritchie notes, the iPhone can process text live in-camera, a more demanding task than just analyzing a still photo. Since Macs don’t have an elaborate camera array to scan photos on the fly, they theoretically have a simpler time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tY5dKC"&gt;MacOS Monterey will be released this fall, but if you’re interested in trying out Apple’s beta software (ideally not on your main device), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22558991/macos-monterey-how-to-install-public-beta"&gt;you can follow our guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard is removing unspecified inappropriate references from World of Warcraft</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GT_NRIkWw35_nyzZELnCMhgqkOo=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69642164/992UUQ8203471623805725796.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Activision Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2tJDOP"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; team &lt;a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23703199/a-message-from-the-world-of-warcraft-team"&gt;has vowed to remove&lt;/a&gt; “references that are not appropriate for our world” in “the coming days” following California’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;major sexual harassment and workplace discrimination lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed against &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; developer Activision Blizzard last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cTZb8"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; team’s statement Tuesday didn’t specify what “references” they would remove. But it seems possible that NPCs and items named for former &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; senior creative director Alex Afrasiabi may be taken out of the game — although Afrasiabi seemingly left Blizzard in June 2020, his stamp on the game remains, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/blizzard-harasser-from-lawsuit-is-still-all-over-world-1847345457"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; reported Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWIjgQ"&gt;Afrasiabi was singled out in the lawsuit for his horrible behavior, which the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) says included “blatant sexual harassment with little to no repercussions.” The complaint provides more detail, which I am prefacing with a &lt;strong&gt;content warning for descriptions of sexual harassment&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="EAbpuw"&gt;In a blatant example of Defendants’ refusal to deal with a harasser because of his seniority/position, Alex Afrasiabi, the former Senior Creative Director of World of Warcraft at Blizzard Entertainment, was permitted to engage in blatant sexual harassment with little to no repercussions. During a company event (an annual convention called Blizz Con) Afrasiabi would hit on female employees, telling him he wanted to marry them, attempting to kiss them, and putting, his arms around them. This was in plain view of other male employees, including supervisors, who had to intervene and pull him off female employees. Afrasiabi was so known to engage in harassment of females that his suite was nicknamed the “Crosby Suite” after alleged rapist Bill Crosby. Afrasiabi would also call females derogatory names at company events. Afrasiabi’s conduct was known to Blizzard Entertainment’s executives, who took no effective remedial measures. J. Allen Brack, President of Blizzard Entertainment, allegedly had multiple conversations with Afrasiabi about his drinking and that he had been “too friendly” towards female employees at company events but gave Afrasiabi a slap on the wrist (i.e. verbal counseling) in response to these incidents. Subsequently, Afrasiabi continued to make unwanted advances towards female employees, including grabbing a female employee’s hand and inviting her to his hotel room and groping another woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xM4KFj"&gt;The lawsuit also alleges that the &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; team allowed and encouraged extremely troubling behavior toward women. “Female employees working for the &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; team noted that male employees and supervisors would hit on them, make derogatory comments about rape, and otherwise engage in demeaning behavior,” according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0M34Sp"&gt;Here is the full statement published by the &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; team, which was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1420129038912278529"&gt;also posted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Nt2i54"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was clear from our team conversations that we wanted to put forth a statement that was representative of the World of Warcraft team’s sentiments. We asked all members of our team to send us their suggestions and feedback on how best to address the community and this is the result.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iToAYl"&gt;The past days have been a time of reflection for the World of Warcraft team, spent in conversation and contemplation, full of sadness, pain, and anger, but also hope and resolve. As we heed the brave women who have come forward to share their experiences, we stand committed to taking the actions necessary to ensure we are providing an inclusive, welcoming, and safe environment both for our team and for our players in Azeroth. Those of us in leadership understand that it is not our place to judge when we have achieved our goals, but rather for our team and our community to let us know when we still have more to do.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoHde3"&gt;While we turn to our team for guidance in our internal work to protect marginalized groups and hold accountable those who threaten them, we also want to take immediate action in Azeroth to remove references that are not appropriate for our world. This work has been underway, and you will be seeing several such changes to both Shadowlands and WoW Classic in the coming days.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQrqEf"&gt;We know that in order to rebuild trust, we must earn it with our actions in the weeks and months to come. But we go forward knowing that we share the same vision as our community about creating a place where people of all genders, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and backgrounds can thrive and proudly call home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fr92e4"&gt;—The World of Warcraft Team&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard is encouraging its own employees to attend Wednesday’s walkout with paid time off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LIc5dUlfHqyK8Ir7rx7y_L77yFM=/8x0:1091x722/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69641809/TFEVVVUBSZIU1515612314418.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wApCHQ"&gt;On Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595922/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-sexual-harassment"&gt;Activision Blizzard employees will walk out of work&lt;/a&gt; to protest the company’s response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;a giant sexual harassment and workplace discrimination lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed by the state of California. Now Blizzard, the studio at the center of many of those specific allegations, is giving the protest its blessing. Blizzard leadership emailed studio employees today to let them know they won’t face repercussions for attending — and in fact, that they can have paid time off for the duration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWQ0Fq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; obtained a copy of the email, which we aren’t sharing here to avoid potentially identifying sources. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18075936/google-walkout-protest-movement-sexual-harassmesnt-policy-change"&gt;After over 20 percent of Google employees walked out of work in 2018&lt;/a&gt; to protest that company’s mishandling of sexual harassment revelations (among other grievances), several Google Walkout organizers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18536996/google-walkout-organizers-hr-retaliation"&gt;said they faced retaliation&lt;/a&gt; despite the company’s supposed support of their cause. They &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20695964/google-protest-leader-meredith-whittaker-leaves-company"&gt;left&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21030681/google-claire-stapleton-walkout-organizer-retaliation-essay-go-read-this"&gt;got pushed out of the company&lt;/a&gt;. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) found earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421969/google-illegally-firing-three-workers-nlrb-president-biden"&gt;that Google “arguably violated” labor law&lt;/a&gt; by firing several other organizers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nWwgkF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"California sues Activision Blizzard over a culture of ‘constant sexual harassment’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"},{"title":"Activision Blizzard employees to walk out following sexual harassment lawsuit","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595922/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-sexual-harassment"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uu9JCE"&gt;Over 2,600 Activision Blizzard employees have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594882/activision-blizzard-employees-open-letter-management-california-sexual-harrassment-lawsuit"&gt;signed an letter&lt;/a&gt; condemning the company’s response to the state of California’s lawsuit. That’s nearly a third of the company, assuming it hasn’t grown or shrunken significantly since Activision Blizzard’s official tally of 9,500 employees in December 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
