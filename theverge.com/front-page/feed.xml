    <title>Sony announces the world’s first QD-OLED 4K TV, coming later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6vsGNprbJNY6vI3oo7Ak3wA24Lk=/29x0:1342x875/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345789/2_way_Stand_A95K.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QH64k5"&gt;Sony is setting some pretty grand expectations with its 2022 TV lineup — led by the introduction of the world’s first consumer QD-OLED TV. The company’s current and well-regarded OLED sets use panels from LG Display that are tuned with Sony’s own processing. But the new flagship Bravia XR A95K TV will include a QD-OLED (quantum dot organic light emitting diode) panel manufactured by none other than Samsung Display. It’ll come in 65-inch and 55-inch sizes, with both coming in at 4K resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ct3zdi"&gt;It was rumored that Samsung Electronics might announce a QD-OLED 4K TV at CES 2022, but that hasn’t panned out so far. So it’s Sony that gets the prime spotlight instead. Samsung Display has been &lt;a href="https://www.samsungdisplay.com/eng/tech/quantum-dot.jsp"&gt;developing QD-OLED for a number of years&lt;/a&gt;, and the display technology could become something of a middle step between standard OLED and the MicroLED displays that only Samsung is selling right now — for ungodly sums of money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2RMIW"&gt;QD-OLED is designed to combine the best traits of OLED (perfect blacks, infinite contrast, etc.) with benefits of quantum dot LED TVs like improved brightness and more vivid color reproduction at higher brightness levels. It’s not a major new approach like Micro LED, but more of a progression from where things have stood for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="3gbfJT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10959455"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="02lRrt"&gt;Sony is still sourcing from LG Display for its other 2022 OLEDs, the A90K and A80K, so that business relationship isn’t going anywhere. But the company now finds itself in the unique position of having two different types of OLED TVs. It’ll be very interesting to see the head-to-head comparisons between QD-OLED and the best “normal” OLED sets from LG and Sony once they all start shipping to consumers this spring. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPRQ_FM-BtgvwWDkzIre-aixO6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142580/A95K_Cable_Management.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A95K QD-OLED TV has built-in cable management.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BQW7J1"&gt;Aside from its one-of-a-kind panel, the A95K comes with a unique stand that can either put the TV in a “front position” style, where the display is in front of the stand, or a “back position” if you want to position the pricey TV right up against a wall. The back of the TV also has a funky look to it that I can appreciate with built-in cable management. Even the step-down A90K OLED’s stand has a trick where it can raise the display enough for a soundbar to rest on it without obstructing the view.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IaCl8Fi4oU8pGkiTPsWfZamUzTs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142591/A90K_Stand_Raised.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A90K’s stand in the optional soundbar position.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hef1xZ"&gt;The A95K will have four HDMI inputs, with two of them having full HDMI 2.1 capabilities. All of Sony’s latest OLEDs will support 4K gaming at 120Hz, auto HDR tone mapping when connected to a PS5, and auto low latency mode. And these TVs will finally ship with the option for variable refresh rate out of the box instead of making buyers wait for a software update like past models. Hopefully that’s a sign that VRR is coming closer to arriving on the PlayStation 5 itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WULDEQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TyTk7kCR7Mc?rel=0&amp;amp;start=3" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOWzUX"&gt;Google TV remains Sony’s software of choice for 2022, and the lineup continues to feature the company’s word salad of branded features like XR OLED Contrast Pro, XR Triluminos Max (for the A95K) or Pro (for the rest), and Acoustic Surface Audio Plus. Sony really does get some fantastic audio performance from its premium TVs, and its in-house processing also slightly bests LG’s OLED lineup in picture quality, so the names are probably here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stuPu0"&gt;Sony also announced its first line of Micro LED TVs, which I’ve covered separately. Pricing and specific release dates for all the TVs will be announced in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony made a camera for its TVs that can scold you for sitting too close</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fUfAYOwuzwc-EPssNAmLjJ_fmpk=/38x0:857x546/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345779/BRAVIA_CAM__CMU_BC1____TV.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KQMZpN"&gt;Here’s the so-called “weird Sony” gadget for CES 2022: the Bravia Cam is a new video camera that will come bundled with the company’s very fanciest TVs (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22629261"&gt;the new QD-OLED A95K&lt;/a&gt;) and sold as an optional add-on for the rest of the lineup. You’ll be able to make video calls with it, but Sony is cramming in way more functionality than the simple stuff. The question is really whether any of the Bravia Cam’s many tricks will actually work worth a damn in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eefqZg"&gt;First, and this is the part I’m instinctively most wary of, the Bravia Cam will allow you to control 2022 Sony TVs with gesture controls from the couch. Want to power your TV off with a close of your fist? Have at it. Or you can pause your content or adjust the volume by waving your hand around. I’m having some Kinect flashbacks here, and it’s fair to say this isn’t an aspect of the Bravia Cam that Sony is selling me on. Not without trying it first, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cmL0FiBbUuxgnvihbfenVyjjbmw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142725/BRAVIA_CAM__CMU_BC1____Angled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bravia Cam mounts to the top of the TV and plugs into the USB port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MUNq0J"&gt;The other uses seem a little more interesting. With the Bravia Cam plugged in, you can set your Sony TV to display a proximity alert if it detects someone sitting too close to the screen. This is really intended for kids — the entire screen gets blacked out if you don’t move back — and is off by default. The camera can also be used for what Sony calls “viewing distance compensation,” with the brightness and voice emphasis settings both automatically adjusting based on how far away you’re sitting. Even the left and right channel sound balance can adjust itself for what side of the couch you’re planted on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDqUHY"&gt;And last is a power-saving feature where your Bravia TV will automatically dim if the Bravia Cam detects you’ve left the room. The timeframe where this happens can be adjusted anywhere from a minute after you leave to a full hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGOdkl"&gt;When it first gets to customers, the Bravia Cam will only be good for video chatting; Sony says a firmware update will be required to unlock all of its other features. For the privacy-conscious out there, there’s a hardware switch for physically turning off the camera and its built-in mic. Sony says that mic is used strictly for video chats — it’s not always listening — and according to the company, no private data is ever stored on the camera, the TV, or Sony’s servers. You can wipe the camera’s data at any time from your TV’s settings.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL announces 98-inch XL QLED TV, and you can buy it today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NezNqCKPpZuWgPbnoz0tnV1ReUE=/44x0:2036x1328/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345783/tcl98.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EU5qet"&gt;Last year, TCL announced an &lt;a href="https://www.tcl.com/us/en/products/home-theater/xl-collection"&gt;“XL” TV series&lt;/a&gt; that aimed to offer very big 85-inch displays for prices below what you’d pay for a similarly enormous set from, say, Samsung or LG. And in the first week of 2022, the XL lineup is going even larger. Today TCL is introducing a new 98-inch 4K QLED TV that’s available for purchase immediately. The 98R754 is a Google TV-based set that offers features like 4K gaming at 120Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDoM8I"&gt;As for the price, TCL is only saying that the latest XL model “starts at under $8,000.” So, that probably translates to $7,999. Even at that asking price, TCL claims the 98-inch QLED is “accessible” and honors the company’s “commitment to deliver powerful picture performance and big-screen immersion at an accessible price point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbCBcc"&gt;Images of the TV shared by TCL show that it has four HDMI ports, with two of them supporting 4K at 120Hz (though one of that pair also handles eARC duty). But the company isn’t saying much about other tech specs, so we’ll need to wait for retail listings to get the full scoop. It’s also running Google TV, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849334/tcl-google-tv-6-5-series-available-again-bug-fixes"&gt;should now be a smoother experience&lt;/a&gt; than when TCL’s first TVs with the software initially exhibited bugs and sluggish performance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ejL-c58smycTkULzuwOOKJYa6n0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143907/tenet.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We’re still using &lt;/em&gt;Tenet&lt;em&gt; for press images in 2022?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aC7dqA"&gt;TCL is also sharing some of its plans for other TV models coming later this year: every TCL Roku TV and Google TV will be upgraded in 2022. As part of that, customers can expect an even faster variable refresh rate of up to 144Hz for PC gaming — up from the standard 120Hz. (Samsung’s new 2022 TVs are also making this upgrade.) And TCL says more sets will make the leap from 4K to 8K resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPmbDv"&gt;In a bit of an unexpected move, TCL is also touting upcoming advancements in motion processing. It will be “partnering with Pixelworks and other entertainment leaders to define and deploy a new motion ecosystem — &lt;a href="https://www.pixelworks.com/en/truecut"&gt;TrueCut Motion&lt;/a&gt; — to its high-performance TV models for the first time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqfkvN"&gt;If you’re unfamiliar with TrueCut Motion like I was, here’s TCL’s brief rundown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hvTkfN"&gt;A critical component to great visual experiences, TrueCut Motion is an end-to-end solution that includes a new content delivery format and device certification program to guarantee a consistent filmmaker-approved output. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Sony is joining the Mini LED TV bandwagon in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HbLpWWO8hrOSoc_MmVrZXcAYCjs=/90x0:1950x1240/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345781/sonyminiled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XZ8g7U"&gt;Sony makes arguably the best OLED TVs that you can buy. They outperform LG’s own OLED sets in picture quality despite the fact that both companies use very similar panels from LG Display. That’s because Sony applies its own image processing to everything that you see on-screen. Even when the company adopts a new display technology, it leans on decades’ worth of TV hardware expertise to fine-tune everything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lczu33"&gt;And now that Sony’s got a good handle on OLED, it’s time for a new challenge: Mini LED. As part of its 2022 TV lineup, which also features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22629261"&gt;one of the world’s very first QD-OLED TVs&lt;/a&gt;, Sony is introducing its first Mini LED LCD TVs. The Z9K series will offer 8K resolution in 75- and 85-inch screen sizes, while the X95K sticks to 4K with 65-, 75-, and 85-inch models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TA7BUy"&gt;Like Mini LED TVs from other manufacturers, Sony’s will deliver much more precise local dimming than past models thanks to the backlight LEDs shrinking in size and growing in quantity. This produces improved contrast, higher peak brightness, better display uniformity, and black levels that inch closer to OLED. But even with Mini LED’s many strengths, sometimes you’ll still encounter blooming, which occurs when there’s a visible halo around bright objects (or text) on a dark screen. Sony says it’s put a ton of work into cutting down on blooming with the help of its “XR Backlight Master Drive” algorithms, which dynamically control the backlight to avoid blooming — without affecting brightness of your content. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mK63G-mr54h6c-fM0ju_7EWHs9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143995/sonymini.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony says its Mini LED TVs include anti-blooming measures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MCQ0ye"&gt;This year, Sony says it has also worked to enhance the depth of the picture on its TVs, applying different processing to near objects and the background. And all of the premium Sony TVs continue to feature the company’s very impressive Acoustic Multi-Audio speakers, which means you might actually be able to skip a soundbar; the Z9K has an 85-watt audio system, while the X95K comes in slightly lower at 60 watts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xW6LdU"&gt;All of Sony’s Mini LED models support 4K gaming at 120Hz, auto tone mapping when used with a PS5, and auto low latency mode. And Sony is finally shipping variable refresh rate support on these TVs at launch out of the box — no future firmware update required. Hopefully this is a sign that VRR support is nearing on the PS5 console as well. Sony is sticking with Google TV as its built-in software with the option for hands-free voice commands, and there’s also support for Apple AirPlay 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9BBtT"&gt;TCL led the Mini LED trend among TV makers, but since then Samsung, LG, and now Sony have switched to the same backlighting technique as they look to bridge the gap between traditional LCD TVs and OLED. Mini LED can achieve significantly higher peak brightness than OLED sets, though it still falls short of their infinite contrast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmPgae"&gt;Pricing for the 2022 Sony Bravia TVs and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22629527"&gt;also-announced Bravia Cam&lt;/a&gt; will be released in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Colonialism still influences the earth sciences today — and that’s a big problem for research </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="THAILAND-MYANMAR-ECONOMY-PALAEONTOLOGY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ACNgw3UgZjelRFqkIrmDbx87-Ho=/15x0:4536x3014/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345665/988418660.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;“Amber hunters” on a quest for a Jurassic Park-style discovery of dinosaur remains sift through mounds of the precious resin in Myanmar — a lucrative trade that captivates palaeontologists but also fuels a decades-long conflict in the far north.&amp;nbsp; | Photo credit should read LILLIAN SUWANRUMPHA/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A1n7GJ"&gt;Colonialism is so entangled in earth sciences that its ugly legacy still influences research today. Scientists are struggling to undo the damage that colonization has had on their fields, which have been dominated mostly by white men from wealthy nations over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rw4ztv"&gt;The latest evidence is a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01608-8"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last week that finds that 97 percent of fossil data in a major, global database comes from authors based in North America and Western Europe— indicating that scientists from western nations hold a global “monopoly over palaeontological knowledge production.” The authors say it’s a symptom of researchers from those nations “parachuting” into other countries and taking what they find away with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45Vt5G"&gt;Once researchers return to their home institutions, their findings are often inaccessible to people from the places where the research was conducted — often the same places where colonizers previously planted their flags without regard for the people who already lived there. Today, that creates barriers for local experts, whose contributions would be huge assets to our understanding of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WpHmws"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People are being denied the knowledge”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fY1qqK"&gt;“Basically what is happening is a lot of people are being denied the knowledge that they should have in the first place,” says Nussaïbah Raja-Schoob, a paleobiologist and lead author of the new &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01608-8"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XtobGV"&gt;The problem spreads way beyond paleontology. Across the earth sciences, locking away knowledge at elite institutions in the Global North impedes studies into the forces that shape the natural world. The inequity in who is conducting research and has access to data also risks biasing new research that’s supposed to help us understand what the world will look like in the future, says Raja-Schoob, who studies coral reef evolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r3WBVh"&gt;Raja-Schoob uses the fossil record to understand when corals went extinct, how they went extinct, and what survived. Her research relies on the very same global database that she found is composed almost entirely of works published by authors from North America and Western Europe. She worries that if the fossil record reflects biases in how mostly western researchers collect data, that it might influence the results of that research. Certain regions appear to be overrepresented in paleontological research, for example, which can create sampling biases. Myanmar, the Dominican Republic, and Morocco, for example, are among the most popular “research destinations,” according to her new study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AEFtk"&gt;Biases in the data Raja-Schoob works with are concerning because that data forms the foundation of scientific predictions about what might happen to corals in the future as the climate changes. The outlook for coral reefs is of particular importance because scientists are racing to save them from being wiped off the planet. &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;Ninety-nine percent of coral reefs&lt;/a&gt; around the world are expected to die off in the future if greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels continue unabated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwyP5g"&gt;The western bias in the earth sciences does more than skew our knowledge toward certain corners of the planet. According to Aline Ghilardi, one of Raja-Schoob’s co-authors and a paleontologist at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, it could lead to “the delay or even the impediment of great innovations and discoveries in a scientific field due to the lack of geographically comprehensive data, the plurality of ideas and good local knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ2Cj4"&gt;“This power imbalance can also turn many brilliant minds away from science, simply because they were not born in a ‘scientific power center’ or speaking English as their native language,” Ghilardi wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="qsMNID"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This power imbalance can also turn many brilliant minds away from science”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P8iJGK"&gt;The abundance of western researchers doing fieldwork in foreign countries can fuel other problems as well. Raja-Schoob points to amber — fossilized tree resin that might encase an insect, lizard, or even a dinosaur tail — as a particularly egregious example. No local Burmese researcher has ever been named in a paper on fossils found in Myanmar amber, Raja-Schoob and colleagues have found in their &lt;a href="https://paleoscientometrics.github.io/talks/2020-12-19-PalAss/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the purchase of Myanmar amber for paleontological research concentrated overseas is tied to human rights abuses to the extent that some paleontologists have pushed for a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/amber-myanmar-paleontologists.html"&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkhmZB"&gt;“Colonialism has been sort of a background for my own career and experiences in ecology because I am from India,” says Madhusudan Katti, an associate professor at North Carolina State University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADLFZe"&gt;As a PhD student in the 1990s, Katti studied warblers in India. But he couldn’t find much of the data he was looking for, about the birds’ migration across the Indian subcontinent, in India. Katti, who was enrolled in a US university at the time, happened to have a British professor who helped him gain access to a British museum with a much larger collection. Many researchers outside of the West aren’t so lucky, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yl2KRm"&gt;Katti co-authored a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01460-w"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in May about decolonizing ecology. It included a map showing that countries in Africa and South America that were formerly colonized by European powers have the most bird species named after European surnames. Today, there’s a whole &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22518931/racist-bird-names-black-birders-washington-post"&gt;movement&lt;/a&gt; to scrap racist bird names. If successful, up to 150 birds named after people who benefited from slavery might get new monikers. There are also activists pushing for museums to give back the fossils, antiquities, and specimens they’ve collected from the Global South over generations without locals’ consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGFlc2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00139157.2021.1924574?journalCode=venv20"&gt;National parks and other “protected areas”&lt;/a&gt; are another prevalent example of how the colonial mentality seeps into modern-day conservation efforts, Katti says. These landscapes are typically legally protected from urban development, but usually only after their original inhabitants, who lived there for generations without destroying the landscape, were pushed out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zT4u6E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Honoring local knowledge, and expertise&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3JBR1D"&gt;“We’ve constrained our thinking about ecosystems by thinking of people and nature as separate categories. And I think that’s an exclusive result of the European colonial outlook,” Katti says. To heal old wounds and keep history from repeating itself, Katti’s paper emphasizes honoring local knowledge and expertise. There’s growing &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/6/3015"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, on ecosystems that flourish under Indigenous guardianship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rN1Zmd"&gt;There are ways to chip away at the injustices embedded in the foundations of the earth sciences. Raja-Schoob, Ghilardi, and Katti have outlined some of them in their recently published papers. Acknowledging that sordid history is a start, they write. From there, steps can be taken to make sure more people have access to the body of knowledge that’s become concentrated in museums and academic institutions across Europe and North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeO5Bt"&gt;Improved access might involve repatriating items in museums back to the communities they were taken from, a movement that’s been picking up steam in places like New York City. Activists have targeted the American Museum of Natural History, for instance, &lt;a href="https://decolonizethisplace.org/monh"&gt;demanding&lt;/a&gt; that “human remains, sacred things, and objects of power stolen from Indigenous peoples should be returned.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXydjA"&gt;It’s also important to decolonize the mainstream definition of who is considered an “expert” to make it more inclusive of Indigenous peoples or other local knowledge-keepers, Katti says. They have intimate knowledge of their homelands, even if that isn’t acknowledged with a Phd attached to their names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2DsfUP"&gt;Scientists like Raja-Schoob also want to see more pathways into academia for people from underrepresented communities. That can happen through more dedicated funding for collaboration between foreign and local researchers, she and Ghilardi write in their paper. “Our current practice is not sustainable and could also be biasing our science,” she says. “We have to learn how to develop ethical collaborations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiRR5y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5K5st"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s latest Nest Hub display is nearly half off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zgWII76WV90UwPBnTDmDt_r4oJc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345651/dseifert_20210323_4485_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s latest Nest Hub is on sale today for just $59.99, its second-best price to date.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ip6mXW"&gt;If you were secretly hoping for a smart home display for Christmas but didn’t receive one, today you can treat yourself to one of the best for almost half its usual price. Right now, you can grab Google’s second-gen Nest Hub — our pick for one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"&gt;best smart displays&lt;/a&gt; — for its second-best price to date at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1629831-REG%2Fgoogle_ga01331_us_nest_hub_2_chalk.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865019%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-apple-watch-series-7-wacom-one-airtag-loop-lg-a1-tv-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglklYIiBv6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/1181395/1036?subId1=verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga01331us.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;. Typically $99.99, it’s currently on sale for $59.99, which is only $10 shy of its all-time low during Black Friday. As mentioned in our review, Google’s small second-gen smart display remains an excellent digital photo frame for displaying images from Google Photos, and it offers automatic and reliable sleep-tracking features. It’s also a better speaker than its predecessor and grants you access to Google Assistant’s full suite of features. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="r49OiG"&gt;We’re four days into 2022, and if you’re starting to struggle with your New Year’s fitness resolutions, 1) welcome to the club and 2) today’s Apple Watch Series 7 deal may be just what you were looking for. For those still resolved to get healthier this year, you have another chance to snag Apple’s latest smartwatch for its lowest price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is once again selling the 41mm, GPS-equipped Apple Watch Series 7 in green with a matching Sport Band for $339 instead of $399 after briefly offering the same discount two weeks ago. The Apple Watch Series 7 offers a larger, edge-to-edge display than its last-gen counterpart, along with IP6X dust resistance. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gFFySg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OfP5UO"&gt;On the other hand, if you’re more the type of person who prefers lounging around watching TV over going for a run, 1) again, welcome to the club, and 2) we’ve got a solid deal on a relatively inexpensive OLED. LG’s A1 OLED offers deep black levels, great color accuracy, and wide viewing angles, along with support for both Alexa and Google Assistant. It doesn’t offer the advanced gaming features found with the more expensive LG C1, like variable refresh rate and HDMI 2.1 ports, but if features don’t matter to you, this more budget-friendly OLED might be worth checking out. Right now, you can pick up the A1 in the 48-inch configuration at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F164937252697%3Famdata%3Denc%253AAQAGAAAAkPb26u5XMepclSzddcMwulBMyRV7VoW7jhFGXzqcUALNBOfJF40hvardXAswI2hhBD%252FV9LwELQn5%252BpYRjH9OqNpRBcQRO4riIzygFfx%252BN1mdH588QsfiP1SZMz2OOdJxP7SlL7X1TehcgQQNos0bWwl0fLSgnZj%252FDLs22rdTUl7kLyufQSQ053Ou5CEXrYLMZQ%253D%253D%257Ctkp%253ABFBMxO2r1sRf%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3Dvergedeals010422%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865019%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-apple-watch-series-7-wacom-one-airtag-loop-lg-a1-tv-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Built-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED48A1PUA/dp/B092LZNZB7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $846.99, or $849.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglGbOlG5KN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; instead of paying its original $1,199.99 price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pYtoHG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10959416"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KIdKv3"&gt;Looking for a way to express your creativity at a discount? Wacom’s most affordable drawing tablet is now available for its best price to date. Geared toward entry-level artists and social media content creators, Wacom’s One Drawing Tablet &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082LZXQ6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $299.95 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $100 off of the typical listing price. Our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21028405/wacom-one-tablet-pen-display-android-price-macos-windows-ces-2020" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hands-on impressions left us impressed&lt;/a&gt; with this tablet, namely its matte display, which felt great to draw on. The 13-inch, 1920 x 1080 HD slate is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS, as well as some Android tablets and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJuiNy"&gt;Additionally, the Wacom One comes with a pressure-sensitive stylus and limited-time access to various creative software services, including a two-month subscription to Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, along with six months of access to Adobe Fresco. Note, however, that the drawing tablet lacks support for USB-C, so you’ll need a dongle to connect it to newer MacBook models and Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FyisAx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10959354"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nvajca"&gt;Nintendo Switch owners can nab a complimentary 128GB SanDisk microSD card from Best Buy when they purchase an &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglmcaHay7K" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;annual family membership to Nintendo Switch Online for $34.99&lt;/a&gt;. The membership grants up to eight local Switch users access to more than 70 SNES and NES games, along with perks like online multiplayer, exclusive offers (like access to purchase one of the &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-64-controller.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard-to-find wireless Nintendo 64 controllers&lt;/a&gt;), and cloud storage for game saves. SanDisk’s bundled microSD card, meanwhile, gives your Switch an extra 128GB of storage, so you can store more games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL is bringing two new budget 5G phones to US carriers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DaVVvoLFzwZnegeDZgz5zizsXMI=/0x49:2480x1702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345550/TCL_30_V_5G_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NPQoRa"&gt;TCL will debut a total of eight new phones globally in 2022, but it’s kicking the year off by introducing two models coming exclusively to the US: the TCL 30 XE 5G and TCL 30 V 5G. The 30 XE 5G offers a 6.52-inch 90Hz display and will be sold initially at T-Mobile with other carrier availability later in the year. The 30 V 5G will be exclusive to Verizon, with sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G connectivity. With these new devices, TCL looks to be playing to its strengths in the budget market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfYUKd"&gt;The TCL 30 V 5G boasts a slightly bigger 6.67-inch 1080p display with a standard 60Hz refresh rate. It uses a Snapdragon 480 5G chipset with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The 30 V includes a 50-megapixel main rear camera and a 5-megapixel ultrawide, alongside 2-megapixel macro and 16-megapixel selfie cameras. It offers a 4,500mAh battery and comes with Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fPmZW3aeJ9K2i3CK8Bra7xa8O1g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130731/TCL_30_V_5G_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 30 V 5G is a Verizon exclusive with all flavors of 5G connectivity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L52BGC"&gt;The TCL 30 XE is positioned as an entry-level 5G device with a 720p display, MediaTek Dimensity 700 chipset, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of built-in storage. It offers a 13-megapixel rear main camera and an 8-megapixel selfie cam, plus rear depth and macro sensors. The 30 XE also includes a 4,500mAh battery and ships with Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_8KWHCw7s7t4hTixLDCFXFaUAVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130743/TCL_30_XE_5G_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 30 XE 5G includes a 90Hz display for smoother animations and scrolling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wbO3JT"&gt;The 30-series marks TCL’s third generation of devices bearing the display maker’s own branding — previously, it produced phones for other brands. While last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22560849/tcl-20-pro-5g-review-screen-battery-price-specs"&gt;upper midrange 20 Pro 5G&lt;/a&gt; didn’t quite hit the mark, we thought its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22717002/tcl-20s-and-20se-review-budget-affordable-unlocked-smartphone"&gt;sub-$300 devices&lt;/a&gt; were a great bargain with their big, vibrant screens and low price tags. TCL appears to be leaning into the US budget market with its devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41NjJh"&gt;TCL says both phones will launch “in the coming weeks.” There’s no pricing announced yet, but it’s a fair bet that the Verizon phone will cost more and require a premium unlimited plan to get the most out of it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL wants its latest budget tablets to be easy on the eyes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WWiMWDIyCHI5GvjscStkVwkCpwU=/93x220:2388x1750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345526/tcl_nxtpaper10s_ces2022.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The TCL Nxtpaper 10S tablet reduces blue light by 10 percent. | Image by TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UvjRLV"&gt;TCL introduced a lineup of new tablets at CES this year, which includes its latest iteration of the NxtPaper and budget-friendly Tab series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5DmpfP"&gt;The NxtPaper 10S offers a similar “paper-like” display and a focus on combatting eye strain as its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219269/tcl-nxtpaper-tablet-color-display-ereader"&gt;eight-inch predecessor&lt;/a&gt;. But this isn’t electronic paper. It’s a 10.1-inch IPS display that TCL says reduces blue light by 50 percent and has an anti-glare finish. Unlike the previously released NxtPaper tablet, the 10S comes with a proprietary T Pen to jot down notes and boasts a bigger 8,000mAh battery. The NxtPaper 10S is set to go on sale for $249 in Europe and China next month.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The budget-friendly TCL Tab 8 comes with 4G LTE connectivity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="58H6kD"&gt;TCL’s Tab 8 4G is apparently designed with affordability in mind and appears to be a step down from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22736065/tcl-tab-pro-5g-verizon-mmwave-tablet-device"&gt;the 5G Tab Pro&lt;/a&gt; that the company released in October of last year. It comes with a 4,080mAh battery and, as its name suggests, the option for 4G LTE connectivity. TCL is releasing this tablet alongside another low-cost option, the Tab 10L, which has a 10.1-inch HD screen but doesn’t support mobile connectivity. The Tab 8 4G will cost $129 and will come to European markets sometime in the first quarter of this year, while the Tab 10L will be priced at just $99 and will be available in “select markets” around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TCL TKEE Mini comes with bumpers to help protect it from drops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1wluXC"&gt;Lastly, TCL’s TKEE series of tablets are built specifically for children and have displays that TCL claims will protect kids’ eyes. There are three tiers: the TKEE Mini, Mid, and Max, with the Mid model being the only one of the bunch that supports 4G connectivity. Each tablet sports a rugged design with bumpers that are supposed to protect it from drops, along with a TKEE Pen that kids can use to draw or write on the tablet. Although the TKEE series was &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/tcl-launches-alcatel-tkee-tablets-for-kids-in-india"&gt;previously launched in India&lt;/a&gt; last year, it’s slated for release “in select regions” at the beginning of this year, starting at $89 for the Mini, $149 for the Mid, and $119 for the Max. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Version two of TCL’s wearable display glasses are lighter and less dorky-looking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IFNxfk_TpazNRLm7mVLJt51Nf4U=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345514/__13.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NxtWear Air is a personal secondary display for your phone or laptop embedded in a pair of glasses frames.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEnFQD"&gt;TCL is preparing to launch a second iteration of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22221389/tcl-wearable-display-glasses-moveaudio-s600-pet-tracker-ces"&gt;wearable personal display&lt;/a&gt; it released in limited supply last year. Version two, called NxtWear Air, offers the same secondary-display-in-a-pair-of-glasses function as the original but has been made 30 percent lighter — down to 75g compared to 130g. TCL has made some adjustments for the style-conscious, too, tweaking the design to look more like a normal pair of sunglasses and less like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545583/tcl-nxtwear-g-wearable-display-glasses-availability-price"&gt;something you’d be embarrassed to wear in public&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvbDqj"&gt;NxtWear Air, like its NxtWear G predecessor, offers two 1080p Micro OLEDs embedded in a pair of glasses frames that should give the wearer the effect of viewing a 140-inch screen from about 13 feet away. Its lenses are opaque, and the glasses don’t offer AR or VR functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T-HaUch8sOBSMyPS9eV8Qz6Rjeo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131389/___11.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swappable plates attach to the front of the frames via magnets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tkE34P"&gt;Instead, it acts as a secondary display that you wear on your face, using USB-C to connect to a DisplayPort-compatible phone, tablet, or laptop. Stereo speakers are built in, but if you don’t want to annoy everyone in earshot, you should connect Bluetooth or wired headphones instead. This year’s model also comes with two magnetic interchangeable plates that attach to the front of the frames to change up the style of the glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoBjI2"&gt;TCL says NxtWear Air will launch in Q1 of 2022. There’s no word on which regions it will be available in, and TCL hasn’t revealed a price for them yet. NxtWear G went on sale in a limited run in Australia last year priced at $899 (about $680 US), so expect to spend a little money for the most private monitor you can use on a plane.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>JBL’s latest portable speakers bring the light show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lwUYXL-EHmbleotilHcKBniP-qQ=/47x0:553x337/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345521/jbl_light_show.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CfRx5J"&gt;Today JBL is taking the wraps off three new portable speakers. The diminutive Pulse 5 and more powerful PartyBox Encore feature integrated light shows, while the BoomBox 3 tries to split the difference with a more stoic, bass-focused design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0ssKg"&gt;The waterproof and dustproof (IP67) JBL Pulse 5 ($249.95/£219.99/€249) is a portable Bluetooth 5.3 speaker that fires 360-degree sound and lighting for up to 12 hours on rechargeable battery. The lights can be customized via the JBL Portable app and work without playing any sound at all. The speaker can also be combined with other JBL PartyBoost-enabled speakers for bigger sound and more dynamic lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CokHGAiKwCEz_ytA9u4frkVBYDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131831/JBL_Partybox_Encore_Lifestyle_with_mic.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: JBL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JBL PartyBox Encore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iQPWgJ"&gt;JBL bills the 100 watt PartyBox Encore ($399.95/£299.99/€349) as a “compact party speaker” that includes a digital wireless mic for singalongs. It flashes along with the beat from Bluetooth 5.1 audio streams for up to 10 hours on battery. Audio can also be sourced over USB and Aux-in jacks, and an interface on top gives direct control over the lightshow, mic, and volume. Integrated handles still allow for portability, but its IPX4-rated resistance to splashes makes it less rugged than the Pulse 5.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikI9NbD2aHNGT4IMXqcPz4mMgcY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131830/JBL_BOOMBOX3_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: JBL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JBL BoomBox 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="23I2f4"&gt;JBL is also announcing a new Boombox 3 ($499.95/£449.99/€549) speaker update. It doesn’t include any lighting, but it does come packing a subwoofer, two mid-range drivers, and two tweeters that should provide chest-thumping sound for up to 24 hours before needing a recharge. JBL says the Boombox 3 can deliver deeper bass than its Boombox predecessors alongside “intense clarity.” Other specs include an IP67 waterproof and dustproof rating, Bluetooth 5.3 streaming, and a built-in power bank feature that can charge your phone. It’ll ship in both black and “squad” (read: camouflage) colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odD50S"&gt;JBL says that all three speakers should be available to buy sometime this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
