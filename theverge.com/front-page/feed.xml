    <title>Twitter joins Instagram in copying TikTok’s reaction videos</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter’s new “quote tweet with reaction” feature | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="04LXNr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1479185495267721218"&gt;Twitter has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s testing a feature called “quote tweet with reaction,” where you can embed a copy of a tweet into a photo or video instead of just replying to it with text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3H1Ai2"&gt;Twitter says that the feature is currently being tested on iOS. If you have access to the feature, the retweet menu will have a “Quote Tweet with reaction” button. Tapping it will take you to a screen where you can take a photo or video to put the tweet on top of, or choose one from your camera roll. One of Twitter’s product leads did &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samhaves/status/1479189730948378630"&gt;a reaction quote tweet to the announcement&lt;/a&gt;, which lets us see how the reactions will show up to users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KTOqmD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tweet reaction videos can now start on Twitter!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Testing on iOS: when you tap the Retweet icon, choose “Quote Tweet with reaction” to create and customize your very own Tweet Take –– a reaction video (or photo) with the Tweet embedded. &lt;a href="https://t.co/1E30F8rKYh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1E30F8rKYh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1479185495267721218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5hCGehy4Y7CHtSKglOjeY52BlHM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23150607/ezgif_3_da208613da.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The process of creating a reaction to a tweet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AhYXy7"&gt;The feature is similar to TikTok’s video replies, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832529/instagram-reels-visual-replies-feature-tiktok-copy"&gt;Instagram recently copied for its Reels feature&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter itself has also been adding new ways to share tweets — in December 2020, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166657/twitter-share-tweets-snapchat-snap-ios-feature-launch"&gt;added the ability to embed a tweet in a Snapchat message or story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlX0kJ"&gt;Some Twitter users, as well as staff members at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, have expressed concern that these reaction quote tweets could be an easy vector for harassment. While it’s relatively easy for the platform to moderate regular quote tweets, it’s harder to programmatically scan the contents of a photo or video. Some of Twitter’s other features include mitigations like being able to opt out of photo tagging, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575998/twitter-tweet-change-who-can-reply-after-you-post"&gt;limiting who can reply to your tweets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxCV96"&gt;However, Twitter spokesperson Viviana Wiewall told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that “currently you won’t be able to turn off who can and can’t” use the feature on your tweets, as it inherits the standard quote tweet behavior. When asked if the feature being used for harassment was a concern, they replied: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="drR8JG"&gt;The safety of people on Twitter is our priority and while we don’t anticipate this being used in a harmful fashion, we’ll be closely monitoring the usage of the product and ensure that any abuse is adjudicated as per the Twitter Rules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="W1ejsR"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1479202496467898376"&gt;company also announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s testing a new design that lets you starting writing a tweet from the main timeline view, instead of hitting a button that takes you to a compose screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OSw1Tp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re making it easier to start a Tweet with a new composer bar above the bottom navigation menu. Now testing with some of you on iOS. &lt;a href="https://t.co/jXb260Gm08"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jXb260Gm08&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1479202496467898376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dtbjpk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 6th, 4:50PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about the new composer bar Twitter is testing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fENiIZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 6th, 5:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added response from Twitter spokesperson about harassment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 14 Pro could have a hole-punch camera and hide Face ID under the screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XtOn0HOK_-DLvNsROUueKzaePwE=/0x0:2032x1355/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70356798/akrales_210917_4760_0175.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K7LIn7"&gt;Rumors for Apple’s upcoming 2022 iPhone refresh are continuing to roll, with Twitter leaker DylanDKT claiming that the iPhone 14 Pro lineup will feature a pill-shaped hole-punch design for its front-facing camera, with the bulk of Apple’s Face ID hardware being placed under the display (instead of an eyesore of a notch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5ptVR"&gt;The report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683948/iphone-14-rumor-foldable-fingerprint-48mp-punch-hole"&gt;corroborates earlier rumors&lt;/a&gt; from well-regarded Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from late last year, which also claimed that the 2022 iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max would be shifting over to a hole-punch cutout for the camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u4eRCO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I am able to corroborate information regarding a hole punch camera for the pro models of the iPhone 14. Face ID hardware will be placed under the display. As a reassurance to any concerns, the functionality of these sensors have not been negatively affected by this change.&lt;/p&gt;— Dylan (@dylandkt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1479110144088686604?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7qSRig"&gt;Apple made its first major change to the iPhone’s Face ID notch with last year’s iPhone 13 lineup, which featured a slightly smaller notch than the original design that Apple had used since 2017’s iPhone X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8U0HIa"&gt;And moving the Face ID array beneath the screen while keeping a cutout does make a lot of sense: Face ID’s IR-based setup would be less impacted by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;haziness and weak colors&lt;/a&gt; that exist for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776271/under-display-selfie-cameras-zte-microsoft-xiaomi"&gt;current under-display front-facing cameras&lt;/a&gt;, and reducing the iPhone 14 Pro’s notch to a smaller cutout would put Apple back on even footing with Android competitors, who have long since left Apple’s oversized notch in the dust with years of diminutive camera cutout designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAjn1j"&gt;That said, it seems that Apple might be looking to the slimmed-down notch as a design differentiator between the pricier iPhone 14 Pro lineup and the standard iPhone 14 models, which are said to be keeping the existing Face ID notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQ7634"&gt;Additionally, it seems that Apple’s under-display ambitions will still only extend to the Face ID camera array: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683948/iphone-14-rumor-foldable-fingerprint-48mp-punch-hole"&gt;Kuo’s late 2021 report&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Apple’s long-rumored plans to bring back its Touch ID sensor in the form of an under-display fingerprint scanner won’t happen until 2023 at the earliest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyY5Xg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1479164229567537152"&gt;DylanDKT also claims&lt;/a&gt; that Apple will be released an updated iPhone SE model in 2022, which will keep the same broad design as the current 2020 SE but add 5G and improved specs. Meanwhile, a foldable iPhone is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1479157616983130113%5C"&gt;still said&lt;/a&gt; to be in the prototyping phase, with Apple reportedly “playing the long game to see how the technology progresses” before it commits to a consumer device — a claim that’s also in line with Kuo’s earlier reports. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Natural Cycles’ data shows limited menstrual changes after COVID-19 vaccination</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Feminine hygiene articles" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m13ccdGHT6hVMz4fd2smVQUh9FE=/0x1529:3613x3938/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70356793/1229921387.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Annette Riedl/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JOoGVG"&gt;Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is associated with only a small change to the menstrual cycle, according to a &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000004695"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; using data from the birth control app Natural Cycles. The study follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374523/covid-vaccine-period-heavy-survey"&gt;widespread reports&lt;/a&gt; of heavier and longer periods from people who had recently been vaccinated after the start of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PSc5f"&gt;“This is reassuring for health and reproductive health,” says Alison Edelman, a study author and professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health and Science University. “It’s also validating in regard to patients reporting that they’d experienced something.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCSEj0"&gt;Longer, heavier periods were always a plausible side effect of COVID-19 vaccination. Any stress on the immune system can affect the menstrual cycle, although that doesn’t mean there’s any impact on fertility. (The vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-vaccines-show-no-signs-of-harming-fertility-or-sexual-function/"&gt;does not&lt;/a&gt; impact fertility or pregnancy.) The National Institutes of Health (NIH) put out a call last spring for research proposals that could look into the question of impacts on periods. The NIH wanted analysis to happen quickly and asked for studies to be based on data that followed people over time — so it could look at menstrual cycles from both before and after vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5eXs9K"&gt;Edelman turned to period tracking apps as a source for that data. Her team spoke with both Natural Cycles and Clue, another tracking app. (They’re still analyzing data from Clue, and she says that will likely be included in future studies.) The data these apps provide is “a treasure trove,” Edelman says. People who use the apps can agree to let their anonymized period tracking information be used for research, and Natural Cycles had already been asking users about vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7VtFr"&gt;“This is the best data that we can get for something like this unless they had included the question in the vaccine trials themselves,” Edelman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pWO9Q"&gt;The new Natural Cycles study, which included information on six consecutive menstrual cycles from nearly 4,000 people in the United States, didn’t show major disruptions after COVID-19 vaccination. Overall, there was no change in the length of people’s periods after vaccination. People who were vaccinated had a less than one-day increase in the length of time &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; periods after getting their vaccine compared with the three cycles before vaccination. A small group of people in the study who got both doses of a vaccine within the same cycle were more likely to have a longer increase in their cycle — around two days. The length went back to normal by two cycles later. Anything under an eight-day variation in cycle length is considered normal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWhXD1"&gt;The findings are consistent with data from a &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.15.21266317v1.full.pdf+html"&gt;still-unpublished study&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom, which didn’t find major menstrual changes associated with vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWV1Wf"&gt;The team is planning to look at data on the heaviness of people’s periods after vaccination, as well, Edelman says. They’re also planning to look at Natural Cycles’ data from people in other countries. Other research teams funded by NIH are also pressing forward with their studies on menstrual cycles and the COVID-19 vaccine, and that data should be published soon, she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evbusi"&gt;But this first set of data helps give doctors and patients solid information on what to expect after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. “We’re now able to tell people really concretely that, okay, just like you might get a headache or you might get a fever, there is a chance that you might have a slight change in your menstrual cycle length,” Edelman says. “And also, that it looks like it’s only temporary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYvoBJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mozilla pauses accepting crypto donations following backlash</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5YkBkN438Q1bMrqkirHJRKwju-w=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70356621/acastro_170726_1777_0007_v3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C1Aitx"&gt;Mozilla, the nonprofit organization that makes the Firefox web browser, announced Thursday that it would be pausing the ability to accept cryptocurrency donations following significant backlash spurred in part by a Mozilla founder, Jamie Zawinski (&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mozilla-crypto-donations-jamie-zawinski-2022-1"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwT6sV"&gt;Zawinski, who stopped working for mozilla.org &lt;a href="https://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nomo.html"&gt;in 1999&lt;/a&gt;, tweeted scathing criticism to a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1476951030638260225"&gt;December 31st Mozilla tweet&lt;/a&gt; promoting that it accepted cryptocurrency donations. Mozilla began accepting bitcoin for donations &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-now-accepts-bitcoin/"&gt;in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qROkaC"&gt;“Everyone involved in the project should be witheringly ashamed of this decision to partner with planet-incinerating Ponzi grifters,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jwz/status/1478022085737803776"&gt;Zawinski said&lt;/a&gt; on January 3rd. (Cryptocurrencies have come under significant scrutiny for their &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/03/climate/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-electricity.html"&gt;impact on the environment&lt;/a&gt; and the fact that the bulk of supposed crypto wealth seems to currently be available to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoins-one-percent-controls-lions-share-of-the-cryptocurrencys-wealth-11639996204"&gt;limited few&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GI1wL9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hi, I'm sure that whoever runs this account has no idea who I am, but I founded &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mozilla?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@mozilla&lt;/a&gt; and I'm here to say fuck you and fuck this. Everyone involved in the project should be witheringly ashamed of this decision to partner with planet-incinerating Ponzi grifters.&lt;/p&gt;— j͕̠̦̪͕̓͛̊̾̄ͅw̧̧̳̪̘͊̋͗̾͢͠z̢̘̞͈̺̞̩̓̽̐̋͗̆̋̚͟͜ (@jwz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jwz/status/1478022085737803776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 3, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fCSMBF"&gt;Peter Linss, who made the Gecko engine that underpins Firefox, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/plinss/status/1478135256683143168"&gt;tweeted his disapproval&lt;/a&gt; to Mozilla as well. “What. The. Actual. Fuck,” he said. “You were meant to be better than this.” And it’s not just them — many quote-tweets of Mozilla’s December 31st post &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1476951030638260225/retweets/with_comments"&gt;are brutal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wcniu9"&gt;On Thursday, Mozilla addressed the situation in a Twitter thread. “Last week, we tweeted a reminder that Mozilla accepts cryptocurrency donations,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1479143340159422468"&gt;Mozilla said&lt;/a&gt;. “This led to an important discussion about cryptocurrency’s environmental impact.” Mozilla says it will be “reviewing if and how our current policy on crypto donations fits with our climate goals,” and while that review is taking place, it will be pausing crypto donations. It also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1479143343531692032"&gt;promised that&lt;/a&gt; the review will be “a transparent process” and that it will “share regular updates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BloCBH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In the spirit of open-source, this will be a transparent process and we'll share regular updates. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We look forward to having this conversation and appreciate our community for bringing this to our attention. 4/4&lt;/p&gt;— Mozilla (@mozilla) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1479143343531692032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="93k8u9"&gt;However, Mozilla isn’t completely distancing itself from decentralized technologies like cryptocurrency, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1479143341262577676"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; “decentralized web technology continues to be an important area for us to explore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laSqfr"&gt;“I’m glad Mozilla reversed course here,” Peter Linss said in a Twitter DM to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; after we first published this article. “They play a crucial role in keeping the web open and free. I’m also grateful for the support of all the fans of Mozilla helping to keep them accountable to the ideals they were founded under.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTrSIC"&gt;Mozilla is just the latest company to take heat for its involvement with cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. Tesla was lambasted for its decision to accept bitcoin as payment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22347905/tesla-bitcoin-payment-us-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, and it reversed the policy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433153/tesla-suspend-bitcoin-vehicle-purchase-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;soon after&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>E3 2022 will be online-only again following COVID-19 surges</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="94TS8w"&gt;E3 — one of the largest video game trade shows of the year — will once again be an online-only event this summer, the ESA has announced, citing ongoing concerns around the COVID-19 pandemic. The news, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/01/06/e3-shifts-to-online-only-event-because-of-omicron-concerns/"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, marks the third year in a row that E3 will have skipped its in-person event due to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYzmch"&gt;“Due to the ongoing health risks surrounding COVID-19 and its potential impact on the safety of exhibitors and attendees, E3 will not be held in person in 2022,” the ESA commented in a statement to &lt;em&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/em&gt;. “We are nonetheless excited about the future of E3 and look forward to announcing more details soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xd4DQ8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;E3 will miss a third straight year in person&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CReIOY"&gt;The ESA had originally planned to bring back E3 as an in-person conference in 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22368617/e3-2021-virtual-event-digital-microsoft-nintendo"&gt;announcing in April 2021&lt;/a&gt; (when it officially moved that year’s conference to a digital event) that “the ESA looks forward to coming back together to celebrate E3 2022 in person.” But with the onset of the omicron variant and case numbers surging in the United States, the ESA appears to have decided that it’s not worth the risk of hosting a conference packed with thousands of journalists, game developers, and fans this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3WBAT"&gt;E3’s cancellation of an in-person event is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22869140/grammys-sundance-film-festival-postponed-virtual-omicron-coronavirus"&gt;latest in a series of major events&lt;/a&gt; that have been derailed by COVID’s latest surge: the Grammys awards show was just indefinitely postponed from its original January 31st date, while the Sundance Film Festival is also going online-only, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7B3s26"&gt;The ESA isn’t the only one looking forward to summer gaming events; shortly after the news that E3 2022 would be a virtual event, gaming industry personality Geoff Keighley announced that his own “Summer Games Fest” event (which itself strove to fill the space left by E3’s cancellation in 2020) would also be returning in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iRacing buys Monster Games, teases racing games for the ‘broader market’ like consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series race at virtual Chicago Street Course" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YH4yCxtfYWCxutiK2cDyJCjb__M=/251x0:2963x1808/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70356339/1321405595.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;James Davison, driver of the #15 Chevrolet races during the eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series race at virtual Chicago Street Course on June 02, 2021 in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SXK9eV"&gt;One of the paid subscription services that experienced sudden growth during the pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/features/iracing-nascar-made-in-america/"&gt;has been &lt;em&gt;iRacing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While real-life racing leagues were on hiatus, they used the detailed and realistic sim racing service as an esports broadcasting platform, and enough new people started playing to grow its base of racers on PC from 110,000 at the beginning of 2020 to over 200,000 today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6saIAA"&gt;Now iRacing.com Motorsport Simulations &lt;a href="https://www.iracing.com/iracing-acquires-monster-games/"&gt;says it has acquired Monster Games, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; (MGI). That Minnesota-based studio developed the first four games under the &lt;em&gt;NASCAR Heat&lt;/em&gt; brand and its most recent title, &lt;em&gt;SRX: The Game&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for play on PC and the PlayStation and Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="J7Xt6q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Pro drivers are competing with gamers after F1 and NASCAR canceled races","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/22/21184192/sim-racing-coronavirus-f1-nascar-iracing-veloce-esports-max-verstappen-lando-norris"},{"title":"Fox will broadcast NASCAR’s substitute sim racing ‘season’ on television","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21194033/fox-nascar-iracing-pro-series-broadcast-dale-earnhardt-jr"},{"title":"NBC will broadcast IndyCar’s virtual replacement races on TV","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203305/nbc-indycar-iracing-series-broadcast-sim-online-esports"},{"title":"ESPN to air live NBA 2K League games ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248075/espn-espn2-live-nba-2k-league-games-esports-matches"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HxYcJ5"&gt;A press release announcing the purchase is careful to note, “The iRacing development team will remain 100% focused on continuing to develop the core product, &lt;em&gt;iRacing&lt;/em&gt;.” But Monster Games’ experience making console games is clearly a part of the plans going forward, as the release also says this deal will “further the company’s ability to bring the highest quality racing games to the broader market, including the console space.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQlaSB"&gt;Pumped up by its subscriber growth, iRacing also recently acquired Orontes Games, which had already developed a proprietary game engine to power the high-res graphics and advanced physics for its &lt;em&gt;Drag&lt;/em&gt; racing game that’s available via Steam Early Access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JfWG1"&gt;Rich Garcia, CEO of Monster Games, has a history with iRacing CEO Dave Kaemmer from the early days of Kaemmer’s previous company, Papyrus, working on well-regarded PC racing games. The plan is for MGI to release an unannounced title in development later this year and then develop games using the resources of all three studios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTdH3c"&gt;More information on what’s next is promised “in the coming year.” Still, a quote from Kaemmer gives a strong hint about what we should expect, “We are at a point as a company that we are comfortable building out these two new teams to explore the broader racing game market to ultimately funnel serious sim racers to our flagship product &lt;em&gt;iRacing&lt;/em&gt; on the PC. Rich and the Monster team will be an important part of that strategy as we use our code and experience to bring their games to another level.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nRUY2"&gt;An &lt;em&gt;iRacing &lt;/em&gt;port for the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X seems unlikely, based on that statement, but bringing its ultra-realistic data to racing games built for play on consoles, as well as continued tech upgrades for the flagship title, appears to be a safe bet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eargo’s new hearing aids can automatically adjust to your environment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IXrZ_p_sEwuPIWfII3unY6AqpWg=/0x243:7051x4944/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70355632/E6_full_charger_hd_off_Logos_1__3_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eargo 6 automatically adjust to a user’s environment.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Eargo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GvYLxb"&gt;While a lot of health tech shown at CES is doomed to become vaporware, there’s reason to believe that 2022 is going to be a big year for hearables. Case in point: Eargo, a CES regular since 2015, is announcing the Eargo 6. The buds are the sixth iteration of the company’s smart hearing aids and feature nifty new tech that automatically adjusts sound levels on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvbH3O"&gt;Hearing aids work by converting sound picked up by a microphone into a digital signal that’s then amplified. They can also amplify certain sounds, like your voice, while also dampening background noise. Eargo’s are registered as an &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_events/1022593/mann.pdf"&gt;FDA Class II exempt device&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they are a medium-risk device with specialized controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Re1lG9"&gt;Given that this is Eargo’s sixth version of its hearing aids, some of the updates are iterative. For instance, the new Eargo 6 is better at masking background noise and “noise between pauses in speech.” It’s also got improved IPX7 water resistance. And Eargo added a “mask mode,” which allows the device to more accurately compensate for how masks dampen a speaker’s voice. But the big update this year is a new feature Eargo dubs Sound Adjust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5bSJl"&gt;Sound Adjust builds upon the Eargo 5’s Sound Match feature, which plays sounds in each ear at different volumes and pitches. That creates a personalized hearing profile that can be used to tune the device based on a specific environment, be it a loud restaurant or a meeting. The only issue with the Eargo 5 Sound Match feature was that the initial test to create a personalized hearing profile took 8–10 minutes, and if you ever wanted to update that profile, it requires putting them in the charger and waiting up to five minutes. For &lt;a href="https://help.eargo.com/en/articles/5159823-volume"&gt;temporary adjustments on the go&lt;/a&gt;, you’d have to pull out your phone or tap your ear. Eargo says the new Sound Adjust feature builds on this tech via a proprietary algorithm to identify your environment without user input and then automatically modify the hearing aids’ settings. In a nutshell, it’s going from manual to auto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuwrlL"&gt;While I wasn’t able to try the Eargo 6 in person, I did get to see a demo over Zoom. The Eargo buds are quite small, to the point where you can’t tell if someone’s actually wearing one. Since I couldn’t try one for myself, I’m not able to say how well the device works for someone like me — let alone someone with hearing loss. That said, the discreet design is notable. A major reason so many people don’t use hearing aids is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2904535/"&gt;the social stigma attached to wearing one&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing"&gt;National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders&lt;/a&gt; believes roughly a third of people aged 65–74 suffer from hearing loss. That jumps to 50 percent for those over 75. However, only 30 percent of people over 70 who could benefit from hearing aids have used one. That number plummets to 16 percent for adults aged 20–69.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HGV96F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders believes roughly a third of people aged 65–74 suffer from hearing loss&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="39rCFA"&gt;Eargo CEO Christian Gormsen told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the Eargo 6 is aimed at people with mild to moderate hearing loss, a group that has thus far been underserved due to the cumbersome process of getting hearing aids. There are &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4599-steps-to-obtaining-hearing-aids"&gt;several steps involved&lt;/a&gt;, including getting a hearing test, clearance from your doctor, an appointment with an audiologist, and follow-ups. Another problem is hearing aids are expensive. According to &lt;a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/health/hearing-aid-cost.html"&gt;Consumer Affairs&lt;/a&gt;, the average cost of one digital hearing aid ranges from $1,000 to $4,000, with the cheapest costing between $500 and $3,000. Even Eargo’s models are pricey at $2,950 for a pair (though the company offers a 45-day trial period and financing and says customers all receive lifetime support.) While Medicaid and some private insurance may cover some or all of the cost, most plans — including &lt;a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hearing-aids"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt; — generally don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIIDVq"&gt;Other brands like &lt;a href="https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2020/Honorees/I/IQbuds2-Max.aspx"&gt;Nuheara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://us.oliveunion.com/"&gt;Olive Union&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://hearinghealthmatters.org/blog/2021/signia-ax-insio-ces-2022/"&gt;Signia&lt;/a&gt; have also showcased their hearable tech at CES over the years. But there’s a good reason why 2022 might be a watershed year for hearing tech. Earlier in October, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-landmark-proposal-improve-access-hearing-aid-technology-millions-americans"&gt;proposed a rule&lt;/a&gt; that will allow people to buy hearing aids over-the-counter without needing a medical exam. The FDA also issued updated guidance for personal sound amplification products (PSAPs), electronic devices that act as amplifiers for all sounds. The agency is expected to &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/progress-toward-over-the-counter-hearing-aids"&gt;finalize that proposal in the next few months&lt;/a&gt;. This has huge implications for accessibility, as it’s expected to result in much more affordable products and reduce the number of steps needed to get a hearing aid in the first place.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VtMzGN"&gt;Bigger tech companies have also been adding more hearing-related features to their gadgets. In May, Bose launched its FDA-cleared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430485/bose-soundcontrol-hearing-aid-fda-cleared"&gt;SoundControl Hearing Aids&lt;/a&gt;, which don’t require seeing an audiologist and cost $849.95. The catch is that they’re only available in five states, though Bose does have plans to roll out the device nationally eventually. Apple also recently added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713126/airpods-pro-conversation-boost-firmware-update"&gt;a new Conversation Boost accessibility feature&lt;/a&gt; to its AirPods Pro. Samsung added &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/samsung-s-advanced-audio-chief-on-the-evolution-of-gala-1846279650"&gt;Voice Detect&lt;/a&gt; in early 2021 to the Galaxy Buds Pro and Buds 2. The feature works by activating Samsung’s Ambient Noise mode, allowing sounds from your environment to filter through whenever it identifies you speaking. The idea is so that you don’t have to take out your buds or switch modes when interacting with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymr1lz"&gt;So far, the biggest hurdle in developing innovative health tech is navigating the FDA’s clearance process. Running clinical trials, though necessary, requires resources that smaller startups may not have access to. In theory, allowing over-the-counter hearing aids could not only grant greater access and autonomy for people who need them but also encourage further developments in hearing tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6CV3U"&gt;At the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/over-the-counter-hearing-aids-pros-and-cons"&gt;audiologists have raised concerns&lt;/a&gt; that over-the-counter hearing aids could cause harm by encouraging people to skip professional assessments. Hearing aids aren’t diagnostic and can’t fully replace doctors visits. Additionally, it’s not a given that factory presets on over-the-counter aids would be effective when everyone’s hearing is unique. The American Academy of Audiology’s &lt;a href="https://www.audiology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/COMM21-Position_Statement-OTC-FINAL.pdf"&gt;official position&lt;/a&gt; on the matter states that while audiologists should offer support to people pursuing over-the-counter hearing aid tech, it believes consumers are “best served when they receive a comprehensive audiologic assessment prior to the use of any hearing aid.” For its part, Eargo says it employs over 40 licensed audiologists on staff to help users set up and customize their hearing aids — but that may not be the case for every company that decides to make over-the-counter hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A close up of the Eargo 6 buds" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mpa0-BtcPGVGAr7Kycn_716i9N8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149512/E6_buds_corrected_on_white_L_R_Pads_1__5_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eargo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eargo 6 buds are quite tiny compared to traditional hearing aids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fPrOUH"&gt;This is a common quandary with many health-related gadgets, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733073/smartwatch-wearable-health-impact-doctors"&gt;medical community is still coming to terms&lt;/a&gt; with how to handle people taking their health into their own hands. EyeQue Vision Check, a winner of the CES 2019 Innovation Award, is another example of an FDA-registered gadget that lets users skip an in-person vision test. I &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/i-tried-to-avoid-the-eye-doctor-with-this-gadget-and-fa-1838853503"&gt;tested it&lt;/a&gt; — and while I did get a more accurate pair of glasses, my vision was still noticeably blurrier than the pair I got after finally visiting my doctor. Although some measurements were comparable, it wasn’t ideal for someone like me with severe astigmatism and myopia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwCrPh"&gt;Regardless of how it all shakes out, there’s also no guarantee that existing direct-to-consumer companies like Eargo will opt to take the over-the-counter route. When asked, Eargo spokesperson Grace Schwartzstein told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was “anxiously awaiting the FDA announcement” and that it would “plan to evaluate accordingly.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM says Qualcomm’s computer chips will power its next-gen ‘hands-free’ driving mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rEKmnZ3C9HAXLOeSFxze2Z9iWy8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70355612/cadillac_2021_escalade_0433.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SYr6Go"&gt;General Motors completely redesigned the compute architecture that powers its next-generation “hands-free” driving system thanks to US semiconductor company Qualcomm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zk84X9"&gt;The automaker’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712566/gm-ultra-cruise-adas-hands-free-driving"&gt;Ultra Cruise system&lt;/a&gt;, which will make its debut in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226760/gm-cadillac-celestiq-electric-luxury-tease-ces-2021"&gt;2024 Cadillac Celestiq electric sedan&lt;/a&gt;, will be the first advanced driver assist system (ADAS) to use Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon Ride Platform. The size of “two laptops stacked together,” GM claims the new architecture will have the processing power equivalent to “several hundred” personal computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8ABhtX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“two laptops stacked together”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i2wcPi"&gt;GM first announced Ultra Cruise during an investor event last year, describing it as a massive leap over the company’s Super Cruise system, which allows for hands-free driving on mapped, divided highways. In contrast, Ultra Cruise will cover “95 percent” of driving scenarios on 2 million miles of roads in the US, the company claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxY4JR"&gt;“We’re attempting to have this feature be sort of a door-to-door driverless operation,” said Jason Ditman, chief engineer at GM, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “When the vehicle gets onto a capable road, Ultra Cruise will automatically engage and handle the majority of the work, hands-free. Stop signs, stoplights, turns, splits, merges, freeways, subdivision... all of those domains.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OJwouVuC9ru4GPjyBYutvs355R0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149798/Ultra_Cruise_compute_image_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OoMsEa"&gt;That’s thanks to Qualcomm’s new high-powered processors, Ditman said. Last year, Qualcomm entered into an agreement with GM to provide computer chips for the automaker’s next generation of electric vehicles. When it comes out in 2023, the Cadillac Celestiq will be one of the first vehicles to feature the chipmaker’s new ADAS platform, which includes Qualcomm’s Snapdragon SA8540P system-on-a-chip and SA9000P artificial intelligence accelerator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXV0Qq"&gt;Those two SoCs will deliver “low-latency control functions on 16-core CPUs and high-performance AI compute of more than 300 Tera Operations Per Second for camera, radar, and lidar processing,” GM says. But more importantly, it saves the automaker a lot of room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2oiuzm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It lets us be real efficient with space”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R86tOH"&gt;“It lets us be real efficient with space,” Ditman said. “It gives us the throughput that we need. And it let us take what was originally architected to be distributed modules throughout the car and move all that functionality into the one box.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwhn7d"&gt;Consolidating modules for driver monitoring, mapping, and video processing into one box has also improved the system’s latency, Ditman said, because it allows GM to bypass the previous system routed through the vehicle’s CAN network. Ultra Cruise will use sensors like cameras, radars, and lidar to control the vehicle’s steering, acceleration, and braking. GM hasn’t announced all the details around the sensor suite, but Ditman noted that the system relies on a total of 20 different devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEZd4G"&gt;Despite its enhanced capabilities, GM says it still considers Ultra Cruise a Level 2 system, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers. At Level 2, the vehicle can control both steering and acceleration and deceleration, as well as monitor blind spots and even change lanes automatically. But the driver needs to stay vigilant and keep their eyes on the road; if they don’t, the vehicle’s infrared sensors will detect it, and the system will send several warnings to the driver before disengaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhOr7B"&gt;Ditman said GM learned a lot about driver behavior from monitoring their behavior and made appropriate modifications for Ultra Cruise based on those findings. Some studies have shown that drivers are slow to take back control from a Level 2 system, a troubling sign that could undermine the safety case for more advanced driver assistance. But Ditman said GM’s robust driver monitoring system serves as a “good training tool to get people to pay attention.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NPR’s losing top talent — everyone has a theory why</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p6Tsod"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in Hot Pod Insider, The Verge’s subscription audio industry newsletter. For more stories like this, you can subscribe &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/subscribe/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3kDyS"&gt;Something’s happening at NPR, and everyone has a theory as to what. But first, the impetus. On Tuesday, &lt;em&gt;All Things Considered&lt;/em&gt; host Audie Cornish &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nprAudie/status/1478398877787111424"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; she’s leaving the program after nearly a decade as its host. Her departure, which she says on Twitter is her joining many others in the “great resignation,” marks three hosts of color to leave the network in recent months. (Noel King of &lt;em&gt;Morning Edition&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/11/30/22809789/noel-king-vox-today-explained-co-host-editorial-director"&gt;left in November&lt;/a&gt; for Vox Media — disclosure that Vox also owns &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt; — and Lulu Garcia-Navarro of &lt;em&gt;Weekend Edition &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/lulu-garcia-navarro-joins-times-opinion-as-podcast-host/"&gt;joined&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;in late September.) This &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; follows a thread from Sam Sanders, host of&lt;em&gt; It’s Been A Minute&lt;/em&gt;, who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samsanders/status/1436025093872885760"&gt;listed&lt;/a&gt; all the hosts from marginalized communities who had left as of September, which includes Shereen Marisol Meraji of &lt;em&gt;Code Switch &lt;/em&gt;and Joshua Johnson of &lt;em&gt;1A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mq0oVa"&gt;Many other NPR employees across various roles, including some of color, have left recently, too. These are just names that came up in the course of my reporting. There are surely more. Brakkton Booker, a reporter on the National Desk that’s now at &lt;em&gt;Politico,&lt;/em&gt; left in March; Sam Gringlas, a producer on &lt;em&gt;All Things Considered,&lt;/em&gt; left in December; Jacob Goldstein, co-host of &lt;em&gt;Planet Money,&lt;/em&gt; left in September for Pushkin; and, as of this week, two HR employees who were partners of the news and programming division left as well, according to a source, who asked to not be identified because of their ongoing work with the network. On Twitter, Ha-Hoa Hamano, principal product manager, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hahoais/status/1478806505411461120"&gt;also said&lt;/a&gt; she’s leaving (and discussed many other troubling details about her experience at the network). In 2020, David Greene, host of &lt;em&gt;Morning Edition,&lt;/em&gt; also quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ll2urS"&gt;As my source says: “There’s been an email bidding farewell to somebody every week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrRAe7"&gt;An email also went out yesterday from CEO and president John Lansing, acknowledging both Cornish’s departure and the broader conversation happening around these moves. You can read the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleyrcarman/status/1478803794590896142?s=20"&gt;relevant portion here&lt;/a&gt;, but he says an all-hands next week will “talk about development and advancement at NPR — for all staff, including our hosts.” He also calls “diversifying our audience that relies on our content, sourcing, and staffing” its “North Star.” And that “staffing relies on hiring but also development and retention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C8GmaA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0MQzJh"&gt;So clearly, the turnover is real, and everyone is scrambling to chalk it up to a specific reason, including myself, the Twitter universe, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Deuxmoi/comments/rwcus2/nerd_tea_what_on_earth_is_happening_over_at_npr/"&gt;even Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. I spoke with four current and former employees, most of whom requested anonymity because of their continued work in the industry, to get a sense of the situation and what’s led up to all this turnover, and everyone’s thoughts coalesced around a few themes: more competitors who can offer both higher salaries and more creative freedom; NPR being a legacy media company hesitant to greatly alter its tried-and-true programs; and broader frustration with failures to carry out the network’s empowering mission statement, particularly for reporters and hosts of color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jptViv"&gt;However, before we fully get into it, I do want to say I wasn’t able to speak to any of these hosts directly, and I’m sure, one day, when they’re wanting to share more, we’ll receive the real reasons behind their leaving. Much of this is informed theorizing and feelings, and I think we all know the decision to leave a job is typically highly personal, so let’s assume there’s a combination of things happening, including the X factor of pandemic burnout and restlessness. Now, for what I’m hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVDmhp"&gt;“There is still a mindset, I think, with certain levels of management that’s ‘why would you ever want to leave NPR once you get here because we are … the top gig when it comes to audio,’” says one producer. “But there are so many other places now that are willing to let you do different kinds of interesting things, and they’re willing to pay you more, and they’re willing to give you IP ownership of the things that you do, and those are just things that we have not moved quickly on, and we’re seeing it play out now in the form of highly talented people across the newsroom and across different parts of the building just say, ‘Well, I don’t have to be here to do the kinds of things that I want to do. I can go somewhere else to do that.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoJB6K"&gt;Which is to say: the space is more competitive than ever, and that makes it a prime moment for creators. Lots of media companies are investing in audio, need qualified and talented hosts, and are willing to pay for that access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="R4oNfa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QbYu9g"&gt;Another former producer notes, for context, that when they worked at NPR, listeners would write into the network mourning a host who had left 10 years before but that they still missed. This person, who was with the station for many years, says retention has always been a problem for producers and reporters but never got much attention because they weren’t the “higher profile people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ziqCtk"&gt;“Why else would you care,” they ask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uujTP"&gt;But as for why these hosts are leaving these programs right now, specifically &lt;em&gt;All Things Considered&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Morning Edition&lt;/em&gt;, another producer says hosting these shows is a specific job that requires sitting in a chair for hours, which might not appeal to reporters who enjoy the on-the-ground aspect of gathering audio and interviewing. Another points out that these shows’ hosts or reporters might not have been able to try new formats or segments within the shows’ specific expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X98Sqb"&gt;“You have to stick to a certain broadcast clock, you have to continue to sound like what people think NPR should sound like, and there’s not a lot of room for experimentation in that kind of format,” they say. “So if you’re looking to do something different and you want to try something different, it’s hard to do that when your position is such that you’re part of a newsmagazine that’s going to look and sound the same every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMjBIf"&gt;One producer points out that when former &lt;em&gt;ATC&lt;/em&gt; producer Theo Balcomb wanted to produce a different kind of daily podcast, she took it to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for example, resulting in &lt;em&gt;The Daily&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="PjjT8d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The standby NPR shows hesitate to experiment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N5fhQA"&gt;Maria Hinojosa, who says she was the first Latina hired at NPR in 1985, says these departures and the broader upset at the network likely have to do with not adhering to its mission statement to inform and represent the entire American public. She created and runs Futuro Media Group and also hosts &lt;em&gt;Latino USA&lt;/em&gt;, which NPR previously distributed, though as &lt;a href="https://www.latinousa.org/2020/06/30/latinousaprx/"&gt;of June 2020&lt;/a&gt;, it is distributed by PRX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfnlKJ"&gt;“For me, it was a difficult decision to leave NPR,” she says. “Because I was a child of NPR, you know, it was my first job.” She adds that NPR “wasn’t that into” &lt;em&gt;Latino USA&lt;/em&gt; leading up to the separation and that she fought to “keep the show alive.” She also points out that, over the years, she ran into uninformed questioning from the team. One host, she says, asked her if she was “pro-Latino” and could be “objective” because she hosted &lt;em&gt;Latino USA&lt;/em&gt;, for example, and she says she felt she had to “jump through certain hoops to prove to certain people” that a show or reporting style made sense and would be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEIZ02"&gt;“The critique that I was making, that we were making, that we have been making for decades now, was not to take NPR down and not because we were curmudgeons, but because we understood what the future of the country looks like,” she says. “Therefore, the deep responsibility that NPR has is to be truly representative, and that takes a lot of self-critique, and you’ve got to go to therapy for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TBZagp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A host asked Hinojosa if she could be ‘objective’ around Latino issues&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4NzLow"&gt;In a response to this story, NPR spokeswoman Isabel Lara pointed to various hires, including Sandhya Dirks, Erika Aguilar, and Nick Charles, as well as the naming of new hosts, like Leila Fadel for &lt;em&gt;Morning Edition&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Up First&lt;/em&gt;; Scott Tong for &lt;em&gt;Here &amp;amp; Now&lt;/em&gt;; and A Martínez for &lt;em&gt;Morning Edition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6Pu2Y"&gt;“Diversity in our staff, sourcing, and coverage is not only crucial to the accuracy and fairness of NPR’s content, but to the future of public media and our audience at large,” she says. “Ensuring that public media reflects the people of the United States is not a responsibility or initiative, but a necessity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXPcpI"&gt;She also added that the company tracks voluntary attrition, and its attrition rate in 2021 was 9.3 percent, down slightly from 10.1 percent in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61KbRh"&gt;I imagine we’ll be hearing more about this story in the days, weeks, and months to come, particularly in the expanded world of public media and member stations. For now, though, I’ll leave you with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hahoais/status/1478806505411461120?s=20"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/farai/status/1478811849365897227?s=20"&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt; I’ve &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thesporkful/status/1478465187816554497?s=21"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; over the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WBJenna/status/1478457973001359360?s=20"&gt;past couple&lt;/a&gt; days so you can get even more details and thoughts on what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>For some reason Megalovania played during an audience with the Pope</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QkgyaY4k1HpL388gEZKkP2-Bh1I=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70355372/sans.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FDjPBJ"&gt;Six days into 2022 and we’ve already had one of the weirdest collisions of gaming culture and the wider world. Yesterday, during Pope Francis’ &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/_oKcdP7_WOU"&gt;weekly general audience&lt;/a&gt; in which he said a few prayers, made a few addresses, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/05/europe/pope-dogs-cats-kids-intl/index.html"&gt;casually shamed voluntarily childfree people&lt;/a&gt; for preferring the company of their pets to tiny, screaming humans &lt;em&gt;most of us cannot possibly afford&lt;/em&gt;, a troupe of jugglers / acrobats / general circus folk performed to a jazzy ska-esque rendition of “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/wDgQdr8ZkTw"&gt;Megalovania&lt;/a&gt;” from Toby Fox’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16151292/undertale-playstation-4-vita-release"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eJivVN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This year just started and we already have the insanity of Megalovania being performed in front of the Pope. &lt;a href="https://t.co/QBxGtl9v1c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QBxGtl9v1c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ultima | #вʟм (@UltimaShadowX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UltimaShadowX/status/1478963456707641345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o7IaHa"&gt;Everything about this performance inspires in me a manic chuckle as I try to make sense of the scene unfolding in front of my eyes. The performance starts with an acrobat twirling a foam cylinder with their feet. Then, for some reason, the jugglers start, and &lt;em&gt;then &lt;/em&gt;someone wheels by on a unicycle making every element of this performance look like unorganized, mismatched chaos. Something that’s oddly fitting when you think about the chaotic terror of the Sans fight. In the Sans battle, just like in this performance, nonsensical shit is coming at you from all sides while a little man in a funny outfit smiles at you serenely as “Megalovania” plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lgUjMU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vr4IYjeplJA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M5kNzc"&gt;As incredulous as it may sound, this is actually not the first time there’s been a Pope / &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt; crossover. In 2016, YouTube gamer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatPatGT"&gt;MatPat&lt;/a&gt; famously &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/6/12105428/pope-undertale-youtuber"&gt;gave the Pope a Steam code for &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as he thought the game represented the same themes of forgiveness and compassion that the Pope alluded to in a speech he made earlier in the year. Maybe Big Catholic Boss Guy finally got around to playing it and liked the song so much he requested it for his next general audience. Of course, that would mean the Pope would have taken the “&lt;a href="https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Genocide_Route"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;” option which, depending on your view of organized religion, may or may not match up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mqVGI"&gt;Wow, that got dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYsLcg"&gt;The history of atrocities committed in the name of religion aside, everything about this performance rips. I especially like the wide shot of the stage that includes the Pope in his funny outfit, the performers in their funny outfits, and members of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Guard"&gt;Swiss Guard&lt;/a&gt; with their &lt;em&gt;totally normal &lt;/em&gt;technicolor pantaloons and traditional halberd lending that extra dash of “is this real or am I tripping balls right now?” all while Fazzini’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resurrection_(Fazzini)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Resurrection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looms in the background looking ready to consume everyone whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUM1gF"&gt;It is the exact kind of surrealism I think Toby Fox would appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PF65V"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJtZzM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
