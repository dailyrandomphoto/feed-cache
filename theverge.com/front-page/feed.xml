    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y5LjNF"&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has opened an investigation into the collapse of an Amazon warehouse in Illinois that left &lt;a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/illinois/workers-killed-in-edwardsville-building-collapse-include-mother-of-toddler-army-veteran/article_51515e92-02e0-54d5-a7c4-d6dd3a27d02c.html"&gt;six people dead&lt;/a&gt;. The damage was caused by a tornado that swept through the area Friday evening, leaving a path of destruction across three states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFtYyH"&gt;In addition to the six people killed at the Amazon warehouse, 45 were rescued, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/12/technology/amazon-tornado-edwardsville.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which reported that local authorities had some difficulty determining how many people were in the facility at the time since many who work out of the warehouse are contractors for other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="txd01a"&gt;“OSHA investigates all workplace fatalities and we are supporting them,” Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmy9IS"&gt;As first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/13/osha-opens-probe-into-deadly-amazon-warehouse-collapse-in-illinois.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, OSHA will have six months to complete its investigation, issue any citations, and propose penalties if the agency determines safety or health regulations were violated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raSK2H"&gt;Former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a tweet on Saturday that his “thoughts and prayers” were with the families of the workers who died. “All of Edwardsville should know that the Amazon team is committed to supporting them and will be by their side through this crisis,” Bezos &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1469849247042334721?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram’s new Reels Visual Replies are just another feature copied from TikTok</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ibl8NSfkaDCR-mfhRLtC5ard5P4=/246x0:1782x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266678/FGSDy6WVkAET_Cv.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It looks familiar...&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yVkHyP"&gt;Instagram has added another strikingly familiar feature to Reels: the ability to add a user comment to a video (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/instagram-now-lets-users-reply-to-comments-with-reels/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Now, if a user comments on a reel you’ve posted, tapping the “reply” button will let you add a sticker of the comment into a new reel, which you can then move around or change its color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ha61A3"&gt;As Twitter users pointed out in the comments of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1469444419656896515"&gt;Instagram’s announcement post&lt;/a&gt;, the feature is very similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22583435/tiktok-reply-video-comments-how-to"&gt;how TikTok lets you do video replies&lt;/a&gt;. As of now, it seems limited to just comments on your reels — I wasn’t able to make stickers out of comments on photo posts or comments on other peoples’ reels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JH6w_gX_rfkXcq_ln6UHiWbSElg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085390/Screenshot_20211213_122859.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tapping reply on a comment, then tapping the camera button adds that comment as a sticker in a new reel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JnCB8CZ6tVqG2TVVGLen4uY1FFY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085412/Screenshot_20211213_122841.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can then resize, move, or change the color of the comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jGUr9D"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;its launch in August 2020&lt;/a&gt; (when we called it “similar to TikTok”), Instagram’s tweaks and additions have made the two platforms feel more and more alike. The maximum time limit for Reels was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596530/instagram-reels-60-seconds-time-extension"&gt;bumped up a few times&lt;/a&gt;, reaching the one-minute mark in July (just after TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;raised its max length from one minute to three&lt;/a&gt;). Instagram also lets you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360544/instagram-reels-remix-tiktok-duet-feature-launch"&gt;“remix” reels&lt;/a&gt;, similar to TikTok’s “duet” feature, and it just recently added the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778073/instagram-reels-text-to-voice-effects-tiktok-creators"&gt;text-to-speech and voice effect features&lt;/a&gt; that have been a staple for TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utkAXW"&gt;Even if Reels Visual Replies aren’t original, it’s nice to see that Instagram’s adopting the feature. It’s a fun way to interact with your audience, and while it may not be the thing that gets creators to jump over from TikTok (it’s certainly not as enticing as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22777899/instagram-reels-bonus-program-35000-dollars-creators-tiktok-competitors"&gt;Instagram’s up-to $35,000 bonuses&lt;/a&gt; for posting Reels), it’s at least one fewer thing that’s missing from Meta’s version of the app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A tornado expert explains why last week’s twisters were so devastating </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kentucky: Aftermath of tornado in Mayfield" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xwmcfYiXJ5bnLfGdDyz5QkQVLrQ=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266652/1237200100.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QuVDXH"&gt;Meteorologists were&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrJeffMasters/status/1469700985102741507"&gt;shocked&lt;/a&gt; by the tornadoes that devastated the Midwest and Southern US over the weekend. The twisters, which struck during the evening of &lt;a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/211210_rpts.html"&gt;December 10th&lt;/a&gt;, plowed across multiple states with incredible ferocity much later in the year than most tornadoes usually hit. Entire communities were devastated, and at least &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/12/12/us/tornadoes-kentucky-illinois"&gt;90&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; lost their lives. Residents across Kentucky, Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Mississippi, Illinois are still recovering and searching for missing loved ones.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWDPFv"&gt;Tornadoes are still somewhat of an enigma to scientists. We know the basic &lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/ffc/torntext"&gt;meteorological ingredients&lt;/a&gt; needed to cause a tornado to form, as well as where and when they tend to appear. But what’s normal for the US — which sees &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/weather-atmosphere/tornadoes"&gt;more tornadoes&lt;/a&gt; than any other country on Earth — could be &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/12/11/tornadoes-climate-change/"&gt;changing&lt;/a&gt;, according to some &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2021/12/13/tornadoes-kentucky-climate-change-study/6478150001/"&gt;early&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aah7393"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the relationship between climate change and tornadoes is still &lt;a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/tornadoes-and-climate-change/"&gt;hazy&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists still need a better understanding of what is the perfect storm of conditions for triggering tornadoes so that they can suss out how things could change in a warming world.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9wU8rq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You really don’t want to see this outcome.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZM2Cw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with &lt;a href="http://people.se.cmich.edu/allen4jt/allen_homepage.html"&gt;John T. Allen&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of meteorology with a focus on tornadoes at Central Michigan University. He tells us what scientists are still trying to learn about tornadoes, and what we might expect in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6NKLT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxGoK5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As someone who’s studied tornadoes for a long time, what was running through your head as you were watching what happened over the weekend?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGtwxs"&gt;I’ll be honest, it’s never a pleasant thought. Having seen a few of these high end tornadoes in person and seeing the devastation that they leave behind, there’s a sense of powerlessness that comes from... you sort of know that it’s going to happen, but you can do very little about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spBBFW"&gt;In this particular case, part of you is just hoping that something changes in the storm: that it stops doing this and doesn’t hit a town or it misses a town to the south, or it misses that populated area. You really don’t want to see this outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4qPn6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made the tornadoes that struck over the weekend unusual?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQABRT"&gt;What I think has made this event stand out was a couple of particularly long-track tornadoes that stretch from Arkansas into Kentucky. One particular storm produced an extremely long-track tornado. We don’t know exactly how long that track was, but it will probably find itself in the upper echelon of the longest track tornadoes we have in history. Another aspect of that tornado was that it was particularly intense. We saw quite a number of fatalities associated with this tornado, had a number of towns absolutely devastated by it. So certainly, it will be one of those historic events that goes down in people’s memories and will be something that will be felt by those communities for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XO7aGc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Something that will be felt by those communities for a very long time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fqb3rZ"&gt;This tornado outbreak was certainly on the larger scale for December tornado outbreaks. We have had tornadoes previously in December, even on Christmas day you can have tornado outbreak if the conditions are right. So at least in terms of getting tornadoes in December, that’s not too surprising. The sheer number of tornadoes wasn’t overly large. We’re talking on the order of somewhere around about 30 tornadoes overall, we won’t know until the survey’s finished in the coming days.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQ0mCS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was there anything else that might have made this tornado outbreak especially dangerous, like its path or the fact that it happened at night when it’s difficult for people to see them coming?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9V6GId"&gt;This area is relatively highly populated, and that’s never a good thing when it comes to tornadoes. Out in the plains, the population is relatively sparse. It means that there are fewer places that are likely to be impacted. But when you’ve got a very long track like this, the chance of hitting something goes up. As you move into the southeastern United States, it increases exponentially. [Editor’s note: some &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-018-0048-2"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has also found a trend toward more tornadoes in parts of the Midwest and Southeast and fewer in the Great Plains, where they’ve been more common in the past.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OIZOua"&gt;Adding to that, we’ve got a tornado that’s late at night when people aren’t necessarily expecting it. That we’re not in what people typically think of as tornado season means that the overall vulnerability and chance that people may get caught unawares was much higher. Nocturnal tornadoes certainly have a disproportionate share of fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VwdVPP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions are already being raised around what can or should be done to prepare for tornadoes in the future. What do we know so far about how climate change might affect tornadoes in the US?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7v1wgt"&gt;It’s very difficult to say specifically for tornadoes. They’re very small-scale phenomena. And even on a daily basis, it can be quite difficult to predict whether a storm is going to produce a tornado or not. A lot of the research that has been done to date looks at the sort of ingredients, the conditions that could lead to tornadoes: warm, humid air, changing wind speed with height, which allows storm organization. And what we’ve found is that, at least for the future, there is definitely an increasing sort of length to the season. We’re seeing more potential for these tornadoes. The storms that produce tornadoes in the fall and winter and early spring are increasing up to &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021EF002277"&gt;25 percent&lt;/a&gt; per degree Celsius of warming relative to now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIe8An"&gt;We had an abnormally warm period — I mean, Memphis hit 80 degrees Fahrenheit on Friday, which was unusually warm for the winter. Storms rely on relatively warm, moist air near the surface to increase the available energy to basically produce strong updraft. So in this case, you get much stronger vertical motion in the storms and that tends to be a thing that we see favoring stronger storms which might produce tornadoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kk4INr"&gt;The other factor that comes in there, and one that doesn’t really change is wind shear. So if you think about clouds moving in different directions at different heights, that’s what wind shear is. What wind shear does is it allows the storms to sort of organize themselves into something that is more sustained. It lasts a lot longer. It’s not your typical everyday thunderstorm. This is a storm that, in this particular case, might have persisted for over seven hours. And those sorts of storms are known to be more frequent producers of tornadoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udnoVA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And how does a tornado form?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLvQJl"&gt;There are a lot of different mechanisms that we’re aware of that potentially could produce a tornado. Generally speaking, you need a supercell thunderstorm. That supercell thunderstorm begins to rotate at the mid levels and that process produces a downdraft that then causes rotation at the surface to become more intense, and eventually we refer to it as a tornado when it exceeds 50 miles per hour. But the exact mechanisms of tornado formation are still an open topic of scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfHSbP"&gt;In this case, we had multiple storms producing very strong and intense tornadoes. Usually about six or more is defined as an outbreak, although other metrics exist. Tornado outbreaks are associated with a large-scale synoptic system. This particular system ended up producing snowfall in the Dakotas. It produced strong winds through Michigan, about 60 miles an hour. That particular system, as it moved eastward, pulled warm moist air up from the Gulf of Mexico, which was running a little bit warmer than normal. That warm, moist air is juxtaposed with relatively cool air coming behind the system. The interaction of those and an upper-level system that moved in as well produces a large area over which the conditions are favorable. It pulls those ingredients together. And so in this particular case, we had a system that produced an unusually large area of favorable conditions, which is what allowed for long-track tornadoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yl5mzy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do meteorologists forecast tornadoes? And how much warning do we typically have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XghqAW"&gt;Warning times on average are in excess of 13 minutes. In this case, we had in excess of 20 minutes for Mayfield, one of the worst impacted locations. So there was certainly good anticipation of this particular event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7bcIv"&gt;In terms of forecasting the likelihood of tornadoes, it really comes back to those ingredient conditions which we talked about earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vK6Yq6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A question we’re still sort of trying to wrap our heads around.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4i5NSP"&gt;We have a whole suite of models we operate at our storm prediction center and other groups to basically predict the storms themselves and try and get an idea of will a storm form? How intense might it be? And we use that to formulate outlooks which are issued up to eight days in advance. The final outlooks are down to the day, then are proceeded by tornado watches. Tornado watches say, “the conditions are likely to get a tornado in the next few hours.” And then a tornado warning is, “the tornado was coming to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnV4Lx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are scientists still trying to understand about tornadoes?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And what makes them difficult to study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BlXzG"&gt;Really pinning down why is it that a given scenario produces a tornado, I think, is a question we’re still sort of trying to wrap our heads around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ywFunh"&gt;It’s not uncommon to have field projects in which you’ve had extreme trouble actually getting out in the field to observe a tornado. At the same time, we’ve had other situations where we’ve had very good observations of these events. The challenge is that there are a lot of physical processes at very small scales that really matter for tornadoes. That small scale influence means that it’s very hard to actually identify which storm is going to produce a tornado. Which one is it? On the same token, is it going to produce a long-track, higher-scale tornado? Or is it going to produce a relatively weaker tornado? We don’t have great answers for that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4T3BU"&gt;We really do need a greater degree of field observations. We need more modeling studies to understand what’s going on. There’s a lot of science and research that needs to be done and those sort of things need federal support to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNYFLm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gH3Mua"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IsSiR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4KUfV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yO79gP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The MacBook Air with M1 processor is back down to $800 for today only</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air is fast" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vO1qpXj53nwSXQfxIsb8Wy2UZZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266487/vpavic_4291_20201113_0380.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Air with M1 processor first debuted just over one year ago.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ak2488"&gt;The MacBook Air with M1 processor, our top pick for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;the best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt;, is currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcsdQZjSND" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 off at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This brings the popular laptop from Apple down to its historical low price of $799.99. We have often seen this MacBook Air discounted by $50, $100, and even occasionally $150, but this level of sale is much less frequent, and as good as it gets. Best Buy’s deal on the MacBook Air is only running for today — scheduled to expire when it strikes midnight on December 14th — or while supplies last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuNF5X"&gt;The configuration of MacBook Air on offer today is the late 2020 model with the Apple-made M1 CPU, outfitted with the base-level 256GB SSD and 8GB of RAM. You have your choice of colors from its three options of space gray, gold, and silver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOfFBV"&gt;There are few other laptops as capable in this price range as the MacBook Air, whether you’re dabbling in productivity and work, everyday home and on-the-go computer use, or even light content creation. Its battery life is also exceptional. The biggest knock against this laptop — dongle life aside — is the awful webcam quality. Though there are worse problems to have, especially if you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652783/best-webcam-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;put some of that money saved toward a webcam&lt;/a&gt; that is much better than the cameras built into any laptop. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 Darkplates made me want to grab Sony’s upcoming black faceplates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/imTMP55o_4ZjSYBlgRljV9UssZE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266463/jpeters_211213_4919_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My PS5 Digital Edition with the Darkplates 2.0.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;I now stan the PS5’s original design&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="VIKJDz"&gt;Sony has &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; announced official PS5 faceplates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22831965/sony-ps5-covers-faceplates-colors-new-controllers"&gt;in different colors&lt;/a&gt;, including red, pink, blue, purple, and — thankfully — black. But if you’re looking for an easy way to change up the PS5’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/6/11/21288541/playstation-5-ps5-sony-design-memes-roast-twitter-router-face-building"&gt;popped-collar aesthetic&lt;/a&gt;, you might want to check out Dbrand’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733642/dbrand-new-ps5-darkplates-sony-legal-threats"&gt;PS5 Darkplates 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, which are more rounded and add a grille on each side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uDWbh"&gt;Dbrand sent some to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;and I’ve taken some photos of them on my PS5 Digital Edition so you can get an idea of what they might look like on your console. (Photos taken on my iPhone 12 Mini.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vKgO2hKn09BukQfECr9Idh80gg4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084990/jpeters_211213_4919_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what the Darkplates 2.0 look like head-on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9zkYmDtCKxfXWighxVV_p6bXn7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084992/jpeters_211213_4919_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a look when the console is laying horizontally. I’ve also applied a Dbrand matte black strip to the middle of the console, which is typically glossy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="556FEs"&gt;I really like the matte black finish on the Darkplates 2.0. I feel it isn’t quite as conspicuous as the PS5’s standard two-tone look, and it matches well with the Xbox Series X and the black Nintendo Switch dock. And similar to what my colleague Sam Byford observed with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306874/dbrand-ps5-darkplates-matte-black-hands-on-review"&gt;first version of the Darkplates&lt;/a&gt;, the plastic used for the Darkplates 2.0 feels sturdy — and I’m glad that’s the case since a set currently costs $59.05. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wd7GEWJK5tglHWU8Sle2OYLgYd0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084998/jpeters_211213_4919_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s my PS5 with Darkplates 2.0 next to my Xbox Series X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/joUAAImTp1ZhXEZO9R2xmtmiP78=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084999/jpeters_211213_4919_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, my TV stand is currently made of moving boxes. I’m working on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pIXe7D"&gt;I’m less of a fan of the big grille that’s on each Darkplate. Dbrand claims on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/ps5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt; that the grilles make the PS5 run cooler. But I haven’t personally run into any overheating issues with my console when using the original PS5 faceplates, so I can’t vouch for whether the grilles make a meaningful difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KGZnVQdHaDA9xhuowJj9gEZqznQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084993/jpeters_211213_4919_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The grille takes up a big chunk of the Darkplate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ou0Kjnvo_2MlFWJ-5z-s7kBY8iQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084991/jpeters_211213_4919_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a closer look at the grille, where you can see the removable mesh grille on the inside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6cyNm3"&gt;Like Sony’s official faceplates and the Darkplates 1.0, there’s also an Easter egg on the inside of the plates. Sony etched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;PlayStation icon microtexture&lt;/a&gt; featuring the PlayStation symbols, and the Darkplates 1.0 had Dbrand’s twist on those icons. For Darkplates 2.0, Dbrand opted to inscribe a lot of binary. I asked Dbrand what it means, and it said the binary is excerpts of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22728936/dbrand-pulls-ps5-darkplates-from-sale-sony-threatens-legal-action"&gt;cease and desist letter Sony sent the company&lt;/a&gt; regarding Darkplates 1.0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/31SYX2k_vPGprjLHsUdYhTVh3fM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084995/jpeters_211213_4919_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s a lot of zeros and ones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EYQ5du"&gt;I expected to really like the Darkplates 2.0; I generally prefer black electronics, and I wasn’t a fan of the PS5’s design when it was announced. The color is great, but something about the overall look just isn’t clicking with me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdakOV"&gt;Maybe it’s the giant grilles. Maybe it’s how the Darkplates’ design exposes the light bar on the middle part of the console, which can be distracting depending on where I am in my living room. But maybe it’s just the fact that I’ve gotten &lt;em&gt;used &lt;/em&gt;to the original design of the PS5. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still ridiculous, but to me, it’s what the PS5 &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; — popped collar and all — and I’ll probably be picking up a pair of Sony’s new $54.99 color faceplates in black so I can keep the original look but with a darker color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rbz4O9"&gt;When asked for comment about Sony’s new PS5 faceplates, Dbrand pointed to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1470428336446967817"&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KQZaho"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Called it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/2xeHPI8Q0K"&gt;https://t.co/2xeHPI8Q0K&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jJ3M7N6onG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jJ3M7N6onG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— dbrand (@dbrand) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1470428336446967817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Netflix is making a live-action Mega Man movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1652v0XD029hMLj-sRMvsPNYjIA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266455/mega_man_11_fans_are_already_doing_gearless_runs_of_the_demo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xmragU"&gt;Video game adaptations are on a &lt;em&gt;tear — &lt;/em&gt;we got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826714/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-movie-trailer-the-game-awards"&gt;new trailers for &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826806/halo-tv-show-live-action-trailer-2022-game-awards-master-chief"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; live-action TV series&lt;/a&gt; just last week. And of course, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22799382/chris-pratt-voice-super-mario-movie-nintendo-illumination-ceo"&gt;Chris Pratt is playing Mario&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738187/uncharted-movie-trailer-tom-holland-nathan-drake-mark-wahlberg"&gt;an&lt;em&gt; Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie&lt;/a&gt; is nearly here. Amid these heavy hitters comes the news that Netflix is ready to bring us another franchise as well: Mega Man&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the Capcom “blue bomber” who’s been blasting his way through retro side-scrollers since 1987 on the original NES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqJ07b"&gt;Technically, a Mega Man movie’s been in the works &lt;a href="https://www.tracking-board.com/tb-exclusive-a-mega-man-movie-is-a-go-at-fox/"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt; at Chernin Entertainment, and it became a little more formal &lt;a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e181004.html"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt; when Capcom officially announced it’d be a live-action film (!) with Henry Joost and Rel Schulman, perhaps best known for &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1584016/?ref_=nm_knf_i1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catfish&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, attached to write and direct. But recently, that directing duo &lt;a href="https://www.supermarche.nyc/bio"&gt;revealed on their Supermarché company website&lt;/a&gt; that Netflix has picked up the picture (via &lt;a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/mega-man-capcom-live-action-movie-reportedly-coming-netflix/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comicbook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mega-man-movie-in-the-works-at-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k74y16"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Features in the works include: an adaptation of Capcom’s MEGA MAN for Chernin Entertainment and Netflix, which they wrote and are directing,” the site reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGe0Nk"&gt;Unfortunately, there’s no indication of how far along the movie is or when it might release. (&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; writes that sources say it’s very early in development.) But as some have pointed out, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/04/netflix-chernin-entertainment-producing-deal-peter-chernin-1202903133/"&gt;Netflix has a first-look deal with Chernin&lt;/a&gt;; perhaps Netflix saw something that it liked. Netflix and Supermarché didn’t immediately have comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tW2yMt"&gt;The gold rush to secure video game intellectual property for Hollywood adaptation goes far beyond the films and shows I’ve mentioned so far, of course, and Netflix has definitely seen the potential thanks to the performance of its&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/7/15938192/netflix-castlevania-review-animated-video-game-adaptation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series. Netflix has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403849/netflix-resident-evil-tv-series-original-live-action-announcement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252386/netflix-tomb-raider-kong-skull-island-anime"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows in the works, too, and is reportedly in development on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594569/pokemon-live-action-series-netflix-development"&gt;live-action &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt; as well. It generally sees a lot of potential in gaming, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587048/netflix-mobile-games-streaming-wars"&gt;even vis-a-vis snapping up film studios itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RyKXw8"&gt;Outside of Netflix, we recently had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22302819/milla-jovovich-monster-hunter-interview-captain-artemis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22398015/mortal-kombat-2021-movie-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; movies&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277372/the-last-of-us-ellie-game-of-thrones-bella-ramsey-hbo-lyanna-mormont"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; TV show&lt;/a&gt; for HBO, maybe a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22799583/mass-effect-bioware-tv-show-movie-amazon-studios-rumor"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect &lt;/em&gt;show for Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21311513/amazon-fallout-tv-show-prime-video-westworld-creators-bethesda"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fallout &lt;/em&gt;show that’s definitely for Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350484/sony-ghost-of-tsushima-movie-film-director-john-wick-sucker-punch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22153341/metal-gear-solid-movie-oscar-isaac-solid-snake"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid&lt;/em&gt; movie&lt;/a&gt; adaptations. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452272/jj-abrams-portal-movie-valve-half-life-2013-script-production"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; movie&lt;/a&gt; might even be happening someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUFyAH"&gt;We’ve come a long way since &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uwe_Boll"&gt;Uwe Boll&lt;/a&gt;, that’s all I’m saying.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Researchers trigger new exploit by renaming an iPhone and a Tesla</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jq_Odp_JHjg5eN4yTGSSA01siD8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266287/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S9gPVK"&gt;Security researchers investigating the recently discovered and “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828303/log4j-library-vulnerability-log4shell-zero-day-exploit"&gt;extremely bad&lt;/a&gt;” Log4Shell exploit claim to have used it on devices as varied as iPhones and Tesla cars. Per &lt;a href="https://github.com/YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface/blob/master/pages/Tesla.md"&gt;screenshots&lt;/a&gt; shared &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chvancooten/status/1469340927923826691"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;, changing the device name of an iPhone or Tesla to a special exploit string was enough to trigger a ping from Apple or Tesla servers, indicating that the server at the other end was vulnerable to Log4Shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBgwtV"&gt;In the demonstrations, researchers switched the device names to be a string of characters that would send servers to a testing URL, exploiting the behavior enabled by the vulnerability. After the name was changed, incoming traffic showed URL requests from IP addresses belonging to Apple and, in the case of Tesla, China Unicom — the company’s &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/29/investing/tesla-china-unicom/"&gt;mobile service partner for the Chinese market&lt;/a&gt;. In short, the researchers tricked Apple and Tesla servers into visiting a URL of their choice.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An iPhone device information screen with name changed to contain the exploit string.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zc5cRA"&gt;The iPhone demonstration came from a Dutch security researcher; the other was uploaded to the anonymous &lt;a href="https://github.com/YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface"&gt;Log4jAttackSurface&lt;/a&gt; Github repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLI6ry"&gt;Assuming the images are genuine, they show behavior — remote resource loading — that should not be possible with text contained in a device name. This proof of concept has led to widespread reporting that Apple and Tesla are vulnerable to the exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoQIub"&gt;While the demonstration is alarming, it’s not clear how useful it would be for cybercriminals. In theory, an attacker could host malicious code at the target URL in order to infect vulnerable servers, but a well-maintained network could prevent such an attack at the network level. More broadly, there’s no indication that the method could lead to any broader compromise of Apple or Tesla’s systems. (Neither company responded to an email request for comment by time of publication.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="luPhIQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Log4Shell is all the more serious for being relatively easy to exploit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jFCQW3"&gt;Still, it’s a reminder of the complex nature of technological systems, which almost always depend on code pulled in from third-party libraries. The Log4Shell exploit affects an open-source Java tool called log4j which is widely used for application event logging; though it’s still not known exactly how many devices are affected, but researchers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1469289471463944198"&gt;estimate that it is in the millions&lt;/a&gt;, including obscure systems that are rarely targeted by attacks of this nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQiQpw"&gt;The full extent of exploitation in the wild is unknown, but in a blog post, digital forensics platform Cado reported detecting servers trying to &lt;a href="https://www.cadosecurity.com/analysis-of-initial-in-the-wild-attacks-exploiting-log4shell-log4j-cve-2021-44228/"&gt;use this method to install Mirai botnet code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhBv95"&gt;Log4Shell is all the more serious for being relatively easy to exploit. The vulnerability works by tricking the application into interpreting a piece of text as a link to a remote resource, and trying to retrieve that resource instead of saving the text as it is written. All that’s necessary is for a vulnerable device to save the special string of characters in its application logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHVHwX"&gt;This creates the potential for vulnerability in many systems that accept user input, since message text can be stored in the logs. The log4j vulnerability was &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/minecraft-and-other-apps-face-serious-threat-from-new-code-execution-bug/"&gt;first spotted in &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; servers, which attackers could compromise using chat messages; and systems that send and receive other message formats like SMS clearly are also susceptible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XeiN5"&gt;At least one major SMS provider appears to be vulnerable to the exploit, according to testing conducted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. When sent to numbers operated by the SMS provider, text messages containing exploit code triggered a response from the company’s servers that revealed information about the IP address and host name, suggesting that the servers could be tricked into executing malicious code. Calls and emails to the affected company had not been answered at time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2llowl"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html"&gt;update to the log4j library&lt;/a&gt; has been released to mitigate against the vulnerability, but patching of all vulnerable machines will take time given the challenges of updating enterprise software at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Universal Control won’t be coming to macOS Monterey until sometime this spring</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vpqLBu"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523322/apple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo"&gt;Universal Control feature&lt;/a&gt; has been delayed again, with the company’s website updating today to note that the drag-and-drop feature won’t be arriving until sometime “this spring,” as spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleSWUpdates/status/1470468525613539334"&gt;the AppleSWUpdates Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIpYIX"&gt;Universal Control was originally announced alongside macOS Monterey and iPadOS 15 at WWDC back in June, but the feature — which promises to bridge Apple’s Mac and iPad devices, allowing users to use a single mouse and keyboard for both and to drag and drop content between the two — has yet to materialize in either macOS or iPadOS. Apple hasn’t even started offering Universal Control to developers or beta users to test yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kNcuje"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Universal Control on macOS Monterey works","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Nh2JJn"&gt;Apple had previously updated its website in October to indicate that Universal Control &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733044/macos-universal-control-later-this-fall-monterey-feature-delay"&gt;would be available “later this fall,”&lt;/a&gt; but with the official end of fall just a few days away, it seems that the company is no longer going to hit that estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1oyk3J9lwYF7uL2j0OVs-ksrusQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085160/Screen_Shot_2021_12_13_at_2.14.35_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mLD03M"&gt;Universal Control isn’t the only major feature to have missed the initial release for Apple’s 2021 software updates. SharePlay, one of the company’s marquee software features this year, wasn’t available at the launch of either iOS 15 or macOS Monterey (the feature only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22732647/apple-ios-15-1-download-release-available-now"&gt;arrived on iOS on October 25th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-macos-monterey-12-1/"&gt;just hit macOS today&lt;/a&gt;), while other more minor features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;also failed to make the cut&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alpha Motor’s EV designs look cool, but will they ever get made?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YSrFB5r8MLLvbPo-0MRrV_bi1Vs=/264x0:3075x1874/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266185/Screen_Shot_2021_12_13_at_9.57.21_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alpha Motor Ace electric coupe design.&lt;/em&gt; | Images: Alpha Motor Corporation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xcZOwG"&gt;Alpha Motor Corporation is nominally an electric vehicle startup. It has spent the last year pumping out &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/12/secretive-new-ev-startup-unveils-alpha-wolf-electric-pickup-truck/"&gt;retro-futuristic design&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/alpha-motor-ace-electric-car-urban-vehicle/"&gt;retro-futuristic design&lt;/a&gt;, one of which just won the award at this year’s LA Auto Show &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/la-auto-show-announces-the-zevas-award-winners-301425130.html"&gt;for best electric coupe&lt;/a&gt;. But for every new vehicle design Alpha Motor Corporation has released, there are more questions left unanswered. How is the startup funded? What are its plans to build these vehicles? What exactly &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;Alpha Motor Corporation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFqYGX"&gt;Bengt Halvorson at &lt;em&gt;Green Car Reports &lt;/em&gt;put up a mighty effort trying to &lt;a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1133401_confusion-brews-as-retro-style-ev-startup-alpha-motor-turns-on-the-charm"&gt;track down some of those answers in August&lt;/a&gt;. He found some, sort of — it appears that the startup was founded, and perhaps funded, by the same person (or people behind) another EV startup called Neuron, which had ties to China but disappeared from the US startup scene as quickly as it arrived. (Alpha Motor says there’s no relationship.) But he also turned up even more questions, like: why are two auto show baristas apparently moonlighting as Alpha Motor’s spokespeople? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8Wj0T"&gt;Those two men — Joshua Boyt and Jay Lijewski — now say they are full time Alpha Motor employees. Boyt is the head of business development, and Lijewski the head of marketing. I recently spent about 35 minutes talking to them via video call in an attempt to answer some of the questions Halvorson (and, in May, former &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/505010/what-we-know-alpha-motor/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;InsideEVs&lt;/em&gt; reporter Gustavo Ruffo&lt;/a&gt;) tried to answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9GsA9F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yet another mysterious EV startup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MzxAd8"&gt;Boyt and Lijewski made a few admissions. They said the startup does not currently have any drivable prototypes and that there is no parent company above the Alpha Motor corporate entity registered in Delaware. But they remained tight-lipped about pretty much everything else — funding, the size of the team, or why Alpha Motor shares a registered address with Neuron EV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNV7J9"&gt;Boyt said they’re “really not trying to do anything that confuses or misleads people,” and that they are just trying to build a “different kind of company.” Considering how many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820435/lucid-motors-sec-investigation-spac-merger-churchill"&gt;well-funded EV startups have found themselves under investigation&lt;/a&gt; for potentially overpromising or misleading investors, maybe that’s the safer move when there’s still billions of dollars flowing into the space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RafnVP"&gt;Playing the “mysterious EV startup” can sometimes help capture some of that money. But so far, Alpha Motor is demonstrating there’s a razor-thin line between being properly cautious and intentionally muddy about what, exactly, the new company is up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qXlmq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5nQ0k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I, like many people, have seen a lot of the designs that Alpha has put out. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to make it to the LA Auto Show, but I saw you guys won one of the awards there. There’s obviously a lot of attention on the startup in some ways. So I just want to know more about what’s going on. I know that there’s not a lot of information about the origins of this startup, how it plans to execute on any of the things that we’ve seen. So I’m just looking for more answers on all that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e62tvG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joshua Boyt:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure. Well, I mean, obviously, a lot of what we’re doing is intentional. I mean, we definitely put a lot of thought and care into everything that we do, as kind of expressed in the designs that have been put out. Our real goal, again, is just creating cars we think people will love. And we want to create a different kind of company. I mean, there’s a lot of people in this space kind of moving within historically... traditional methods, especially in terms of automotive, and we really just want to be a different kind of company. And so, for that reason, we’ve been a lot more strategic on what kind of information we share, how we release our vehicles and when. But again, it’s all meant for a specific purpose, to make sure that we are in control of what it is that we... the narrative is, and what it is we do as we develop a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="EEeIB6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we really just want to be a different kind of company”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jFXpVO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jay Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, and there’s a couple of different ways to go about building a company. Especially at this stage of the timeline. We could have chosen to remain extremely stealth and not put any vehicles out until we were ready to go. Vehicle designs, that is. But we decided to put as much information, vehicle designs, design ethos out there as we could simply because we can. And we can’t help ourselves but put these vehicle designs out there to see what the public is interested in. That can help us steer the company’s trajectory, kind of knowing what people will like before we get to the production phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjoPrj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. Is the company something you guys joined that was already in process? Or is it something that you two created?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jDMwv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, we so we joined when the company was already formed. Like many folks, I personally fell in love with a particular design that Alpha put out months ago — it was the Jax, I fell in love with the Jax — and at that particular time, I was working on an online event that was meant to serve as a humanitarian effort to raise awareness on the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfyktN"&gt;So I was working on this project to just kind of change the narrative on what people know and think about the country of Yemen. And I had noticed after falling in love with the Jax that Alpha... our mission here is “move humanity.” And at that particular time, Alpha was trying to share their platform for causes just like the Yemen project that I was working on. And so I sent an email to [Alpha] and they picked it up and they shared it on their platform, and I was really impressed by that. And so that started a natural kind of organic conversation and me and Joshua had some in-depth talks with the team at Alpha and we joined, what about four months ago, Joshua?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eVNowI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We were just drawn by the design”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z9z46U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, formally I think it was around September, I believe. But we’ve been involved with the project for some time. And obviously, same thing. We were just drawn by the design. We worked in automotive for some some time as well and [have] done a lot of things in marketing and different support in our career. And we’ve always been enticed by the idea of mission, and companies that are driven by heart and driven by a bigger objective than just monetary return. And I think it’s pretty evident as we worked with the team and met with everybody there that the goal really is to just... is part of creating an ecosystem, not just really great cars, which obviously is something, but connecting people and the way that we live, and using our platform, again, to create visibility for philanthropic uses and for connectivity. I think that’s a very admirable trait about the company. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alpha Motor Wolf pickup truck design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MEQrTl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;And the other piece is I think there’s a lot in the strategy that we’ve learned working with the company of really not trying to do anything that confuses or misleads people. Like, we really want to stick to a strategy of being very confident and cautious because we don’t want to build hype. Like nothing we’ve done... even, you mentioned the award, winning the award [at the LA Auto Show], we’ve not promoted anything. And I mean, we’ve got between like, two of our posts of cars that we launched, we have over a million views on YouTube. Because we’re focusing on the things that we love, we’re focusing on products that we think people will love, and building a great company. So I think that ambition is really proving itself. Being a little bit more strategic on how we’re revealing information, again, is because we don’t want to be self promoting. We don’t want to be marketing ourselves, so to speak, but really just kind of leaving an open door for people to access information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="mbmyr2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we can’t reveal everybody that’s involved”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zi9aR3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned the team at Alpha a couple of times. Who is the team at Alpha?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lolNSp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;We have a pretty good group, for reasons of where we are as a company, we can’t reveal everybody that’s involved. Some of that information is public knowledge on the internet. We’ve seen a couple posts recently of people mentioning some of the team members, but unfortunately, we can’t reveal everybody that’s involved right now, but as we do get to that spot, we’ll definitely make sure you guys know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnCHLp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you say how big the team is?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZBA5a"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;How big the team is? Um, I can’t. It’s... we’ve got a lot of people that are working in different departments, obviously, PR, business development, engineering. We’ve just recently been putting a bunch of stuff out about our design centers and our battery, extended life batteries that we’ll be using for mobile use. The team’s working hard on a lot of stuff. But again, yeah, we can’t really...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRS13e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;The individuals who are in a spot where they can share their involvement with the company, they’re all on LinkedIn right now. We’re all on LinkedIn, and the folks who are not listed that are on the team, it’s for reasons, you know, that... I’m sure you understand the startup phase, there’s a lot of hustle and scrappy nature of building a startup that it just makes it... that’s the way it is right now. But when the time is right, you guys know exactly who’s on the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="9luyCb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we are just begging for people to be patient with us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hsPve7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;We’ve seen there’s a lot of companies out there, a lot of companies that are in the startup phase, a lot of companies that are bringing different things to market and all that, and I think we’ve tried to be very objective and step back and look at the strategies of other companies... And the problem I think a lot of times that happens when the push is for... whatever the motivation in a startup is, whether it’s monetary or whatever, it can change a company’s trajectory. And we’re so committed to being a different kind of company and having something that we can establish and carry many, many years into the future, we don’t want to open up too much. We don’t want [there] to be any deviation from that mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uf5YM6"&gt;So it’s difficult because obviously we understand the game we want to play, and communicate, and we know the importance of media and everyone involved. But we’re so confident in what it is we’re building, we are just begging for people to be patient with us because... I mean, the result is happening. The response has just been incredible from the cars that we’re producing. We couldn’t be more excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWdMFe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve used a couple different words to describe the stuff that you’ve been working on, so I want to be absolutely clear about this. You say the cars that you’re “producing,” and you’ve talked about the vehicles that you’re “designing.” What is actually being done at Alpha Motor right now? Are you designing vehicle designs that you hope to produce if you feel they’re popular enough? Are you actually trying to start producing something that looks like one of those cars? What is actually happening?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfPubG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;All of the vehicles that we have released are in production process. In our production process. Every one of those is within our production process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rx8lyy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And what does that mean, just so I’m clear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y92p1d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, it just means that they’re all at varying degrees of the production process, but they are all in development. For sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3eFOW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s an incredible lift. I mean, we have EV startups, even large automotive companies, that are spending billions of dollars to just get the first electric vehicle out the door.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTzI4h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Right, right. Yeah. And the timeline obviously is different on all of those. But again, you know, we... our goal really is to try and make sure that our process again is very intentional. We’re putting out, at the phases where we can, every single vehicle that there is out there, like I don’t know if you’ve got a chance to see, but the Wolf is in a different part of the production process where we have the non-drivable prototype that right now you can see at the Petersen [Automotive] Museum. So the timelines vary on on all of these vehicles, but every single one of them is in production process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t0ZmpO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re in a very delicate phase”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JJnb14"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering the financial lift that would be involved in attacking that, even if you have them spaced out over a couple of years, how is the startup funded?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmtRrr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, again...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuT4XY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;We can’t really get into that at the moment. We’re in a very delicate phase when it comes to that aspect of the company which, you know, also informs the slow release of a lot of information. What we can share at this time is that we are working on putting out as many vehicle designs as we can, we’re fleshing out not only the the vehicle lineup, but the accessory lineup, even the concept for our retail locations down the road. We’re really trying to be on the ready for every aspect of our business, so that when it is go time, we’re ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9ycq8N"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGELzaE6ZTc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jlmtG3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me ask one more question, and then I’ll follow up on some of that. On paper, the startup is headquartered in Delaware, registered through Delaware. Is that part of the company, Alpha Motor US — is that where it stops or is there a parent company somewhere else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qoGI5t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;That’s where it starts — that’s where it stops. We’re based in Irvine, California. We are a private entity at the moment. Our team is very hard at work on many aspects of the company and [laughs] that’s where we’re at at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLRLJN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;And again, I know all that information that is public knowledge is fine, and we want people to be able to know that stuff. We’ve even... any of those more detailed questions. We actually just recently posted a FAQ on our website that goes through any of this kind of information that you might be interested in as well. So definitely feel free to check that out on the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCed4s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got it. I know you don’t want to talk about individuals. You said there are people on LinkedIn who have the company name out there as far as who their employer is, but can you say who some of the executives are who run the company? Who it was that founded the company? Because you said earlier that you guys aren’t trying to do anything that confuses or misleads people, but that kind of information usually comes out with startups that are trying to raise money and exist in the real world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxR9UB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;And I guess that’s the thing is, we’re not necessarily putting out there that we’re like trying to raise money or we’re trying to do this. What we’re trying to do is just build our company, and I know everybody wants to know exactly what phase we’re at and when, and that’s the difficult part because media really, really wants to pull all those details out for other people that potentially would want to get involved. But again, we’re not trying to do things the way everyone else does. And I know that seems frustrating, and I can feel it. We talk to a lot of media about this. But again, we really just want to continue doing what we’re doing. I mean, that’s the reason that we are a privately held company. We’re doing our process, and we feel very, very confident that what we’re doing is going to create a different kind of company. And so we’re doing everything we can to reveal... again, if you wanted to look at any of that information about the name of the founder is Edward Lee, that’s public knowledge, that’s posted online, that’s in &lt;a href="https://www.alphamotorinc.com/faq"&gt;our FAQ as well&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQPfTy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;And our vice chair is Jada Lee, she’s our vice chair and counsel for the company. That’s the leadership team right there. I am the head of marketing and Joshua’s the head of business development. There are more folks on the team, of course, but you know, again, they’re not ready to divulge that info at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jkjkza"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;But again, we really want to help people get to know us as a company. And that doesn’t necessarily only come by introducing the individuals. We really want to be the kind of company that shows how we operate, the kind of energy and heart that’s put behind our designs, the things that we want to support. I mean, obviously we’re trying to do things like getting connected with the &lt;a href="https://www.alphamotorinc.com/movehumanity"&gt;Michael J. Fox Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and promoting some different things we can using the visibility of our company. We’re excited about that. We’re excited that we know the attention that we’re getting, the reviews on YouTube, through social media, all that, that we can use that for good. And so that’s really what we’re focused on right now. All the rest of it, it’ll be, as things come out, obviously everyone will be excited in that time that it is, but yeah, we just want to put our attention on the things that we know we can utilize for good right now.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jax electric crossover SUV design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ukwkug"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re accepting preorders for some of the vehicles though, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qdqbv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;Not monetarily. We’re taking reservations as a way to get in the queue. In due course, once we develop or further our timeline, we will get into fully refundable cash deposits. But we’re not at that point in our timeline yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mc3Abk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you feel any obligation to those people who have expressed enough interest to sign up to share more information than you already have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdqC95"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;I mean, I think people are excited enough about what we have going on to want to reserve those vehicles, they’re on that journey with us and their excitement is right there with us. And us being able to bring more vehicles to the table, we think that will support different people in different seasons of life or different phases. Like we just released the Saga — being able to have a four-door sedan option is really awesome. We’re excited about that. We actually teased another model that’s coming up soon as well. So these are the kind of things we’re trying to create — cars, like you said that people will love, that will fit in within people’s lifestyle and that helps to kind of continue our process on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G9FQ9D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Alpha Motor doesn’t have any drivable prototypes yet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xS4sCz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;And we certainly are interacting with folks who have shared their interest in our vehicles and will continue to do so. Finding unique and clever ways to interact with these folks and have them interact with our vehicles in a way before they’re actually physically produced. So we’re working on that for sure. And we don’t take that excitement lightly. You know, the love that has been given to us by people who are already in the reservation queue, it puts a lot of wind in our sails, and yeah, it definitely encourages us to keep going and to push through all the heavy lifting that a startup will endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uaQ903"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One last thing on the different models just so I’m clear. You said there is one at the Petersen Museum that’s not drivable but is built out. What about the other ones? Do you have drivable prototypes of any of the other vehicles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MxQHdh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;No, not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZILoj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Not currently, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vKhTg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. And how — obviously, like you’ve said, I think it’s pretty obvious that there has been a positive reaction to a lot of the designs — how deep into the functional side of those designs that you’re creating have you gone? Are these CAD modeled exterior and interiors that look really good, but the sort of internals of these theoretical vehicles don’t exist, or are we talking like down to the battery pack, you’ve actually done the work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nr9snD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, Sean, you’re asking really good questions definitely into our processes. And unfortunately, that’s one of those things that we can’t share specifics around. But again, like anybody that is familiar with what it takes to make visuals like we do, you probably will understand the amount that goes into that. We definitely are investing a lot of care in the cars that we release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sVVjO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;And you know, we will say this, the folks on our team, design, engineering, and beyond, are extremely well-versed in what it takes to actually bring vehicles to the market. So I think your answer is enveloped in that statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQoTqp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. You mentioned some of the other things that have been written recently. One thing that I’m obviously curious about, that a lot of people have been curious about, and I know that the company has been very particular in expressing what it sees as the facts of the situation are, this apparent closeness to another company that had sort of come and gone, called Neuron. I see that Alpha has released statements saying that there is no relationship but there are obvious overlaps, as far as addresses registered to these businesses, and things like that. What is going on with Neuron?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAyjnP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;We’re not associated with that at all. Alpha is a completely different company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40082j"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it just a strange coincidence that you wound up with the same registered address?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBNrhs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Um, I have no idea, like it’s not... all I know is that we are completely separate and not connected in any way to that company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaCdFE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that goes for even someone like Edward Lee or other people who are at the top of the company, that they’re separate as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KArkxV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re interested in speaking with Edward about anything in his prior work history, we’ll see what we can do to set up an interview with him, but we can’t speak on Edward’s past. It’s really not our place, but we can assure you that Alpha Motor Corporation is its entirely own entity, privately held, and we’re pushing forward with our mission here at Alpha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3qnND"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. I mean, if he has availability, I would love to talk to him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQulI1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;Okay, yeah. Shoot us a couple of dates and times that will work for you and we’ll see what we can get on the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="lEKhWl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We really don’t feel extremely beholden to justify what we are doing at Alpha at this stage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wllXus"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As you release more designs, what should people be looking for as far as trying to get a sense of how you’re actually going to succeed as a startup? Like, what kinds of things are you going to start showing people as evidence that you’re going to be able to build these vehicles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ML8QO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;I think that people will start to see the natural progression of seeing vehicles. I mean, we will have driving prototypes. We will have cars that will drive on the road. We will produce cars. I think that it’s all going to happen as expected. Again, we’re not trying to over promise and under deliver. What we want to do is just stick to doing what we know, is how it works. Like Jay mentioned, our team is versed in bringing vehicles to market, is versed in doing everything from design, engineering, production, all of those pieces. And so we really just want to make sure that we’re being — again, we’re not giving people something that they’re hanging on, “Oh you said this date and that,” or whatever. We really are trying to just do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsen93"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;We really don’t feel extremely beholden to justify what we are doing at Alpha at this stage. Yeah, we’re having very detailed conversations with folks who will provide resource, but as far as those kinds of detailed conversations... we’re not having them with the general public or, frankly, with the media at this time. But we will feel responsible for sharing a lot more of that detail when we get into the phase of accepting cash deposits for vehicles because that will signal that the pathway is clear for production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVQAUf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. Alright. Well, I appreciate you guys shedding as much light as you’re able to on this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwTog4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Quick question for you before we get off. What got you interested in Alpha? What got you interested in talking to us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU8gcj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lack of information around some of the specifics. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJudfT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Didn’t like any of the designs or anything? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oupnqu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The designs are great, but I’ve been covering this industry for a while now, and not to try and compare your designs to other people’s designs, but we’ve seen a lot of designs. And we’ve seen a lot of companies struggle to come up with the vast resources that are required to, like I said, execute on even one of those designs. And even armed with those resources, are often running into trouble [getting past] the sort of general blockers that stop a lot of companies from ever succeeding in this space. Even a company like Tesla has skirted quite close to death multiple times. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGAcgX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Totally. We definitely are excited about what we’re doing, and I hear that, and I know there’s a lot of people that want to see EV take its place in the world, and we’re about that. We are about this mission, understanding that EV is the future. We really believe in the direction of our company and the process that we’re taking. I know that it’s hard and I know your job is one of the hardest ones in trying to give people confidence and comfortability in what is a new market. There’s so much market potential. You know what I mean? The EV market is still so small compared to internal combustion engine, and a lot of that is people being afraid of what stepping into that future looks like. Do we have infrastructure? Do we have all these things? And it’s going to take a lot of people working together to get us to that space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ieq0yP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;The folks are either afraid of the lack of infrastructure, or they just haven’t really found an EV design that really resonates with them. And I think that’s a very unique thing that we offer at Alpha, is a different take on the design ethos of EVs. The visceral reaction that people are getting when they’re looking on these vehicle designs, whether they’re posted on our website, our Instagram, or even someone like &lt;em&gt;MotorTrend&lt;/em&gt;’s website or Instagram, they’re getting an insane amount of interest. Again, that puts a lot of wind in our sails, and that pushes us to fulfill this mission. We’re definitely on track and we’re up for the challenge. We completely understand the potential pitfalls and difficulties that are out in front of us, and we know that it’s going to be an uphill battle, but we’re very confident that we’ll be able to see it through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UulCnX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me ask you one last question on that design piece of this. Because I think certainly a lot of people would agree that automakers could stand to have some fresh competition on the design side. Some have sort of gone out of their way recently to try to stand out from the crowd. But a lot of what drives modern vehicles toward looking like each other and gives these companies trouble in sort of making vehicles that stand out and have really radical designs is that they’re developing vehicles with stringent federal safety standards in mind, efficiency targets that they have to hit, working around the current physical and sort of chemical restrictions of battery technology, when we’re talking about electric vehicles. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TGgnB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much of all of that goes into the process of coming up with these vehicle designs that Alpha Motor has put out, or are you just leveraging the ability and the freedom of maybe not having to answer those questions just yet, and sort of being able to flex design muscles because you’re not really fitting inside the box you might eventually have to fit in? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIxfjc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;All those things are in consideration. We want to make vehicles that we’re actually going to produce. They’re not just cool designs. They’re not just drawings on paper, either. Our goal is to make vehicles that will be vehicles that people can drive. [Also] vehicles we love, like we want to drive them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="lmKvTf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;I think our designs are unique, but I don’t think that they’re necessarily radical in terms of a lot of the testing that will have to be done. I don’t think that we’re introducing any sort of design that is new to the verifying agencies. I think we’re taking an approach of tapping into what people have always loved about cars, and not trying to give people our take on the future. I think that’s a key differentiator. We take all that into account. And like I said earlier, the folks on our team are extremely well versed in what it takes to not only design cool-looking vehicles, but what it takes to bring those vehicles to the market. You can underline that because I think that’s very important to share. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You should now be able to download iOS 15.2&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NjCL3h"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15.2, which includes a ton of features and fixes, has started to become roll out to iPhones after an extensive beta period. According to Apple’s release notes, posted by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-ios-15-2-watchos-8-3-and-tvos-15-2-to-all-users/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-ios-15-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the update includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="txvrW9"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;The Digital Legacy program&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22812264/digital-legacy-death-estate-google-apple-how-to"&gt;designate who gets access to your data&lt;/a&gt; when you die&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1i2stA"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22749352/apple-app-privacy-report-ios-15-2-beta-feature"&gt;The App Privacy Report&lt;/a&gt;, which shows what permissions your apps use, and what websites they connect to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TqxDX0"&gt;Apple’s $4.99 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822631/apple-music-voice-plan-ios-15-2-release-candidate"&gt;voice-only plan for Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5Jr09g"&gt;A fix for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778650/apple-iphone-13-pro-beta-macro-mode-button-auto-switching"&gt;somewhat confusing state of the 13 Pro’s macro mode&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="2XMGjZ"&gt;The update also brings with it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776028/ios-15-2-beta-communication-safety-messages-children-sexually-explicit-nudity-scan-notifications"&gt;some of Apple’s communication safety features&lt;/a&gt;, one of which will blur iMessages sent to children that an on-device scan tags as potentially being explicit. The feature was part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;Apple’s controversial suite of changes&lt;/a&gt; meant to fight child sexual abuse material (CSAM), which involved on-device scanning of photos uploaded to iCloud, as well as automatically notifying parents if their child chose to view pictures tagged as inappropriate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ItxICe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kb2zI4"&gt;Apple has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;delayed the photo library scanning feature&lt;/a&gt; and has made it so that children get to choose whether to notify their parents. iOS 15.2 also brings changes to Safari and Siri that will redirect users to resources if they search for topics related to CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpg3CG"&gt;The update also includes Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22824733/apple-iphone-part-service-history-ios-15-2"&gt;new parts and service history feature&lt;/a&gt;, which can show you which parts on your device have been replaced and whether the job was done using genuine Apple parts. Apple says that the iPhone XR, XS, and SE second-gen will show if your battery was replaced and that the iPhone 11 and up will also show if your display has been replaced. The iPhone 12 and 13 models will be able to show info about camera replacements as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsjGrg"&gt;The repair history will show up in Settings &amp;gt; General  &amp;gt; About, under the name and software version section. If you haven’t replaced the battery, screen, or camera on your phone, it won’t show up, according to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212878"&gt;Apple’s support document&lt;/a&gt; for the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCRjka"&gt;To download iOS 15.2, go to Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Software Update. As usual, it can take a moment to roll out to everyone, so if you don’t see it you may want to check back in after a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qY1oWF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 13th, 3:04PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added info about repair history info.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
