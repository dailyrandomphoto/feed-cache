    <title>Anker announces Soundcore’s first audio glasses, priced at $200</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LRcvllYVamjBpwnngrsGA3vRad4=/0x4:2040x1364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988455/_20_Wander_frame_with_male_model.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hFY010"&gt;Anker is joining in on the trend of glasses that pull double duty as music listening devices. Today the company’s Soundcore brand announced the $199.99 Soundcore Frames. That price gets you the glasses’ temples and a frame of your choosing. The frames can be swapped out for any of the 10 different designs, but the chunky side temples always stay the same polished black style. They’re due to start shipping in mid-November and will be available from Anker’s website, Amazon, and Best Buy among other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBcCBW"&gt;The temples essentially act as true wireless earbuds, with two speakers in each one. This is a strategy we’ve seen from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314474/razer-anzu-smart-glasses-announced-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;other companies like Razer&lt;/a&gt;. In Anker’s case, it makes it simple to switch the temples to a different frame; polarized, blue-light filtering, and prescription lens options will also be available. Additional frame styles will sell for $49.99 each. The company will let people virtually try on frames through its Soundcore smartphone app for Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VW-Um2aFaVEuwZsGGvdYAWfO75A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923411/A3600012_Bluetooth_Audio_Smart_Glasses_TD02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Anker&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The frames easily detach from the temples.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fe1d2E"&gt;There are two speakers on each temple, and in most cases outside, most people won’t notice your glasses are playing music. But if you’ve got the volume up inside, there’ll definitely be some sound leakage to those nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCp9yj"&gt;Battery life is estimated at up to 5.5 hours of continuous playback, and the Soundcore Frames are IPX4 water resistant. Similar to the controls we’ve already seen from Bose and others, they use simple tap and swipe controls on the temples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zg6aHF"&gt;Anker is very much aware this is its first attempt in a category that has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22351451/bose-frames-tempo-audio-sunglasses-review-features"&gt;led by Bose&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;some extent Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is hoping it can do its own part in pushing the concept of audio glasses to wider popularity. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>On The Verge is happening October 22nd and 23rd, and you’re invited</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XlYPPOHcKDl29XQcexxX6AMidVA=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69936061/Stage_2__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of The Verge’s 10-year party at Spring Studios in NYC. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Join us in New York City for live performances, amazing artists and creators, and much more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Kg9Dbv"&gt;Hello, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;friends! It’s almost been 10 years since we launched (can you believe it?), and to celebrate we’re throwing a big party. It’s happening on October 22nd and 23rd in New York City — and &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/Podcast"&gt;we hope you’ll join us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVpRtM"&gt;We’re throwing this party at Spring Studios, which has a rich tradition of bringing creative people together to show off the future of tech, art, and culture. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;will completely transform the space for two days and fill it with special guests, live performances, interactive art and games, awesome food and drink, and an opening night party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="s6d3e5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Join us at On The Verge!","description":"The Verge is turning 10, and you’re invited to help us celebrate in New York City on October 22nd and 23rd. (Hint: get $150 off the standard ticket price with code &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$99NOW&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.)","label":"Buy tickets","url":"https://voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/vergesecondary"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="naCd5g"&gt;Here’s some of what we’re excited about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mZNe56"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;exclusive premiere screening&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pFPdR85yOiM_jt1LXuZmNesYYt0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892324/Springboard_Thumb.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m1cOLZ"&gt;Everyone who attends On The Verge&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will see the debut of our biggest documentary to date, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Springboard: The Secret History of the First Real Smartphone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. A decade before Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, a tiny team of renegades imagined and tried to build the modern smartphone. Nearly forgotten by history, a little startup called Handspring split off from the mainstream tech world to try and invent the future before the present was ready for it. And though Handspring has been relegated to the margins of tech history, many of the predictions they chased in the late 90s would be correct. After the screening, we’ll hold a live Q&amp;amp;A with Dieter and Nilay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TZAiQs"&gt;Live performances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="6JlhL4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbK_dQ5wXGk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n4dwsn"&gt;Our opening night party will feature a live performance by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I73SGyUTsM"&gt;The Stickmen&lt;/a&gt;: an amazing DJ and drummer duo that will transform our expo space with light and sound. And we’ll have a great lineup of other talented DJs to bring the space to life throughout the entire event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8oDjmw"&gt;A one-of-a-kind indie arcade&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fFrKpRby46MNr5VdJ339qsI949k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890465/ef97f32612f5c2179942fd123755ab13.WONDERVILLE.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="95rs8S"&gt;We’ve assembled a wildly creative group of artists &amp;amp; creators to make On The Verge&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;fun and interactive. That includes the folks from &lt;a href="https://www.wonderville.nyc/"&gt;Wonderville arcade in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, who will be putting together their unique lineup of games for guests to enjoy. (We’re particularly excited about The Giffinator, which will let you put yourself and your friends inside of a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;animated GIF.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="k5WLcE"&gt;Experimental art&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/39ulcNkSY3OtkZmgjHNc5C-7cC8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890725/Studio_5.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fb72u9"&gt;We’re gathering creators working on the edge of the future, including the wildly talented &lt;a href="http://zach.li/"&gt;Zach Lieberman&lt;/a&gt;: an artist, researcher, and educator who creates performances and installations that take human gestures as input and amplify them in different ways. He’s bringing several works to On The Verge, including &lt;em&gt;Reflection Studies, &lt;/em&gt;which will transform one of the largest spaces at Spring Studios into an interactive art experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DkKPLi"&gt;The Creators Studio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="w3DW5e"&gt;We’re turning the roof of Spring Studios into a space for interactive talks, demos, and performances — including science and tech demos, a creative illustration class, and a repair school hosted by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22702324%2Fon-the-verge-event-date-tickets-guests-creators" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our friends at iFixit&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want to just hang out, you’ll be able to take in spectacular views of the city while enjoying some of the best food and drink it has to offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jVbQ7D"&gt;A special live &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="irKens"&gt;Nilay and Dieter will be joined by &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;alum Joanna Stern and David Pierce to look back at 10 years of &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and talk about their favorite memories from creating the site. Then, they’ll be joined on stage by special guest Yänjaa Wintersoul: an award-winning memory athlete. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;hosts will see if their memory of covering gadgets for a decade can stand up to the skills of a World Memory Champion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dc3rTb"&gt;All-day programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2e8oqK"&gt;On top of all that, our main stage will be packed for both days of the event with live performances and talks with special guests, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Id7oc1"&gt;Dieter and Nilay will sit down with Nick Weaver, co-founder and CEO of Eero, to chat about the future of the smarthome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I80rVv"&gt;Alex Heath will be joined by Snap SVP Ben Schwerin and Snap star Jacques Slade to talk about creating on the resurgent platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EvCxvA"&gt;Dan Seifert will hang out with the iFixit crew and discuss the right to repair our devices, as iFixit tears down a Nintendo Switch live on stage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RZCGDg"&gt;Rapper, producer and songwriter Ricky Desktop will offer a live demo and share how he broke through TikTok into the music industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EmVxVo"&gt;... and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="916hDr"&gt;Head over to the event website &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/Podcast"&gt;to learn more about who’s coming&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDTzIs"&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;first big event, and it won’t be our last. We hope you’ll join us as we kick off the next 10 years of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which will be bigger, brighter, and more exciting: just like the future we imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uj6nCR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: COVID-19 is still a reality, and the health and safety of everyone at the event is our first priority. So everyone who joins us will be required to follow masking protocols and provide confidential proof of vaccination. Stay tuned: we’ll keep everyone updated on the latest health and safety requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash launches $1 million disaster relief fund for restaurants</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d0vrGT5lnnMFvWrK13W-5CGqbgM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988413/acastro_190724_1777_doordash_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ms7x2p"&gt;Restaurant delivery platform DoorDash has launched a restaurant disaster relief fund that will offer grants of up to $10,000 to US restaurants affected by natural disasters over the next year, the company said Wednesday. The $1 million fund will be open to eligible restaurant owners beginning November 1st and is a partnership with small business assistance platform Hello Alice. Restaurants affected by Hurricane Ida in August and the ongoing California wildfires are eligible to apply, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y1Pcf1"&gt;To qualify, restaurants must be experiencing hardship due to a state or federally declared natural disaster; have a brick-and-mortar location in the US with three or fewer locations; and have fewer than 50 employees per location. The restaurants have to have revenue of $3 million or less at each location for the past 12 months and have been open for at least six months. Applications will be processed every three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFiNK9"&gt;Restaurants can use the grant funds for rent, utilities, maintenance, supplies, payroll, and other essential expenses, DoorDash said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qrsgf"&gt;The company also unveiled a new partner program that matches merchants on its platform with a dedicated point of contact for support and banking reconciliation issues, and it introduced a new mobile app for iOS and Android, which it says will be available “in the coming months.” It will allow restaurants to track live orders and get real-time data about sales and operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAwp4Y"&gt;DoorDash’s latest announcement in support of restaurants comes at a somewhat awkward time. The company is involved in two lawsuits against New York City that involve laws attempting to regulate how delivery companies work with restaurants there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTaOC3"&gt;Along with Grubhub and Uber Eats, DoorDash is suing NYC for capping the amounts the platforms can collect in fees from restaurants. In a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839571/Delivery_Platforms_Complaint.pdf"&gt;complaint filed&lt;/a&gt; in US District Court on September 9th, the companies argue that the fee caps are government overreach. They sought an injunction preventing enforcement of the rule which restricts platforms from charging restaurants more than 23 percent per order, but they were &lt;a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/delivery-providers-accused-violating-nyc-fee-cap"&gt;accused of adding unclear fees&lt;/a&gt; on top of their delivery fees, exceeding the maximum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dCls5"&gt;And on September 15th, DoorDash filed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675517/doordash-sues-new-york-city-law-delivery-share-customer-data-restaurants"&gt;lawsuit against New York City&lt;/a&gt; over its law requiring delivery companies to share customer data with restaurants it works with, &lt;a href="https://doordash.news/2021/09/15/doordash-stands-up-for-new-york-city-consumer-safety-and-privacy/"&gt;calling it&lt;/a&gt; “a shocking and invasive intrusion of consumers’ privacy.” Earlier this month, the &lt;a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nyc-will-not-enforce-restaurant-customer-data-sharing-law-while-doordash-sues-2021-10-05"&gt;city agreed to hold off&lt;/a&gt; on enforcing the data-sharing requirement while the lawsuit is pending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTn0zE"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/doordash-reports-record-q2-sales-but-swings-to-a-loss-11628801842"&gt;second-quarter earnings report&lt;/a&gt;, DoorDash reported its gross order volume was up 70 percent year over year to $10.5 billion, but revenue was up 83 percent from the year-ago quarter, to $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirPods Max are $100 off at Amazon and Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max from above" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/11VnAW3NZ3yiwxlw_W4XsA-P93o=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988411/npatel_201209_4332_0019sq.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nilay Patel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MaBQ8X"&gt;Another day, another sweet deal on the Apple AirPods Max. This time you can get them in select colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=9&amp;amp;imprToken=6cbe3b18-a2b8-9f79-016&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22486582%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?sharedid=vergedeals&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Max-Pink%2F774269130" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $450. We haven’t seen these headphones drop below this price yet, so this is a perfect time to get your hands on some if you missed out on any of our previous deals. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;Our reviewer Chris Welch&lt;/a&gt; was impressed by the “tremendous build quality and sound” but was a little put off by the price. This sale helps soften the blow of the initial sticker shock and brings them a little closer to competitors from Sony and Bose. These robust cans offer a luxurious fit and finish, pairing them with amazing spatial audio and noise cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="36cJA1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="6Wp7jW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best noise-canceling headphones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8lN3tl"&gt;If you bought that shiny new OLED Switch, but you’ve already run out of storage space, check out this deal on a Samsung Evo Plus microSD card, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fsamsung-128gb-microsdxc%2Fp%2FN82E16820147786%3FDescription%3Dsamsung%2520microsd%26cm_re%3Dsamsung_microsd-_-20-147-786-_-Product%26quicklink%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Newegg for just $16&lt;/a&gt;. This 128GB card effectively triples the storage space of a Switch console (or any other compatible device) and couldn't be easier to use. Just flip open the SD card port and slot it in. Prices on SD cards tend to fluctuate a lot, so if you’re in the market for some extra storage or will be soon, now might be the time to jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="M5Vbe7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10803569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oNYOb6"&gt;One of the best gaming keyboards available, the Corsair K100, is currently enjoying a sizable discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-K100-Optical-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08HR74WV4/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=12&amp;amp;imprToken=82be3b19-5cdd-7cf8-d1b&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22486582%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon, making it just $190&lt;/a&gt;. This gaming keyboard pulls out all the stops in terms of features, bringing together macro keys, RGB lighting, and dedicated media playback controls. The standout feature of the K100, however, is the control knob in the upper left corner. This dial can be used to control a variety of options, including brightness control, track jogging, window zoom, or switching between focused applications. The keyboard can be equipped with either Cherry Silver switches or Corsair’s proprietary OPX optical switches, depending on your preference. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat is down, as many users can’t post or send messages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat white ghost logo on a bright yellow background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h0qetljI3w5--QOjcQSbaeWN3PY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988409/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MUmaBr"&gt;For the last couple of hours, Snap Streaks have been at risk as many users report they can’t successfully post story updates or send messages on the service. In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1448254521914937349"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the Snapchat Support Twitter account confirmed there are issues this morning, telling people to “hang tight, we’re looking into it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZXmVN"&gt;The source of the issue is unclear, but this doesn’t seem to be a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710963/facebook-dns-bgp-outage-backbone-maintenance"&gt;Facebook-level event&lt;/a&gt; that could take a long time to fix. The app itself is still mostly functional for some of us, and if you don’t try to post you may not notice anything is wrong right away. It’s also not crashing constantly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600902/snapchat-crashing-down-outage-issue-app-login"&gt;which has been a problem for Snapchat&lt;/a&gt;. So whenever service is restored, you may not need an update before you can connect again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhIUFK"&gt;Based on user reports, our own experiences, and &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/snapchat/"&gt;a peek at DownDetector&lt;/a&gt;, the problem isn’t fixed yet, but if we receive any information from Snapchat or notice things changing, we will update this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KE8xvF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re aware that some Snapchatters are having issues using the app right now - hang tight, we’re looking into it!&lt;/p&gt;— Snapchat Support (@snapchatsupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1448254521914937349?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>AMD Radeon RX 6600 official: 1080p for $329, at retail any moment now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HOih6ZFzdo5tDETOD6wqcOqeTKo=/0x0:1322x881/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988257/rx_6600.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="38UExT"&gt;Surprise! AMD just revealed the $329* Radeon RX 6600, a new budget 1080p gaming graphics card that should be available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=amd+radeon+rx+6600&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsearchpage.jsp%3F_dyncharset%3DUTF-8%26browsedCategory%3Dabcat0507002%26id%3Dpcat17071%26iht%3Dn%26ks%3D960%26list%3Dy%26qp%3Dchipsetmanufacture_facet%253DChipset%2520Manufacturer%7EAMD%26sc%3DGlobal%26st%3Dcategoryid%2524abcat0507002%26type%3Dpage%26usc%3DAll%2520Categories&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?N=4294966937+4294820651"&gt;Micro Center&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2Fpl%3FN%3D100007709%2520601359511" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt; starting as soon as &lt;em&gt;the very moment we published this story&lt;/em&gt; at 9AM ET. Given how exorbitant GPU prices have been during the global chip crunch, you should probably stop reading if you want one and &lt;em&gt;get with the clicking&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhALx5"&gt;OK: If you’re reading these words, I’m assuming you’ve now secured either a new GPU or a dose of disappointment. Great! Now let’s discuss why you might actually want this video card, based on my recent briefing with AMD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KdgoQv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;*all of these prices are made up by AMD and Nvidia and you’ll rarely ever see them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jVKEDM"&gt;If you’ve read my colleague Tom Warren’s recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617256/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review-gpu-graphics-card"&gt;AMD RX 6600 XT review&lt;/a&gt;, you know we already considered that $379* card an entry-level GPU. It was capable of playing most of the latest games at 1080p and maximum settings, but not all, not with ray-tracing, and was definitely a sizable step beneath the $400* Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti that costs just $20 more*. It’s exactly the kind of bang-for-the-buck GPU that I used to buy myself, though.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biFJOP"&gt;Well, the new RX 6600 is the exact same GPU, but with four fewer compute units (28 instead of 32), slightly slower clockspeeds, and reduced power consumption of just 132 watts (vs. 160 watts) so you can easily fit it into a system with a 450-watt power supply,  instead of the 500 watts AMD recommends for the 6600 XT, let alone the 550-watt that even Nvidia’s entry level $329* GeForce RTX 3060 asks buyers to bring to the table. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OFCgZmvQtatvsrcTzqRg2y6BQ74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22922770/6600_fps.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMD says its card wins some and loses some compared to the identically priced* Nvidia RTX 3060.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NkFqQK"&gt;In practice, AMD says you’re looking at a 10 to 15-percent performance gap between the 6600 and 6600 XT, but the company would rather you look at its 23-percent uplift over Nvidia’s RTX 2060 instead — assuming you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310745/amd-ryzen-3000-smart-access-memory-resizable-bar"&gt;taking advantage of Smart Access Memory aka Resizable BAR&lt;/a&gt; with a compatible CPU and game, anyhow. If so, AMD says you can expect to average 91 FPS in &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6,&lt;/em&gt; 85 FPS in &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; at maximum levels of detail, and averages 100 FPS across the company’s test suite, compared to 120 FPS average for the 6600 XT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGDTEF"&gt;The company also says its Nvidia DLSS competitor, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) is potent enough in games like &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt; that you can step up to 1440p plus raytracing and still average 60 FPS (assuming you’re pairing it with a Ryzen 5 5600X processor and DDR4 3600MHz RAM or better). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_H5JDafs2meRjsymcVkn1ouvF7E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22922779/rx6600_gpus.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J0oliG"&gt;Unfortunately, most of AMD’s GPU board partners don’t seem to be taking full advantage of the RX 6600’s reduced power consumption yet. While ASRock does have a single-fan design and Sapphire’s dual-fan looks fairly svelte, every card takes up at least two full slots in a case and they all still require 8-pin PCIe power connector — and the PowerColor card still quotes a 500W power supply recommendation, not 450. Still, like the Nvidia RTX 3060, the reduced size and power requirements could make it popular for smaller builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OtQ3o"&gt;You should find full reviews of the AMD RX 6600 at a variety of reputable publications today, and we’ll add a few of their conclusions later in the day. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;But as with any graphics card during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, actual retail availability at a reasonable price matters &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more than comparative performance, since you generally can’t find anything close to its MSRP — and that goes double for AMD, whose availability has been notably worse. Here’s AMD’s statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on supply this time around:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LbgJ0F"&gt;AMD is working closely with board partners, OEMs, SIs and etail/retail partners to ensure as many graphics cards are available to gamers as possible, and we expect that a healthy supply of AMD Radeon RX 6600 graphics cards will be available at launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jZzxLS"&gt;“Healthy” is a very difficult word to pin down, but we’ll see. Late last month, AMD CEO Lisa Su suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697339/amd-crypto-mining-ceo-lisa-su-gpu-code-conference"&gt;chip supplies would likely be “tight”&lt;/a&gt; until the second half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 7 review: time and time again</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A bigger screen and faster charging are nice, but not reasons to upgrade&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="r78a4Q"&gt;The most important questions to ask about the new Apple Watch Series 7 aren’t about the Apple Watch Series 7, they’re about the Apple Watch you may already have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbnGfL"&gt;That’s a gentle way of saying that if there’s nothing wrong with your current watch, there’s nothing in the Series 7 that should compel you to upgrade. If you’ve been waiting for some key feature before buying your first Apple Watch, I don’t know that it’s here, either. I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;wrote very nearly the same thing last year about the Series 6&lt;/a&gt; and I think that’s just what we should expect from the Apple Watch series going forward: iterative updates that will be great when you replace your current watch, but not a reason to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oxqaof"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; great. The larger screen and faster charging are the two headline features and both are welcome. The Apple Watch is in a class entirely of its own right now. Nothing else is as good for iPhone users and nothing like it is available for Android users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rr2QCi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10803240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The screen is 20 percent larger on the Apple Watch Series 7" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vFtnb290teD_pSpxCtzldF4z6RE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908902/vpavic_211006_4796_0039.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen is 20 percent larger on the Apple Watch Series 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PE3CaZ"&gt;Apple Watch design and screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3WRkBW"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 didn’t get the major redesign that had been rumored. Instead, it looks almost identical to previous Apple Watches and maintains compatibility with all previous Apple Watch straps, although there are incredibly subtle changes in its overall size and curves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5lOXW"&gt;There are new color options available, including midnight (which apparently has a hint of blue in it), starlight (a cross between silver and gold), and a dark green. Apple sent me the green one and in most light it just looks gray — but every now and then it’ll pop and look visibly green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="zrbgNb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bigger screen isn’t a reason to upgrade on its own&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple Watch Series 7 (left) and Series 5 (right)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/77CIVaV1KTdYeOe_pX865bYXJyQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908911/vpavic_211006_4796_0094.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 (left) and Series 5 (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The front glass is thicker and more crack resistant, with a “refractive” edge and smaller bezels." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xM7yM8Zskz023avG3FK7K9F8Vbk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908913/vpavic_211006_4796_0110.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The front glass is thicker and more crack resistant, with a “refractive” edge and smaller bezels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JFRGJH"&gt;The biggest change is the screen; it’s 20 percent larger than the last few iterations of the Apple Watch. It does the thing all screen upgrades tend to do: make the older screen with its larger bezels look small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8gyzF"&gt;When Apple first made the screen bigger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17875882/new-apple-watch-series-4-review-ekg-bands-screen-price"&gt;way back on the Apple Watch Series 4&lt;/a&gt;, I thought it made an appreciable difference in the experience and would even be worth upgrading for. Here, on the Series 7, I just think the screen is really nice and looks better, but isn’t enough to justify an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lxje9k"&gt;Apple has kept the always-on screen and says that it is brighter in ambient mode when indoors. That is: the overall max brightness hasn’t changed, but when you’re inside, the screen should look a little less dim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGHWO4"&gt;The other design change on the Series 7 is that it’s more durable. The front crystal on all models is thicker and stronger against cracking. (It’s also more refractive, so you can catch a glimpse of some pixels at extreme angles.) The whole watch adds IP6X dust resistance for the first time and maintains the same water resistance to 50 meters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxcE07"&gt;Apple didn’t add any new health sensors to the Series 7. It still tracks heart rate and has a blood oxygen monitor and EKG. None of these sensors should be used for diagnostic purposes as the Apple Watch is not a medical device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 7 charges faster but has the same overall battery life." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C9NguEoxluYKwrSjCZzXL_9ZraI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908901/vpavic_211006_4796_0032_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 charges faster but has the same overall battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jUuETH"&gt;Apple Watch charging and battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6hmjtu"&gt;Apple is still targeting 18 hours of battery life on the Apple Watch Series 7. It’s enough to get through a day — maybe two if you turn off the always-on screen and don’t work out. In my tests, those numbers are borne out. I need to charge the Series 7 only a little less often than I need to charge my old Series 5 (which is starting to lose its battery capacity a bit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlwDN6"&gt;I wish Apple had done more to improve battery life on the Series 7, especially since this is technically a redesign. I would have even taken the same size screen as last year’s model if it had meant getting longer battery life instead. There’s nothing &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; with the Apple Watch’s battery life, but I do wish that it aimed higher like the new iPhones did this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7WklxI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Faster charging is nice, but I was hoping for more battery life&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2KC2rF"&gt;Instead, we got faster charging thanks to a redesigned charging puck that also uses USB-C. Lots of people have those wall adapters but may need to pick up a second one (or a multi-charger), since it’s not included in the box. (As an aside, the actual plug part of the Apple Watch charger is longer now, which Apple says is to manage heat.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8HzHt"&gt;The charging is faster. Apple claims it’s 33 percent faster than the older cable and that sounds right to me. I have been able to juice up 20 percent in just ten minutes several times and it has been easier to top off to a full charge in the morning while I putter around with coffee and breakfast. It makes it slightly more convenient to use the watch for sleep tracking since it’s easier to fit a quick charging session in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR96Ld"&gt;Still and all, I would have preferred standard Qi charging to faster charging (if I had to choose). Qi charging mats are cheap and plentiful now, but integrating an Apple Watch charger adds cost and complexity. Older Apple Watch chargers will work just fine with the Series 7, but at the slightly slower charging speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are a few Series 7 exclusive features in WatchOS 8, including a keyboard." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pMVHZYvkBKwH28N7OxsRRj5YsDI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908905/vpavic_211006_4796_0053.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are a few Series 7 exclusive features in WatchOS 8, including a keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHHCCf"&gt;WatchOS 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CV85Vt"&gt;There are a few features in WatchOS 8 that are exclusive to the Series 7, ostensibly because its larger screen makes them possible. The watch can fit just a little more text when reading a message, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Umfs96"&gt;The two watchfaces custom to the Series 7 are called “Contour” and “Modular Duo.” The former just puts numbers out on the edges of the screen and would apparently look bad on screens with larger bezels, while the latter allows you to have two full-width complications stacked instead of just one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1uxTv"&gt;The larger screen also allows for a new text-entry option: a miniature keyboard. You can tap or swipe on it and as long as autocorrect is doing its thing correctly, it works fine. It’s about as good as any smartwatch keyboard I’ve used, but I still prefer dictating messages via Siri whenever possible. I wish I could compare it to the FlickType app that was kicked out of the App Store in January 2019, but it’s not back (and there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22676706/apple-watch-swipe-keyboard-flicktype-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;lawsuit pending&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="VfJzvf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can finally set multiple timers in WatchOS 8 (but not on iOS 15)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Modular Duo face lets the Series 7 (right) have two full-width complications. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P0FGiHFxbhMUUAiOXnPFVa00vJ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908909/vpavic_211006_4796_0084.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Modular Duo face lets the Series 7 (right) have two full-width complications. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Contour watch face is exclusive to the Series 7." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1izd5PwAiJ8EuI3ro7gZ9xU2PK8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908910/vpavic_211006_4796_0090.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Contour watchface is exclusive to the Series 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L3Nlnp"&gt;Those are the Series 7-specific features, but WatchOS 8 has a few more things worth covering. It’s able to auto-detect outdoor bike workouts — and in my testing it managed to do that very well, even when I was hitting stoplights at every block. I wish Apple would make it easier to integrate the Watch’s workout data with cadence or power sensors on a bike, but cyclists are still on their own to figure out how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Au4ZXk"&gt;Apple says it’s also adjusting your calorie metrics if the watch believes you’re riding an e-bike. There’s no setting for it, it just detects if your heart rate is suspiciously low and your speed is remarkably high as you cruise up a hill. There’s also no indicator in your results if your calorie metrics were adjusted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAau3a"&gt;WatchOS 8 has a redesigned photos app and lets you send photos directly from the watch. It has an updated “Mindfulness” app with a “Reflect” feature that gives you some kind of prompt to meditate on, like “Recall a challenge you’ve overcome” and “Think about what sparks your creative energy.” As you can probably tell from the unnecessary scare quotes in the previous sentence, I don’t like it. I think meditation is a deeply personal — and for many people spiritual or religious — thing, and so I recoil whenever I see tech companies reducing the practice down to anodyne apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OY7h6u"&gt;I’ve left the best for last: the Apple Watch lets you set multiple timers. You can set them in the timer app. You can set them with Siri. You can use Siri to name each timer. You can see all your timers stacked one after the other. It’s magical. It’s wonderful. It’s hilarious that it took until 2021 to make this happen and even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; hilarious that the iPhone itself &lt;em&gt;still can’t do it&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXp6kk"&gt;Seriously, though, multiple timers on the Apple Watch is great, especially for cooking. It means I don’t need to stay within earshot of the smart speaker in my kitchen if I’ve got something in the oven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 7 in green." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HzI7QElmyePeOV3IGRw5j3oxyGE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908899/vpavic_211006_4796_0029.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 in green.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iyi6xQ"&gt;I have said this every year for several years now because it’s true every year: the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch for iPhone users, by far. There are fitness trackers that fulfill niches not filled by the Apple Watch like Garmins for more serious athletes or Fitbits for people who want something simpler. But as a general computer-on-your-wrist, the Apple Watch Series 7 is challenged only by older Apple Watches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3zFWYX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Still the best smartwatch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YghhQR"&gt;If you have one of those older Apple Watches, I don’t think there’s anything here that should compel an upgrade. All the new features are very nice but not necessary. If there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; something that’s bothering you about your current watch, then by all means go for it if you can afford it. Also, while the Series 3 is still kicking around for cheap, I don’t think it’s a great buy anymore. The Apple Watch SE is a better value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIc4JH"&gt;There’s no reason that we should have an expectation of major year-on-year updates for the Apple Watch. These smaller iterations might not be what we’ve been hoping for — a big redesign with much more battery — but that doesn’t make the Series 7 bad on its own merits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="vaBJsW"&gt;It’s a great watch — again, the best smartwatch. If it’s time for you to replace your watch (or buy your first one), you’ll love it. If it’s not time to replace your watch, it’s not time to replace your watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="1A6fiL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10803297"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple exploring AirPods that take your temperature and monitor posture: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cOI7_9H7qLMFVkk_kc1jSClRIuk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988163/akrales_161216_1332_A_0259_v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NMjpHH"&gt;Apple is reportedly exploring new health-focused features for its AirPods, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-studying-potential-of-airpods-as-health-device-11634122800"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Features might include using the earbuds to take wearers’ temperature, monitor their posture, and improve their hearing. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes that it’s not clear if the latter function differs significantly from AirPods’ existing “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713126/airpods-pro-conversation-boost-firmware-update"&gt;Conversation Boost&lt;/a&gt;” feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zGsMO"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, these functions “aren’t expected by next year and might never be rolled out to consumers or the timing could change.” In other words, it sounds like the iPhone maker is just exploring these new health features, rather than actively working on integrating them with products due out in the next year or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJnoTc"&gt;Adding these sensors would make sense for Apple. The company has increasingly marketed its products on the strength of their health and fitness applications, though so far, most of this attention has been focused on the Apple Watch. Reports &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt; suggested the company was looking into adding various sensors to the wearable, including monitoring blood pressure, temperature, sleep quality, blood oxygen, and blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srnaZf"&gt;Integrating health features into commercial products is tricky work, though, mostly because of the difficulty in meeting the high bar of medical regulatory standards. This inevitably leads to delays. It was &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in June, for example, that the next Apple Watch would add temperature monitoring, but this function never appeared in September’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch 7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RF0o5J"&gt;Unfortunately, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t include much detail about Apple’s plans for the AirPods. Taking temperature from someone’s ear is commonplace, though, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40438857/i-tried-five-high-tech-solutions-that-promised-to-fix-my-terrible-posture-did-they-work"&gt;many posture devices&lt;/a&gt; on the market that use digital sensors to alert wearers when they’re slouching. Apple has already shown it’s interested in using AirPods as a hearing assistant of some sort, though the earbuds are not actually approved for this purpose by the FDA. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How different is Amazon’s Halo View from the Fitbit Charge 5?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JI0jsndl89a3mrvf4_ZvhjChuJk=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988110/Halo_View_3Hero_Full_3600_LIVE_BLOG_SELECT.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Halo View fitness tracker looks strikingly similar to the Fitbit Charge 5.&lt;/em&gt; | Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g4sy0h"&gt;If recent headlines were any indication, Amazon’s fall hardware event was all about Amazon’s forthcoming home robot, Astro, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692048/ring-always-home-cam-drone-amazon-price-release-date-specs"&gt;new home surveillance drone&lt;/a&gt;. Buried in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692147/amazon-devices-event-echo-ring-biggest-announcements"&gt;deluge of announcements&lt;/a&gt;, however, was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692305/amazon-halo-view-fitness-tracker-nutrition-membership-screen"&gt;Halo View&lt;/a&gt;, an $80 fitness tracker that bears a striking resemblance to the recently released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697200/fitbit-charge-5-fitness-tracker-price-available"&gt;Fitbit Charge 5&lt;/a&gt;. The similarities become even more pronounced when you consider the View’s new display and its ability to track your heart rate and sleep quality. In many respects, it seems as if Amazon created a Fitbit Charge 5-like wearable at a price point that makes it far more accessible. Or did it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7PNTs"&gt;We analyzed the two to find out. We have yet to test the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NCGKHKF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Halo View&lt;/a&gt;, however, so note that the comparison below is based on the View’s specs and our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22680300/fitbit-charge-5-review-fitness-tracker"&gt;hands-on review of the Fitbit Charge 5&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll dig even deeper once we get our hands on the new wearable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="r8eyMz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10781163"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVqhr3qErGAlPNm0Mit0ZWajA7E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22889772/amazon_halo_view.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon / Fitbit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fitbit Charge 5 (left) and Halo View (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Riah4x"&gt;A (slight) difference in design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2F2SxM"&gt;Like the Fitbit Charge 5, the follow-up to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Amazon Halo Band&lt;/a&gt; is essentially a bracelet with a rectangular body and a color AMOLED display, one equipped with haptic feedback. The View, however, also features a digital home button. That’s something the Fitbit Charge 5 lacks, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22680300/fitbit-charge-5-review-fitness-tracker"&gt;my colleague Jay Peters found&lt;/a&gt; makes returning to the homescreen particularly challenging. Amazon has yet to reveal specific dimensions for the View, but we do know it’s slightly lighter than the Charge 5. The small band and capsule weigh 20.6 grams, while the large band and capsule weigh 21.85 grams. In contrast, the Charge 5 weighs 28 grams and is 10 percent thinner than its predecessor, according to Fitbit. Amazon hasn’t revealed how thin the View is or the size of its screen, however, we do know the Charge 5 offers a 21.8 x 14.7-millimeter display, which we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22680300/fitbit-charge-5-review-fitness-tracker"&gt;found to be too small&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="brGJ0X"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10781245"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bnF9gy"&gt;On the accessory front, both the View and the Charge 5 offer three default colors with options for additional bands, so you can customize the device’s appearance. The View comes in active black, sage green, and lavender dream, while the Charge 5 is available in steel blue / platinum, black / graphite, and lunar white / gold. Amazon says additional bands will be available for the View starting at $14.99 each, including fabric, leather, and metal variants for $29.99 apiece. The Charge 5 comes in &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergeHaloViewFitbit5101221/https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/accessories/charge5-leather?sku=181LBPMS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergeHaloViewFitbit5101221/https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/accessories/luxe-metal-mesh?sku=180MMSR" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;metal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergeHaloViewFitbit5101221/https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/accessories/charge5-hook-loop?sku=181HLBUS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fabric variants&lt;/a&gt;, too, but they’re more expensive. The leather bands, for example, start at $49.95.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9V6Nv"&gt;While both sport two band sizes, the View can accommodate larger wrists. The latest Fitbit offers a small band for wrists that measure between 129.5 and 170.2 millimeters and a large band for wrists that fall between 170.2 and 210.8 millimeters. In contrast, the Halo’s small / medium band size is for wrists measuring between 129.5 and 195.6 millimeters and the medium / large size should accommodate wrists between 160 and 226.1 millimeters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AXIuxzlqXQDZuq1DLDRVR1QaZZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888802/Halo_Accessories_03.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like the Fitbit Charge 5, the Halo View is available with a variety of different bands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tTXzga"&gt;Sensors and small discrepancies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uZBdq3"&gt;Being fitness trackers, both the Halo View and Fitbit Charge 5 share similar sensors. Each touts an accelerometer, as well as sensors for monitoring your blood oxygen level (SpO2), heart rate, and skin temperature. Users can easily gain information about these through the display, which also shows activity, sleep scores, live workout tracking, move notifications, and more. They’re both also water-resistant up to 50 meters, and both claim to offer up to seven days of battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whhhib"&gt;However, the Charge 5 boasts a few sensors and features the View doesn’t. The Charge 5 comes with a new electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor that measures your body’s response to stress. Fitbit uses that information to then generate a Stress Management Score, which Fitbit Premium members can access via a report with additional information. Fitbit said it also plans to introduce a new EKG app in the future that can share your results with your doctor after checking your heart for atrial fibrillation. The Charge 5 also offers built-in GPS and the ability to make contactless payments (via Fitbit Pay), two things the View lacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TcPfSv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10781256"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OVfsMo"&gt;When it comes to smartwatch-like functionality, we know very little about the View besides the fact you can access text notifications on it. The Charge 5, meanwhile, provides notifications for texts, calls, calendar events, and even select smartphone apps like Gmail, WhatsApp, and Facebook. Android users can even use the Charge 5 to send quick replies in some apps — though, iPhone users will need to pull out their phones. The Charge 5 also allows you to mute notifications, and it features a sleep mode that allows you to schedule and silence notifications at night. It even has a Smart Alarm that will wake you up within half an hour before your regular alarm does, during what Fitbit considers the “optimal stage of sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rt5u3I"&gt;There are also some minor differences in battery life between the two. Amazon claims the View can fully charge in under 1.5 hours, while &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergeHaloViewFitbit5101221/https://help.fitbit.com/manuals/charge_5/Content/manuals/html/Get%20Started.htm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit says&lt;/a&gt; its device can take two hours. While we praised the Fitbit Charge 5’s battery life &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22680300/fitbit-charge-5-review-fitness-tracker"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt;, Fitbit’s seven-day promise also drops to two if you use its always-on display mode. The View, as far as we know, lacks an always-on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsJnS5"&gt;In addition, both wearables work with iOS and Android phones and are Bluetooth-compatible, but it looks like you’ll need a slightly newer operating system to use the Charge 5 app. The View requires your device to run at least iOS 12.0 or Android OS 7.0, however, the Charge 5 requires you to update to a minimum of iOS 12.2 or Android OS 8.0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UUHDUs"&gt;Services galore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMsPS9"&gt;The Fitbit Charge 5 and Amazon Halo View both offer and work with separate membership-based wellness services. Whether you pick up the View or Charge 5, you’ll be able to sample either for free for a limited time. Like the latest Fitbit, the membership services for the View will include a new fitness feature that provides access to “hundreds” of workouts from popular brands like Orangetheory and Aaptiv, as well as some guided meditation and relaxation exercises from the likes of Headspace. Amazon says the service, called Halo Fitness, will arrive later this year and be available to those with the original Halo as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7-pAg5iqQCrp2Gu4GPhi8B_gZIc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888810/Screen_Shot_2021_09_29_at_3.10.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Halo Membership offers meal planning services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aAcrUf"&gt;Yet that may be where the similarities end on the services front. As previously noted, the Charge 5 comes with six months of Fitbit Premium for free, but the View comes with a yearlong Amazon Halo membership. After the end of their respective trials, however, Fitbit Premium costs $9.99 per month, whereas an Amazon Halo Membership costs $3.99 a month. Non-members can still use the View after the subscription ends, but they’ll not be able to enjoy a good chunk of the membership’s features, including tone analysis, body composition, movement insights, activity and sleep scores, sleep stages data, and activity intensity information. They will, however, be able to access a limited number of workouts, programs, and recipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DE32IA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fitbit’s new premium subscription service hopes to sway you with personalized data, challenges, and more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20835674/fitbit-premium-subscription-service-personalized-data-challenges"},{"title":"Amazon’s Halo body fat percentage calculator outperforms lab devices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538610/amazon-halo-body-fat-percentage-accurate-study"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="md1oi1"&gt;In addition to the new fitness feature, the monthly Halo membership will include a new nutrition service come January: Halo Nutrition. The new perk will supposedly function like a personalized meal planner, giving you access to roughly 500 recipes from companies like Weight Watchers, Amazon-owned Whole Foods, and Lifesum. It will also integrate with Amazon’s virtual assistant, Alexa, meaning you can easily add the ingredients and groceries to your Alexa shopping list. While you can connect your Fitbit to your Alexa, Fitbit Premium currently lacks a comparable nutrition service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssMHPc"&gt;Other capabilities of the View include the ability to estimate your body fat percentage via your smartphone camera, and a tool that will allow you to measure and help create a plan to improve your mobility, stability, and posture. While the View dropped the microphone found on the original Halo, the Halo smartphone app still offers a feature that can &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/a-new-tool-to-help-you-understand-and-improve-your-social-wellbeing"&gt;analyze your tone&lt;/a&gt; and emotional state so you can better understand how you sound to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1PISQYIMXt5zTos1qd3TmZbb5NU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859124/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fitbit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While similar in appearance to the Halo View, the Fitbit Charge 5 can also calculate Stress Management Scores.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LIer0K"&gt;Although Fitbit Premium doesn’t offer a meal planning service, it does offer some perks that Amazon’s premium subscription doesn’t (for an added cost). For one, the service can connect you with a professional health coach, who can help you create a custom action plan. Many of these coaches are personal fitness trainers and dietitians who are there to help support you in reaching your overall wellbeing goals. The service, “&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergeHaloViewFitbit5101221/https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/services/coaching" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit Premium + Health Coaching Membership&lt;/a&gt;,” is available for $54.99 per month. The regular Fitbit Premium subscription also offers detailed health reports you can give to your doctor, however. It features a Health Metrics dashboard, for instance, that provides you with an overview of your breathing rate, skin temperature, resting heart rate, heart rate variability, and SpO2 over the past month. You can also print a monthly wellness report of your activity, sleep, heart rate, weight, and menstrual health statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IG0URV"&gt;In some ways, the Charge 5 also prioritizes mental health and other aspects of your wellbeing a little more than Amazon’s wearable. Unlike the View, the Charge 5 offers a Stress Management Score report using its EDA. The results are based on your responsiveness, exertion balance, and sleep patterns. The View’s new tone analysis feature is designed to improve your “social health,” but Fitbit Premium offers games and challenges you can participate in with others. For example, members can invite their friends in timed step, distance, or active minute challenges to see who can do the most amount of activity. The upcoming Daily Readiness score feature will also let you know how mentally and physically ready you are to work out, or if you should prioritize recovery instead. It supposedly does so with an algorithm that analyzes your recent activity, sleep quality, your body’s responses to various stress factors as measured by heart variability while sleeping, and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="3kd3IF"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="SnGVqq"&gt;On paper, both the Fitbit Charge 5 and Amazon Halo View are very similar. Yet there are still features the Halo lacks and vice versa that may make one or the other potentially a better fit depending upon your goals and priorities. That said, our comparison is only based on what Amazon has revealed so far regarding the View — not necessarily real-world performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrVREk"&gt;Both are designed to help you lose weight and stay physically fit if that’s your primary goal. They each offer what most fitness trackers do, providing insight into your daily activity. Their membership-based wellness programs both offer hundreds of workouts from experts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="720U7Z"&gt;If you need a little more help managing your diet, though, Halo Nutrition may benefit you. However, if you regularly participate in activities where distance tracking is an important goal, like running, hiking, cycling, or distance swimming, a built-in GPS can be helpful. The Charge 5 has one, which allows it to provide more accurate pace and distance metrics without you having to bring your phone along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flU4ME"&gt;If you have specific health conditions that you also need help with, each wearable could also offer different perks depending upon what those are. The Charge 5’s EDA and the ability to play games with other contacts can be helpful for those who are prioritizing their mental health, especially during a pandemic where many still feel isolated. Those who have heart problems or come from a family with a history of cardiovascular issues may appreciate Fitbit’s EKG app as well. On the other hand, an individual with a disease like Parkinson’s may find the Halo membership helpful with features designed to improve mobility and posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dN28s"&gt;If you don’t particularly care for the extra membership perks or GPS, though, there’s something to be said about saving $100. At the end of the day, it seems like the Halo is an affordable fitness tracker offering many of the features the latest Fitbit Charge comes with at nearly half the price. That’s not a bad deal, at least on paper — which is all we have for now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch William Shatner fly to space on Blue Origin’s tourist rocket</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6YyWou"&gt;Early Wednesday morning, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708534/blue-origin-william-shatner-new-shepard-crewed-flight-october"&gt;famed Star Trek actor William Shatner&lt;/a&gt; will boldly go where he’s never been before: actual space. Shatner, best known for playing James T. Kirk, Captain of the &lt;em&gt;USS Enterprise,&lt;/em&gt; is set to fly to space and back, along with three fellow passengers, aboard Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket out of West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXbeTQ"&gt;Today’s flight marks the second crewed flight for the New Shepard, a reusable passenger rocket developed by Blue Origin to take paying customers to the edge of space to experience a few brief moments of weightlessness. The company’s first crewed flight in July &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;famously included Blue Origin’s founder&lt;/a&gt;, former Amazon CEO and currently the second richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IJILsO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;boldly going where he’s never been before&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HsYfSx"&gt;The crew going up today is an eclectic one. Flying alongside Shatner are two paying customers: Chris Boshuizen, a former NASA engineer and co-founder of small satellite company Planet Labs, as well as Glen de Vries, co-founder of software company Medidata and vice chair of life sciences at a French software company called Dassault Systèmes. Audrey Powers, vice president of mission and flight operations at Blue Origin, was announced as the final passenger along with Shatner last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USKlDp"&gt;The foursome’s flight will last just about 11 minutes total. New Shepard is a suborbital rocket, meaning it cannot achieve the ludicrous speed needed to lap the Earth indefinitely. Instead, the rocket will launch upright from Blue Origin’s launch site in Van Horn, Texas. In just a few minutes, the rocket will climb to an altitude above 62 miles (100 kilometers) high, crossing the boundary into space. While high above the Earth, the capsule separates from the rocket, and the passengers inside have a few minutes to float around and look out the tall windows at the Earth below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6iT4ny"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NMo3ENeuB8g?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oloCKP"&gt;Shatner’s flight comes just a few weeks after the release of his new spoken word album, &lt;em&gt;Bill&lt;/em&gt;, which includes a song with Brad Paisley called “So Far From The Moon,” which revolves around Shatner’s experience on the night of the Apollo 11 lunar landing in 1969. At 90 years old, Shatner will become the oldest person to have gone to space. He’ll beat out legendary aviator Wally Funk, who flew on the first crewed flight of New Shepard with Bezos. Funk, who is 82 years old, was part of a group of 13 women in the 1960s who underwent the same testing that NASA used to pick its first astronauts but was ultimately denied the option to train for space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZxlRX"&gt;Shatner will be the second actor in just the last two weeks to fly to space. Russian actress Yulia Peresild also just launched to the International Space Station on a Russian Soyuz rocket in order to shoot scenes in space for an upcoming movie called “The Challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="zwzggy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I want to press my nose up against the glass window.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UuziTs"&gt;Last week, Shatner gave &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/tech/2021/10/06/william-shatner-space-plans-joke-sot-acfc-vpx.cnn"&gt;a light-hearted interview to CNN’s Anderson Cooper&lt;/a&gt; about his upcoming ride. “I want to press my nose up against the glass window,” Shatner said. “What I don’t want to see is somebody else out there, looking back at me. No, no, we don’t want that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WseFhx"&gt;The conversation ultimately devolved into giggles, with the two making some inappropriate jokes regarding the shape of the New Shepard rocket. “Some people made fun of the way the rocket looks, but I think it’s cool,” Cooper said. “I like it. I think that the weightless thing I think would be fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyAxwD"&gt;“Well, no, there’s nothing to be... nothing to be made fun of,” said Shatner in response. “We’re inseminating the space program.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket, carrying Jeff Bezos to space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W42Dwp"&gt;The New Shepard flight, called NS-18, also comes less than two weeks after 21 current and former Blue Origin employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702335/jeff-bezos-employees-essay-blue-origin-toxic-workplace"&gt;published an explosive public essay in Lioness&lt;/a&gt;, criticizing the company for creating a sexist and unsafe working environment. “In our experience, Blue Origin’s culture sits on a foundation that ignores the plight of our planet, turns a blind eye to sexism, is not sufficiently attuned to safety concerns, and silences those who seek to correct wrongs,” the essay states. This weekend, the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; also &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/11/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-delays-toxic-workplace/"&gt;wrote a critical story about Blue Origin&lt;/a&gt;, in which employees described the company as “authoritarian bro culture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ggm8vZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Shatner’s presence serves as a reminder of how unlike the aspirational Federation we are today.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOu8hN"&gt;The writer of the Lioness essay, former Blue Origin employee Alexandra Abrams, expressed concerns about the upcoming Shatner flight. “I sincerely hope the NS-18 crew has a nominal flight this week. I grew up on ‘Star Trek,’’ and I remember when Jeff Bezos toured Shatner at Blue in Kent, Washington in 2019,” Abrams, former head of employee communications for Blue Origin, said in a statement to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “To me, Shatner’s presence serves as a reminder of how unlike the aspirational Federation we are today, and will continue to be if nothing changes. ‘Star Trek’ is about exploring our shared humanity &amp;amp; evolution as a species; I worry we’re becoming the Ferengi of our own story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHHRVG"&gt;Despite the safety concerns raised in the essay, Blue Origin has only seen success with the flights of its New Shepard rocket. Prior to its first crewed launch, Blue Origin successfully launched and landed New Shepard up to 14 times with three separate vehicles. The flight that carried Bezos and Funk went smoothly, as did a subsequent uncrewed research flight that sent 18 commercial payloads into space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YnVzK"&gt;Takeoff this morning is scheduled for 10AM ET out of Blue Origin’s launch facility in Van Horn, Texas. The company plans to begin streaming live coverage of the flight 90 minutes before takeoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrrIq2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
