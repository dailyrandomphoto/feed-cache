    <title>Ladies and gentlemen, a leather case for your MagSafe puck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ILxqlDEUnwChx43BVOb6jJg7F0=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69551329/856500010205_Lifestyle_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if MagSafe, but covered in leather?&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nomad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ldz8wB"&gt;I’m not going to pretend to understand how product development meetings work, but there must have been something pretty special in the water when Nomad’s crack team of accessory specialists put together its latest pitch. From the company that was brave enough to encase your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111850/nomad-leather-airpods-pro-case-rugged-design-apple-accessory"&gt;AirPods Pro case in leather&lt;/a&gt;, comes an all-new leather MagSafe case. That’s right, it’s a leather case for the iPhone 12’s magnetic charging puck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbQHjj"&gt;Nomad’s argument is that the case, which is available in either black or brown, gives a MagSafe charger “a classic, yet bold new look,” and that it makes the charger slightly bigger and easier to grip to remove from a phone. But it also costs $25. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R5zK_6fLsV4DWMd50ob2xCvu4eM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22699659/856500010199_Lifestyle_13.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nomad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nomad’s expanded leather universe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FVhHnC"&gt;As a tech blogger, I consider it my duty to maintain a base level of open-mindedness about new technology. But I also reserve the right in exceptional circumstances to point out when something seems just plain silly, and encasing a charging puck in leather is one of those moments. I can get behind the idea of a leather case for anything you’re going to be carrying around in your pockets to protect it from the stresses of everyday life, but a charger? A charger that you’re almost certainly going to leave plugged in next to your bed for 99 percent of its life? &lt;em&gt;Please.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbVkJJ"&gt;If you’re already a fully paid-up member of Nomad’s expanded leather universe, and you’ve already got a leather case for your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176171/nomad-new-leather-macbook-pro-sleeves-luxury-expensive-price-release-date-hands-on"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287731/nomad-rugged-leather-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging"&gt;your iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111850/nomad-leather-airpods-pro-case-rugged-design-apple-accessory"&gt;your AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394331/apple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin"&gt;your AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, then sure, why not also cocoon your MagSafe charger in leather for the hell of it. Maybe try following our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17357436/how-to-patina-iphone-x-leather-case-saddle-brown-processor"&gt;exhaustive guide to getting a nice patina&lt;/a&gt; on your leather accessories while you’re at it. You’ve earned it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy VII Remake’s directors wanted to show ‘a new side’ of Midgar with Yuffie chapter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jOMu8IhVthIfmwJ1rPZoAGNxCR4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550977/FF7RIntergrade_AprilScreenshot_01_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F76Jpt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a complete story. Instead, the game explores the beginning of the classic RPG, with later chapters planned to finish the narrative at some point in the future. This means you’ll meet most of the main cast, but certain characters haven’t yet made an appearance — which turned out to be helpful when co-director Motomu Toriyama&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;started thinking of the game’s first add-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsKhyr"&gt;“We were going to depict a side of Midgar that took place during the same timeline as the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; base game, and so I thought Yuffie, who was an optional character [in the original game], was the logical choice,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Even in the source material, she makes an appearance in the middle of the journey, but the events of her journey were never depicted, so I took the liberty to create this new story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0GRnx"&gt;The result is a short add-on called &lt;em&gt;Episode Intermission&lt;/em&gt;, which recently launched alongside an enhanced PS5 version of the game. It stars Yuffie Kisaragi — a fan-favorite ninja obsessed  with materia, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21203140/final-fantasy-vii-remake-materia-size-aerith-hair-director-hamaguchi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FFVII’&lt;/em&gt;s strange magical orbs&lt;/a&gt; — as she heads to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21213574/final-fantasy-7-remake-midgar-city-design-ps4-interview"&gt;the sprawling metropolis of Midgar&lt;/a&gt; to meet up with the Avalanche and seek out a particularly powerful magical item. The story takes place concurrently with the main game; you’ll even see characters like Barrett and Jessie in brief snippets and hear about the impact of events that they were involved in. &lt;em&gt;Episode Intermission&lt;/em&gt; only lasts a few hours, but it’s designed to show the story and world from a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="uSew5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10640850"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ofxtnz"&gt;“Players can see a new side of Yuffie, the Avalanche members living in the slums, and the dark side of Shinra, allowing them to immerse themselves even deeper into the world of Midgar,” Toriyama explains. “By getting an understanding of &lt;em&gt;FFVIIR Intermission&lt;/em&gt;, I think players can further enjoy the relationships between the main characters and more of the world of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remak&lt;/em&gt;e opening up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78cjsc"&gt;Yuffie wasn’t the only optional character in the original &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; that launched in 1997. Players were also able to recruit Vincent Valentine, a gunslinger with a dark, mysterious past. And while his dual-pistols would probably be a lot of fun with &lt;em&gt;FFVIIR&lt;/em&gt;’s more action-oriented combat, his backstory made it a more challenging fit. Yuffie, on the other hand, had a less-defined history, making her an almost ideal candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AvD2SFfGumpAg2P5FsUHIzfhAhQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703331/re_08_Battle_Yuffie_LimitBreak_Bloodbath_activation_stance__EN_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Aaz9l6"&gt;“If, for example, this were Vincent, he would have been sleeping in a coffin in the Shinra mansion, so we couldn’t move him around; but Yuffie was traveling the world as a materia hunter,” Toriyama says. “By having the events from Midgar depicted in &lt;em&gt;FFVIIR Episode Intermission&lt;/em&gt; be a part of her travels as a materia hunter, we are able to see the emotions beneath her fun character, which will then connect to the story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yfBAG"&gt;Aside from the new story elements, the new episode also has some gameplay tweaks as well. One of the highlights of &lt;em&gt;FFVIIR &lt;/em&gt;is how each character has a very different feel; combat is completely different if you’re wielding Cloud’s comically large sword or Tifa’s kickboxing skills. For Yuffie, her ninja background means she moves incredibly fast and can attack both from up close and afar, giving her a distinct style among the cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0GLeo"&gt;She even moves through the world quickly outside of combat. &lt;em&gt;Intermission&lt;/em&gt; has a number of environmental puzzles that involve clambering up pipes and running along walls. “The controls focus on leveraging the lore of her being a ninja, so we were very particular about making Yuffie’s movements fit that unique characteristic about her, with having her deftly move across latticed walls and poles,” says co-director Naoki Hamaguchi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dk10PM"&gt;The new episode is relatively brief — you can probably experience all of it in around five hours — but it manages to cram a lot into that small package, from gigantic boss battles to brand-new characters. And while we still know very little about when the next main part of &lt;em&gt;FFVVIIR&lt;/em&gt; is coming or what it will actually entail, it sounds like this isn’t the last players will see of Yuffie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6nZSe"&gt;“With this episode, we were able to delve further into Yuffie’s back story, have her go through an experience similar to Cloud and his team, and leave Midgar at around the same time,” says Toriyama. “This will then lead to her encounter them — as an ally — in the story down the line.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW’s actually making the futuristic CE 04 electric scooter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kNQE_sd5ZLqY0rrdTAu6LjbW37c=/0x0:2250x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550920/P90428705_lowRes.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: BMW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nxUvz8"&gt;BMW has been warning us for years that it wants to make and sell a radical electric city scooter, and now it’s following through. On Wednesday, the German automaker announced that its Motorrad division will put &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560306/bmw-electric-scooter-concept-motorrad-definition-ce-04"&gt;the striking BMW CE 04 into production&lt;/a&gt;, with decent range and speed on offer as well as plenty of futuristic vibes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ryl6b6"&gt;The CE 04 broke cover as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560306/bmw-electric-scooter-concept-motorrad-definition-ce-04"&gt;a concept scooter in November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, though that itself was basically just a reimagining of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/26/15698882/bmw-motorrad-motorcycle-concept-link-photos"&gt;another concept that BMW debuted in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. What’s really striking about the images BMW released Wednesday is how similar the production version looks. Instead of watering down the bold design in an attempt to please a wider range of buyers, the CE 04’s bright orange accents and sharp, angular lines make it look just as much like it belongs in an anime as its concept predecessors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YddRJ7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s striking how little BMW changed the design from the concepts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pO7GtU"&gt;BMW is really angling the CE 04 as a city vehicle — so much so that the press release quite seriously opens with an &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0337029EN/the-new-bmw-ce-04"&gt;extended first-person narrative written from the perspective of a fictional owner and parka-obsessed city-dweller&lt;/a&gt; that I cannot recommend enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="49tow7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10640976"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ypwkiy"&gt;This framing helps contextualize the limited 81-mile range, which is made possible by a lithe 8.9kWh battery (built on the same cells &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462746/bmw-ix-suv-ev-price-specs"&gt;that power the new iX SUV&lt;/a&gt;). But while that pales in comparison to the three-digit range figures of most every modern four-wheel electric vehicle, it’s enough to cover the kinds of daily short trips one typically makes with a scooter like the CE 04. Driving in a city means there will also be a lot of braking, which presents ample opportunity to use regenerative braking to feed energy back into the battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNOM40"&gt;For however long the battery lasts, it sounds like the CE 04 will be a fun ride. BMW says it has a maximum output of 31kW (42 horsepower) and a top speed of 120 kilometers per hour (roughly 75mph). Automatic stability control, dynamic traction control, and an anti-lock braking system — technologies that BMW has been iterating on for a while now, with the company going so far as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle"&gt;developing a prototype self-driving motorcycle&lt;/a&gt; — are all available to help riders keep that quickness in check. A 10.25-inch TFT screen between the handlebars will offer onboard navigation and smartphone connectivity. (And the bike will have an “[a]ctively ventilated mobile phone charging compartment with USB-C charging port” to boot, according to BMW.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URT1Uu"&gt;BMW &lt;em&gt;has &lt;/em&gt;sold a futuristic electric scooter before, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/29/13103000/bmw-c-evolution-scooter-usa-paris-auto-show-2016"&gt;the C Evolution&lt;/a&gt;, which was quite well-received despite never really catching on — likely thanks to the $13,000 price tag. BMW didn’t drop a price for the CE 04 or say when and where it will be available. Eager buyers will apparently have to wait for the company to pull those details from the future, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grubhub will use Russian-made robots to deliver food on college campuses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9TO-_5-2J1gun8PXu1PKtINdH5g=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550815/YanexRoverDeliveryMI_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p4Nktj"&gt;Grubhub and Russian self-driving startup Yandex are teaming up to use robots to deliver food on US college campuses. It represents the latest deal that envisions hundreds of six-wheeled self-driving robots that essentially act as roving lunchboxes in cities across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWLiXV"&gt;The robot-powered delivery service won’t kick off until this fall when college students return to campus. Yandex, which is often described as Russia’s Google, will operate the robots, as well as handle the entire food delivery process. Grubhub, which has partnerships with over 250 college campuses in the US, will serve as the platform for the delivery transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AAV6pn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Grubhub cited the cost savings it will get by eliminating delivery workers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y87zhx"&gt;Grubhub cited the cost savings it will get by eliminating the delivery worker from the equation as a potential benefit from the deal with Yandex — though neither company disclosed the financial terms of the partnership. “We’re excited to offer these cost-effective, scalable and quick food ordering and delivery capabilities to colleges and universities across the country that are looking to adapt to students’ unique dining needs,” said Brian Madigan, vice president of corporate and campus partners at Grubhub, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76a5yH"&gt;Yandex says that its delivery robots can navigate pavement, pedestrian areas and crosswalks, and reach campus areas not accessible by car. “Such functionality enables the robots to handle delivery tasks traditionally performed by people and provides efficient last-mile logistics automation,” the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQ7Iso"&gt;Food delivery via robot is nothing new in the US. There are many startups operating delivery robots of varying sizes — everything from fully sized minivans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18173776/udelv-self-driving-delivery-walmart-baidu-ces-2019"&gt;like Udelv&lt;/a&gt; to robots that look almost identical to Yandex’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18194566/amazon-scout-autonomous-six-wheeled-delivery-robot"&gt;like Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20812184/starship-delivery-robot-expansion-college-campus"&gt;Starship&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18139394/postmates-serve-autonomous-delivery-robot-los-angeles"&gt;Postmates has a delivery robot called Serve&lt;/a&gt; that can carry 50 pounds of cargo. There are even some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265397/nuro-robot-delivery-houston-texas-kroger"&gt;like Nuro&lt;/a&gt;, which has made what can be best described as a mini-robotic car, that fall somewhere in between. All claim to be autonomous, but some require human monitors to track their movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGYR6F"&gt;Demand for delivery robots has skyrocketed since the pandemic, though it remains to be seen whether that holds up as the economy reopens and fewer people rely on takeout from restaurants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXbA2l"&gt;Delivery services view the use of robots as one of the many ways they can cut down on labor costs and achieve profitability. Earlier this year, DoorDash acquired salad-making robot startup Chowbotics. But most seem to be stuck in the experimental phase, with companies unclear on how exactly to scale up the use of these automated helpers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ubisoft is reportedly shaking up Assassin’s Creed with new live-service game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b8Jk6JTNN5dRm39_Ecxig8h03a0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550726/acastro_190528_1777_ubisoft_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8wPUuh"&gt;Ubisoft has officially confirmed the existence of &lt;a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/GZi5hT4dBeM8YITOsJeCn/an-update-on-assassins-creed-infinity-and-the-future-of-the-assassins-creed-franchise"&gt;a new &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; game codenamed &lt;/a&gt;“&lt;a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/GZi5hT4dBeM8YITOsJeCn/an-update-on-assassins-creed-infinity-and-the-future-of-the-assassins-creed-franchise"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt;,” after a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-07/assassin-s-creed-infinity-to-offer-live-online-game-service?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; detailed the new online service-based game. While Ubisoft’s announcement doesn’t shed much light on what form the new game will take, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports that it will be an evolving online game similar to the likes of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rs1XUu"&gt;Infinity&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;marks what is likely to be the biggest change in the franchise’s history since its debut in 2007. Until now, Ubisoft has tended to release a new standalone &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; game once every one or two years, each focused on a single location and time period. But according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Infinity&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will feature multiple connected settings that may look and play differently, and this number may expand over time. The new game is reportedly years away from release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MuOfxS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A huge change for the franchise&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OKdcgG"&gt;The title also marks a shift in how Ubisoft develops &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; games, the company says. While previous titles have generally been led alternatively by its teams in Montreal and Quebec City, the new game is being developed under a “collaborative, cross-studio structure” between the two studios. “Rather than continuing to pass the baton from game to game, we profoundly believe this is an opportunity for one of Ubisoft’s most beloved franchises to evolve in a more integrated and collaborative manner that’s less centered on studios and more focused on talent and leadership, no matter where they are within Ubisoft,” the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLG1C0"&gt;Development of the title has reportedly been impacted by a recent wave of sexual misconduct allegations that emerged against senior Ubisoft employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332534/ubisoft-serge-hascoet-harassment-sexism-racism-metoo"&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21305018/ubisoft-multiple-employees-administrative-leave-sexual-misconduct"&gt;year&lt;/a&gt;. Employees are reportedly angry that managers accused of misconduct are still in senior positions within the company. A spokesperson for Ubisoft told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg,&lt;/em&gt; “Any employee that had allegations and remain at Ubisoft has had their case rigorously reviewed by a third party and were either exonerated or underwent appropriate disciplinary actions.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moderna starts human trials of an mRNA-based flu shot</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Uf8Ys7"&gt;Moderna gave its mRNA-based seasonal flu vaccine to the first set of volunteers in a clinical trial, the pharmaceutical company &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-first-participant-dosed-phase-12-study-its"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The start of the trial marks the next stage of the company’s work on this type of vaccine technology after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569345/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-efficacy-announcement"&gt;overwhelming success&lt;/a&gt; of its COVID-19 vaccine, which was built using the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266897/coronavirus-vaccine-development-strategies-pros-cons"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="274cru"&gt;Before the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA vaccines were still largely experimental, even as they were heralded as &lt;a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/vaccines/coronavirus-help-mRNA-DNA-vaccines/98/i14"&gt;the future&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine development. People who get an mRNA vaccine are injected with tiny snippets of genetic material from the target virus. Their cells use that genetic information to build bits of the virus, which the body’s immune system learns to fight against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3ktch"&gt;The high efficacy of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562309/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-gene-based"&gt;major endorsement&lt;/a&gt; for this type of vaccine. Now, pharmaceutical companies plan to use this technology to fight other types of infectious diseases, including flu. The flu shots available each year in the United States are usually between &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/vaccineeffect.htm"&gt;40 and 60 percent&lt;/a&gt; effective. The most common shots are made by growing the influenza virus in cells or chicken eggs, and then killing the virus so it’s no longer dangerous. It takes a long time to grow the virus, so companies have to start making the shots around six months ahead of time, based on predictions around which strain of the flu will be circulating that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lt33qK"&gt;Pharmaceutical companies hope that mRNA-based flu vaccines can be more effective than the traditional shots. Because they’d be faster to make, production wouldn’t have to start so far in advance, and they could theoretically be more closely matched with the type of flu spreading each season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbzijl"&gt;Moderna is the second group&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to start testing its mRNA flu shot in human trials — &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/sanofi-translate-bio-start-seasonal-mrna-flu-vaccine-trial-gaining-early-lead-over-moderna"&gt;Sanofi and Translate Bio&lt;/a&gt; kicked off a trial this summer. Pfizer and BioNTech have been interested in mRNA flu shots for &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/pfizer-pays-biontech-120m-to-form-mrna-flu-vaccine-pact"&gt;a few years&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re pushing forward with those plans &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/11/covid-vaccines-pfizer-scientist-says-mrna-technology-could-create-more-potent-seasonal-flu-shots.html"&gt;as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dxkqG"&gt;Moderna says it hopes to eventually create combination vaccines that could protect people against flu, COVID-19, and other respiratory infections with one shot. “Our vision is to develop an mRNA combination vaccine so that people can get one shot each fall for high efficacy protection against the most problematic respiratory viruses,” Stéphane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna, said &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-first-participant-dosed-phase-12-study-its"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWGrAR"&gt;If flu shots using this technology prove to be safe and effective, it could also make us more prepared for a potential pandemic flu in the future. It’s a fairly simple process to design a shot that could target&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a new influenza virus. “[mRNA] gives us a very strong platform for a rapid response,” Rosemary Rochford, an immunologist at the University of Colorado, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562309/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-gene-based"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last fall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Wireless headset includes Game Pass Ultimate at eBay for $107</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xbox Wireless headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RzkjakZ7g_tcYzrMXSx5Dd12c5k=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550449/cfaulkner_210311_4469_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HutEmf"&gt;Over at eBay, the seller antonline (with a 98.7 percent positivity rating) has Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless headset in stock. This accessory has been tricky to find in stock, and what’s notable is that the price isn’t inflated. What’s more, you’re getting a better deal here since it includes a free one-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. All in all, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F124796256296%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F7%2F22566572%2Fxbox-wireless-headset-game-pass-ultimate-ebay-apple-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’ll cost you $107 for the headset and the subscription&lt;/a&gt; (usually $115 together). The eBay listing says “limited quantity available”, so act fast if you want to snag a headset before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T76BgH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;This is the best wireless headset for Xbox owners to get&lt;/a&gt;. It pairs effortlessly with your Xbox One or Series S / X console (as well as PC via a USB adapter that’s not included), and you can also pair a phone to them with Bluetooth. Their easy-to-use dials let you adjust volume and tweak the game / chat audio mix to your liking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zbvf2t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxi0dd"&gt;Over at B&amp;amp;H Photo, the last-gen 12.9-inch iPad Pro (space gray) with 256GB of storage is discounted. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553828-REG%2Fapple_mxat2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F7%2F22566572%2Fxbox-wireless-headset-game-pass-ultimate-ebay-apple-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can snag it for $949&lt;/a&gt;, down $150 from its usual $1,099 price. That makes for a $250 price difference between the last generation tablet and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;the latest model that has the faster M1 processor, support for Thunderbolt, and a Mini LED screen&lt;/a&gt;. Those might be nice features to have for some, but for those who don’t want to spend that much, this might be the deal you’ve been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C4LZz6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BTR8X4"&gt;If you want a no-frills M.2 NVMe SSD with 1TB of storage, Best Buy is hosting a deal on SanDisk’s Ultra 1TB model. Normally around $105, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733115867493280374" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $95 today&lt;/a&gt;. To be honest, Best Buy frequently knocks the price down on this SSD, and this isn’t as huge of a price cut as Best Buy makes it seem. Outside of a deal, it usually costs around $120 or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBQtIe"&gt;I’ve noted this before in previous deal posts this SSD has appeared in, but &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/hww8re/ssd_sandisk_ultra_1tb_internal_pci_express_30_x4/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;folks on Reddit claim&lt;/a&gt; that this drive lacks DRAM cache, meaning it might struggle with maintaining speed while transferring large files. Still, it’ll likely be a good enough option for people just looking for a good amount of speedy storage without paying too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tDuUR4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10357138"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Cowboy’s excellent third-generation electric bike gets discounted to €1,990</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TgJS-P2j5z5hM5m3EcDcb7FSciU=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550260/verge_DSC_0771_2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="khz54d"&gt;Cowboy’s third generation electric bike, the appropriately named Cowboy 3, has received another discount. Going forward, it will now sell for €1,990 (£1,690), €300 cheaper than its original launch price of €2,290. That price includes mudguards, which Cowboy recently started including as standard, as well as free delivery in 10 days. This latest price cut comes a little over two months after Cowboy reduced the price of its third-gen bike to €2,190.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wLeUo"&gt;The reason for the price drop is obvious. The Cowboy 3 came out one year ago, and a successor, the Cowboy 4, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22417053/cowboy-c4-st-electric-bike-price-specs"&gt;announced in May&lt;/a&gt;. So yes, you’re getting a slightly older model without the new version’s improved powertrain or integrated wireless charging dock for your phone. But we really liked the Cowboy 3 when we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21454206/cowboy-3-electric-bike-review-price-features"&gt;reviewed it last year&lt;/a&gt;. It’s got helpful features like built-in crash detection, and it’s also remarkably sleek for an electric bike with a removable battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUJ62s"&gt;Meanwhile, the new Cowboy 4 is currently due to ship this fall. It’ll be joined by the Cowboy 4 ST, a version with a step-through frame. Both new bikes will retail for for €2,490 / £2,290.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google crowd out the competition with default apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-BajpgSWY_z9XLxnIOLTmw66pc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550154/Google_Apple_App_Dominance2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new study shows how Apple and Google’s preinstalled apps dominate their mobile platforms&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="wJfzM4"&gt;If you use an iPhone or Android phone, chances are the majority of your most-used apps were made by Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysNYXF"&gt;That’s the takeaway from a new Comscore study that ranks the popularity of preinstalled iOS and Android apps, such as Apple’s Messages, alongside apps made by other developers. The results show that the majority of apps people use on their phones in the US come preinstalled by either Apple or Google. The first-of-its-kind report was commissioned by Facebook, one of Apple’s loudest critics, and shared exclusively with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHrZWT"&gt;Preinstalled services dominate when it comes to basics like weather, photos, and clocks, according to the report, suggesting these categories will be difficult for other apps to compete in. Defaults don’t win out exclusively, though: Apple Maps and Music don’t appear on the iOS list at all, and Gmail makes the iOS list several entries below Apple Mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="c5cAMz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple and Google are increasingly under scrutiny for favoring their own services&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzYrnI"&gt;The timing, as Facebook likely intentioned, is apt: Apple and Google are increasingly under scrutiny for how they favor their own services over competitors like Spotify. US lawmakers are currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;reviewing a new set of bills&lt;/a&gt; designed to curb the power of Big Tech, including legislation that could potentially bar Apple and Google from giving their services the upper hand against rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDvTGa"&gt;The pushback stems from how Apple and Google bundle their apps and services with their mobile operating systems in ways that some of their competitors think is unfair. The criticism is harsher against Apple, given that it more tightly controls the apps that come preinstalled on the iPhone and doesn’t allow developers to circumvent its App Store.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzrZxb"&gt;At the same time, it has been difficult to know how popular these preinstalled apps are relative to apps made by third-party developers since Apple and Google don’t disclose user numbers for their default apps. Research firms regularly track the popularity of apps that are available for download in app stores, but Comscore’s study is the first real attempt at charting how default mobile apps compete against other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="TCKt1W"&gt;&lt;div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/6523915"&gt;&lt;script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tknLNo"&gt;You can view the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22313379"&gt;full interactive version here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9sO-_nhMbJmafmbNBALEFxq300A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702366/VRG_Data_Top20Apps_BarChart_Vert2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CDcIg6"&gt;To make the report last December, Comscore used data it regularly gathers from apps and websites alongside a survey of roughly 4,000 people asking about the default apps they used during the month of November. The results show that 75 percent of the top 20 apps on iOS in the US were made by Apple, while Google made 60 percent of the top apps on Android. The top four apps on both platforms were made by their respective parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hheye"&gt;Facebook is the only outside developer with more than one app on the iOS list and the only developer with three apps on the list for Android. Randomly, a staggering 78 million people used Apple’s Calculator app — more than the users of Gmail on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcH7KS"&gt;Facebook paid for the Comscore study to show the “impact of preinstalled apps on the competitive app ecosystem,” according to company spokesman Joe Osborne. The social network’s executives have long criticized Apple’s limitations on third-party developers for hindering their ability to distribute mobile games and compete effectively with iMessage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="iJJVIt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple called the report “seriously flawed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pBAsdA"&gt;Apple rejected the report’s findings. “This Facebook-financed survey from December 2020 was narrowly tailored to give the false impression that there’s little competition on the App Store,” an Apple spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “In truth, third-party apps compete with Apple’s apps across every category and enjoy large scale success.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXdn9R"&gt;The spokesperson said the survey’s methodology was “seriously flawed in a number of ways” and that the results contradicted Comscore’s recent &lt;a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings#tab_mobile_apps/"&gt;April 2021 rankings&lt;/a&gt; on app usage. But those rankings didn't attempt to factor in the usage of all preinstalled apps like the Facebook-commissioned study did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVl9oD"&gt;Google did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MknSY7"&gt;Besides Comscore showing app usage in the US for a particular window of time, there are a couple of other quirks in its methodology to note: it did not include browsers such as Apple’s Safari or Google’s Chrome in the rankings or what it calls “embedded operating system features” like Siri. And results for Android weren’t gathered by specific phone manufacturers, meaning app usage isn’t broken out for Samsung phones relative to the Google Pixel, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="05S9u9"&gt;Still, the report points to the power platform owners have over what apps are used on their devices. It’s not just the app stores that serve as gatekeepers, but the phones themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6WkGS9"&gt;Microsoft has started testing its new Office design today. The software maker originally teased its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332483/microsoft-office-future-ui-design-ribbon-command-bar-interface"&gt;design changes to Office last year&lt;/a&gt; before revealing last month that Office’s new UI is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554676/microsoft-office-64-bit-arm-windows-11-beta-insider-redesign"&gt;designed to match the redesigned Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; operating system. Office Insiders can now access the new UI for testing before it’s available to all Microsoft 365 users later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6BE4n"&gt;The main changes are a rounded look to the Office ribbon bar, with subtle tweaks to some of the buttons throughout Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Microsoft had originally teased more dramatic changes to its Office UI, which included moving toward more of a command bar instead of the traditional ribbon interface. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft has teased bigger UI changes for Office.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ozeIAh"&gt;It looks like, for now at least, Microsoft is gradually bringing subtle changes to its Office design rather than fully ditching the ribbon interface. Microsoft is still working on adaptive commanding that will eventually see Office’s ribbon interface replaced with a toolbar that can be undocked to float nearby actions you’re taking in documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYmwuy"&gt;We’re expecting to see those changes appear on the web and mobile versions of Office first, ahead of any significant design overhauls to the main desktop versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Microsoft said last year that these changes could take a year or two to roll out, so we’re only starting to see the first changes in time for Windows 11 right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIlj9X"&gt;This updated Microsoft Office interface is available for testers on both Windows 10 and Windows 11. You’ll need to be part of the &lt;a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/"&gt;Office Insiders group&lt;/a&gt; and set to receive beta channel updates in Office settings. Once you’ve updated, a megaphone icon at the top of any Office app will let you toggle the new UI on or off.&lt;/p&gt;
