    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NtxvH7"&gt;Microsoft is holding a special Surface hardware event on September 22nd. The software maker has started sending media invites for this &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fevent%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fall hardware event&lt;/a&gt;, although it will be online-only and not in person. We’re expecting to see Microsoft announce a successor to the Surface Duo and a new Surface laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTzvUM"&gt;Leaked images of Microsoft’s upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;Surface Duo 2 device appeared online in July&lt;/a&gt;, and we’re expecting to see the official announcement of this Android-powered dual-screen hardware on September 22nd. The leaked images suggest the biggest change will be a triple camera system, complete with telephoto, ultrawide angle, and standard lenses. The Surface Duo 2 is also rumored to include Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor, 5G support, and an NFC chip for contactless payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ka2vlg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You’re invited.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MicrosoftEvent?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MicrosoftEvent&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="https://t.co/tpK3TB8Xxb"&gt;https://t.co/tpK3TB8Xxb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Microsoft (@Microsoft) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/1433082292663209993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cTLNcx"&gt;Alongside the Surface Duo 2, Microsoft is rumored to be launching a successor to the Surface Book 3. &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-book-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft might not name it the Surface Book 4, though. Instead, it’s likely to be a Surface Laptop Pro, or something similar. That’s because Microsoft is reportedly redesigning its high-end laptop to switch to a non-detachable 14-inch display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zw0nss"&gt;A Windows 11 launch on October 5th wouldn’t be complete without an update to the Surface Pro lineup, too. Microsoft launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309005/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus-review"&gt;refreshed Surface Pro 7 Plus&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, but it was only for businesses. We’re hoping to see a more refined Surface Pro design that takes advantage of the latest Windows 11 features. Microsoft’s teaser image even includes a Surface Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjayjy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all of Microsoft’s Surface news live on September 22nd, so stay tuned for the latest.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s Bolt USB dongle bolsters encryption for its new wireless mice and keyboards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/88l-czRbWExFI1u0XuGmLeVmOj4=/0x196:2358x1768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69803267/Screen_Shot_2019_09_03_at_8.52.08_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EAnbNc"&gt;Logitech is known mostly for its consumer-facing products, but it’s making a big play to appeal more broadly to businesses that take privacy seriously. It’s launching a range of mice and keyboards that will include a new Logi Bolt USB-A dongle that aims to reduce latency in crowded workplaces and greatly boost security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OouWs"&gt;These accessories can securely connect to computers and mobile devices via Bluetooth Low Energy — no dongle necessary. Though the Bolt USB dongle is also based on Bluetooth, it will enable a far more secure tether (security mode 1, level 4). Opting for Bluetooth should make the Bolt far less prone to hacking than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/14/20692471/logitech-mousejack-wireless-usb-receiver-vulnerable-hack-hijack"&gt;Logitech’s Unifying 2.4GHz receiver, which was vulnerable to the “MouseJack” hack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAIDfa"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fcontent%2Fdam%2Flogitech%2Fen%2Fbusiness%2Fpdf%2Flogi-bolt-ebook.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22651973%2Flogitech-logi-bolt-usb-dongle-bluetooth-security-le-keyboard-mouse-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s white paper for the Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, it says that security mode 1, level 4 utilizes Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman P-256 (ECDH) and AES-CCM encryption. The company says these measures ensure that “a Logi Bolt wireless product and its Logi Bolt receiver can only communicate with each other.” Logitech is going as far as ensuring that its direct Bolt wireless connections are Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant. These are the standards &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/compliance-faqs-federal-information-processing-standards-fips"&gt;created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology&lt;/a&gt; (NIST) for use within the federal government. If you’re curious about Bluetooth security, &lt;a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-121r2.pdf"&gt;the NIST wrote a guide on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logi Bolt" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wkEAzLNqZATdKqxj7ehvGKs7s1c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819763/logiboltusb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Curiously, Logitech didn’t opt for a USB-C option for the Bolt dongle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mPedAp"&gt;Logitech says its Bolt USB dongle offers a stronger connection, too, at up to 33 feet (10 meters), even if you’re in a congested work environment. One Bolt dongle can connect up to six accessories to your computer. It’s compatible with multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, iOS, iPadOS, Linux, Chrome OS, and Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFRxTR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fmice%2Flogi-bolt-usb-receiver.956-000007.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22651973%2Flogitech-logi-bolt-usb-dongle-bluetooth-security-le-keyboard-mouse-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s listing for the Bolt dongle&lt;/a&gt; says it’s “coming soon” and will cost $14.99. But don’t expect your current Logitech accessories to work with it. Devices that are compatible with Logi Bolt will have a Bolt logo on their underside, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fbusiness%2Fwork-setups%2Flogi-bolt-wireless-technology.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22651973%2Flogitech-logi-bolt-usb-dongle-bluetooth-security-le-keyboard-mouse-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to Logitech’s FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wto51f"&gt;The first accessories that offer enhanced security via Bluetooth LE and include the Bolt USB dongle will launch in September, &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/logitech-bolt-new-wireless-protocol-provides-added-security-for-mice-and-keyboards"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The early lineup includes Logitech’s MX Master Series for Business, comprised of an MX Master 3 and MX Keys. There are also webpages up for business editions of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fkeyboards%2Fergo-k860-for-business.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22651973%2Flogitech-logi-bolt-usb-dongle-bluetooth-security-le-keyboard-mouse-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s Ergo K860 split keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fmice%2Fmx-anywhere-3-for-business.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22651973%2Flogitech-logi-bolt-usb-dongle-bluetooth-security-le-keyboard-mouse-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MX Anywhere 3&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fmice%2Fergo-m575-for-business.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22651973%2Flogitech-logi-bolt-usb-dongle-bluetooth-security-le-keyboard-mouse-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ergo M575 wireless trackball mouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA is testing electric air taxis with Joby Aviation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rWXFpWL5NLeDNo9PE9t9ejb8eYw=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69803251/1sep2021_press_release___co5i3243.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DNzGxT"&gt;NASA kicked off test flights of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft — colloquially referred to as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15426178/flying-car-uber-larry-page-vtol-elevate"&gt;“flying cars”&lt;/a&gt; — with Joby Aviation, the Northern California company that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298957/joby-aviation-public-evtol-electric-aircraft-spac-hoffman"&gt;recently went public&lt;/a&gt;. The test flights are part of a national campaign by NASA to observe these experimental aircraft in action and determine whether they are safe for passengers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCf4IY"&gt;Joby, which was founded in 2009, is the first eVTOL company to participate in &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/aamnationalcampaign"&gt;NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) National Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. The test flights commenced Monday, August 30th, at the company’s airfield in Big Sur, California, and will run through September 10th, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-begins-air-taxi-flight-testing-with-joby"&gt;the agency said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHtmV6"&gt;But NASA won’t just be a passive observer as Joby’s six-rotor aircraft whiz through the air. The space agency will be collecting “vehicle performance and acoustic data for use in modeling and simulation of future airspace concepts,” it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f5Zcq1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But NASA won’t just be a passive observer as Joby’s six-rotor aircraft whiz through the air&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yCh1KT"&gt;In other words, it will be closely monitoring the aircraft’s sound profile to see how well it compares to helicopters and other gas-powered vehicles. A major selling point for eVTOL companies is that these aircraft are noticeably less noisy than helicopters, and therefore better suited for flights over populated areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FzopD"&gt;During the test flights, NASA says its team will “collect information about how the vehicle moves, how the vehicle sounds, and how the vehicle communicates with controllers.” The agency plans on conducting similar tests with additional eVTOL companies in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HegJrJ"&gt;NASA will also be advising the Federal Aviation Administration as it writes new rules for electric air taxis like Joby. NASA’s national campaign is “an important strategic step in NASA’s goals to accelerate the AAM industry timeline,” said Davis Hackenberg, NASA AAM mission integration manager, in a statement. “These testing scenarios will help inform gaps in current standards to benefit the industry’s progress of integrating AAM vehicles into the airspace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lE8fgt"&gt;Of course, it's NASA’s job to encourage the development of advanced aviation technology, but it’s the FAA’s job to write the rules that will govern their flights and commercial operation. But that’s not without its fair share of turbulence. The space agency previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17331450/uber-expands-partnership-nasa-flying-taxi-dallas"&gt;signed data-sharing agreements with Uber&lt;/a&gt; on the ride-hailing company’s nascent air taxi plans that never ended up getting off the ground. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22086597/uber-sells-flying-taxi-elevate-joby-aviation"&gt;the company transferred its eVTOL division, Uber Elevate, to Joby&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for a $75 million investment in the startup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXXWwO"&gt;Joby and other eVTOL companies hope to eventually win FAA certification, but that process will likely take a long time. Some experts have said it will be five years or maybe longer before the FAA grants certification to an eVTOL company. Joby has said it aims to launch its first air taxi service in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMase6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says Arizona and Georgia will be first to add state IDs to iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HL-nlwJzhCvdHLRt7SNK_ToFvRk=/129x0:2871x1828/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69803242/license.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l76xkS"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F09%2Fapple-announces-first-states-to-adopt-drivers-licenses-and-state-ids-in-wallet%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22652051%2Fapple-iphone-drivers-license-state-id-arizona-georgia-ios-15" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced the first US states&lt;/a&gt; that will support iOS 15’s new ability to store driver’s licenses and state IDs in the Wallet app. Arizona and Georgia will lead the way, with Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah following after that. No timetable is given for exactly when the new feature will be adopted by these states, however: Apple only says that consumers can expect “more information at a later date.” And the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has again confirmed it will open select airport checkpoints and security lanes to Apple’s mobile IDs once states begin making them available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCu4N4"&gt;Adding a state ID or driver’s license to Apple’s Wallet app works similarly to the way you currently add a credit card. But after scanning your license or ID with your iPhone’s camera, you’re also required to provide a selfie that your state can use for verification purposes. Apple says “users will also be prompted to complete a series of facial and head movements during the setup process” for added security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjsVb3"&gt;Apple is also again emphasizing the privacy protections it has in place for driver’s licenses and state IDs, noting that “Apple and the issuing states do not know when or where users present their IDs” and that biometric authentication is required for the data to be shared. IDs are “presented digitally through encrypted communication directly between the device and the identity reader, so users do not need to unlock, show, or hand over their device.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KYKbqcHbSmH_6pk5prlO3J5q0n0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819957/tsa.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple says the TSA will only be able to see specific requested information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E64ENi"&gt;With that last part, it seems Apple is trying to address the concerns that some have raised over what mobile IDs could mean for interactions with police and other law enforcement. It sounds like you won’t ever have to fully unlock your phone to share a mobile ID. The idea that the TSA will let you breeze through security without at least being &lt;em&gt;shown&lt;/em&gt; your phone’s screen feels like a stretch, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAI7M8"&gt;Apple says its implementation of mobile IDs “supports the ISO 18013-5 mDL (mobile driver’s license) standard which Apple has played an active role in the development of, and which sets clear guidelines for the industry around protecting consumers’ privacy when presenting an ID or driver’s license through a mobile device.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tls9lJ"&gt;Apple is clearly attempting to counter any hesitancy about the new feature, and proponents of digital IDs maintain that they’re safer and more secure than physical documents. But the &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/am/deeplinks/2021/07/dhss-flawed-plan-mobile-drivers-licenses"&gt;ACLU and Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; have cautioned that “longer-term, if digital IDs replace physical documents entirely, or if physical-only document holders are placed at a disadvantage, that could have significant implications for equity and fairness in American life.” They’ve also criticized the federal government for trying to intertwine mobile driver’s licenses with the &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/real-id"&gt;REAL ID program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4KCrd"&gt;This new functionality will be included in iOS 15 when the software update is released this fall, but states will dictate if and when they get on board with Apple’s Wallet-based state IDs and driver’s licenses. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dems push for federal probe of alleged ad collusion between Google and Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7LKeQsqKCsRGt0kUids_2hmUCKU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69802612/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="taXJrJ"&gt;Four Democratic members of Congress are calling for an investigation into whether an alleged secret 2018 agreement between Google and Facebook concerning digital advertising violated federal antitrust law. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and Mondaire Jones (D-NY) wrote a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and Acting US Attorney General Nicholas Ganjei of Texas asking them to determine whether federal charges might be warranted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ND3HXX"&gt;“If the reports are accurate, the behavior appears to be a clear violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act (Sherman Act), which criminalizes “mak[ing] any contract” “in restraint of trade or commerce,” the letter states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pw746z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The behavior appears to be a clear violation of... the Sherman Antitrust Act”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LvGx5P"&gt;Attorneys General in ten states &lt;a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/admin/2020/Press/20201216%20COMPLAINT_REDACTED.pdf"&gt;filed suit against Google&lt;/a&gt; in December over a program reportedly nicknamed “Jedi Blue,” according to an &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-google-facebook-ad-deal-at-the-heart-of-a-price-fixing-lawsuit-11609254758"&gt;unredacted draft version&lt;/a&gt; viewed by the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal.&lt;/em&gt; The Texas attorney general’s office led the suit, alleging that Facebook and Google worked to sabotage “header bidding,” which allows advertisers, including competitors, to bypass Google’s ad auctions. Google “repeatedly used its monopolistic power to control pricing,” according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mU5pPH"&gt;The Jedi Blue agreement &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-google-facebook-ad-deal-at-the-heart-of-a-price-fixing-lawsuit-11609254758"&gt;allegedly guaranteed that Facebook&lt;/a&gt; would receive a fixed percentage of advertising bids on Google. In return, Facebook agreed to curtail its involvement with header bidding in ad auctions, the complaint states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBROFu"&gt;In February, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272230/west-virginia-newspaper-google-facebook-lawsuit-digital-ad-revenue"&gt;parent company of a West Virginia newspaper chain&lt;/a&gt; filed an antitrust suit against the two companies, alleging that they were siphoning digital ad revenue away from news organizations. HD Media alleged in its complaint that the Jedi Blue agreement was an illegal quid pro quo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmpIV6"&gt;Now the members of Congress want the Justice Department to investigate whether Google and Facebook should be subject to sanctions, including possible criminal penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3M4h50"&gt;Both companies strenuously deny any wrongdoing, and have issued detailed rebuttals to the charges. In response to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Google spokesperson referred to a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/ag-paxtons-misleading-attack-on-our-ad-tech-business/"&gt;January blog post written by Adam Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s director of economic policy. Titled “AG Paxton’s misleading attack on our ad tech business,” the post states that Facebook is one of more than 25 partners in its Open Bidding program, and that having the Facebook Audience Network’s participation actually helps publishers, by increasing the demand for publishers’ ad space, which allows the publishers to earn more revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6518jf"&gt;“AG Paxton inaccurately claims that we manipulate the Open Bidding auction in FAN’s favor. We absolutely don’t,” Cohen writes in the post. “FAN must make the highest bid to win a given impression. If another eligible network or exchange bids higher, they win the auction. FAN’s participation in Open Bidding doesn’t prevent Facebook from participating in header bidding or any other similar system. In fact, FAN participates in several similar auctions on rival platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdzTaO"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on the letter, but pointed to the company’s December statement on the matter, in which the company said that such partnerships are common in digital ad markets. “Any suggestion that these types of agreements harm competition is baseless,” the previous statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfbCv4"&gt;Still, the specific allegations in the Texas case have been enough to spark further action. In the letter, members of Congress are particularly interested in the claim that the Jedi Blue deal was &lt;a href="https://mlexmarketinsight.com/news-hub/editors-picks/area-of-expertise/antitrust/googles-description-of-jedi-blue-clarifies-states-us-antitrust-complaint"&gt;signed by Google senior vice president Philipp Schindler and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg&lt;/a&gt;. The two may have been aware they were violating antitrust laws, as suggested by “a provision governing the parties’ options  to terminate the agreement in the event of certain government investigations of the agreement,” which could be evidence of criminal intent, according to the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRsbpi"&gt;The Jedi Blue deal amounts to bid rigging, the letter suggests, in violation of the Sherman Act which states that a “contract … or conspiracy, in restraint of trade  or commerce … is declared to be illegal.” Criminal penalties could range up to $100 million for a company found in violation and up to $1 million in fines and ten years in prison if an individual is found guilty.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No Man’s Sky free update adds alien settlements for you to discover and rule</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o9O3GCSjO31bf-431W2bCUg9lmI=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69802602/No_Man_s_Sky_Frontiers_Screen_1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OsmPZ8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;’s latest update is adding alien settlements for you to discover as you explore its procedurally-generated universe. The appropriately titled “Frontiers” expansion was &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/09/as-no-mans-sky-celebrates-its-fifth-anniversary-hello-games-reflects-on-the-journey-so-far/"&gt;first teased last month&lt;/a&gt;, and represents the game’s seventeenth major update since its launch five years ago. It’s available to download today, free of charge, like the rest of &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;’s updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BtzmbE"&gt;A brief trailer released by developer Hello Games gives an idea of what players can expect from these settlements, which come complete with aliens wandering their streets. Players will be able to become the Overseer of a settlement, and build it up from a small collection of buildings into a larger town. Once you’re in control, citizens will ask for help with their problems, and the town itself will need to be defended against attack. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5svzF1V22di-SZK5AQgFjDPWY5M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819496/No_Man_s_Sky_Frontiers_Screen_4.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hello Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A wretched hive of scum and villainy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c3xtAe"&gt;Alongside settlements, the Frontiers update includes more base-building parts and a redesigned construction interface. There’s also a new expedition which will task players with mapping and exploring planets, as well as more minor quality of life improvements like redesigned visual effects, and the addition of deep space nebulae to pretty up the night sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlJqk7"&gt;Frontiers looks like another impressive free update for a game whose launch was rocky, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jul/20/no-mans-sky-next-hello-games-sean-murray-harassment-interview"&gt;to say the very least&lt;/a&gt;. But over the past five years Hello Games has turned &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt; into an experience that arguably exceeds anything its developers promised prior to its release. No wonder it now has such a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18683405/no-mans-sky-billboard-hello-games-sean-murray-gofundme-thank-you-beyond"&gt;dedicated following&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKQ5W3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdpeV9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Android 12 lets you control your phone with facial gestures</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b2-h7Z7MoiSJKcKXVegDNs-e49M=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69802559/VRG_1777_Android_12_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="koRjta"&gt;A new accessibility feature that is being introduced with Android 12 allows you to control your screen using facial gestures: raise eyebrows, smile, open mouth, look up, look left, look right. This feature, called “Camera switches,” uses the phone’s camera to watch for these gestures and allows them to signal simple screen operations. These operations include: go to the next actionable screen object, select an object, go to the previous object, touch and hold, scroll forward, and scroll backward; you can also pause the camera switch itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmzBWL"&gt;It’s not a long list: it only includes six facial gestures and not all that many actions. However, it’s a beginning, and it could be useful if you can’t use your hands to work your phone’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="av01cN"&gt;If you do have a Pixel loaded with Android 12 beta — or if you’re reading this after Android 12 becomes available — here’s how you start using the “Camera switches” feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="r5dZwU"&gt;On your phone, go to “Settings”  &amp;gt; “Accessibility” &amp;gt; “Switch Access”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PKYNED"&gt;Toggle on “Use Switch Access.” It will probably ask you to allow it to view and control your screen and interact with apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dBADsf"&gt;You’ll then be asked to choose a switch type. You can use a physical switch via USB or Bluetooth, but we’re going to go with Camera Switch instead. You’ll be asked for permission to take pictures and record video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="be3ni4"&gt;Next, the app asks you to choose between using one switch or two. This is a little confusing: what it really means is that you can either just use a single gesture to start auto-scanning what’s on the screen (one switch), or you can use up to six different gestures to perform a variety of functions (two switches). I selected the second; either way, once you’ve made your choice, tap “Next.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ODnKOR"&gt;You now need to select one of three ways that you will be able to move through your actionable items using facial gestures. Linear scanning means that each gesture will move forward item by item; row-column scanning will let you select a row of items and then drill down; group selection will assign all items a color and you use facial gestures to choose which color you want, and drill down from there. I chose linear scanning, but you may want to try out all three to see which works for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="nNtKDF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10727839"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="9HjKkA"&gt;The three subsequent screens let you choose switches for three actions:  next, select, and pause (in other words, temporarily pause or unpause the use of facial gestures). You can use one or more facial gestures for each — for example, you can assign both eyebrows up and eyes right to “next.” But you can only use each gesture for one action; so if you choose to raise your eyebrows to indicate “next,” then “raise eyebrows” will be grayed out for any other actions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="irjMw3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10727861"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="63nwas"&gt;The next screen is called “Switch Access settings.” Toggle it on to enable it. It has a “Try it” button that you can use to see if your camera can properly catch your smile, upraised eyebrows, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HlMiM1"&gt;On this page, you can also tweak your face gesture settings to better suit your needs. For example, if you tap on “Open Mouth,” you can set how big the gesture needs to be (in other words, how open your mouth has to be), how long you need to hold it, etc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="yOCLXg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10727943"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j6x7WF"&gt;Try it out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0QAiRe"&gt;At this point, it’s a good idea to leave setup and try it out. I did, and while I found it slow going (and realized very early on that I had neglected to assign the “previous” switch), it worked pretty well. I even had little trouble using raised eyebrows to indicate “next,” despite my rather heavily framed glasses. (Of course, they’re reading glasses that I often wear low on my nose, so it’s possible glasses might be a problem for others.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lz5kOk"&gt;Some things you may want to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wAM8l5"&gt;If you want to go back and tweak your settings, you can go back to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Accessibility” &amp;gt; “Switch Access” &amp;gt; “Settings.” There you can reassign facial gestures either by going through the guided setup again (look for “Open setup guide” at the top of the page) or running through the various menu options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2R8c8F"&gt;A blue smiley face at the top of your screen will appear when the camera switches are active. When the switches are paused, you’ll see a blue “pause” symbol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vpY91h"&gt;When you go through your home screen using camera switches, a “Menu” button will appear next to the smiley face. This will bring up a quick menu of six action items, such as home, back, notifications, power options, etc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EgIalo"&gt;One handy feature is the “Switch Access shortcut” which you can find on the main “Switch Access” page. The shortcut — a little green icon — will stay on your screen at all times, letting you turn switch access on and off at will. If it’s getting in your way, swipe it toward the edge of the screen to minimize it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="hsoiGX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10727953"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dqzXLf"&gt;Granted, Android 12’s new Camera Switch Access feature takes a while to set up and can be a little complex to tweak. In addition, I only used it for a few hours, and so I’m not a fair judge on how ultimately useful it would be to someone who may find it difficult to interact with their phone using touch. But if it is something that you might find useful, take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0dsFs"&gt;One additional note if you’re using Android 10 or 11: since this feature is built into the Android Accessibility Suite, which is already part of Android 10 and 11, there is a good possibility that it will eventually become available to those versions of Android as well. According to sites such as &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-camera-switches-control-phone-with-face/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re comfortable sideloading APKs on your phone, you can access it now via sites such as &lt;a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/android-accessibility-suite/android-accessibility-suite-12-0-0-381995842-release/android-accessibility-suite-12-0-0-381995842-android-apk-download/"&gt;APKMirror&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, stay tuned and watch for updates.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>1Password subscriptions are 50 percent off for Verge readers today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/52UQahxcn0uMeTuTL6gMzvbz41s=/63x0:1938x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69802439/item_details_view.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yk8VZ1"&gt;Many of us would agree that online protection is more vital than ever before, but trying to remember a random string of letters and symbols for every site you frequent — or don’t — isn’t always easy. Password managers like 1Password are a great way to store your login credentials and beef up your security, however, one that can also save you plenty of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDv1yP"&gt;Thankfully, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers can save 50 percent on their first year of 1Password for a limited time, whether they opt for an &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-15026552?sid=VergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;individual plan&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-15026551?sid=VergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;family subscription&lt;/a&gt;. The individual plan normally runs $2.99 a month and comes out to be around $36 per year, yet our exclusive discount brings the annual price down to $18. The family plan, meanwhile, will run you $2.50 a month instead of $5, culminating in $30 a year. Keep in mind, however, that the family plan is limited to five people and that each plan is only available to new 1Password users, not returning customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7rckI"&gt;In terms of features, 1Password offers quite a few. Not only does the service store your login details, but it will send you alerts for compromised sites and vulnerable passwords, while security features like authenticated encryption keep your data safe. You can also use the service on unlimited devices and enjoy 24/7 customer support if you hit a snag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0nXk1j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10426335"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="XTiUco"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10437502"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Us84ji"&gt;If you have yet to pick up a smart speaker, the second-generation Echo Show 8 is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-8-2nd-Gen-2021-release/dp/B084DC4LW6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750688708099700197#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $100, matching its best price ever. Unlike the previous generation, the 2021 Echo Show 8 boasts faster performance and a superior 13-megapixel camera. It also features the same display, design, and speaker system as its predecessor, which is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-8/dp/B07PF1Y28C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale for $80&lt;/a&gt;. We consider the second-gen model the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best smart speaker you can buy&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you intend to use the smart display for video calls. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qwPCKk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10611942"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mdfWru"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-75-Inch-Class-QLED-Built/dp/B08WFTZ9LY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling&lt;/a&gt; the 75-inch QLED Q80A Series TV at an all-time low, taking around $500 off the typical list price. Normally $2,700, you can pick up the TV — which was released earlier this year — for just $2,198. Better yet, a few &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffers saw in the fine print that if you purchase it before September 30th and use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;B6PXLX23DQL9&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout, Amazon will give you $400 in credit to use on future purchases. Not a bad deal at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSEQma"&gt;The 4K TV delivers wide viewing angles thanks to its IPS panel while producing bright and colorful images. It’s a good buy for gamers, too, who will enjoy the low input lag and support for variable refresh rate (VRR) and AMD FreeSync technology. While we haven’t tested this specific model, &lt;a href="https://www.reviewed.com/televisions/content/samsung-q80a-qled-tv-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reviewed&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that movie fans may not appreciate the low contrast levels or relatively lackluster local dimming feature, which can make it hard to watch HDR content or films in a dark room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Op1XkD"&gt;Amazon’s current deal comes just a week after the retailer also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-75-Inch-Class-QLED-Built/dp/B08WFLBLWP?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cut the price of the 55-inch model by $200&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it to a record low of $1,098. Other sizes are similarly discounted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="g1p9br"&gt;If you’re looking for a pair of true wireless earbuds, you can pick up a refurbished pair of Jabra Elite 85t for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F164914311936%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeGetaoneyear1Passwordsubscriptionfor50percentoffAUG312021%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22651065%2F1password-amazon-echo-show-8-samsung-qled-tv-jabra-elite-85t-apple-deals-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$117 at eBay through Jabra’s digital storefront&lt;/a&gt; with promo code &lt;strong&gt;SAVE15LABORDAY&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;p id="Qk6SHI"&gt;Released in November, the 85t are the first pair of earbuds from Jabra to ship with active noise cancellation. In contrast to the AirPods Pro and Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds, they’re also capable of simultaneously pairing with two devices. You can also buy the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750688339690161172#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jabra Elite 75t at best Buy right now for $100&lt;/a&gt;, however, if you want solid noise cancellation and excellent on-earbud controls, it may be worth forking over the extra $17 for the refurbished Elite 85t. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="2zWZiX"&gt;For a limited time, Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro Smart Battery Case is more than half off its usual price. Once again, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081SHMJ77/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750684926448631384#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are both selling the $130 case for a record low of $52. Best Buy is also throwing in a free, six-month subscription to Apple Music and Apple News Plus for new users. The case offers a decent amount of charge — Apple says you can expect “up to 50 percent” extra battery life — while boasting features such as a physical camera button and the ability to charge your iPhone and battery case simultaneously. At the same time, its soft microfiber lining gives your phone some additional protection.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI’s next smartphone gimbal might include a telescoping selfie stick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ZfpmDxIWRHnYXuIONr6WuQxIYs=/0x0:1068x712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69802338/DJI_OM_5_1630481788_0_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gimbal, meet selfie stick.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124942.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7Ab4x2"&gt;DJI appears to have another smartphone gimbal on the way with a telescoping selfie stick built into its handle, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,124942.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Osmo Mobile 5, which is an apparent successor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21401564/dji-osmo-mobile-4-phone-gimbal-magnetic-announce-price-release-date"&gt;last year’s Osmo Mobile 4&lt;/a&gt;, is likely to make its first appearance at DJI’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DJIGlobal/status/1432690094750588932"&gt;September 8th launch event&lt;/a&gt; where it will reportedly earn a European price of €159, which roughly translates to a tax-inclusive price of $188. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEY3D2"&gt;The Osmo Mobile 5 reportedly folds down to around 17cm (6.7 inches), but can be extended when you need to get closer to your subject, or further away from yourself. From the pictures, it doesn’t seem to extend quite as much as a traditional selfie stick, but it should be enough to give you a little extra flexibility with your shots. When extended, the gimbal’s controls sensibly remain down by your hand. Sure, selfie sticks have a pretty terrible reputation as the chosen accessory of inconsiderate tourists, but they’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2014/12/31/7470713/selfie-stick-haters-hate"&gt;pretty damn handy in the right circumstances&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oO61bB_XKLObrYmMDIs5f5cm0Z8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819574/msedge_RuyuCYhmHG.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124942.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It appears to fold down as compactly as DJI’s existing gimbals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WER3hx"&gt;Unfortunately, it sounds like the telescoping mechanism built into the Osmo Mobile 5 has had an impact on battery life, which reportedly stands at around 6 hours and 20 minutes compared to 15 hours for the Osmo Mobile 4. Thankfully the magnetic mounting system from the Osmo Mobile 4 has stuck around, which should mean it’s as easy as ever to quickly attach and detach your phone from the gimbal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXNl8b"&gt;Alongside the Osmo Mobile 5, &lt;em&gt;WinFuture’s&lt;/em&gt; Roland Quandt also reports that there’s a more affordable $99 version of the Osmo Mobile 4 on the way, which won’t include the original $149 gimbal’s magnetic mounting system. A shame for sure, but it’s hard to argue with the discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QGNn0e"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;btw... DJI OM 4 SE is also incoming: 99$ and basically the same as the original OM4, but w/o the magnetic smartpone holder. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dQO5LhKMMQ"&gt;https://t.co/dQO5LhKMMQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Roland Quandt (@rquandt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1433023533001629699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Telegram uncaps live stream viewers as part of big version 8.0 update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/30qryDtAhkxKIX5Gssm4rnMluGQ=/61x0:1195x756/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69802138/aed1cb7af8c96e961b.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Telegram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sOEgks"&gt;Telegram, the messaging app that’s becoming more and more like a fully-fledged social media network, is expanding support for video live streams with its latest update. &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/live-streams-forwarding-next-channel"&gt;Version 8.0 of the app&lt;/a&gt;, which is available now on both iOS and Android, allows live streams to be watched by an unlimited number of viewers, up from the &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/video-1000"&gt;previous limit of 1,000&lt;/a&gt;. Other new features include more options when forwarding messages, and a shortcut to switch between channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NbmZv"&gt;Increasing the maximum number of viewers like this opens the door to Telegram becoming a full-on mobile live streaming platform, complete with the ability for as many as 30 users to broadcast at once. “The power to run your own TV station is here, right in your pocket,” is how Telegram puts it. The service also supports &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats-on-steroids"&gt;Clubhouse-style voice channels&lt;/a&gt; with support for “millions” of live listeners. It’s rapid progress considering Telegram’s group calling feature only launched in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551652/telegram-adds-group-video-calling-chat"&gt;June this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0C5u4A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The power to run your own TV station is here, right in your pocket”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Iohab"&gt;Also included with version 8.0 of the app is an option to remove captions and hide sender names when forwarding messages and media. Scrolling to the bottom of a text channel now includes a new option to quickly swipe up to jump to the next unread channel. Other interface tweaks include a new “choosing a sticker” status in chats, and an unread messages counter in comment threads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yISqmy"&gt;As of January this year, Telegram boasted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1349014065931284480?s=20"&gt;500 million active users&lt;/a&gt;, compared to around 2 billion for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134652/whatsapp-2-billion-monthly-active-users-encryption-facebook"&gt;Facebook’s rival WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
