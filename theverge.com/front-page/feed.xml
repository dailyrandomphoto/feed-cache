    <title>Vivaldi is updating its browsers to block annoying cookie pop-ups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i60nfBJtsFfk2phO_qZj3fvHdpc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69203592/vivaldi_browser_cookie_blocker_setting.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vivaldi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5WTD3D"&gt;Vivaldi announced today that it’s updating the &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/press/embargoed/vivaldi-browser-blocks-cookie-dialogs-improves-privacy-design/"&gt;desktop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/press/embargoed/new-vivaldi-on-android-language-switcher-cookie-crumbler/"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; versions of its Vivaldi browser with the ability to block annoying cookie preference pop-ups. Thanks to the passage of the European Union’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt; (GDPR), you’ve probably had to click through at least one dialog box asking if you’d like to manage how a site tracks you. Vivaldi’s new update lets you avoid those notifications — with some major caveats — while theoretically still keeping you safe from tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EJa8q"&gt;Vivaldi’s logic for the new feature, affectionately called “Cookie Crumbler,” is that while giving users control over how they’re tracked is good, doing so through a pop-up “leads to clicking ‘allow’ or ‘accept’ without realizing that unwittingly users just gave permission for trackers to create behavioral profiles about them,” Vivaldi writes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-v1z0djtC6kORkl4FMj0ezKL-UY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476438/Screen_Shot_2021_04_28_at_1.05.47_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A cookie dialog box from &lt;/em&gt;The Guardian.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MYhPRA"&gt;Vivaldi’s &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/features/ad-blocker/"&gt;built-in Ad Blocker&lt;/a&gt; can theoretically already handle hiding users from the various tracking methods deployed by sites, so Cookie Crumbler is about removing the annoying hangers-on — the pop-up notifications that direct users to customize how they’re tracked, if at all. Users with an updated version of Vivaldi (version 3.8 as of today) can enable Cookie Crumbler by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracker and ad blocking &amp;gt; Manage sources &amp;gt; Remove cookie warnings lists. The same feature can be enabled on the Android version of Vivaldi under the same menus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4CzAkfZA18MElQRuM7398cB-mTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476434/vivaldi_browser_cookie_blocker_setting_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Vivaldi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Cookie Crumbler” can be enabled on Android in the same menu you manage Vivaldi’s ad and tracker blocker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LoBREU"&gt;Cookie Crumbler pulls from two separate third-party block lists to work, but “this is not a perfect solution, as there will be a few websites that use other tactics to obtain cookie consent,” Vivaldi says. Enabling Cookie Crumbler may also make some sites completely inaccessible on desktop and mobile, depending on if the site locks some functionality behind interacting with the cookie dialog. Losing access to some websites is a major inconvenience for a web browser that’s designed to visit websites, and that may be why Cookie Crumbler isn’t enabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzHsYa"&gt;Vivaldi is also taking an even stronger stance on Google’s cookie alternative, FLoC, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;Federated Learning of Cohorts&lt;/a&gt;. FLoC builds cohorts from users’ browsing history to sort them semi-anonymously by interests or qualities for websites looking to sell ads. It seems less directly invasive than a traditional cookie, but also hugely dependent on browser makers implementing it correctly for it to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyVYpP"&gt;Vivaldi is &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/no-google-vivaldi-users-will-not-get-floced/"&gt;decidedly not okay&lt;/a&gt; with Google’s implementation of FLoC and is not enabling it in its browser, despite relying on Google’s Chromium codebase. With today’s updated version of Vivaldi, it’s also blacklisting the FLoC component required for Google’s current test of the ad technology, removing it from browsers that might already have it downloaded and preventing it from being downloaded going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXff93"&gt;Vivaldi 3.8 also adds new customization options for the browser’s Panels feature (think SlideOver in iPadOS but for websites) and a new keyboard command for adding bookmarks. The Android version of the app can also now switch between the 41 languages Vivaldi supports rather than relying on Android’s built-in language settings.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Would you pay $30 a month for a faster web browser that eats less battery?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LENmsQirMZcz7iocpzQn4960BIg=/0x0:1376x917/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69203413/mighty_browser.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ao3iRA"&gt;No matter how much web browsers improve, it feels like they can’t keep pace with everything we want to do. Open one too many tabs on a few-year-old laptop, and your fan starts spinning, your battery life dips, your system starts to slow. A faster or cleaner PC might fix it, but &lt;a href="https://www.mightyapp.com/"&gt;a startup called Mighty has a different idea&lt;/a&gt;: a $30-a-month web browser that lives in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ievKTm"&gt;Instead of your own physical computer interacting with each website, you stream a&lt;em&gt; remote &lt;/em&gt;web browser instead, one that lives on a powerful computer many miles away with its own 1,000Mbps connection to the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAtGyB"&gt;Suddenly, your decent internet connection would feel like one of the fastest internet connections in the world, with websites loading nigh-instantly and intensive web apps running smoothly without monopolizing your RAM, CPU, GPU and battery, no matter how many tabs you’ve got open — because the only thing &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; computer is doing is effectively streaming a video of that remote computer (much like Netflix, YouTube, Google Stadia, etc.)  while sending your keyboard and mouse commands to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z2VD1m"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dWPdDgSZ5yU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gMeA3R"&gt;Skeptical? I definitely am, but perhaps not for the reason you’d think — because I tried this exact idea nearly a decade ago, and it absolutely works in practice. In 2012, cloud gaming pioneer OnLive introduced a virtual desktop web browser that would let you load full websites on an iPad in the blink of an eye &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; stream 4K video from YouTube. (Quite the feat in 2012!) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/2/22/2817646/onlive-desktop-plus-has-the-fastest-virtual-web-browser-youve-ever"&gt;I called it the fastest web browser you’ve ever used&lt;/a&gt;, and OnLive’s asking price was just $5 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E6HE8w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a proven idea&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E2fXRx"&gt;Cloud desktop providers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21176310/shadow-cloud-gaming-service-price-lower-google-stadia-nvidia-geforce-now"&gt;like Shadow&lt;/a&gt; have also offered similar capabilities; when you rent their gaming-PCs-in-the-cloud ($12-15 a month), you can use those virtual PCs’ built-in web browsers to get similar speeds, thanks to the fact they typically live in data centers with very few hops to (and possibly direct peering arrangements with) major content delivery networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76CLaI"&gt;Mighty argues that by focusing on the browser (rather than recreating a whole Windows PC), it can give more people what they actually want. “Most people want an experience where the underlying OS and the application (the browser) interoperate seamlessly versus having to tame two desktop experiences,” &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26962818"&gt;founder Suhail Doshi commented at&lt;em&gt; Hacker News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Mighty claims it’ll eliminate distracting cookies and ads, automatically notify you about Zoom meetings, quick search Google Docs and presumably other integrations to come. Mighty also says it encrypts your data and keystrokes, &lt;a href="https://www.mightyapp.com/security"&gt;among other security promises.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9nNZv"&gt;But it’s not entirely clear why it costs so much more, or who would be willing to pay $30 a month for such a subscription — you’d think the kinds of people who can afford a monthly browser bill on top of their monthly internet bill would be the same kinds of people who can afford a faster PC and faster internet to begin with. Gigabit fiber is already a reality for some homes, and it’s not like Mighty will turn &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;your iffy 25/3 connection&lt;/a&gt; into a gigabit one; while Doshi tells me it’ll technically work with a 20Mbps connection, he says he’s targeting 80+Mbps households right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="If2683"&gt;Then again, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;it’s not like everyone has a real choice of internet service provider&lt;/a&gt;, no matter how much money they make. As Jürgen Geuter (aka tante) points out below, this feels more like an indictment than innovation. It’s been a decade, and we still haven’t solved these problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qKjRkW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"Streaming your browser to you because rendering the HTML is too slow on your machine" is not innovation but a mark of shame on everyone building websites and browsers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tech failed as an industry. &lt;a href="https://t.co/JJC0WomArb"&gt;https://t.co/JJC0WomArb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— tante (@tante) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tante/status/1387390816595947522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YIMvM9"&gt;I agree &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1387499682759380995"&gt;with my colleague Tom&lt;/a&gt;: I genuinely want to know who’d actually pay for this and why. Would you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HQzqfI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I want to meet whoever is going to spend $30 a month to stream a Chromium browser from the cloud just to avoid RAM hungry Chrome &lt;a href="https://t.co/4pl6jL2zUV"&gt;https://t.co/4pl6jL2zUV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1387499682759380995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Facebook claims it mistakenly hid posts calling for India’s prime minister to resign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NejP3qeOZaAQUaLrvkqiS_3MN7c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69201908/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kLTZoh"&gt;When Facebook users tried to view a hashtag calling for the resignation of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, they &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/srinivasaiims/status/1387472195316711426"&gt;instead saw a message&lt;/a&gt; saying that Facebook was temporarily hiding the posts in order to keep the community safe. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-blocking-posts-hashtag-resign-modi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the posts were hidden for about three hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3qohU"&gt;Facebook has now restored the posts. The company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the hashtag was blocked “by mistake” and claims it wasn’t because the Indian government asked Facebook to remove it. It also says the block was the result of some of the content that used the hashtag, but did not specify what kind of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeLMIH"&gt;The temporary suspension of the hashtag is likely to fuel concerns about the influence that Modi’s BJP party wields over Facebook operations and social media in general. Last weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;Twitter hid tweets critical of various officials&lt;/a&gt; after receiving an emergency order from the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foSR7N"&gt;India is currently currently seeing another wave in COVID-19 cases, which has lead to critical medical supplies being in short supply. Many of the Facebook posts with the ResignModi hashtag include references to the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MMbby"&gt;Facebook has blocked hashtags in the past — during the 2020 US election &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551717/facebook-tiktok-block-election-conspiracy-theory-hashtags-twitter-monitoring"&gt;it blocked the  “StopTheSteal” tag&lt;/a&gt;, showing users a similar message to the one seen in India today. The hashtag for “Qanon” is also blocked, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504887/facebook-qanon-ban-all-apps-pages-groups-instagram-accounts"&gt;part of Facebook’s fight&lt;/a&gt; against the conspiracy-based social movement. Unlike the ResignModi hashtag, the StopTheSteal and Qanon tags are still blocked, with the message citing content that goes against community standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqaH8A"&gt;Facebook India has been a sore point for the company in recent months, with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536149/ankhi-das-facebook-india-resigned-quit-bjp-hindu-muslim-conflict"&gt;controversial policy chief resigning&lt;/a&gt; last October. Critics pressured her to leave, claiming that, under her guidance, Facebook India had failed to moderate hate speech that led to anti-Muslim pogroms in Delhi. More broadly, there were concerns that her public alignment with the ruling BJP party had led to unfair application of Facebook policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="162nQO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 28th, 9:04PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with statement from Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s pay raise for over 500,000 workers comes at an interesting time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UTm_XxvVt3EXSYcqwX81Bd4F8hY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69202415/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFHMtK"&gt;Amazon has announced that over 500,000 of its workers will get a permanent increase in their hourly wages starting in mid-May, from as low as an additional 50 cents an hour to as much as three extra dollars per hour (via &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-boost-pay-500k-operations-workers-much-3-hour-1b-investment/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeekWire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That’s a substantial chunk of its 1.3 million person workforce getting at least a small pay bump, and the company shared that it’s investing over $1 billion in these pay increases. Amazon said that it’s also on a hiring spree for “tens of thousands of jobs across our operations in the US.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xGE3T"&gt;Amazon previously recognized its warehouse and delivery workers with a $2 pay bump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21182411/amazon-hires-employees-warehouse-delivery-pay-raise-coronavirus"&gt;last March&lt;/a&gt; as the company worked to meet increased demand during the pandemic, but that was a temporary raise that disappeared &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/amazon-to-end-wage-increases-and-overtime-pay-in-june.html"&gt;in May 2020&lt;/a&gt;, shortly after the United States had reached 100,000 deaths; the coronavirus pandemic has killed &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/us/us-covid-deaths-half-a-million.html"&gt;over 400,000 additional people&lt;/a&gt; in the United States since then. The company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the pay bumps announced Wednesday are permanent, however, and new hires will be eligible for them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m66m6c"&gt;Here’s the full text of &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/a-message-from-darcie-henry-amazon-vp-of-people-experience-and-technology-worldwide-consumer"&gt;Amazon’s announcement&lt;/a&gt;, from Amazon’s Darcie Henry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="virJLb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon is hiring now for tens of thousands of jobs across our operations in the U.S., and we’re looking for great people to join our Customer Fulfillment, Delivery, Package Sortation, and Specialty Fulfillment teams. In support of this effort, we pulled forward our annual fall pay review for these teams and will be rolling out increases from mid-May through early June.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loy9S5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;More than 500,000 people will see an increase between at least 50 cents and $3 an hour, which is an investment of over $1 billion in incremental pay for these employees. This is on top of our already industry-leading starting wage of at least $15 an hour and the more than $2.5 billion that we invested last year in additional bonuses and incentives for front-line teams. These jobs come with a range of great benefits, like medical, dental, and vision coverage, parental leave, ways to save for the future, and opportunities for career advancement—all in a safe and inclusive environment that’s been ranked among the best workplaces in the world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXlFzG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other teams are continuing with their regular annual compensation review plans, which will occur throughout the remainder of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hYQ2LI"&gt;Wednesday’s news comes just a day before the company’s earnings tomorrow, April 29th. It also arrives as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22408128/amazon-warehouses-unionizing-staten-island-jfk8-christian-smalls"&gt;a fired Amazon worker is attempting to unionize other warehouse employees&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"&gt;the failed union vote in Bessemer, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XCXn6a"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T says it will now offer a prepaid 5G data-only plan with up to 100GB of data for $55 per month — a big upgrade from its previous offering of 40GB for $75. The new pricing extends to Cricket Wireless customers as well as AT&amp;amp;T’s direct prepaid subscribers, though those on Cricket won’t be able to access the 5G network. These plans allow customers to buy data for their tablet or mobile hotspot separate from their voice plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEnrf2"&gt;That 100GB is a lot of data at a lower price than the other major carriers are offering; currently, T-Mobile has a prepaid data-only plan of 50GB for $50 and Verizon has a 30GB plan for $65 per month. It may be no coincidence that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497743/verizon-home-lte-service-rural-communities-48-states"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; are also eager to expand their own 5G and LTE-based fixed home wireless products, but AT&amp;amp;T may have a little more room to be aggressive with its mobile hotspot offerings while it remains committed to pushing its fiber home internet service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWxMmR"&gt;The company says that current Cricket customers already enrolled in the 100GB data-only plan — previously $90 per month — will see the new price reflected on their next bill. Likewise, existing AT&amp;amp;T customers will get a data bump and a price decrease automatically. New customers can sign up for the plans starting today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Space community mourns the death of Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Michael Collins Studying Flight Plans" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GkE4stmIsKUKEK68OdCmV0i5Q1g=/0x20:3989x2679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69201988/517427560.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kuQOSQ"&gt;Michael Collins, the witty “forgotten” astronaut of NASA’s legendary Apollo 11 mission to the Moon, died of cancer on Wednesday, his family said. An icon of space exploration and an eloquent storyteller (who, arguably, had the best sense of humor among the Apollo 11 crew), Collins passionately advocated for further exploration of other worlds. Astronauts, NASA officials, and others in the space community who are heeding his advocacy mourned his death today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKtfx9"&gt;Collins was the Columbia command module pilot who stayed in orbit around the Moon in 1969 while his crew mates, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, descended to the lunar surface and became the first two humans to set foot on another world. Aldrin, now the only living Apollo 11 astronaut, mourned his fellow crewmate in a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NreQh8"&gt;“Dear Mike,” Aldrin said, “Wherever you have been or will be, you will always have the Fire to Carry us deftly to new heights and to the future. We will miss you. May you Rest In Peace. #Apollo11”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="okhfg7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Dear Mike,&lt;br&gt;Wherever you have been or will be, you will always have the Fire to Carry us deftly to new heights and to the future.  We will miss you. May you Rest In Peace.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apollo11?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apollo11&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/q4sJjFdvf8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q4sJjFdvf8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dr. Buzz Aldrin (@TheRealBuzz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealBuzz/status/1387451395461292037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KPjUPI"&gt;After the Apollo 11 mission, Collins was given an informal nickname, the “forgotten astronaut,” and went on to write several books, including a 1974 memoir, &lt;em&gt;Carrying the Fire&lt;/em&gt;, where&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;he relived the feeling of utter loneliness as his Columbia module flew into the remote darkness of the Moon’s far side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvKM5o"&gt;“I like the feeling,” he wrote in his memoir. “Outside my window I can see stars — and that is all. Where I know the moon to be, there is simply a black void.” He called his perch in the capsule his “beautiful little domain” in a 2019 interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, adding “It was all mine. I was the emperor, the captain of it, and it was quite commodious. I had warm coffee, even.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7J2MvI"&gt;Collins had a long career, even beyond NASA. During his 90 years on (and off) Earth, he also served as an Air Force colonel, head of the State Department’s public affairs bureau, and director of the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum. “He helped shepherd the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum from a rickety old hut on the National Mall to its present premises,” said Tom Ellis, a teaching fellow at the London School of Economics who studies space history. His stint as the museum’s director, Ellis said, “demonstrated that he was a rare spacefarer who truly understood just how ‘historic’ the space age was. Someone whose post-space career was as impressive as his time as an astronaut.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wKCYmc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We mourn the passing and celebrate the life of our former director and astronaut Michael Collins. His vision and extraordinary achievements helped define our museum, and his wit, warmth, and wisdom will always be a part of our work. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Z8VPRSfabs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Z8VPRSfabs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— National Air and Space Museum (@airandspace) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/airandspace/status/1387453338363568129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yZWGVC"&gt;NASA’s acting administrator Steve Jurczyk said Collins was “a friend of all who seek to push the envelope of human potential,” citing a famous quote from the astronaut: “Exploration is not a choice, really, it’s an imperative.” Jurczyk added: “Whether his work was behind the scenes or on full view, his legacy will always be as one of the leaders who took America’s first steps into the cosmos. And his spirit will go with us as we venture toward farther horizons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktFgnR"&gt;NASA is investing billions into its Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon and establish a long-term presence that can inform future missions to Mars. The space agency &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; a $2.9 billion contract with SpaceX this month to deliver the first crew of astronauts to the lunar surface since the last Apollo Moon mission in 1972. Past attempts to build on the Apollo program’s legacy and return to the Moon were squashed by shifting presidential priorities — but the Artemis program, started in 2019 by the Trump administration, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22323621/trump-moon-program-artemis-biden-nasa-timeline"&gt;won embrace&lt;/a&gt; by the Biden administration as well, making a crewed return more likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HfvpOq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We will continue Carrying the Fire, Mike.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vVrMw0"&gt;Pam Melroy, a retired NASA astronaut of three shuttle missions and President Biden’s nominee for NASA Deputy Administrator, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Astro_Pam/status/1387457744224014341?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: “So, so sad at the passing of my favorite astronaut, @AstroMCollins. A hero just outside the spotlight. We will continue Carrying the Fire, Mike.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PJhIB"&gt;Mark Geyer, director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, NASA’s astronaut HQ, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DirectorMarkG/status/1387475108004962304?s=20"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; “many people here at JSC will remember his wit, humor, and their interactions with him with both admiration and affection.” Geyer recalled Collins’ visit to JSC in 2019, during the 50th Apollo 11 anniversary: “Mike said he primarily remembers not having time to relax and enjoy the view for long, but in the moments when he did he look out his window at Earth, he realized how delicate it was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqWuxT"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/statement-of-president-joe-biden-on-the-passing-of-michael-collins/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, President Biden said Collins “lived a life of service to our country” who “both wrote and helped tell the story of our nation’s remarkable accomplishments in space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePnvLc"&gt;“From his vantage point high above the Earth, he reminded us of the fragility of our own planet, and called on us to care for it like the treasure it is,” Biden said. “Our prayers are with General Collins’ family. Godspeed, Mike.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook expects ad tracking problems from regulators and Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2r1HaM-7DVxkDsuWX56glio-d28=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69201604/acastro_180522_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YMzHQN"&gt;Facebook’s ad revenue was up more than 45 percent during the first three months of 2020, soaring to $25.4 billion — or about seven times what Twitter makes in an entire year. But the company sees some potential problems on the horizon that could limit continued growth: regulators are closing in on ad tracking practices, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;a feature launched this week by Apple&lt;/a&gt; could harm its ability to target ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1BP9s"&gt;“We continue to expect increased ad targeting headwinds in 2021 from regulatory and platform changes,” Facebook CFO Dave Wehner writes in the company’s &lt;a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"&gt;Q1 2021 earnings release&lt;/a&gt;. Wehner specifically calls out iOS 14.5, which includes a feature that lets iPhone and iPad users easily stop apps from tracking them in certain ways. Facebook expects to start seeing an impact from the changes to iOS right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="E81iTS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Apple’s new privacy feature is such a big deal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nS41nB"&gt;Facebook believes its ad revenue will continue to grow over the rest of 2020 even with those changes, but it sees a slowdown coming in the second half of the year. Mostly, Facebook says, that’s because it did so well last year during the pandemic. But regulatory factors and Apple’s changes will play a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rG8mSu"&gt;The new update requires apps like Facebook to proactively ask users to consent to being tracked for the purpose of advertising. Facebook and other companies &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Ffacebook-looks-to-take-its-fight-with-apple-to-court&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F28%2F22407728%2Ffacebook-q1-2021-earnings-apple-regulators-ad-tracking-problems" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;expect a lot of people to opt out&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s a possibility that’ll hurt their ability to accurately target ads. Facebook has criticized the feature as a threat to the businesses that rely on those ads. “Apple’s latest update threatens the personalized ads that millions of small businesses rely on to find and reach customers,” a Facebook website reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C583UN"&gt;On a call with investors, Facebook executives said the company was working on improvements to its ad tech that would allow for better ad targeting even with access to less data. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg framed it as a “rebuilding” of the company’s tech; Wehner said Facebook was “making progress” on solutions with the goal to “maintain and even improve performance” in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ri403o"&gt;Meanwhile, the European Union’s data protection leader &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/eus-top-privacy-regulator-urges-ban-on-surveillance-based-ad-targeting/"&gt;has recommended&lt;/a&gt; a ban on ad targeting that’s based on tracked web activity. European lawmakers are &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/"&gt;planning a significant overhaul&lt;/a&gt; of digital marketplace regulations, and Facebook could come out with fewer available tools to target ads to individual users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fShQuV"&gt;But for the moment, Facebook continues to grow on all major counts. Daily users across Facebook’s family of products hit 2.72 billion, up from 2.6 billion at the end of the prior quarter, while monthly users hit 3.45 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JwVdr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 28th, 6:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with comments from Facebook’s earnings call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s iPhone 12 and Mac sales skyrocket despite ongoing pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i99fSomk-kSyCJQESjrxlXCOLSM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69201444/akrales_201018_4238_0194.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mEoNl7"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 12 lineup maintained enormously strong demand from consumers from January through March, according to the company’s fiscal Q2 earnings &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-reports-second-quarter-results%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F28%2F22407894%2Fapple-q2-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;posted today&lt;/a&gt;. Apple reported record March quarter revenue of $89.6 billion, up 54 percent year over year. The iPhone took in just under $48 billion, jumping up by 66 percent from a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eusbyT"&gt;Sales of Mac and iPad hardware also surged for yet another quarter, up 70 and 78 percent respectively, due in part to continued remote work and schooling necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. That success might slow down as some regions of the world return to a sense of normalcy, so most eyes — as usual — are on the iPhone. It’s been reported that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;iPhone 12 mini isn’t doing as well as Apple hoped&lt;/a&gt;, but other models are clearly hits with consumers. “This family of devices is popular with both upgrades and new customers alike,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the afternoon earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9tiF6"&gt;These Q2 earnings follow a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252663/apple-q1-2021-earnings-iphone-12-mac-sales"&gt;historic, blowout December quarter&lt;/a&gt; for Apple that saw the company surpass $100 billion in revenue for the first time in its history. But now focus has shifted to how Apple will perform in the second half of the year and whether the iPhone 12 devices, Apple’s first to offer 5G data, have indeed sparked the huge upgrade cycle that some analysts had thought was likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJ4THr"&gt;Just last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;Apple held its first event of 2021&lt;/a&gt; and introduced new products including a purple iPhone 12, a redesigned iMac powered by the M1 chip, updated iPad Pro tablets, a faster Apple TV 4K streaming box, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;long-rumored AirTag item tracker&lt;/a&gt;. The iPhone and AirTags go on sale April 30th, which is when Apple will begin taking preorders for its other newly announced hardware. An all-new MacBook Pro is expected to follow in the coming weeks — likely at Apple’s WWDC keynote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlbgdn"&gt;Apple’s fiscal second quarter earnings come with a legal backdrop: the company faces an imminent courtroom battle with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic Games. Depositions from both companies have already been filed, and senior executives are expected to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22405894/epic-apple-store-fortnite-trial-kickoff-witnesses-list"&gt;provide extensive testimony starting next week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbaNaY"&gt;Even with Apple’s services business — up to a record-high $16.9 billion from $13.3 billion in the year-ago quarter — and hardware on such an upward trajectory, investors and consumers continue to await the next major device that will push the company into a new product category. Rumors have long suggested that AR and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;VR headsets&lt;/a&gt; are in Apple’s future; software boss Craig Federighi recently &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/joanna-stern-personal-technology/exclusive-apple-software-chief-explains-ios-145-app-tracking-defends-companys-reach/57D138E3-3677-4A78-9534-62DAD443FE97"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s Joanna Stern&lt;/a&gt; that mixed reality tech “deserves exploration.” In an earlier interview with Kara Swisher, CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;described AR as “critically important” to Apple’s future&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNSpTM"&gt;And then there are the long-running reports of an eventual Apple-made electric car; back in February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/7/22271748/hyundai-apple-car-talks-stopped-report"&gt;Nissan and Hyundai both downplayed discussions&lt;/a&gt; the automakers were rumored to have held with Apple on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wJHt8i"&gt;The upcoming ad-supported tier is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327217/hbo-max-ad-supported-tier-launch-date-international-price-subscriber-growth"&gt;still set to launch in June&lt;/a&gt; and will feature a few major differences from the $15 per month plan — including access to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;WarnerMedia’s same-day theatrical release strategy&lt;/a&gt; for films like &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Matrix 4&lt;/em&gt;, which will be limited to subscribers to HBO Max’s more premium tier. WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar has also confirmed in a March analyst event that HBO original shows won’t get ads added in, so customers won’t have to worry about &lt;em&gt;Euphoria&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;getting interrupted by commercials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5gQoxy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;HBO, for less&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m8nakF"&gt;The $9.99 price tag would mark a new low price for access to HBO’s content, undercutting the $14.99 per month that WarnerMedia has charged for the service for years (whether purchased through cable companies or as a standalone streaming service).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRq298"&gt;It also would allow for HBO Max — which, at $14.99 per month, is currently one of the most expensive streaming services — to better compete with or even undercut competitors like Disney Plus ($7.99 per month) or Netflix (which starts at $8.99 per month but offers pricier $13.99 and $17.99 per month plans, too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uR10PM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A fired Amazon worker is trying to unionize four NYC-area facilities</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GMMI60"&gt;Amazon workers at four different facilities near Staten Island have begun the process of unionizing with the &lt;a href="https://amazonlaborunion.org/"&gt;Amazon Labor Union&lt;/a&gt;. The organizing effort is being led by Christian Smalls, a former warehouse worker who was fired in March after organizing a walkout to protest unsafe working conditions during the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/amazon-labor-union-staten-island"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BWGEe"&gt;The company has responded by posting anti-union messages on TV screens at JFK8, the fulfillment center where Smalls used to work. “KNOW THE FACTS BEFORE YOU SIGN A UNION CARD,” reads one of the messages &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvzx7v/amazon-launches-another-union-busting-campaign"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “If someone asks you to provide your personal information or sign a union card, do not release your personal information without knowing all the facts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fojuUz"&gt;Several hundred workers at JFK8 have already signed cards in support of the union, Smalls told &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;. In total, the warehouse employs roughly 5,000 workers. The union could present the cards to Amazon as early as June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpOjxz"&gt;The effort comes on the heels of a bitter defeat for Amazon organizers in Alabama. Earlier this month, warehouse workers in Bessemer voted against unionizing with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), although the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"&gt;organization is currently contesting the results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yVM9p"&gt;After Smalls was fired, he filed a class action lawsuit against Amazon (the case is ongoing). He also created the Congress of Essential Workers, which grew into the Amazon Labor Union, according to &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1tqp3"&gt;The Amazon Labor Union isn’t affiliated with a national group like the RWDSU, which could complicate the high-stakes unionizing effort. Typically, unions like RWDSU provide much-needed resources and experience to employees trying to organize their workplace. For now, most of that work is being done by Smalls and the various organizations he founded since leaving the company. The group has also &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-the-amazon-labor-union?utm_campaign=p_cp_url&amp;amp;utm_medium=os&amp;amp;utm_source=customer"&gt;set up a GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; to cover organizing expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGVuYp"&gt;Smalls told &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; that he thinks independence will be helpful. “We have nothing to compare ourselves to,” he said. “That puts us at an advantage. Workers can’t say we already tried it and failed. When talking to workers, we can say this is us creating this together as workers of Amazon. We’re all in this together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vaLnrh"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
