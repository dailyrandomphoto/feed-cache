    <title>Apple will now let you add virtual lasers and confetti to your Clips videos</title>

  &lt;p id="0bKlTv"&gt;Apple now lets you add augmented-reality lasers, confetti, and more to your Clips videos, thanks to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fclips-adds-immersive-new-arspaces%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22404413%2Fapple-ar-lidar-clips-video-effects-sparkle-lasers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an update to the short-form video app&lt;/a&gt;. The feature, called AR Spaces, will let users with LIDAR-equipped Apple devices (so far, that’s the iPhone 12 Pros and iPad Pros from 2020 or later) add room-filling effects that can interact with walls and floors. (If you watched Apple’s April 20th event, you may have spotted &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/JdBYVNuky1M?t=2697"&gt;a brief look at the update&lt;/a&gt; ahead of today’s release.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7C22qp"&gt;You can get an idea of what this will look like in action with this GIF taken from Apple’s demo video. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wy6r-Dc-R5X2JAdmGgL-9cg-pCM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471539/apple_clips_ar.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Prism and Dance Floor effects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QOP8L0"&gt;Apple says that the AR Spaces effects should work with the other effects built in to Clips, such as the animated stickers and emoji, if you want to add even more to your videos. The update to the app can be downloaded now from the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XK2MkR"&gt;The Clips update is Apple’s latest experiment with AR, in which the company has a keen interest. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22278780/apple-augmented-reality-ar-app-for-all-mankind-tv-plus"&gt;released an AR experience tie-in&lt;/a&gt; for its show &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind &lt;/em&gt;in February, and CEO Tim Cook discussed some of his thoughts about AR tech in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;an interview earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. There are also rumors that Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;working on a full-fledged AR / VR headset&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California will be able to set its own tailpipe standards again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SFChronicleVirusTraffic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JuFCSiEB-QqJKXfppadObyUmu08=/0x1:5043x3363/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69189535/1312394406.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lKXzOt"&gt;California is on track to regain its power to set tougher vehicle emissions standards than the rest of the US. The Environmental Protection Agency announced today that it’s reconsidering a Donald &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872304/trump-california-emissions-pollution-rollback-waiver-clean-air-act"&gt;Trump-era edict&lt;/a&gt; that sought to strip California of that ability. The EPA plans to rescind the Trump decision altogether after a public comment period ends on July 6th, the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2021-04-26/epa-california-emissions-waiver-reversing-trump?utm_id=28019&amp;amp;sfmc_id=765815"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Last week, the Department of Transportation &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/cafe_preemption_nprm_04222021_1.pdf"&gt;moved&lt;/a&gt; to repeal a related Trump-era rule that barred individual states from setting their own tailpipe standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="5mN4kb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;California has essentially set the tone for the country&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HEzeDu"&gt;California has been able to set its own tailpipe standards since it was granted a waiver under the 1970 Clean Air Act. At the time, the Golden State was grappling with an air quality crisis that it sought to solve, in part, with tougher standards for tailpipe pollution. Since then, California has essentially set the tone for the country. In order to sell in California, the nation’s biggest auto market, automakers have had to adhere to the state’s stricter standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TB5ux"&gt;“I am a firm believer in California’s long-standing statutory authority to lead. The 2019 decision to revoke the state’s waiver to enforce its greenhouse gas pollution standards for cars and trucks was legally dubious and an attack on the public’s health and wellbeing,”  EPA Administrator Michael Regan &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-reconsiders-previous-administrations-withdrawal-californias-waiver-enforce"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a statement today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdmZjs"&gt;Former President Trump sought to take away California’s Clean Air Act waiver and weaken fuel efficiency and emissions standards. While the Obama administration sought to increase average fuel efficiency by 5 percent each year between 2021 and 2026, the Trump administration lowered that standard to a 1.5 percent annual increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qZTrOT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, and BMW all struck a deal with California&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MBhTTI"&gt;But Trump faced opposition &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272179/attorneys-general-sue-trump-administration-fuel-efficiency-standard-rollback"&gt;in court&lt;/a&gt; and, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611607/gm-trump-california-car-emission-pollution-biden-fuel-efficiency-standards"&gt;increasingly&lt;/a&gt;, from automakers. Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, and BMW all struck a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20727261/trump-emissions-rollback-ford-volkswagon-honda-bmw-california-deal"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; with California in 2019 to increase fuel efficiency and cut emissions regardless of whatever weaker&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;federal standards the Trump administration set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ntFsw"&gt;So California never fully lost its outsize influence over the auto industry. But with its legal authority to set separate standards fully restored, the state will have an even bigger voice as the Biden administration considers new federal standards &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/04/22/transportation-climate-change/"&gt;expected in July&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmD1Om"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New White House task force will look for ways to boost union organizing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks On Gun Violence Prevention From White House Rose Garden" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S0DF0NXbrAB-ZIRkdupXko0qIfk=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69189523/1311488967.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alex Wong / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OupgVV"&gt;President Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/04/26/executive-order-on-worker-organizing-and-empowerment/"&gt;issued an executive order today&lt;/a&gt; to create a new labor task force in support of worker organizing in the United States. The effort will be led by Vice President Kamala Harris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8vxII"&gt;“Despite the importance of unions to our economy and democracy, and nearly 60 million workers today saying they would join a union if given the chance, American workers have faced increasing barriers to organizing and bargaining collectively with their employers,” the order reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFfBXH"&gt;The task force, which includes a long list of cabinet members and policy advisers, will make recommendations on how the federal government can help workers organize and join unions. This could include helping contractors in industries that have been difficult to organize, such as the so-called gig economy, &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/26/fact-sheet-executive-order-establishing-the-white-house-task-force-on-worker-organizing-and-empowerment/"&gt;according to a White House fact sheet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cI4cVn"&gt;The move comes after decades of declining union membership. In 2020, just 10.8 percent of the US workforce was unionized, down from more than 30 percent in the 1950s, according to the White House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHkiEh"&gt;In the executive order, Biden wrote that this decline has led to a “host of negative consequences for American workers and the economy, including weakening and shrinking America’s middle class.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmePON"&gt;The task force can’t create new policies or pass laws, so the immediate effect of the executive order will be minimal. But the new group could help to spur President Biden to take stronger action in support of collective bargaining. Already, the White House has voiced its support for the Protecting the Rights to Organize Act, which would strengthen organizing protections. The bill is currently awaiting a vote in the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66D5z3"&gt;The task force now has 180 days to come up with policy recommendations to increase union membership in the public and private sectors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DaKnxQ"&gt;President Biden has been a vocal supporter of the labor movement, a break from previous Democratic presidents who were more measured in their support. In February, the President publicly voiced support for Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama, who were in the middle of a closely watched union drive. Workers eventually voted against unionizing, though the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"&gt;is contesting the result&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin protests NASA’s $2.9 billion SpaceX contract</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos gives an update on their progress and share their vision of going to space to benefit Earth." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V8Qa4okClzgbjrP9CpX28dR_Tyk=/0x0:4966x3311/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69189436/1183345648.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xR9hpq"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin is protesting NASA’s decision to award SpaceX $2.9 billion for a pair of missions to land on the Moon by 2024. NASA’s Human Landing System program, which funded development of three rival lunar lander prototypes (including Blue Origin’s), was expected to pick two of those landers in April. But NASA opted for just one — SpaceX’s Starship — because of short funding from Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHup6y"&gt;The 175-page Blue Origin protest was filed with the Government Accountability Office less than two weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;NASA’s selection of SpaceX&lt;/a&gt;. Blue Origin has been developing its Blue Moon lunar lander with a “National Team” of established space and defense contractors: Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, and Draper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yrzRa"&gt;“NASA has executed a flawed acquisition for the Human Landing System program and moved the goalposts at the last minute,” Blue Origin said in a statement released on Monday. “In NASA’s own words, it has made a ‘high risk’ selection. Their decision eliminates opportunities for competition, significantly narrows the supply base, and not only delays, but also endangers America’s return to the Moon. Because of that, we’ve filed a protest with the GAO.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vqsqOM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Capcom will now give you a week to play Resident Evil Village’s final demo instead of just a day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wmknH1ILtqXexISULKMoIs-LMAA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69189352/EsRryLBXIAAE_Yd.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Capcom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rWoiFf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242218/resident-evil-8-village-release-date-trailer-ps5-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is nearly here, and Capcom is giving you more time to play a piece of it ahead of launch. The studio originally announced that players on Xbox, Playstation, and PC would have access to a 60-minute demo this weekend for just 24 hours, but after &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evils-time-limited-demos-are-the-dumbest-shit-1846716385"&gt;fan criticism&lt;/a&gt;, Capcom has extended the demo’s availability to a full week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HA3TDo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt;’s final demo will still unlock on May 1st at 8PM ET in North America, but availability will now end on May 9th at 8PM ET, a two-day overlap with the game’s full release on May 7th. Capcom announced the change along with extended time frames for both the United Kingdom and Europe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1386697010686930951?s=20"&gt;on the game’s Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. Playtime for the demo will still be limited to an hour, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NO34SB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We've heard your feedback and are extending the availability period for the final 60-minute multi-platform &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/REVillage?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#REVillage&lt;/a&gt; demo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The original 24-hour window starting 5PM PDT May 1 (1AM BST May 2) has been increased by a week, and now ends at the same times on May 9 PDT (May 10 BST). &lt;a href="https://t.co/8VKEU8bMnu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8VKEU8bMnu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1386697010686930951?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tATZzf"&gt;The final demo will let you play two sections of the game: the eponymous village and Castle Dimitrescu, home of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261405/resident-evil-village-tall-lady-dimitrescu-height"&gt;the tall vampire lady&lt;/a&gt; everyone knows and loves. PlayStation owners had just a few hours to check out the village and then the castle sections in 30-minute chunks over the past two weekends, but on May 1st, players on PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Stadia will all have a week to play through both sections of the game, as long as they do so within 60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TV6QDD"&gt;This demo follows the first from January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243367/resident-evil-village-maiden-demo-available-now-ps5-playstation-5"&gt;titled “Maiden,”&lt;/a&gt; which featured an unnamed protagonist rather than &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt;’s main character, Ethan Winters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QiYYJm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FH0eL_I_l0g?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=26&amp;amp;start=26" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lsli4r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; launches on Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC, and Stadia on May 7th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota is buying Lyft’s autonomous car division for $550 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7hwKBdlljzK2FLfR4_4XfSOUVlY=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69189221/BP9I1393_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PjlVaj"&gt;Lyft is selling its autonomous vehicle division to a subsidiary of Toyota — the latest in a series of acquisitions that is seeing the world of self-driving cars grow increasingly smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tNnE8V"&gt;Woven Planet Holdings, a subsidiary of Toyota, will acquire Lyft’s self-driving division, Level 5, for $550 million in cash — $200 million of which was provided to Lyft up front. The rest of the money, $350 million, will be paid out to Lyft over five years. The ride-hailing company says it will see an annual savings of $100 million of non-GAAP expenses, which it claims will better position it to ultimately earn a profit. Toyota has also agreed to use Lyft’s fleet data and platform for any commercial service it eventually launches under its Woven Planet subsidiary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5osbv"&gt;The deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021, brings to an end Lyft’s four-year journey toward developing and deploying its own self-driving cars. The company follows its rival Uber in off-loading its costly autonomous vehicle division in a bid to stop losing so much money. Last year, Uber sold its AV project to Aurora, a startup founded by the former head of Google’s self-driving project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sibzqE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The deal brings to an end Lyft’s four-year journey toward developing and deploying its own self-driving cars&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="adTXI6"&gt;Of course, Lyft did not experience the tragedy of overseeing a self-driving car killing a pedestrian as Uber did in 2018. Rather, Lyft’s project was small-scale but productive. It mostly consisted of a pilot project in Las Vegas with Aptiv using self-driving cars with safety drivers to conduct tens of thousands of taxi trips. That project is now being overseen by Motional, Aptiv’s joint venture with Hyundai, and Lyft is involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iujZj4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/21/16005636/lyft-self-driving-car-technology-hardware-software"&gt;Lyft launched its Level 5 division in 2017&lt;/a&gt; with the bold claim that by 2021, “a majority” of its rides would take place in autonomous vehicles. The company hired hundreds of engineers to staff a 50,000-square-foot facility in Palo Alto, California. A year later, Lyft acquired the UK-based augmented reality startup Blue Vision Labs for a reported $72 million in the hopes of accelerating its efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PL4dTH"&gt;But the prediction that most of Lyft’s rides would take place in AVs never came to pass. In fact, despite some technical successes, autonomous vehicles remain very far away from any kind of mass adoption. Most AVs on the road today are still test vehicles, with most of the major players refusing to commit to a timeline for commercialization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V5qnvD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota, meanwhile, has largely kept its self-driving car tinkering quiet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t2uUE8"&gt;Toyota, meanwhile, has largely kept its self-driving car tinkering quiet. The Japanese company, which is the largest automaker in the world, has released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166854/toyota-self-driving-car-test-vehicle-ces-2019"&gt;some information about its test vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16849422/toyota-self-driving-car-platform-3-lexus-lidar"&gt;types of sensors&lt;/a&gt; it’s using, but we’ve seen very little of the cars in operation. Toyota was planning to offer a limited ride-hailing pilot in downtown Tokyo during the 2020 Summer Olympics, but that was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The automaker also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152817/toyota-pony-ai-self-driving-car-investment-valuation-china-silicon-valley"&gt;recently invested $400 million in Pony.ai&lt;/a&gt;, a self-driving startup based in the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nk44VQ"&gt;Toyota has developed a self-driving software called “Chauffeur,” which ironically was also the codename for Google’s self-driving project under Chris Urmson, now the CEO of Aurora. Toyota has a second product called “Guardian,” which is essentially an advanced driver-assist system akin to Tesla’s Autopilot. Neither is being offered in any production car today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UZj2d"&gt;Toyota Research Institute, the automaker’s Silicon Valley-based division, has been conducting tests at its Ottawa Lake, Michigan, closed-course facility for a number of years. In 2018, Toyota agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17787878/toyota-uber-investment-self-driving-car-research"&gt;invest $500 million in a joint self-driving project with Uber&lt;/a&gt;, but that investment is now moot as Aurora owns what’s left of Uber’s AV division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZC9Ogg"&gt;Last year, Toyota broke ground on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21052324/toyota-woven-city-japan-bjarke-ingels-ces-2020"&gt;“Woven City,”&lt;/a&gt; the 175-acre site of a former car factory in Japan. The automaker hopes to transform it into a “prototype city of the future” where it can test autonomous vehicles, innovative street design, smart home technology, robotics, and new mobility products on a population of real people who would live there full time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldeL5B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNgmcA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla turns a record profit despite new Model S and Model X delay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Model Y " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l7DBsVvQRYsXKzilaChB9J20ScQ=/418x0:3582x2109/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69188993/0x0_Model_Y_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eZPwAT"&gt;Tesla has drawn a lot of scrutiny lately, has run into delays with the refreshed Model S and Model X, and the auto industry is struggling through a global shortage of semiconductors. But none of those things seemed to have much effect on Tesla’s business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyBR0j"&gt;On Monday, the Silicon Valley automaker &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471586/TSLA_Q1_2021_Update.pdf"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its best-ever start to a year, despite not making a single Model S sedan or Model X SUV. That’s thanks in large part to the fact that Tesla continues to increase the number of Model 3s and Model Ys it makes and sells out of its year-old factory in Shanghai, China, validating CEO Elon Musk’s long-standing goal of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/11/30/18118451/tesla-gigafactory-nevada-video-elon-musk-jobs-model-3"&gt;localizing production in the world’s biggest markets for electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLgQlC"&gt;As a result, Tesla generated $10.4 billion in sales the first quarter, and recorded a $438 million profit. That’s basically double the revenue it generated in the first quarter of 2020, when Tesla had to temporarily shut down its factory in China due to the earliest outbreaks of the coronavirus. It’s also the most profit Tesla’s ever made in a quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gLOAcB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A record first quarter despite shutting down Model S and Model X production&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="shT2R8"&gt;This is the seventh quarter in a row that Tesla has turned a profit, though the company was once again buoyed by selling emissions credits to other automakers. Tesla said Monday that it sold a record $518 million worth of regulatory credits, meaning that it would’ve finished the quarter in the red without them. Tesla presented the growth of regulatory credit sales as a positive in the presentation it published Monday. But many close followers of Tesla have been waiting for the moment when it’s able to turn a profit based on the products it sells. This was not that moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytUDDM"&gt;Tesla also says it made about $101 million on the sale of bitcoin in the first quarter. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272103/tesla-bitcoin-investment-1-5-billion-cryptocurrency-payments"&gt;announced in January that it had bought $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; and started allowing customers to pay for cars using bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rOpHvI"&gt;
&lt;div id="datawrapper-rDVri" data-analytics-viewport="datawrapper" data-iframe-fallback="https://img.datawrapper.de/rDVri/full.png" data-iframe-fallback-width="600" data-iframe-fallback-height="600" data-iframe-fallback-alt="(billions in USD; green indicates profitable quarter)" data-iframe="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rDVri/1/" data-iframe-width="600" data-iframe-height="600" data-iframe-layout="responsive" data-iframe-title="Tesla's quarterly revenue and profit/loss " data-iframe-resizable=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&amp;&amp;(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){var i=document.createElement("iframe");var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-rDVri");var t=e.dataset.iframeTitle||'Interactive graphic';i.setAttribute("src",e.dataset.iframe);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("frameborder","0");i.setAttribute("scrolling","no");i.setAttribute("aria-label",e.dataset.iframeFallbackAlt||t);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("height","400");i.setAttribute("id","datawrapper-chart-rDVri");i.style.minWidth="100%";i.style.border="none";e.appendChild(i)})}()&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R5Ll4z"&gt;This all comes at a time when Tesla is facing renewed scrutiny over the safeguards, or lack thereof, that govern the use of its Autopilot advanced driver assistance feature following a fatal crash in Texas. It’s still unclear whether Autopilot was involved in that crash, which killed two men. Even if it was, it’s very possible that the feature was misused due to early police reports that there was no one in the driver’s seat — something the company warns its customers against. But Musk’s brief claims about Tesla’s ability to stop people from misusing Autopilot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397546/tesla-autopilot-consumer-report-test-no-driver"&gt;have some obvious holes&lt;/a&gt;, federal safety investigators are now digging into what happened, and the crash &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397826/tesla-autopilot-investigation-blumenthal-markey-nhtsa-ntsb"&gt;has the attention&lt;/a&gt; of multiple &lt;a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/transportation/article/Brady-urges-Tesla-to-cooperate-with-federal-crash-16124407.php"&gt;lawmakers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQOXaT"&gt;The global chip shortage, meanwhile, has not hit Tesla as hard as it has some other automakers. The company said Monday that it was “able to navigate through global chip supply shortage issues in part by pivoting extremely quickly to new microcontrollers, while simultaneously developing firmware for new chips made by new suppliers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TjaWWK"&gt;Tesla didn’t make any Model S sedans or Model X SUVs in the first quarter because the company has been readying redesigned versions of each electric vehicle, which were announced in January. Those refreshed vehicles were supposed to start shipping in March, and Musk even said at the time that they would start coming off the line in February. But the company has either run into an issue retooling the production lines at its Fremont, California factory where the Model S and Model X are made, or something else is going on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TboQuU"&gt;Tesla did say Monday that the “[f]irst deliveries of the new Model S should start very shortly,” but didn’t specify what that means, or give any update on the refreshed Model X. The company’s website currently pegs the earliest deliveries for the Model S happening in June, while the Model X apparently won’t get to customers until at least October. Tesla said Monday that it took about a $200 million hit as a result of the delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KP9rTV"&gt;
&lt;div id="datawrapper-7F0ff" data-analytics-viewport="datawrapper" data-iframe-fallback="https://img.datawrapper.de/7F0ff/full.png" data-iframe-fallback-width="600" data-iframe-fallback-height="600" data-iframe-fallback-alt="" data-iframe="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7F0ff/1/" data-iframe-width="600" data-iframe-height="600" data-iframe-layout="responsive" data-iframe-title="Tesla production / deliveries through Q1 2021" data-iframe-resizable=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&amp;&amp;(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){var i=document.createElement("iframe");var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-7F0ff");var t=e.dataset.iframeTitle||'Interactive graphic';i.setAttribute("src",e.dataset.iframe);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("frameborder","0");i.setAttribute("scrolling","no");i.setAttribute("aria-label",e.dataset.iframeFallbackAlt||t);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("height","400");i.setAttribute("id","datawrapper-chart-7F0ff");i.style.minWidth="100%";i.style.border="none";e.appendChild(i)})}()&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8cePLH"&gt;That Tesla had a strong quarter despite this delay is a testament to the importance of the new factory in China, as well as the general popularity of the Model 3 and Model Y. But while delays are nothing new in the world of Tesla, the company is, for now, leaving money on the table here, as the Model S and Model X generate more profit per car sold and the new versions are even more expensive. To wit, Tesla shared in January that the average selling price for all its cars dropped 11 percent in 2020 compared to 2019 because of the higher mix of Model 3 and Model Y sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sIXrA"&gt;Tesla said the average selling price declined even further in the first quarter, but that it actually increased the amount of money it’s making on each of those cars because it continues to cut the costs associated with making them. “Reducing the average cost of the vehicles we produce is essential to our mission,” the company wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9Gv3X"&gt;Things should only get better for Tesla, too. The company said it has nearly maxed out capacity at its California factory, but told investors that it expects to be able to continue increasing production each quarter in China. Tesla said it still plans to be able to start making vehicles at the factory it’s building in Berlin, Germany by the end of this year. And it has started installing some equipment at the factory it’s building in Austin, Texas. Tesla said it still expects to start making deliveries out of that factory by the end of 2021, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9x16M"&gt;“We think Model Y will be the best selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world,” Musk said on a call with investors Monday evening. “Probably next year. I’m not 100 percent certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely.. more likely than not, that 2022 Model Y is best selling car or truck... in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRp5jS"&gt;Tesla also continues to slowly build up the energy generation and storage part of its business, too. The company deployed 92MW of solar panels and solar roof tiles in the first quarter, the most in more than two years. The company finished the quarter with $494 million in sales of energy generation and storage products — up big from $293 million in the first quarter of 2020, and even more than it sold in the second quarter last year ($370 million). The company is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380057/tesla-solar-roof-price-increase-contract-amount"&gt;increasing prices for people who are waiting to have its solar roof tiles installed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy2ivO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change Siri’s voice in iOS 14.5 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wFsYk_I7SRkTLJ2YqLOOcBYLeUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067730/akrales_190522_3444_0017.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvbuiG"&gt;Until recently, the default voice for Apple’s Siri assistant has been stereotypically female-sounding. However, studies have found that having AI assistants default to female-sounding voices can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634322/amazon-alexa-apple-siri-female-voice-assistants-harmful-gender-stereotypes-new-study"&gt;reinforce harmful stereotypes&lt;/a&gt;, so Apple has tried to fix that in its upcoming iOS 14.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KGYdg"&gt;Starting with iOS 14.5, when you get a new phone, you’ll be prompted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;pick a default voice for Siri&lt;/a&gt; — and Apple is including two new voice options. But if you’ve updated your current phone to 14.5, you don’t have to wait. This guide will show you how to change the voice after setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhB1LI"&gt;It’s a reasonably simple process. First, go to the Settings app, then to Siri &amp;amp; Search, and tap Siri Voice. There, you’ll be presented with the list of options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/583JirAdCoNcghR8xipu6St_0-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416486/Image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap Siri Voice to be taken to the list of options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mph8AS"&gt;At the moment, the American variety is the only one with four voice choices; Australian, British, Indian, Irish, and South African versions only have two. The four US voice choices are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yS4oPO"&gt;Voice 1, which is a soft-spoken male-sounding voice &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="swUqtC"&gt;Voice 2, an energetic, confident female-sounding voice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l6YrCC"&gt;Voice 3 is similar to Voice 2 but male-sounding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OtUBen"&gt;And finally, Voice 4, which is similar to the default Siri voice that’s been around all these years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="tZcBH0"&gt;If you want to hear what the voices sound like for yourself, they’re in the embedded tweet below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u8ZG9v"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Siri's new voice options in the latest iOS 14.5 Beta &lt;a href="https://t.co/25pUA8kP7V"&gt;pic.twitter.com/25pUA8kP7V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1378024607962128384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P5h6cp"&gt;Tapping on a voice will play a snippet of it saying “Hi, I’m Siri. Choose the voice you’d like me to use.” If you choose voices 1–3, your phone will have to download them before you can use them, but you don’t have to stay in the Settings app while it does so. Once it’s finished downloading, Siri will respond with your chosen voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlKF9C"&gt;If you’ve just updated to macOS 11.3, you can also select from the new options by going to System Preferences, then Siri. From there, you can choose the voice you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BwMin9n3CbGzKfr5iRfznvl8qdc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471503/Screen_Shot_2021_04_26_at_1.02.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Siri voices have come to macOS as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>The macOS 11.3 update includes a massive security patch and new emoji</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q3HA91"&gt;Apple has just released macOS 11.3, alongside iOS 14.5. It’s probably worth updating your Mac to it as soon as you can — not only because it comes with some new features, including improvements for running iPhone and iPad apps on M1 Macs and updates to Apple Music and Podcasts, but it also fixes a major security flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RgAIa"&gt;The update &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-macos-113-patches-security-flaw-vulnerability/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Mashable+%28Mashable%29"&gt;reportedly patches a vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; that allowed malware to bypass many of macOS’s built-in protections, like File Quarantine and GateKeeper’s opening dialog box. While Apple’s built-in anti-malware system could &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/shlayer-mac-malware-macos-security/"&gt;still block malicious programs if Apple were aware of them&lt;/a&gt;, enterprise software company Jamf did find evidence that the security flaw &lt;a href="https://www.jamf.com/blog/shlayer-malware-abusing-gatekeeper-bypass-on-macos/"&gt;was being exploited by attackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sd3MC7"&gt;Apple also &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212325"&gt;details a slew of other security fixes&lt;/a&gt; that are included with the latest update on its security update page. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222"&gt;Catalina and Mojave&lt;/a&gt; have received security patches as well, for those who haven’t yet updated to Big Sur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sqa92"&gt;Aside from security updates, one of the biggest new improvements in 11.3 (at least for owners of M1 Macs) is the ability to resize iPhone and iPad app windows. Apple’s also added keyboard, mouse, and trackpad support for games that are compatible with controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The infinity symbol in the queue controls the Autoplay feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="adDieb"&gt;Apple has also added autoplay to the Music app — a feature which is either great or annoying depending on your mood. After you reach the end of a song or playlist, Apple Music will continue playing music that it thinks is similar (thankfully, it can be turned off if you’re just looking to listen to one specific song). The News and Podcasts apps also have redesigned pages to make them easier to use (with the former getting a reworked search feature — something that’s exciting to me, and possibly no one else).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHAOre"&gt;The update also adds many of the features that are in iOS 14.5: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;ability to track AirTags&lt;/a&gt; using the Find My app, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285963/apple-emoji-ios-14-5-smiley-faces-hearts-more-skin-tones"&gt;new emoji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;Siri voices&lt;/a&gt;, and support for the Xbox Series X / S and PlayStation 5 DualSense controllers. You can visit Apple’s site to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211896"&gt;see the entire list of updates and features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: You can apparently still lose jobs and get arrested for an overdue VHS rental </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nt_t7gEnm3_yNiqr6sNeyh50sEg=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69188730/the_verge_vhs_3_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gQcTD1"&gt;Ever mysteriously lost a job opportunity? Did they treat you like a criminal? Better check to see if your family forgot to return a VHS tape 22 years ago! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qelH6"&gt;As utterly ridiculous as that sounds, it’s apparently &lt;a href="https://okcfox.com/news/local/oklahoma-woman-charged-with-felony-for-not-returning-vhs-tape-21-years-ago"&gt;the true story&lt;/a&gt; of Texas woman Caron McBride, who had a warrant out for her arrest in Oklahoma for felony embezzlement — all because a movie store thought she rented a copy of &lt;em&gt;Sabrina and the Teenage Witch&lt;/em&gt; in 1999 and never bothered to bring it back. Never mind that the store in question (“Movie Place”) closed in 2008, or that VHS is such a dated tech that even the last Japanese manufacturer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/7/21/12244094/japan-stops-vcr-production-funai"&gt;finally stopped producing the players&lt;/a&gt; five years back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDfnF1"&gt;McBride &lt;a href="https://okcfox.com/news/local/oklahoma-woman-charged-with-felony-for-not-returning-vhs-tape-21-years-ago"&gt;told local Fox News affiliate KOKH&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/woman-hit-with-embezzlement-charges-for-20-year-old-ove-1846764009"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that she had no idea this tape even existed and never would have picked it — “just not my cup of tea” — but thinks maybe a man she used to live with at the time could have rented it for his two kids. She only found out about the out-of-state warrant when she tried to change the name on her driver’s license after getting married in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3jcqp"&gt;“She told me it was over the VHS tape and I had to make her repeat it because I thought, this is insane. This girl is kidding me, right? She wasn’t kidding,” McBride told KOKH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8wYPAJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The last Blockbuster: what we really lose when video stores shut down","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/29/17788212/blockbuster-last-video-store-bend-oregon-movie-selection-algorithm-discovery-netflix-hulu-amazon"},{"title":"How to make digital copies of your VHS tapes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/21/18660239/vhs-tapes-digital-copies-how-to-make"},{"title":"These VHS covers for current movies and shows make us nostalgic for the present","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/2/8332885/vhs-covers-boxes-80s-breaking-bad-game-of-thrones"},{"title":"The Internet Archive’s VHS Vault will send you on a 90s nostalgia trip","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/2/28/21158457/internet-archive-vhs-vault-tapes-shows-recordings"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WCKhNB"&gt;She also told the publication she’d been let go from several jobs over the past few years and suspects this was the reason: “When they ran my criminal background check, all they’re seeing is those two words: felony embezzlement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCwmAy"&gt;While the warrant has now reportedly been dropped and her record may soon be expunged, it wouldn’t have been totally surprising if she’d actually gotten arrested over the tape: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/25/11303546/man-arrested-freddy-got-fingered-vhs-overdue-tom-green"&gt;a man in North Carolina got arrested for an overdue VHS rental in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZYaiU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/us/caron-scarborough-davis-vhs-return-warrant.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;admirably reached out to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi8BwUh3XOk&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;the world’s last remaining Blockbuster video rental store&lt;/a&gt; for comment about McBride and got one: “We’ve definitely not sent out a warrant for anybody for that,” said manager Sandi Harding. “That’s a little bit crazy to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpMmJP"&gt;McBride’s plight reached the cast of &lt;em&gt;Sabrina&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;and the Teenage Witch &lt;/em&gt;after star Melissa Joan Hart shared it &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/COETyj0FNN4/"&gt;on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. You can read more cast members’ thoughts in the comments there.&lt;/p&gt;
