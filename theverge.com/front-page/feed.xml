    <title>OpenTable adds a new ‘verified’ tag for restaurants to check vaccine status</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CMalcUJWrvgjENHErHygBt87Q4U=/90x0:1167x718/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69732251/Screen_Shot_2021_08_16_at_12.24.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yASg7t"&gt;OpenTable is &lt;a href="https://blog.opentable.com/verify-diners/"&gt;adding a new feature&lt;/a&gt; that will let restaurants tag diners as “verified” for meeting entry requirements. The initial — and obvious — use of the verification feature will be for restaurants to log guests who are vaccinated for COVID-19, but the feature could also be used to do things like confirm a diner is of legal drinking age or other requirements for entry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuZmYS"&gt;The feature should be rolling out to restaurants later this month, and it aims to help make it easier for restaurant owners to better serve repeat customers, especially with cities like New York City &lt;a href="https://ny.eater.com/2021/8/16/22626847/proof-of-vaccination-indoor-dining-first-day-august-16-nyc"&gt;starting to roll out vaccination requirements&lt;/a&gt; for restaurants as the delta variant continues to rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yMVbRS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OpenTable wants to make things easier for repeat diners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bqxBgQ"&gt;The verification tag only applies to a single restaurant or restaurant group and doesn’t actually log any vaccination data or personal information. Actually checking the vaccine status of a diner will fall to the restaurant, in line with whatever policies a location has for vaccine requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DEDoJ"&gt;But in theory, the OpenTable system would allow for a diner to show proof of vaccination on their first visit, and then make future reservations easier. Since OpenTable isn’t extending the “verified” status between different restaurants, you’ll still have to meet that verification status at each new place you go (unless they’re operated by the same group), but it still could be a convenient feature for customers who frequent the same places often.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart is on the hunt for someone to develop cryptocurrency products</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inside A Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Location Ahead Of Black Friday" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5_aWQ6-_r4uY5PtGE0ZmSR8cUIg=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69732045/875075340.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gdtN6W"&gt;Walmart is looking to hire a new senior director to develop new digital currency products, possibly including cryptocurrency payments, according to &lt;a href="https://careers.walmart.com/us/jobs/WD704706-usa-senior-director-ii-corporate-development-and-integration"&gt;a listing on the company’s job site&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-16/walmart-seeks-a-crypto-expert-to-oversee-digital-currency-push?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The move mirrors a similar interest shown by Walmart’s sworn enemy Amazon, which wants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22591754/amazon-hiring-cryptocurrency-aws-payments-jassy"&gt;to hire someone&lt;/a&gt; to head up cryptocurrency products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Dj94o"&gt;The new Walmart senior director position will serve as the company’s “Cryptocurrency and Digital Currency Product Lead,” in charge of “developing the digital currency strategy and product roadmap.” Among other responsibilities, the listing says this new role will also be focused on “identify[ing] crypto related investment and partnerships,” suggesting Walmart might buy its way into preexisting cryptocurrency businesses as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PzklJG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Everyone’s playing with speculative digital assets&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8afUtu"&gt;This shouldn’t be too surprising. Even though Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595684/amazon-bitcoin-payments-denial"&gt;denied claims&lt;/a&gt; it was preparing to start accepting Bitcoin payments — while reiterating it’s interested in crypto — cryptocurrencies and the blockchain in general have had a bit of a moment during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CHUwo"&gt;Whether it’s the rise of blockchain-linked collectibles like NFTs (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;non-fungible tokens, remember them?&lt;/a&gt;) or major theater chains like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617594/amc-bitcoin-memestock-apple-google-pay"&gt;AMC deciding they’ll accept crypto payments&lt;/a&gt; to appeal to their new, very online audience, people seem very interested in playing with speculative digital assets. Walmart and Amazon might just be making sure their bases are covered, but a future where they do accept alternative payment methods also feels increasingly possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6rmWh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nJWeI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spin’s electric scooters are coming to Google Maps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Spin E Scooter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oQUjYKWLZ2OCF5wGGiOl0PFeT5c=/0x2:5016x3346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69731934/1219078283.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Horst Galuschka/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="azukfR"&gt;Google Maps users will be able to find and rent Spin’s electric scooters after the Ford-owned company announced a new global integration on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frYEaJ"&gt;Starting Sunday, anyone who uses Google Maps will be able to see the nearest available Spin e-bike or e-scooter in real time, including how long it will take to walk to the vehicle, as well as battery range and expected arrival time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c11d8S"&gt;But to pay for the scooter, unlock it, and take their ride, users will be redirected to Spin’s app. Google Maps users will be able to see Spin’s availability in 84 cities, campuses, and towns in Europe and North America, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="184vNn"&gt;“Our goal is really to make it just as convenient or even more convenient to get around with alternative transit, bikes, buses, scooters, public transportation, as it is to get around with the car,” Spin CEO Ben Bear told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And until you’re able to do that, you’re not going to really drive the mode shift that we’re all focused on in the micromobility industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SKfVMb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our goal is really to make it just as convenient or even more convenient to get around with alternative transit”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I0x1q3"&gt;Spin’s scooters will appear on Google Maps when users select the bicycle option after looking up directions to a specific location. They will also appear under the public transportation tab, Bear said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIK0cF"&gt;Spin is the latest e-scooter company to integrate its products into Google Maps. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/3/18248555/google-maps-lime-scooters-bikes-integration-expansion"&gt;Users have been able to find and rent Lime’s scooters since late 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the city, the popular navigation app also includes available bike-share, public transportation schedules, and fare information for using Uber and Lyft vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLZjVg"&gt;Alphabet — which owns Google — is an investor in Lime, having contributed to a $170 million investment in the scooter company in May 2020. As part of that deal, Lime acquired Uber’s bike and scooter-sharing company, Jump. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B2S-KgsiM4mkyOgJM3S6pBqKv_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785627/SF_GoogleMaps_Press.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HUMscP"&gt;The Google Maps integration will help level the playing field for Spin in terms of competition with its rivals, Bear said. “Whichever is the fastest, most convenient option is what’s going to surface first, right?” he said. “So it’s really done in a fair way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suwP0m"&gt;Spin, which was acquired by Ford for $100 million in 2018, has seen its own shake-ups. Earlier this summer, co-founder and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy/"&gt;CEO Derrick Ko stepped down&lt;/a&gt; to assume a strategic advisor role, while the company’s chief business officer, Ben Bear, became the new CEO. Spin announced plans to add electric bikes to its fleet of shared vehicles, while also expanding to multiple cities in the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmcRn9"&gt;Possibly spurring all this activity was a report that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/ford-is-said-to-weigh-exit-of-electric-scooter-unit-spin?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Ford was considering divesting itself from Spin&lt;/a&gt;, or perhaps merging the scooter sharing firm with a special purpose acquisition company, also known as a SPAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMH0qT"&gt;A spokesperson for Ford declined to comment on &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report regarding divestment, but since its publication, the automaker’s top executives have expressed confidence in Spin’s business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="um1TqY"&gt;“I’m excited about all we’ve accomplished under the leadership of Derrick, Zaizhuang, and Euwyn to advance micromobility solutions in our cities and as a capability for Ford,” said Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a recent statement. “They’ve built a terrific business, and we look forward to continued progress under Ben, who is strongly positioned to grow Spin and give more people the freedom to move and pursue their dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this deep dive on why US public health data systems couldn’t handle COVID-19</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Drive-Thru Covid-19 Testing Site As Biden Blasts Texas Governor For Surging Cases" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/szJgnyKdRlQmgHV9Qrr3g5PSWx4=/0x3:7228x4822/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69731912/1234463344.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5dTASv"&gt;Public health data systems in the United States are out of date, underfunded, and can’t communicate with each other. Those issues left states unable to keep track of COVID-19 spread, and during surges, many local health departments stopped contact tracing, according to a new investigation from &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NTc7U"&gt;The deep-dive look at the gaps in public health surveillance shows breakdowns at nearly every step in the process.  Labs that ran COVID-19 tests didn’t report data directly to health departments through electronic systems, instead using faxes or emails. Health departments used different systems to track different types of outbreaks and relied on programs that required laborious, manual entry. They couldn’t get information about cases through the system in time to intervene in outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXfCTG"&gt;The challenges were exacerbated during COVID-19 case surges, &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;investigation showed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="uDRovi"&gt;In Alabama, during surges, data systems crashed from an influx of cases hitting the system. In Vermont, more than 1,300 of Covid-19 lab results in December 2020 were received through fax, email or snail mail — not through the state’s electronic reporting system. In Washington state, labs were up to 10 days late reporting Covid-19 results during peak periods. In Wyoming, the state health department had to “deduplicate” thousands of records in its electronic system each month to ensure positive results were counted just once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Ahmv9N"&gt;The delays at the state level meant the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was sent inconsistent or delayed data. The federal agency had to build a program to scrape the states’ data sites for information, because they weren’t getting it from officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VxbYg"&gt;The shoddy surveillance systems were one reason the US wasn’t able to control the spread of COVID-19. “Because we did not have the kind of centralized intelligence to identify, test for and execute rapid containment, the U.S. missed our opportunity to contain the virus,” Charity Dean, California’s former assistant director of the Department of Public Health, told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFy4HU"&gt;Investment from the CARES Act could help modernize systems, but officials say it’s not enough. The problems that plagued health departments last year are still a problem today, officials are exhausted, and the delta surge is making things even harder to manage — much less fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmnsYp"&gt;Go read the full story &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/15/inside-americas-covid-data-gap-502565"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 to get easy perk resets to entice players back into Night City</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/otOG1G7KRNUx-5elWHIFzwCw3as=/48x0:1668x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69731887/screen_ripperdoc_clinic_en.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viktor, a character in &lt;/em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HwZOyo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; will let you more easily reset your character’s perks in the upcoming 1.3 patch, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/39089/whats-new-in-night-city-patch-1-3-development-insight"&gt;new blog post from developer CD Projekt Red&lt;/a&gt;. The new feature arrives ahead of the next-gen upgrade set to hit sometime this year and could be useful for anyone who wants to dive back into the game and switch up how their character plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vt8fyr"&gt;You can see the new feature in action in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I49IfNvapkY"&gt;a video from the developer&lt;/a&gt;, which shows that you’ll have to pay some in-game currency to reset your perks. You can already reset your perks, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/How_to_Reset_Perks"&gt;but it’s quite expensive to do so&lt;/a&gt; — this new option seems to be much more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dNwFzv"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I49IfNvapkY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9h9xE"&gt;It appears that the reset feature doesn’t let you switch up your attributes (the five main traits in the game’s skill tree that house the different perks) so it doesn’t seem like you’ll be able to entirely respec your character. But if you feel like you haven’t picked the right perks or just want to build your character differently, the reset feature seems like it will offer a cheaper way to mix things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HD7rqS"&gt;Patch 1.3 also looks to bring a welcome improvement to the mini map you see while driving. In the new update, the mini map &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fNsSBER4fE&amp;amp;t=43s"&gt;appears to be more zoomed out than it was before&lt;/a&gt;. I regularly careened past turns because they appeared with little warning on the map, so this change will hopefully make it easier to know where you need to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wlnQGC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I49IfNvapkY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TjgTz4"&gt;CD Projekt Red hasn’t shared a release date for patch 1.3, but the developer promises that a full list of 1.3 changes is “coming soon,” so perhaps the update is imminent. The studio has released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22239765/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-bug-fixes"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356546/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-2-bug-fixes-console-stadia"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;its troubled launch&lt;/a&gt;, and the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/37298/our-commitment"&gt;latest roadmap&lt;/a&gt; (last updated July 1st) indicates that free DLCs and a free next-gen console update are scheduled to be released sometime this year. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="abCK1C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boyfriend Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; is getting an update, but not to its gameplay.

The developer says that right now the warning, “inadequately describes the events of stalking and emotional manipulation that exist in the story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="10Uef7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The content warning for Boyfriend Dungeon inadequately describes the events of stalking and emotional manipulation that exist in the story. We'll update the game next week with a more accurate CW. We apologize for any hurt inflicted by our mistake. Thank you for playing!&lt;/p&gt;— Kitfox Games   BOYFRIEND DUNGEON OUT NOW (@KitfoxGames) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KitfoxGames/status/1426600404423520285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="djKL70"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boyfriend Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; is a dating sim / dungeon crawler in which players can build a relationship or romance with a number of sharp, dressed swords. Days after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619888/nintendo-switch-indie-world-showcase-axiom-verge-2-boyfriend-dungeon"&gt;game’s surprise release&lt;/a&gt; last Wednesday, people started voicing concerns on social media about a plot element that involves one of the characters stalking and emotionally manipulating the player. People took issue that the content warning that pops up when loading a new game doesn’t adequately address the potentially triggering elements players might be subjected to. They were also concerned that some of the plot’s darker themes weren’t communicated well enough in the game’s advertising and Kickstarter campaign. Right now, the content warning reads like this:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Content warning in Boyfriend Dungeon that states, “This game may included references to unwanted advances, stalking, and other forms of emotional manipulation.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Boyfriend Dungeon&lt;em&gt;’s original content warning.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dXzesU"&gt;It is not unusual for developers to update or implement content warnings in response to evolving attitudes about player protections and consent. Earlier this year, Team Salvato released &lt;a href="https://ddlc.plus/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — an expanded version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/24/16807866/doki-doki-literature-club-dating-sim-horror-short-play"&gt;deceptively unsettling &lt;em&gt;Doki Doki Literature Club&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which included enhanced &lt;a href="http://teamsalvato.com/blog/updates-to-content-warnings-in-ddlc-plus/"&gt;content warnings&lt;/a&gt; that were not present in the original release. The updated content warnings allowed players to choose how much they wanted to be spoiled about the plot in order to make an informed decision on whether to play. The game also included a setting that would warn the player in-game whenever they were about to experience potentially upsetting content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QkvZJT"&gt;After Kitfox Games’ announcement, some players were still concerned and expressed a desire for the developer to implement a feature that will let players opt out of the problematic content altogether. &lt;em&gt;Boyfriend Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; already has a feature like this in which players can choose to not receive texts from the player’s mom. However, opting out of text messages is different from opting out of portions of the story since the text messages are not critical to the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin sues NASA, escalating its fight for a Moon lander contract</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin New Shepard Space Vehicle Flies The Billionaire And Other Passengers To Space" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4mMcmwcdp4T4Qw4_drlynQ76AAU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69731346/1329737107.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7m4WLf"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin brought its fight against NASA’s Moon program to federal court on Monday, doubling down on accusations that the agency wrongly evaluated its lunar lander proposal. The complaint escalates a monthslong crusade by the company to win a chunk of lunar lander funds that was only given to its rival, Elon Musk’s SpaceX and comes weeks after Blue Origin’s first protest over the Moon program was squashed by a federal watchdog agency. Now in court, Blue Origin’s challenge could trigger another pause to SpaceX’s contract and a new lengthy delay to NASA’s race to land astronauts on the Moon by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74nxOm"&gt;Blue Origin’s complaint, filed with the US Court of Federal Claims, was shrouded behind a protective order but was described as a challenge to “NASA’s unlawful and improper evaluation of proposals submitted under the” the Moon competition, lawyers for Blue Origin said in a separate filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K14A58"&gt;Blue Origin was one of three firms vying for a contract to land NASA’s first astronauts on the Moon since 1972. In April, NASA shelved the company’s $5.9 billion proposal of its Blue Moon landing system and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;went with SpaceX’s $2.9 billion Starship proposal instead&lt;/a&gt;, opting to pick just one company for the project after saying it might pick two. Limited funding from Congress only allowed one contract, NASA has argued. The contract involves two lunar landings — one test landing without humans, and another with humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLMyXX"&gt;A spokesperson for Blue Origin called the lawsuit “an attempt to remedy the flaws in the acquisition process found in NASA’s Human Landing System,” adding: “We firmly believe that the issues identified in this procurement and its outcomes must be addressed to restore fairness, create competition, and ensure a safe return to the Moon for America.” NASA wasn’t immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5hGIT"&gt;Blue Origin filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in April, less than two weeks after SpaceX’s award was announced, arguing NASA should’ve canceled or changed the terms of the program when it learned it wouldn’t have had enough money to fund two separate contracts. It also alleged NASA unfairly negotiated the terms of SpaceX’s proposal before making the award, without giving the same opportunities to Blue Origin and Dynetics. The GAO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602082/nasa-gao-spacex-blue-origin-dynetics-lunar-lander"&gt;rejected those arguments&lt;/a&gt; in late July and deemed NASA’s decision fair and lawful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="btFnvk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Blue Origin planning to ask for a pause to SpaceX’s contract during the lawsuit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="essnOH"&gt;That protest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412771/nasa-spacex-hls-moon-lander-blue-origin-protest"&gt;prevented&lt;/a&gt; SpaceX from starting its contract for 95 days while the GAO adjudicated the case. Now in federal claims court, Blue Origin’s latest challenge could trigger another delay. The company alerted the court last week of its impending lawsuit and signaled to the judge that it will seek an order to pause SpaceX’s contract while the case is adjudicated, according to a person familiar with the notice who’s not authorized to speak publicly about litigation. If the judge grants Blue Origin’s request, the pause to SpaceX’s contract could potentially last even longer and put &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618275/nasa-spacesuits-delay-inspector-general-report-2024-artemis"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; dent in the timeline of NASA’s Artemis program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXM4L3"&gt;Blue Origin pitched its Blue Moon lunar lander with a “National Team” of established aerospace contractors that included Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, signaling that the technical expertise from those companies would fill in for Blue Origin’s limited spaceflight experience. The company has launched and landed its reusable suborbital space tourism rocket New Shepard roughly 16 times, with its first crewed flight taking place in July with Bezos and three others aboard. Engineering lessons from New Shepard will help guide Blue Origin’s approach for its lunar landing segment of Blue Moon, Bezos has said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiVrk0"&gt;After losing its GAO protest, Blue Origin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570287/space-tourism-virgin-galactic-branson-blue-origin-bezos"&gt;waved its frustration out in the open&lt;/a&gt; through statements and snarky white papers dangling the prospect of another legal fight in court and attacking SpaceX’s Starship system as inefficient. “We stand firm in our belief that there were fundamental issues with NASA’s decision,” the company said in a statement after the GAO ruling, “but the GAO wasn’t able to address them due to their limited jurisdiction.” In one infographic posted on its website, Blue Origin targeted SpaceX’s Starship system directly, saying “there are an unprecedented number of technologies, developments, and operations that have never been done before for Starship to land on the Moon.” One critique cast SpaceX’s proposal as overly complex, noting it would take 16 separate Starship launches for each Moon landing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLWL4Q"&gt;Musk defended this approach in response to Blue’s critiques on Twitter, saying “16 flights is extremely unlikely” and that a “max of 8” launches would be required for one Starship lunar landing.” The rocket system, as proposed to NASA, would require several launches of a fuel tanker version of Starship that would, through some proprietary fueling depot floating in Earth orbit, supply fuel to a lunar lander version of Starship before trekking to the Moon’s surface, according to the GAO. Musk defended this approach in responses to Blue’s critiques on Twitter, saying “16 flights is extremely unlikely” and that a “max of 8” launches would be required for one Starship lunar landing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uePURE"&gt;“However, even if it were 16 flights with docking, this is not a problem. SpaceX did more than 16 orbital flights in first half of 2021 &amp;amp; has docked with Station (much harder than docking with our own ship) over 20 times.” Then, in another tweet, he threw in some snark at Blue Origin: “The sad thing is that even if Santa Claus suddenly made their hardware real for free, the first thing you’d want to do is cancel it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZvMu0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgSRJn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel enters the PC gaming GPU battle with Arc</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ns2B-1w_CDkHIv8RdT8GY5lh1Ao=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69731009/intelarc.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel Arc is the new branding for Intel’s GPUs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4hTrhC"&gt;Intel is branding its upcoming consumer GPUs as Intel Arc. This new &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/visual-technology/arc-discrete-graphics.html"&gt;Arc brand&lt;/a&gt; will cover both the hardware and software powering Intel’s high-end discrete GPUs, as well as multiple hardware generations. The first of those, known previously as DG2, is expected to arrive in the form of codename “Alchemist” in Q1 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PI64lk"&gt;Intel’s Arc-based Alchemist GPUs will be available in both desktops and notebooks in early 2022, with Intel seemingly aiming to compete against both AMD and Nvidia here. While we still don’t know much about the performance of the first Alchemist GPUs, Intel &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/introducing-discrete-graphics-brand-intel-arc.html#gs.8iunf6"&gt;published a teaser video&lt;/a&gt; today that showed prototype silicon powering &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Psychonauts 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jTz6e3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's a sneak peek of pre-production Intel Arc graphics in action. &lt;a href="https://t.co/VOMsMN6r2y"&gt;https://t.co/VOMsMN6r2y&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IntelArc?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#IntelArc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/b9fOsXdRCq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/b9fOsXdRCq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Intel Graphics (@IntelGraphics) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IntelGraphics/status/1427262530594869258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BLdrhz"&gt;Intel’s Arc GPUs will be capable of mesh shading, variable rate shading, video upscaling, and real-time ray tracing. Most importantly, Intel is also promising AI-accelerated super sampling, which sounds like Intel has its own competitor to Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545441/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-tests-benchmarks"&gt;AMD launched its own FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR)&lt;/a&gt; answer to DLSS in June, but it’s only using a spatial upscaling technique rather than AI-based temporal upscaling. The aim of all these technologies is to upscale games from a lower resolution to provide smoother frame rates without a noticeable compromise in image quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ABCb60"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"These are Intel’s first Iris Xe desktop GPUs ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251142/intel-iris-xe-graphics-cards-desktop-gpu-pc"},{"title":"Intel’s new desktop GPUs won’t work in AMD systems ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252534/intel-desktop-gpu-amd-support-systems-iris-xe"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="YDFuuW"&gt;“The launch of the Intel Arc brand and the reveal of future hardware generations signifies Intel’s deep and continued commitment to gamers and creators everywhere,” says Roger Chandler, head of Intel’s client GPU business. “We have teams doing incredible work to ensure we deliver first-class and frictionless experiences when these products are available early next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QkXJzwXRgxaSm9AXfK7TGbbtygE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785211/intelarcchip.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel’s first Arc GPUs will arrive in notebooks and desktops early next year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vRGGXK"&gt;Intel is only teasing the brand of its Arc GPUs today and revealing that “Battlemage,” “Celestial,” and “Druid” are all codenames for its future generations of Arc GPUs. More details and specifics are planned for later in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqgdKd"&gt;So far, Intel has launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251142/intel-iris-xe-graphics-cards-desktop-gpu-pc"&gt;first Iris Xe graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, codenamed “DG1,” that use the company’s Xe LP architecture. These lower-power cards were mainly designed for pre-built workstations, instead of dedicated gaming rigs. Intel’s upcoming Arc GPUs will be based on the company’s Xe-HPG microarchitecture, which is a combination of the work Intel has been putting into its Xe-LP, HP, and HPC microarchitectures.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How drones are changing our view of sharks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MRgR1lcfwy_Xd4G7t6z-LupDFPE=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69730980/vlcsnap_2021_07_09_16h59m21s441.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Two sharks and a surfer off the coast of California. | Image: CSULB Shark Lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LdUnh7"&gt;A quick Google search for “sharks” drums up a sampling of headlines of recent sightings. “Leopard Sharks Return to La Jolla Waters in Droves,” reads one, while another highlights a “cluster of juvenile great white sharks off Pacific Palisades coast.” There’s been a steady stream of these kinds of stories all summer: sharks swimming eerily close to unknowing swimmers nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="9qOq67"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Drones are actually helping researchers dispel some misguided fears&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2zqARw"&gt;If there seem to be more shark sightings than ever, it may be thanks to drones. Aside from driving some scary headlines, drones are actually helping researchers dispel some misguided fears: it turns out that shark encounters aren’t actually so rare. People often don’t even realize when there are sharks around them, drone footage shows, and much of the time the sharks don’t seem to pay humans much attention either.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJl6AK"&gt;“It’s a little scary to think that there’s great whites out there. But at the same time, the amount of times I’ve been out here, I’ve probably swam with countless, you know, that have swam by. So I think ignorance is bliss in this case,” Robert Xaudaro, a surfer, told &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/great-white-shark-pacific-palisades-will-rogers-state-beach-california-population/10945063/"&gt;ABC 7 Eyewitness News&lt;/a&gt; last week in a story about the juvenile great white sharks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32bxXU"&gt;“The technology has really revolutionized and given us a completely different view of sharks,” says Chris Lowe, a professor of marine biology and director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IG2u38"&gt;Previously, researchers like Lowe could only hop on planes and helicopters to spy on sharks from the sky. That was a pretty pricey endeavor, he says, and was mostly used just to count how many sharks were out there. With drones, that’s all changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sHixM1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What they’re doing when they’re around people”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wX3bQT"&gt;“We have a low-cost tool that’s giving insight, kind of a bird’s-eye view as to what sharks are doing and more importantly: what they’re doing when they’re around people,” Lowe says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhX6o4"&gt;Lowe’s research team is combing through about 700 hours of drone footage that they’ve either taken themselves or received from others to study shark behavior and how they react to people. In one 42-second &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pxvONjBWmvd00BXgFAPTCdK7Hk38Fs84/view?usp=sharing"&gt;clip&lt;/a&gt; taken off the coast of California, five sharks can be seen swimming next to three surfers in wetsuits. The people sit casually on their boards, legs dangling in the water, as the sharks pass them by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="awz3MU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pxvONjBWmvd00BXgFAPTCdK7Hk38Fs84/preview" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; picture-in-picture; gyroscope;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8hFQtR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video courtesy of CSULB Shark Lab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G9RjEi"&gt;They’ve studied hundreds of interactions between people and young white sharks. While their research isn’t finished or published yet, Lowe has a cursory analysis: “It looks like so far, the sharks don’t care. They treat people as if they’re flotsam, just floating debris on the surface.” Basically, the sharks generally ignore people unless they’re being chased or harassed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kzbj5B"&gt;That’s a relief given that human and shark interactions might be on the rise. Lowe’s research could ultimately inform authorities’ decisions on whether to close a beach if sharks have been spotted nearby. That becomes a tougher call to make if juvenile sharks are hanging out for weeks or even months at a time — potentially forcing beach closures that can harm local economies even if those sharks don’t pose a significant threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndd3JW"&gt;“From a public safety standpoint, there’s been no scientific evidence to back up any of this. And now for the first time, we have some science,” Lowe says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8S0axE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s part of the story. The other part of the story is climate change”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r1qbNK"&gt;Shark populations are bouncing back in US waters after being dramatically overfished, according to Lowe. Sharks have been climbing back from the brink over the past 15 or so years. This year, Lowe says, that trend is likely coinciding with more beachgoers as people emerge from pandemic-induced lockdowns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CaP2F8"&gt;“That’s part of the story. The other part of the story is climate change,” Lowe says. As oceans warm, white shark nurseries are moving farther north on the West Coast of the US to places that were previously too cold for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwDtYy"&gt;Toxic algae blooms can also push sharks into new places, as farming and industrial runoff make red tides worse. Hundreds of sharks surprised residents of Longboat Key, Florida last month when they crowded into local canals. The sharks were likely seeking refuge from a &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/4/22606025/florida-red-tide-dead-fish-beach-algae-bloom"&gt;red tide&lt;/a&gt;, which sucks oxygen out of the water and can kill marine life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aq1c9F"&gt;With more people and sharks running into each other, there are also more amateurs documenting with drones. &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-04/spying-on-california-great-white-sharks-with-drones"&gt;Recreationists&lt;/a&gt; have shared their shark footage with Lowe, although he’s quick to say that it’s best if citizen scientists are licensed drone pilots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGCkoW"&gt;Whether all this footage contributes to research or just winds up on YouTube or social media, Lowe says it has helped to cast sharks in a new light. The sharks are in their natural environment — not cast as the villain in a film like Jaws. “The bottom line is there’s no doubt that drones have given people a different perspective because they get to see sharks around people and see that the sharks aren’t attacking,” Lowe says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1w8T0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALXCAi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BXuxaC"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405230/amazon-fire-hd-10-2021-announced-kids-pro"&gt;refreshed its Fire HD 10 tablets&lt;/a&gt; in late April, and it added a faster processor and more RAM to make its biggest budget-friendly model a better value. Now is a great time to buy one, as the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BX7FV5L/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire HD 10 with 32GB of storage and ads on the lock screen&lt;/a&gt; is $50 off its usual price, bringing it down to $100. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-tablet/dp/B08F69779X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free version is $115&lt;/a&gt;. And, if 32GB of storage doesn’t seem like it’ll be enough, you can purchase &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0887P21Z2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an affordable 256GB microSD card&lt;/a&gt; that can greatly expand its internal storage for things like apps, movies, and more (it supports up to a 1TB microSD card).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7FeA4"&gt;The slightly more capable &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F6FYN6B/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire HD 10 Plus&lt;/a&gt; is also far less expensive than usual. Normally $180, it’s $130. This upgrade won’t be for everyone, but it has more RAM (4GB compared to 3GB in the standard Fire HD 10), a “soft-touch finish,” and wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JkHTfh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10616001"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VS8y5n"&gt;Excellent deals on the Apple AirPods Pro aren’t too tricky to come by. They’re regularly $50 or slightly more off their usual $250 price, but seeing them selling for $180 is still rare enough that we thought you ought to know about it. That sale price is happening at Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;where they’re listed for $190&lt;/a&gt;, but $10 will be knocked off the total cost at the checkout page. At the time of publication, Amazon says your order will ship in one or two days.&lt;/p&gt;
