    <title>Motorola Moto G Pure review: an easy bargain</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;For casual users, this $160 4G phone is good enough&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PfY8IN"&gt;The Moto G Pure is the rare $160 phone that works well enough that you forget you’re using a sub-$200 device. Yes, Motorola made some compromises to deliver a phone at this low price point, but it still nails all the basics that you should care about: good build quality, good battery life, and good cameras for the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik6WHn"&gt;That is not to say the Moto phone is perfect. Its processor is just a second slower in most tasks, it only works on 4G networks, and its paltry 32GB of internal storage is just not enough space to use for long. But for its price, it’s hard to argue against the Moto G Pure — it gets a lot right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VDmDAF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10871077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7hQaep"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="DI4Ddk"&gt;For a big phone with a 6.5-inch screen, the Moto G Pure feels relatively compact, measuring 0.34-inch thick and weighing 0.41lbs. Thanks to its rounded corners and sloped edges, the G Pure is comfortable to hold for long stretches, though it’s a bit tall (the screen has a 20:9 aspect ratio) to use single-handed for my small hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OM443k"&gt;Available in deep indigo, the G Pure has a subtle sheen to its textured, matte back cover. Its plastic material is very hard and slippery, despite that texture. In fact, I’ve lost count of the number of times the phone has magically slipped off an ottoman or table and still works. Yes, this $160 Moto phone is quite durable, but I wouldn’t test the smartphone gods — you’ll still be better off with a case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DncdMx"&gt;It has a snappy fingerprint sensor under the Motorola logo, as well as Face Unlock to give you a hands-free option to unlock your phone. I like that the Moto software gives you more control over how this works. You can use your face to unlock the phone (no need to press the power button first), and ask the phone to bring you to the last app or webpage that was opened (rather than the lockscreen). With good lighting, Face Unlock works well enough, but the fingerprint sensor is faster and more consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W2NRUxvZ044iPffFsdlFOZ-z8VM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956983/gsin_190203_4806_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For a big phone with a 6.5-inch screen, the Moto G Pure feels relatively compact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CuYpZV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware &amp;amp; Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Md2AB3"&gt;As part of the cost cutting to hit the G Pure’s low price, Motorola decided to use a weak processor and minimal RAM, and it shows. At the heart of the Moto phone is the MediaTek Helio G25 processor, which is &lt;a href="https://www.giznext.com/chipset-compare/qualcomm-snapdragon-439-vs-mediatek-helio-g25"&gt;comparable to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 439&lt;/a&gt; but actually lags behind that 2018 Snapdragon chipset. Everything from opening a website, switching between apps, to opening the camera app to take a photo just takes an extra second on the Moto phone. While this doesn’t sound like much, those extra seconds really add up over the course of a day and can make you question your sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvxvTM"&gt;It has just 3GB of RAM to support its under-powered processor and a meager 32GB of internal storage. At this point, 32GB is simply not enough capacity for a phone, especially when most people are hanging onto their phones for longer. After just two weeks of light use — installing updates and a few apps, plus taking some photos — I’ve already burned through 18.04GB (56 percent of storage) on the G Pure. With Motorola promising one OS update and two years of security updates, you’ll likely run out of space before you run out of software support. Good thing it has a microSD card slot, where you can expand its limited capacity with up to a 512GB card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Moto G Pure’s fingerprint sensor and side buttons." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mLvv2alnMT6GmDuVEDNdMV3fEfE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956981/gsin_190203_4806_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the Motorola logo is the Moto G Pure’s fingerprint sensor for securing your phone against intruders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkHLGK"&gt;The G Pure’s 6.5-inch LCD screen may look vibrant with its brightness set to 100 percent, but it is only a 720p display, with a low 269 pixel density. At 1600 x 720p resolution, &lt;em&gt;The Spider-Man: No Way Home Trailer&lt;/em&gt; looks more pixelated and dim on the Moto than on the OnePlus 9’s 2K display. Day to day, you probably wouldn’t notice just how low-res the display is, but if you have any higher-quality screens in your life, it will stand out and not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlHPgF"&gt;I played some &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Unite&lt;/em&gt; to stress test it, and performance was better than I expected, at least once I was able to launch the game fully. It took three tries and multiple force quits on it before I could actually play. Once the game finally loaded, I was able to move my pokemon around the battlefield without lag, with the battle music blaring from the lone speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qch758"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s hard to deny that the Moto G Pure will be good enough for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ISV0DW"&gt;Using only 4G service to test the G Pure’s 4,000mAh battery, I spent the day toggling between two email accounts, sharing content on Twitter and Hangouts, and playing some &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Unite&lt;/em&gt;. The G Pure stayed cool to the touch no matter how much I was stressing it. Although the battery didn’t quite live up to the two days of use claim from Motorola, I got about 16 hours out of it (or about seven hours of screentime) before needing to hit the charger. Don’t expect a fast charge, though: It took me about two hours to recharge this battery with the included 10W charging brick. In all, the battery should last you a full day at minimum, or maybe as long as two days for a light user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Moto G Pure dual camera system closeup." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VaoTg8icuZpo5S9iQOv6bht5kBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956982/gsin_190203_4806_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Pure kept it simple with a rear, dual-camera system, rather than add a sub-par ultrawide or macro camera onto the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r3rGf7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camera&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="BMQtq0"&gt;For a $160 phone, the cameras on the Moto G Pure are better than expected, especially for photos that you’ll likely only share online. Rather than squeeze another lackluster ultrawide or macro camera onto the back, Motorola made a smart decision to keep it simple with just a rear dual-camera system — a 13-megapixel main camera and a 2-megapixel depth sensor — plus a 5-megapixel front-facing camera (f/2.4) for selfies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7rMJcS"&gt;The 13-megapixel main camera with f/2.2 aperture was surprisingly capable at capturing details in low-light situations. At a recent indoor event with tricky lighting, it had no problems focusing with various light sources in dark rooms, and it managed to photograph small details in the art installations. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dfXCY6jPNW5r6UjmjnZ8cazmtg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23022110/IMG_20211022_222531879_MP_1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moto G Pure camera test image: the main camera is able to capture fine details even in low light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dt1zjg"&gt;Like other smartphone cameras in this class, color accuracy seems to be an issue with the G Pure. Most photos look fine, but there are a few issues, like the pumpkins that look too red with stems that look too blue to be realistic. Likewise, the yellow door should look more orange, and the blue door should look more teal (with more green) than blue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hWULVm9mnhfqf8fsESdpz8TbjOM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021849/IMG_20211016_163007674_1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moto G Pure camera test image: the two doors’ colors are not true to life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3XpYO"&gt;My biggest gripe with the G Pure’s camera is its slider interface for zooming. Unlike other camera apps where you can tap to select the most optimal digital zoom presets, Moto’s zoom slider doesn’t automatically appear in the app. In addition, your hand will probably block your screen as you try to frame your shot and navigate the slider bar at the same time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zCoupo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10870825"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BII4oi"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample photos from the Moto Pure G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Moto G Pure’s camera app UI." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0StNfiklM-I1IDQqHb5VdPxkTNE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956986/gsin_190209_4806_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Pure’s zoom slider bar is not as easy to use as other phones’ camera app UI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="3355Ti"&gt;
&lt;p id="BCUmNa"&gt;At $160 — or less if you catch a sale or carrier deal, as this phone works on many 4G networks in America — it’s hard to deny that the Moto G Pure will be good enough for most people looking for a basic budget phone for under $200. After all, it has an all-day battery, a versatile main camera, all in a well-designed, durable package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDQZ0q"&gt;It’s a shame it doesn’t have a faster processor, more RAM, or more onboard storage, which would make it a clear winner. I’d rather Motorola charge a slightly higher price like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22717002/tcl-20s-and-20se-review-budget-affordable-unlocked-smartphone"&gt;$190 TCL 20SE&lt;/a&gt;, which offers 128GB of internal storage, has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 processor, and is supported by 4GB of RAM. At least you wouldn’t have to constantly worry about backing up the files from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pmtp8a"&gt;But these issues might not be deal-breakers for more casual users or those with a strict budget. Not many great phones are available at this price point, and the Moto G Pure is quite the catch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD’s powerful 5800X processor is down to its lowest price yet at Newegg</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KAhNW9VApZh2DlR9VMRoRsZwUcs=/401x0:4720x2879/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70159365/AMD_Ryzen_5000_Series_Lidded_5.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team red is at it again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oeNyYz"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Famd-ryzen-7-5800x%2Fp%2F19-113-665" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AMD Ryzen 7 5800X has been discounted at Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, letting you save up to $75 with the promo code &lt;strong&gt;BFPAYA526&lt;/strong&gt;. This brings the total down to $374, the lowest price we’ve seen for this particular processor. As an added bonus, this CPU comes packaged with a free month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aaUqF"&gt;The 5800X is part of the latest Zen 3 architecture and uses the same AM4 socket used by AMD's previous generation of processors, which for most people should allow you to swap in this new CPU without having to invest in a new motherboard. This eight-core CPU has a base clock speed of 3.8GHz but is capable of up to a 4.7GHz boost clock speed. While this CPU is quite powerful, Newegg has also discounted the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Famd-ryzen-9-5900x%2Fp%2F19-113-664" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;5900X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Famd-ryzen-9-5950x%2Fp%2F19-113-663" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;5950X&lt;/a&gt; to $524 and $746, respectively, if you’re in need of a processor with a little more staying power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YJrIXh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10870965"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pU9Qh1"&gt;The OnePlus 8T is currently enjoying a sizable $100 discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone-Version/dp/B08KXB3R7S?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1lSvSuiQO" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the cost down to $500. Both retailers are offering up the aquamarine (light green) colorway version of the phone. Each comes unlocked with 256GB of storage. While it lacks support for Verizon’s mmWave 5G, it should work with any US carrier’s 4G service, in addition to a limited range of 5G service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acvOJm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our review&lt;/a&gt; of this phone noted that it was a relatively incremental upgrade to the OnePlus 8, but that it still manages to bring impressive performance and extra perks you usually don’t see at this price, like a silky 120Hz refresh rate display. We’ve seen similar (and sometimes better) deals on this phone recently, so who knows what will come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Black Friday right around the corner&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

Normally $329, this week is the first time we’ve seen a price break on these, and it’s a solid value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMd1UZ"&gt;While they look similar to the older QC35 II, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our reviewer&lt;/a&gt; definitely noticed the improvements made to the overall battery life of these comfy headphones. The QC45 are capable of lasting up to 24 hours on a single charge. And, while they can’t be used when they’re charging, the USB-C support means they can quickly be topped off, with just 15 minutes of charging netting you roughly three hours of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2X2n4A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10869266"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="onLWgd"&gt;
&lt;p id="AGLoqS"&gt;If you’re looking to expand your PC storage space, this deal on the 1TB WD Black SN750 PCIe 3.0 M.2 SSD is for you. It’s currently $150 off the regular MSRP, bringing the total down to $110 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRZge5hJKF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-SN750-NVMe-Internal-Gaming/dp/B07M64QXMN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This is the lowest price we’ve seen and is an excellent value if you want speedy storage. One quick note, however, is that due to this M.2 drive being PCIe 3.0 and not PCIe 4.0, it’s not advised that you use it with the PlayStation 5, as it likely will not work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EW8jhb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CXkTss"&gt;
&lt;p id="j0xeFy"&gt;If you’re in the market for a large and curvaceous gaming monitor, the big 32-inch version of the &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fmsiom321cqr.html%3F&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MSI Optix series has been discounted at Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to the lowest price we’ve ever seen for this 1440p panel. Capable of up to a 144Hz refresh rate, this monitor also features a 1ms response time and has AMD FreeSync to keep frame rates smooth and reduce screen tearing. The included stand is adjustable, but the monitor has a 100 x 100 VESA mount if you want to use a monitor arm instead. In terms of connectivity, the MAG321CQR can accept HDMI 2.0 or DisplayPort 1.2 inputs, and it has a pair of USB ports for connecting or charging peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fGhQC9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10871048"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EVQ8os"&gt;
&lt;p id="KsReRx"&gt;The stellar Razer DeathAdder V2 Pro wireless gaming mouse is currently discounted to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B08FQMBKQG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$80 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price ever. The design of this mouse features four programmable buttons and is ambidextrous (but was made with right-handed gamers in mind). It has a 20K DPI sensor and can operate for up to 120 hours on a single charge, provided you’ve turned off the RGB lighting.

    <title>Ring doorbells will be able to greet people with holiday cheer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fiAm6eSgMFne6iS7s8Sc5DJkmqQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70159251/dseifert_20210323_4486_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F5zXD1"&gt;Ring is releasing some holiday-themed Quick Replies to add some cheer to its doorbell’s automatic answering feature. Instead of the usual “We can’t answer the door right now, but if you’d like to leave a message, you can do it now” types of messages, you can instead have your Ring greet visitors by saying “We’re busy wrapping presents right now,&lt;em&gt;” &lt;/em&gt;or have it automatically thank delivery workers for bringing gifts to your door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vyy4LX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056808171-Ring-Quick-Replies-"&gt;According to Ring&lt;/a&gt;, Quick Replies are available on pretty much every Ring doorbell. While the feature is free, you’ll have to be a paying subscriber if you want any visitor responses to your doorbell’s “Happy Holidays!” greeting to be recorded (though you can watch them happen live without a Ring Protect plan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7DGj8a"&gt;Like in previous years, you also have the option to set carols like “Deck the Halls,” “Jingle Bells,” or “Oh Hanukkah” as your chime tones, so you can experience getting tired of holiday music by mid-December without leaving home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pEiflI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is spreading holiday cheer more fun than creeping visitors out?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ltvfCs"&gt;Ring seems to be building a collection of holiday-themed Quick Replies and ringtones — earlier this year, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708996/rings-halloween-doorbell-ringtones-spooky-quick-replies-arrive"&gt;added spooky ones for Halloween&lt;/a&gt;. Personally, I’m hoping there’s eventually a collection for every occasion; maybe you have &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USF55GUALyQ"&gt;a sappy love song&lt;/a&gt; play when someone’s at the door around Valentine’s Day (potentially leading to you realizing that the package delivery person is The One), or have your Ring tell guests to “come back later, we’re responsibly playing with fireworks” on the Fourth of July or New Year’s. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s GeForce Now subscriptions now come with free Crysis Remastered for PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HV2Ao4fK_RNwotuxxFnvTfWHXn0=/256x0:1792x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70159240/GFN_Thursday_Crysis_Remastered.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zv1jzK"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22725953/crysis-remastered-nvidia-geforce-now-available-streaming"&gt;Nvidia settled the age-old question once and for all&lt;/a&gt; — yes, it can run &lt;em&gt;Crysis&lt;/em&gt;, whatever it is, as long as it can stream the company’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service. To prove it, Nvidia’s now giving away a copy of &lt;em&gt;Crysis Remastered&lt;/em&gt; for free with every new six-month GeForce Now subscription, as well as the first wave of customers who’ve already subscribed or preordered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750246/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-3080-google-stadia-cloud-gaming"&gt;GeForce Now’s impressive new RTX 3080 tier&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a limited-time offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HcWd8b"&gt;You don’t even have to play that copy of &lt;em&gt;Crysis &lt;/em&gt;using GeForce Now, by the way — it’s a full PC copy delivered via the Epic Games Store, and you can run it on your gaming desktop or laptop too. It’s yours to keep even after your subscription is over. Nvidia says it’s the first time GeForce Now has given away a game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNjHs7"&gt;“Current GeForce Now RTX 3080 members will receive game codes in the days ahead; while members who have preordered but haven’t been activated yet, will receive their game code when their GeForce Now RTX 3080 service is activated,” writes Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dm9R7y"&gt;It’s worth noting this isn’t the whole &lt;em&gt;Crysis Remastered&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;, just the first game in the series, so we’re talking about a title that currently costs $30 on the Epic Games Store. That’s not necessarily a reason to pick up the service — I’d suggest trying GeForce Now’s free tier to make sure it works for you first — but if you’re already interested in a copy of the game &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; want to become a GFN subscriber, that’s a sizable discount off your six-month, $50 subscription to GeForce Now’s priority tier, or your $100 subscription for six months of the RTX 3080 service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite is getting better Battle Pass progression later this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A50wvRCkP5eE5HZCF0drb4EN1yk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158973/HaloInfinite_RXJtJxSVSl.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="urkns2"&gt;If you’re still stuck on level 1 of the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass, fear not, as 343 Industries is making some much-needed changes to progression later this week. “To address the feedback on Battle Pass progression we will be making targeted tunings to our model later this week,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1461124062021763072"&gt;says &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; community manager John Junyszek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qTANV"&gt;The existing &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass makes it difficult to level up, as you’re limited to completing daily or weekly challenges instead of earning XP for every game you play. While that isn’t changing yet, 343 Industries is adding “Play 1 game” challenges “to help make sure you consistently progress through the Battle Pass by playing matches the way you want,” according to Junyszek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3HF7SN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To address the feedback on Battle Pass progression we will be making targeted tunings to our model later this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To start, we'll be adding "Play 1 Game" challenges to help make sure you consistently progress through the Battle Pass by playing matches the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;— John Junyszek (@Unyshek) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1461124062021763072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yId2pq"&gt;343 Industries will also be removing some weekly challenges and fixing bugs with others, but these changes do have a small price. “When we make this update, we’ll need to reset your challenges, including your progress towards weekly ones,” explains Junyszek. “To make up for this reset, we’ll be granting this week’s Ultimate Reward, the Sigil Mark VII Visor, to everyone who logs in from November 23rd to November 30th.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhuQBV"&gt;XP boosts will also now double in duration, lasting for an hour instead of 30 minutes, which will help for longer Big Team Battles games. We may even see further changes to the XP and progression systems in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;in the future, too. “We’ll be watching these changes closely to make sure they have the positive impact we all want on your progression,” says Junyszek. “This is only our first step - we are committed to continue evolving these systems but it will take time.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kTGrLucpuf2Yks1-20j7TjTM3HI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925717/HaloInfinite_2021_10_03_21_02_12_131.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The XP boost changes should help during Big Team Battles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UBbrpz"&gt;Criticism around the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass progression has been getting increasingly louder across the community of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; fans this week after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782786/halo-infinite-multiplayer-available-download-launch"&gt;surprise early release of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. While multiplayer previews over the summer felt like an exciting return to form, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22725770/halo-infinite-multiplayer-preview"&gt;we had concerns around the Battle Pass progression&lt;/a&gt; and XP systems. 343 Industries still went ahead with the same systems, despite concerns from many during the technical previews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3uFn2"&gt;It’s encouraging to see quick changes, though. This opening &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; season will last until May, which is double the three months that had originally been promised. That extra time could be why 343 Industries kept the slow Battle Pass progression in the first place, but we’ll have to check out the changes later this week to see if they make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify launches lyrics feature globally for free and paying users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Spotify Stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/exXtCaChxrUyyxsLMKiYH1unUEI=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158957/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YEAnqG"&gt;Today, Spotify is finally rolling out its &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-18/you-can-now-find-the-lyrics-to-your-favorite-songs-in-spotify-heres-how/"&gt;real-time lyrics feature globally&lt;/a&gt;, after previously only offering it in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307984/spotify-real-time-lyrics-26-markets-musixmatch-genius-apple-music-karaoke"&gt;limited selection of countries&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3S2No"&gt;The lyrics themselves are provided by Musixmatch, which claims to &lt;a href="https://about.musixmatch.com/press"&gt;offer lyrics&lt;/a&gt; for “over 8 million” titles. and will be accessible on basically every platform where Spotify has an app. This includes iOS, Android, desktop computers, gaming consoles, and smart TVs. The feature is available to both free and premium listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYNrcO"&gt;As well as using the lyrics to sing along yourself, there’s also a social element which allows you to share lyrics to social media. Spotify says the feature will be available across the “majority” of its music library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANfx4V"&gt;Here’s how to access the lyrics (and share them) as per Spotify’s instructions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FH7wet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the Spotify mobile app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4cTCiu"&gt;Tap on the “Now Playing View” on a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23MrNs"&gt;While listening, swipe up from the bottom of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrGvtb"&gt;You’ll see track lyrics that scroll in real time as the song is playing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rKYKC"&gt;To share, simply tap the “Share” button at the bottom of the lyrics screen and then select the lyrics you want to share — and where you want to share it — via third-party platforms.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2efwpu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the Spotify desktop app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYmPaQ"&gt;From the “Now Playing” bar, click on the microphone icon while a song is playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iBJ9c"&gt;Voila! You’ll see track lyrics that scroll in real time while the song plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwQZTP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the SpotifyTV app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8Y2PP"&gt;Open the “Now Playing View” on a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zow6SJ"&gt;Navigate to the right corner to the “lyrics button” and select if you want to enable Lyrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1sj3t"&gt;Once enabled, you’ll see the lyrics in the “Now Playing” View.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fkfXUq"&gt;Spotify’s history with lyrics is complicated. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/26/8113061/spotify-lyrics-feature-desktop-app"&gt;previously worked with Musixmatch&lt;/a&gt; to display song lyrics until &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/lyrics-spotify-musixmatch-gone-for-now/"&gt;parting ways with the company in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, it’s offered a “Behind the Lyrics” feature thanks to a partnership with Genius. It’s an interesting feature that offers background information on songs, but it’s less useful for karaoke sessions. Although it’s offered lyrics in some markets, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/29/13103812/spotify-japan-available-lyrics-feature"&gt;like Japan&lt;/a&gt;, the feature hasn’t received a widespread launch in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307984/spotify-real-time-lyrics-26-markets-musixmatch-genius-apple-music-karaoke"&gt;western markets like the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxJ0Ly"&gt;With the introduction of the new lyrics feature, Spotify &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/spotify-finally-rolls-out-real-time-lyrics-to-global-users/"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it’s discontinuing its “Behind the Lyrics” feature.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zipline starts first commercial US drone deliveries with Walmart partnership in Arkansas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r0dSR7gTgReSxvgUCfJvSWdpCBM=/0x0:5097x3398/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158855/Zip_launch.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6uZY56"&gt;Walmart and drone delivery company Zipline are launching a delivery service in Pea Ridge, Arkansas — the first commercial drone delivery service offered by Zipline in the US. Customers will be able to choose from “thousands of products,” though are restricted to health and wellness items like “over the counter allergy medicine, bandages, ibuprofen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKt9H0"&gt;The project’s launch shows there’s continuing belief in the potential of drones to perform commercial deliveries. But the technology’s slow rate of adoption (Walmart first tested drone deliveries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/26/9617600/walmart-drones-amazon-faa-test"&gt;back in 2015&lt;/a&gt;) and the lack of large-scale implementations (the Pea Ridge service only covers a 50-mile radius) also shows there are plenty of questions to be answered if drone deliveries are to become commonplace for regular consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L28I8e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Vaccines make sense for drone deliveries — do diapers?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pT03z2"&gt;To date, Zipline has mostly proven its mettle in healthcare, delivering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21270351/zipline-drones-novant-health-medical-center-hospital-supplies-ppe"&gt;medical supplies in North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/13/13267868/zipline-drone-delivery-rwanda-blood-launch"&gt;blood in Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320965/drone-delivery-vaccine-ghana-zipline-cold-chain-storage"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines in Ghana&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the economics of deliveries are better suited to the expenses of the technology. Vaccines and blood samples are small, valuable, and benefit greatly from speedy delivery. Walmart is Zipline’s first commercial partner, and it’s not clear if the economics of drone delivery are as convincing for customers who want on-demand diapers and non-prescription medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k4e1FK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10872508"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QxsIha"&gt;For Walmart, drones may help it plug gaps in its delivery network, particularly in rural communities that aren’t well served by traditional infrastructure. Drones, of course, don’t need roads or highways, and Zipline’s aircraft make delivery by parachute, avoiding the need for customers to have designated landing zones. (This is one of the challenges that has &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/amazon-drone-delivery-prime-air"&gt;reportedly stymied&lt;/a&gt; Amazon’s drone delivery ambitions.) There are other hurdles, of course, including regulatory ones, though Zipline was granted a waiver of certain FAA restrictions on drones &lt;a href="https://cei.org/blog/regulatory-waiver-clears-the-sky-for-private-partnership-innovation-and-competition/"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, which cleared the way for the Walmart partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sA5dfM"&gt;Residents in Pea Ridge, Arkansas who want to test out the drone delivery service will need to download Zipline’s app to do so. There they can place an order and pay for their items if they’re “eligible,” though we’re not quite sure what is meant by this term. Zipline told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that access will start with “a hand-selected group of recipients,” and that following the launch, “Zipline and Walmart will quickly work to expand to additional customers in the broader NWA region, subject to FAA approvals.” But that doesn’t offer much help. It seems drone deliveries are still not arriving as fast as hoped. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google explains the tradeoffs that led to Pixel 6’s slow charging complaints</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y-SLEVmDHLuPox9gnq9NbQxpBXY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158791/bfarsace_211014_4802_0054.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mjwG1g"&gt;Google has responded to allegations that the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro don’t charge as fast as some have expected, confirming that their charging speeds are a deliberate tradeoff for better battery life. It follows a &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6-charging-test-3051231/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which found that the phones’ maximum power draw was around 22W, well short of the 30W that Google’s latest USB-C charging brick is technically capable of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmwxTl"&gt;Writing in a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/135906719/how-charging-works-on-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro?hl=en"&gt;community support post&lt;/a&gt;, a spokesperson for Google confirmed that the maximum power draw of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are 21W and 23W respectively when used with its 30W USB-C charging brick. They added that charging speeds also decrease as the phones’ batteries fill up to preserve their longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4eX0u"&gt;In their post, they note that these figures are the inevitable results of battery tradeoffs. “A battery can be designed for high energy density, or for fast charging power capability, which requires trading off capacity to minimize battery degradation,” says the spokesperson. In other words, a phone can offer long battery life, or fast charging, but it can’t do both at the same time. So, Google prioritized a longer battery life and designed the phones to draw a more modest amount of power when charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z48O3T"&gt;This tracks with what we observed in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;review of the two phones&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="y76nAZ"&gt;”Even if you do use a powerful enough charger, neither phone charges particularly quickly. Google aggressively slows down charging once it’s past 80 percent to preserve the battery cells’ longevity, and since these batteries are so large, getting to a full charge can take a long time. Fortunately, thanks to the long battery life, you will likely only have to charge when you’re sleeping anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GsXJTf"&gt;Although &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7158570?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-pro"&gt;Google’s support documents&lt;/a&gt; never explicitly state the charging speeds of the new phones, their compatibility with Google’s 30W charging brick (sold separately) was taken by many to mean that their real-world maximum charging speeds would approach the 30W level, and would be far faster than the 18W charging supported by the Pixel 5. But in reality, &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;’s report&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that the actual power draw of both phones peaks at 22W and averages around 13W over the course of a full cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPs3ml"&gt;The effect of this is that the phones charge far slower than you might expect, with &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; finding that the Pixel 6 Pro takes almost two hours to reach a full charge. That’s 49 minutes slower than Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra, which has a similarly-sized battery but is only advertised with 25W fast charging speeds. In fact, Google’s power draw is so conservative that its 30W charger only fully charges a Pixel 6 Pro 10 minutes faster than its old 18W charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GaRag0"&gt;Google never claimed that the phones charge at 30W. Instead, it advertised the amount of time it takes to get from 0 to 50 and 80 percent when charged using its 30W charger — 30 minutes and around an hour, respectively. This is in line with what &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; found in its tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPR1Xz"&gt;As well as charging speeds, Google also recently clarified that the seemingly sluggish performance of the phones’ fingerprint scanner is because of their “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/7/22768853/google-explains-pixel-6-fingerprint-scanner-unreliable"&gt;enhanced security algorithms.&lt;/a&gt;” It later released an update containing “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787537/google-pixel-6-pro-update-fingerprint-scanner-slow"&gt;some fingerprint sensor performance improvements&lt;/a&gt;,” although the improvements it delivered appeared to be minimal in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is celebrating 20 years of Xbox in secret style</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2SYbxryWnclnHMSi-SJ2SJy5zJI=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158785/tomwarren_VLS_4504.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Halo-themed Xbox Series X.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N8n3Bg"&gt;Microsoft has been having a hell of a time celebrating 20 years of Xbox this week, adding 76 new games to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782746/microsoft-xbox-backward-compatibility-76-new-games"&gt;the Xbox backward compatibility library&lt;/a&gt;, launching a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641632/microsoft-xbox-series-x-halo-console-elite-2-controller"&gt;Halo-themed Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714394/microsoft-xbox-20th-anniversary-controller-headset-design-preorder-date"&gt;20th anniversary translucent controller&lt;/a&gt;. But, true to the company’s habit of corporate mischief, it’s also been leavening its announcements with plenty of Easter eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3HqhW"&gt;The new hardware that launched this week features the best looking Xbox Series X console and controllers we’ve seen so far, particularly the stylish &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714394/microsoft-xbox-20th-anniversary-controller-headset-design-preorder-date"&gt;translucent one&lt;/a&gt;. All of this new hardware also includes some hidden secrets, too. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/qvt8px/halo_20th_anniversary_xbox_has_a_hidden_zeta_halo/"&gt;Reddit users&lt;/a&gt; have discovered that the Halo-themed Xbox Series X console has a hidden Zeta Halo symbol on the front.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2tug0quW8M78OVWmwhx61Gcdc0I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024102/q2zdupwsq3081.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/qvt8px/halo_20th_anniversary_xbox_has_a_hidden_zeta_halo/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; (Demon_King_Lamb)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hidden Halo Zeta symbol.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H21EWe"&gt;You’ll need to shine a black or UV light on the console to actually see this little Easter egg, but it’s a neat touch for a limited edition 20th anniversary console that celebrates the launch of &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt; and the original Xbox in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6f9sN"&gt;That UV light will also come in handy if you’ve purchased a 20th anniversary Xbox controller. If you shine the UV light on the packaging that the controller ships with, you’ll see the original Duke controller that came with the original Xbox console in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="38qSWx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yes!!! And the new 20th anniversary Xbox controller, it has the old controller from 2001 when you shine the black light on it! &lt;a href="https://t.co/DriHhsIuen"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DriHhsIuen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Hannah (@Hannah31754354) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hannah31754354/status/1460398195121344514?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xoMOYa"&gt;The secrets don’t end there, either. If you were lucky enough to secure a Halo-themed Xbox Elite 2 controller, Microsoft has packed in a special code that lets you add a little controller charm to your guns inside &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. It’s perfect for the early &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782786/halo-infinite-multiplayer-available-download-launch"&gt;launch of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; that took place earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nu9OLS"&gt;The miniature controller will attach to your weapons in the multiplayer version of the game, bouncing around when you’re busy throwing grenades and using your melee button. If you purchase the NERF versions of the MA40 or the Bulldog SG, they also include a little charm for your weapons, and even unique weapon skins in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V7ABAg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is just the cutest thing ever!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you buy the Halo Elite Controller, you also get a little controller charm for your weapons in the game!   &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Halo?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Halo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HaloInfinite?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#HaloInfinite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HaloInfiniteMP?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#HaloInfiniteMP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Xbox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xboxse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@XboxSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/pnuO7WsdvT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pnuO7WsdvT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Wael (@WaelHasno) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WaelHasno/status/1460947943813431303?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xc3Dxn"&gt;Microsoft loves to hide little Xbox-related Easter eggs everywhere. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448039/20-year-old-xbox-easter-egg-developer-revealed"&gt;20-year-old Xbox Easter egg&lt;/a&gt; was discovered earlier this year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433228/microsoft-xbox-series-x-hidden-video-phil-spencer-july-2020"&gt;Xbox chief Phil Spencer hid the Xbox Series S on his shelf&lt;/a&gt; before it was officially announced. Master Chief is also hidden inside the Xbox One X riding a scorpion, or part of the fan on the Xbox Series X. We’ll keep our eyes peeled for any other 20th anniversary Xbox Easter eggs that Microsoft has hidden away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox November update brings quick controller swaps, lower latency, and accessibility tags</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D8G2dWpjhHxJwTHcByUlzkZb5rc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158728/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="takJ87"&gt;Microsoft is rolling out a new &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/11/17/november-xbox-update/?ocid=Updates_soc_omc_xbo__Photo_lrn_11.17.2"&gt;November update for Xbox&lt;/a&gt; consoles that will make it a lot easier to swap your controller between a console and a PC or laptop. Instead of having to trawl through menus to change connections, the update lets you switch between previously connected devices by simply double tapping the controller’s pair button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z6hIz2"&gt;This feature has been available on modern Xbox Series X / S controller since their launch last year, but the new firmware update brings this option to Xbox One controllers with Bluetooth support and the Xbox Elite 2 controller. However, you’ll only be able to use it to quickly switch between a Bluetooth device and an Xbox console, and not two Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uxlb1C"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;did you know Xbox controllers have a secret button feature? It lets you quickly switch between paired devices. Here’s how it works &lt;a href="https://t.co/fjJC9Dv0kA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fjJC9Dv0kA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1438826681725247496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NShbj3"&gt;The new firmware update also adds Dynamic Latency Input (DLI) to older Xbox One controllers, which reduces the input latency on controllers connected to Xbox Series X / S consoles to make gameplay more responsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohJQfa"&gt;Alongside the controller changes, Microsoft is also improving audio output settings on all Xbox consoles. New audio options include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735389/xbox-mutes-speakers-plug-in-headphones-skip-ahead-ring"&gt;ability to mute speaker audio when a headset is attached&lt;/a&gt;, useful if you’re playing at night and don’t want to disturb family members or neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mW8sAkHDHZYGnSNrrgFHGDcjV1U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024099/02_AudioSettings_Additional_Options.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Xbox audio options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PIPrPJ"&gt;New color filters are also part of this update for Xbox Series X / S consoles, which will help players with color blindness or color vision deficiency. Microsoft is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22702660/xbox-games-accessibility-feature-tags"&gt;allowing game developers to tag their titles&lt;/a&gt; with up to 20 accessibility features which will make it a lot easier for people with disabilities to find which games support these visual, audio, and input tweaks. More than 325 games are supported right now, and filtering options will be available in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ks1OKE"&gt;This latest dashboard update also includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787396/xbox-cloud-gaming-consoles-series-x-s-one"&gt;Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) integration&lt;/a&gt;, allowing older Xbox One consoles to play Xbox Series X games. The feature requires a Game Pass Ultimate subscription and will be available in 25 regions, and a subset of Xbox owners can start trying it out with the November update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3XPmG"&gt;Microsoft’s new November Xbox update is available right now for all Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
