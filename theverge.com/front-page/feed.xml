    <title>Hyundai stops making the Kona EV for South Korea after battery recall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pPNLRfEOUqa5Lok-uW5UsJkZnt0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166116/akrales_180329_2351_1035.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6a3MIM"&gt;Hyundai is discontinuing its first mass-market electric SUV, the Kona EV, in South Korea following a massive recall due to a fire risk in the battery pack, the &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210421006400320"&gt;Yonhap news agency reports&lt;/a&gt;. The automaker will instead turn its focus to the forthcoming Ioniq 5 (and the EVs that will follow it), though Hyundai will still sell the Kona EV in the United States, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/hyundai-kona-electric-discontinued-battery-fire-recalls/?PostType=link&amp;amp;TheTime=2021-04-21T20%3A06%3A46&amp;amp;ftag=COS-05-10aaa0b&amp;amp;UniqueID=19DEE852-A2DD-11EB-B8AB-C34416F31EAE&amp;amp;ServiceType=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roadshow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mg2tuB"&gt;More than a dozen reports of fires in Kona EV battery packs have been documented since 2019, and so this February, Hyundai finally decided to spend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299121/hyundai-kona-electric-recall-battery-fire-lg"&gt;nearly $1 billion to recall 76,000 Kona EVs across its home country&lt;/a&gt; (though &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/03/04/hyundai-profit-electric-car-recall-lg-chem/"&gt;battery supplier LG Chem is contributing a big portion&lt;/a&gt;). It also recalled some Ioniq sedans and electric buses that used the same battery technology. Sales of the Kona EV &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/hyundai-kona-electric-discontinued-battery-fire-recalls/?PostType=link&amp;amp;TheTime=2021-04-21T20%3A06%3A46&amp;amp;ftag=COS-05-10aaa0b&amp;amp;UniqueID=19DEE852-A2DD-11EB-B8AB-C34416F31EAE&amp;amp;ServiceType=twitter"&gt;dropped dramatically following the recall&lt;/a&gt;, and some owners have said the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hyundai-motor-electric-recall/kona-ev-owners-say-hyundai-mishandling-recall-for-battery-fires-idUSKBN2BG3ET"&gt;process of getting the battery replaced has been a mess&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFSBjt"&gt;Hyundai &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2019/HYUNDAI/KONA%252520ELECTRIC#recalls"&gt;officially started the recall process&lt;/a&gt; for the Kona EV in the US in March, and the company has been notifying owners since early April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B14TYM"&gt;One reason Hyundai may still be exporting Kona EVs to places like the US is that, just before the original recall in February, it announced &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2022-hyundai-kona-electric-ev-suv-new-look-tech/"&gt;a refreshed version of the electric SUV with a facelift and various tech upgrades&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also still one of the more affordable electric vehicles on the market in North America that has more than 250 miles of range. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Call of Duty: Warzone now has 100 million players — as does Apex Legends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wDxeAkUL2LBYDA9ztV2p5o8u8Q4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166034/04C_IN_GAME_MODES_BR_TOUT.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Activision&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lnZNYq"&gt;In the battle royale of battle royale games, there doesn’t need to be a single winner. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; now has 100 million players, the same number &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;achieved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382560/apex-legends-100-million-players-respawn-ea"&gt;just a week ago&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2KMFl"&gt;They can share a victory royale with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite, &lt;/em&gt;with its 350 million-plus players (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249497/fortnite-350-million-registered-players-hours-played-april"&gt;as of May 2020&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the original &lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds,&lt;/em&gt; which has sold north of &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/pubg-sales"&gt;70 million copies on console and PC&lt;/a&gt;, and its free-to-play &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; variant &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pubg-mobile-five-billion-revenue"&gt;reportedly raked in $5 billion last year&lt;/a&gt; ($7.4 million per day). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hzDBUA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;100 million players and counting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you all for dropping in. It wouldn't be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Warzone&lt;/a&gt; without you. &lt;a href="https://t.co/knanptnCMU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/knanptnCMU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Call of Duty ☢️ (@CallofDuty) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1384582733830176769?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jf722F"&gt;If you’re counting, &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; is growing faster than &lt;em&gt;Apex&lt;/em&gt;, though. It took two years for &lt;em&gt;Apex&lt;/em&gt; to hit 100 million, but it’s been just over a year since &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;’s March 2020 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNGHE2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;will kick off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391634/apex-legends-mobile-beta"&gt;a beta for its own mobile game&lt;/a&gt; later this month, as well as jumping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323591/apex-legends-switch-port-cross-progression-purchases-fortnite"&gt;onto the Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple targeted in $50 million ransomware attack resulting in unprecedented schematic leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LBYgVBc3Ek8Dec1w5qjVOtYcv8g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165959/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ApmGF9"&gt;Apple has been targeted in a $50 million ransomware attack following the theft of a trove of engineering and manufacturing schematics of current and future products from Quanta, a Taiwan-based company that manufactures MacBooks and other products for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJXze0"&gt;The leak, &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/ransomware-gang-tries-to-extort-apple-hours-ahead-of-spring-loaded-event/"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was carried out by REvil, a Russian hacking group that’s also known by the name Sodinokibi. The group had already begun posting the stolen images on April 20th, timed specifically to coincide with Apple’s latest “Spring Loaded” event, after Quanta refused to pay the $50 million ransom for the data. The group is now hoping to get Apple itself to pay up by May 1st, promising to continue to post new images from the leak daily until it does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsdD19"&gt;Quanta has confirmed that its servers were breached &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-21/apple-targeted-in-50-million-ransomware-hack-of-supplier-quanta"&gt;in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, commenting: “Quanta Computer’s information security team has worked with external IT experts in response to cyber attacks on a small number of Quanta servers.” Quanta also says “there’s no material impact on the company’s business operation” as a result of the hack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1jVkRa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The documents appear to be accurate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="knvHRM"&gt;REvil has a history of similar ransomware attacks, &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt; points out, with the group also carrying out similar hacks on &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/computer-giant-acer-hit-by-50-million-ransomware-attack/"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/leading-cosmetics-group-pierre-fabre-hit-with-25-million-ransomware-attack/"&gt;other companies&lt;/a&gt; in the past several months. But the Quanta attack — by virtue of its connection to Apple and the potential to reveal unannounced Apple hardware — marks the group’s highest-profile target yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7QZvI"&gt;The company hasn’t clarified the extent of the leak yet, but images leaked by REvil so far include schematics for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Apple’s just-revealed iMac redesign&lt;/a&gt; — which, prior to yesterday, hadn’t been seen by anyone outside of Apple’s sphere of influence, lending credence to the fact that the documents are indeed accurate. The schematics also include warnings on nearly every page: “This is the property of Apple and it must be returned,” and they specify that the documents are not to be reproduced, copied, or published. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oA7P5h"&gt;Also contained within the revealed files are manufacturing diagrams for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s already-released 2020 M1 MacBook Air refresh&lt;/a&gt; and an as-yet-unreleased laptop that features additional ports in line with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;existing rumors for the upcoming laptop refresh&lt;/a&gt; from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEGHhr"&gt;These documents were stolen and are being leaked to extort Apple and Quanta. Due to the nature of their origin, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/12/7384871/why-were-reporting-on-sony-leak-hack-ethics-mpaa"&gt;we believe it would be unethical&lt;/a&gt; to extensively report on their contents. We’ve reached out to Apple for comment and will update this post with any new information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brydge’s new keyboard for the M1 iPad makes it more MacBook-like than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KLmXH6d9BXFWlQZZxe4MTGLxlcA=/55x0:1045x660/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165808/BRY_129_MAX_Plus_filler_01.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6W9KkO"&gt;Brydge is announcing a keyboard and trackpad accessory for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/21/brydge-unveils-new-max-keyboard-trackpad-combo-for-12-9-inch-ipad-pro/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"&gt;the company’s previous accessories&lt;/a&gt;, the Brydge 12.9 Max Plus will let you take your iPad from being a tablet to a laptop, just by connecting it to the accessory. With Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;new M1-powered iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, some might already be thinking about using it to make a MacBook replacement, while others may just be excited for the way you can now neatly attach it via magnets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qznUJg"&gt;The answer to whether this will help replace your MacBook with an iPad is more or less &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22391979/apple-ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air-2021-anouncement"&gt;what it’s always been&lt;/a&gt;: it depends on whether you can do all your work with what’s available on iPadOS. The iPad Pro has been more powerful than a lot of MacBooks for years, but hardware is only part of the equation. While the 12.9-inch iPad Pro may now have a processor as fast as a MacBook’s and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;a better screen&lt;/a&gt; to boot, it’s still using an OS that, for some, won’t be able to fully take advantage of those features. If you’re fine with the limitations of iPadOS, then the Brydge 12.9 Max Plus could be a new solution for taking the iPad into laptop mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AddzH"&gt;The iPad will attach to the new Max Plus magnetically, instead of using the clamp system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"&gt;used by previous Brydge keyboards&lt;/a&gt;. That system required you to wedge your expensive tablet between clamps that then held onto that breakable glass — a nerve-wracking and not terribly pleasant experience. This brings Brydge’s offering more in line with the Magic Keyboard, and users will likely appreciate increased ease in switching between laptop and tablet mode. Easy, magnetic attachment is something that’s generally been associated with Apple’s iPad keyboards instead of third-party ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaE9AZ"&gt;While Brydge’s built-in trackpads have generally not compared favorably to Apple’s, the company is hoping to change that by adding native multitouch support. With the Max Plus, Brydge is also playing the size comparison game — its trackpad is the largest on an iPad keyboard, according to the company’s site. That may be a nice bonus if you’re the type of person who likes to use the mouse a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLuQap"&gt;The Brydge 12.9 Max Plus is available for preorder &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-12-9-max-plus%3Fvariant%3D39379780075625&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22396039%2Fbrydge-keyboard-magnetic-tablet-laptop-m1-ipad-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Brydge’s site&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s expected to ship in June. It comes in three color options (space gray, silver, and white) and costs $249.99 — $100 cheaper than &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJQJ3LL%2FA%2Fmagic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-11-inch-3rd-generation-and-ipad-air-4th-generation-us-english&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22396039%2Fbrydge-keyboard-magnetic-tablet-laptop-m1-ipad-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s ethical AI researchers complained of harassment long before Timnit Gebru’s firing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G0C3OTOYIsbqoozEDbopsQQ-9-g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165743/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="snJ16V"&gt;Google’s AI leadership came under fire in December when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;star ethics researcher Timnit Gebru was abruptly fired&lt;/a&gt; while working on a paper about the dangers of large language models. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-21/google-ethical-ai-group-s-turmoil-began-long-before-public-unraveling?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new reporting from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests the turmoil began long before her termination — and includes allegations of bias and sexual harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yOI63"&gt;Shortly after Gebru arrived at Google in 2018, she informed her boss that a colleague had been accused of sexual harassment at another organization. Katherine Heller, a Google researcher, reported the same incident, which included allegations of inappropriate touching. Google immediately opened an investigation into the man’s behavior. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; did not name the man accused of harassment, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; does not know his identity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXPKW9"&gt;The allegations coincided with an even more explosive story. Andy Rubin, the “father of Android” had received &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html"&gt;a $90 million exit package despite being credibly accused of sexual misconduct&lt;/a&gt;. The news sparked outrage at Google, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18057716/google-walkout-20-thousand-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai-meeting"&gt;20,000 employees walked out of work&lt;/a&gt; to protest the company’s handling of sexual harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeMChr"&gt;Gebru and Margaret Mitchell, co-lead of the ethical AI team, went to AI chief Jeff Dean with a “litany of concerns,” according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. They told Dean about the colleague who’d been accused of harassment, and said there was a perceived pattern of women being excluded and undermined on the research team. Some were given lower roles than men, despite having better qualifications. Mitchell also said she’d been denied a promotion due to “nebulous complaints to HR about her personality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NibrGh"&gt;Dean was skeptical about the harassment allegations but said he would investigate, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports. He pushed back on the idea that there was a pattern of women on the research team getting lower-level positions than men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RScxFP"&gt;After the meeting, Dean announced a new research project with the alleged harasser at the helm. Nine months later, the man was fired for “leadership issues,” according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. He’d been accused of misconduct at Google, although the investigation was still ongoing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Fa13m"&gt;After the man was fired, he threatened to sue Google. The legal team told employees who’d spoken out about his conduct that they might hear from the man’s lawyers. The company was “vague” about whether it would defend the whistleblowers, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zH0njI"&gt;The harassment allegation was not an isolated incident. Gebru and her co-workers reported additional claims of inappropriate behavior and bullying after the initial accusation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7e4eXF"&gt;Gebru said there were also ongoing issues with getting Google to respect the ethical AI team’s work. When she tried to look into a dataset released by Google’s self-driving car company Waymo, the project became mired in “legal haggling.” Gebru wanted to explore how skin tone impacted Waymo’s pedestrian-detection technology. “Waymo employees peppered the team with inquiries, including why they were interested in skin color and what they were planning to do with the results,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZMeUy"&gt;After Gebru went public about her firing, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309962/timnit-gebru-google-harassment-campaign-jeff-dean"&gt;she received an onslaught of harassment&lt;/a&gt; from people who claimed that she was trying to get attention and play the victim. The latest news further validates her response that the issues she raised were part of a pattern of alleged bias on the research team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="72sc8C"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NFL RedZone is coming to Hulu’s live TV service in time for the 2021 season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rah4qH"&gt;NFL fans will have another place they can watch NFL RedZone and the NFL Network next season, as both channels are coming to the Hulu with Live TV plan &lt;a href="https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/NFL-Media-and-Hulu-Reach-Carriage-Agreement.aspx"&gt;by August 1st&lt;/a&gt;. NFL Network will be included in the base package, while NFL RedZone will be offered at an additional cost, Hulu tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDLaEW"&gt;Hulu isn’t the only streaming service where you can get the NFL channels, as they are also available on YouTube TV, Sling, and fuboTV. And similarly, only NFL Network is part of the base subscriptions for these services — you’ll have to pay for sports-focused add-ons to get access to NFL RedZone. But if Hulu with Live TV is your preferred live TV streaming service, now you don’t have to go somewhere else to get your NFL channel fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgY8zS"&gt;The NFL’s deal with Hulu comes weeks after the league signed new streaming deals &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339636/nfl-streaming-deals-amazon-peacock-paramount-tubi-espn-plus"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;, which included Amazon getting exclusive rights to &lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt; starting with the 2023 season. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Microsoft Classroom Pen 2 is an affordable Surface Pen for students</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vdDhDLubfo02J6AnGhbWEIosAnM=/67x0:787x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165390/Picture1.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iGOAiA"&gt;Microsoft is releasing a new stylus for classroom use: the Classroom Pen 2. The pen will be available on April 27th and will be sold directly to schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NMCWq"&gt;The company launched its first &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-launches-40-classroom-pen-for-students"&gt;Classroom Pen&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. That stylus sold for $39.99 per unit. It was compatible with any device that supported the MPP protocol (including a number of non-Surface Windows devices). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3Wg5D"&gt;Microsoft is going even more budget with this release. The Pen 2 will be sold to schools in packs of 20 for $399.80, which works out to $19.99 per pen. Per &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2021/04/21/best-in-class-microsoft-classroom-pen-2-empowers-every-student-to-achieve-more/"&gt;Microsoft’s blog post&lt;/a&gt;, however, it seems like this pen may only be optimized for Microsoft’s own Surface Pro and Surface Go devices — other Windows devices aren’t mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CfDLkd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p_j3aPr_y6k?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mclcpW"&gt;Microsoft claims that the device has an “improved design” from the &lt;a href="https://www.connection.com/product/microsoft-surface-classroom-pen-20-pack-black/nwh-00001/36623795"&gt;previous model&lt;/a&gt;, though the announcement doesn’t share many specifics. It looks like the Pen 2 is a different color and has a pen clip to attach to a Surface Type Cover. The company also says the new device has a longer enclosure “to optimize for grip strength.” Sure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIpvxC"&gt;Like its predecessor, the Pen 2 appears to have two buttons. It also shares some classroom-specific features with the Classroom Pen: it ships with replacement tips and has a slot that teachers can loop a string through to tether the pen to a Surface device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3izap"&gt;The release is part of Microsoft’s long-standing push to challenge Chromebooks in the education sphere. (Those devices had their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22256873/chromebook-best-year-ever-double-yearly-sales"&gt;best year ever&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, as many students around the world began attending class from home.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="086Oju"&gt;Microsoft has worked with partners like Acer, Dell, and Lenovo to release dozens of &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Feducation%2Fdevices%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sub-$500 Windows PCs&lt;/a&gt; in the past few years, alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18192906/microsoft-classroom-pen-chromebook-challenge-devices-2019"&gt;updates to Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt; that are tailored to classroom use. Stylus support can be a must-have for students who want to draw graphs and take notes on their laptops, and widely distributing Surface Pens could certainly save teachers some paper and ink. And if you’re an average Joe like me who just really wants to play around with a $20 stylus, it’s time to make friends with some neighborhood teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is now letting everyone tweet pictures in 4K on Android and iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VY-VwER3PIt-1bIIRkD8_ZY7cig=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165104/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5PsRbk"&gt;Get ready for Twitter to start looking a whole lot crisper — starting today, the company is letting all users tweet (and view) pictures in 4K on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwChR2"&gt;Twitter’s web app already supports higher-resolution images (at up to 4096 x 4096 resolution), but the mobile apps had been limited to just half that, with a maximum resolution of 2048 x 2048. The company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;previously started testing&lt;/a&gt; the 4K image upload option for mobile users earlier this year, and it seems those tests went well, as its now rolling out the feature to all users starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VlbVFU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter tries to fix problematic image crops by not cropping pictures anymore","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="A4zU7W"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Time to Tweet those high res pics –– the option to upload and view 4K images on Android and iOS is now available for everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To start uploading and viewing images in 4K, update your high-quality image preferences in “Data usage” settings. &lt;a href="https://t.co/XDnWOji3nx"&gt;https://t.co/XDnWOji3nx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1384945690304995330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kp7iRF"&gt;In order to enable the new feature, users will have to go to the “data usage” section of the settings menu in the Twitter app and enable both “high-quality images” (for viewing 4K images) and “high-quality image uploads” (for tweeting them). Users can select whether they’d like the higher-resolution images to be enabled for both cellular and Wi-Fi, just Wi-Fi, or disabled entirely — similar options to how Twitter handles higher resolution or auto-playing video. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon One’s palm-scanning payments are coming to Whole Foods</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/llAxwqjmYI5iO1wIK8ztN7j6b10=/213x0:2403x1460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165024/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_2.41.16_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vCfg9W"&gt;Amazon One is &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-one-continues-expansion-now-available-as-a-contactless-payment-option-at-initial-whole-foods-market-store-in-seattle"&gt;expanding to its biggest area yet&lt;/a&gt;: the company is now testing its palm-scanning payment technology in Whole Foods, starting with a single store in Amazon’s home city of Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBVdiW"&gt;The company has been using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496673/amazon-one-palm-reading-vein-recognition-payments-identity-verification"&gt;Amazon One payment technology&lt;/a&gt; in its Amazon-branded stores in the Seattle area (including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493094/amazon-one-palm-recognition-hand-payments-amazon-go-store"&gt;Amazon Go&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321268/amazon-one-seattle-stores-palm-recognition-payment-technology"&gt;Amazon Books&lt;/a&gt;), but the Whole Foods rollout will make the most substantial expansion of the technology yet. The company says that thousands of customers have already signed up with Amazon One. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZYaFYi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s palm reading starts at the grocery store, but it could be so much bigger","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496673/amazon-one-palm-reading-vein-recognition-payments-identity-verification"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GPlx6n"&gt;According to an Amazon FAQ, the palm-scanning technology analyzes “the minute characteristics of your palm — both surface-area details like lines and ridges as well as subcutaneous features such as vein patterns” in order to identify a customer, allowing them to use the biometric scan as an alternative (and, theoretically, faster) method of checking out than fumbling around with a credit card or cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eSt5y"&gt;Customers will be able to register their palms at kiosks in the supported Whole Foods stores, allowing them to associate a physical credit card to that palm scan. (Amazon One users who have already registered may have to re-link their cards once to be able to use them at Whole Foods.) And of course, Amazon One users will be able to link their Prime accounts to their scans to get the subscription service’s discounts when shopping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fv4KHm"&gt;Amazon One will debut at the Madison Broadway Whole Foods in Seattle as an additional payment option for customers, with plans to expand it to seven other Whole Foods stores in the Seattle area over the next few months. Amazon hasn’t announced plans to further build out the palm-scanning payment system outside of the Seattle area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQmm7l"&gt;All of this, of course, assumes that you’re OK with Amazon building an ever-larger database of biometric information linked to its customers, something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496673/amazon-one-palm-reading-vein-recognition-payments-identity-verification"&gt;that some experts have raised concerns about&lt;/a&gt;. That’s particularly true given that Amazon’s data — unlike other biometric security systems, like Apple’s Face ID — is stored in on the cloud, rather than secured locally on a specific device. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chromebook users will soon be able to auto-caption any media playing in their browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bO7JMaZ3Ova6imMC-CpEC5aQrXg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164871/mchin_181029_4126_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I9y6oi"&gt;Google has announced &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-gets-a-little-more-helpful/"&gt;some new features&lt;/a&gt; coming to Chromebooks, including the company’s Live Captions feature that will be added to Chrome on “most” Chrome OS devices in the coming weeks. Once Live Captions are available, users can flip them on in the accessibility settings to get captions for any media with audio right inside their browser. The feature rolled out to Chrome on Windows, Mac, and Linux &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22337074/chrome-real-time-live-captions-audio-accessibility"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Kt1nQ"&gt;Google is also beefing up the Chrome OS Launcher, which lets you search for files and apps, with some new capabilities, allowing you make simple calculations and check the weather, the definition of a word, and stock prices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BnZwiznehJdWtY7fZgREme0lLB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22460117/Launcher_inline_image_Cy9giIb.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Searching for weather in the Launcher.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GycipM"&gt;The search giant is also adding a new Diagnostics app to Chrome OS that lets you check the status of and run tests on your computer’s battery, CPU, and memory. That means that if your battery isn’t holding a charge for as long as you think it should, you can run a battery discharge test in the Diagnostics app to see if something’s wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRhYOM"&gt;The new launcher capabilities and the Diagnostics app aren’t yet available for a colleague of mine running Chrome OS, but Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the release begins rolling out today. So if you don’t have the new features just yet, you might just need to hang tight until you get the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrpHDX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 21st, 3:41PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added information about the rollout from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
