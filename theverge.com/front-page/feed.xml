    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;But Instagram downplays the changes&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="qi5ZZ1"&gt;Instagram users around the platform share one central concern right now: that the app’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585623/instagram-sensitive-content-control-setting-explore-tab-limit-offensive-posts"&gt;sensitive content filter&lt;/a&gt; is blocking their posts. In posts on both the feed and in Stories, account holders are warning their followers that the setting is limiting their reach and that their followers should disable the filter to ensure their posts get through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajZ68h"&gt;“Over the past 24 hours, I’ve had many conversations with artists and other creators who are incredibly frustrated by having their work hidden,” &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/phillip.miner/"&gt;Phillip Miner&lt;/a&gt;, an artist and the creator of queer hobby magazine &lt;em&gt;Natural Pursuits&lt;/em&gt;, wrote in a post. “Conversely, people are frustrated that they can’t find the content the want to see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWjWwV"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRmaR0Uh637/"&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; of his alerting people to the filter has reached over 700,000 people and has been shared 192,000 times as of this morning, he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. People from all sorts of communities, including the art world, sex workers, tattoo artists, and the cannabis industry have picked up on it, sharing similar concerns, he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jL0WsU"&gt;An account for a gun holster company makes a similar warning in its own post, saying  content about “guns” and “capitalism” might be hidden. If there’s a unifying cause on Instagram right now, it’s around the sensitivity filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A43J1Y"&gt;The sensitivity filter, which was introduced Tuesday, allows people to set limits around how much potentially sensitive content they might see on their Explore page. It’s supposed to filter out things like self-harm content, and it’s turned on by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrbO4J"&gt;But Instagram says that creators shouldn’t worry. The app already limited the amount of sensitive content people see on their Explore page, and the default setting retains that filtering. With the options introduced Tuesday, people can now either further limit sensitive content or allow more of it to surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvmP1A"&gt;A spokesperson suggests to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that some users could even see a bump in discoverability because of this change if people opt into allowing more sensitive content on their Explore page. The change will have “no impact” on what users see in their feed or in Stories, “where we will continue showing them posts from people they follow,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ri2T57"&gt;Sensitive content is defined by Instagram in its “&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/313829416281232"&gt;Recommendation Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;,” which only pertains to content that is recommended in places like Explore and IGTV Discover and is much broader than its “Community Guidelines.” Content that is considered sensitive is still allowed on the app, as opposed to content that violates its Community Guidelines, but Instagram might surface it less frequently, particularly for users who set their sensitivity limits to the lowest level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibr3UO"&gt;A spokesperson didn’t offer specifics around how much sensitive content users could expect to see in their Explore page at any of the three available settings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AHKvfA"&gt;Miner points out, however, that regardless of the filter, bucketing all sensitive content under one broad phrase is the bigger issue. His work often shows nudity, for example, which, if sexually explicit or suggestive, is considered sensitive by Instagram, but he says some people might be okay with nude art while also not wanting to see content that depicts violence, which also falls under sensitive content. The same could be said of tobacco-related content or content related to pharmaceutical drugs, both of which are considered sensitive content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxoMMs"&gt;“What I would love to see is, there’s so much that falls under the umbrella of sensitive content, being able to tailor your experience more,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="S9voUe"&gt;Instagram clearly attempted to give people more control, but it stayed too broad, at least in Miner’s opinion. The platform also isn’t clear with people who want to disable the filter as to whether they’ll suddenly see lots of unwanted weight loss content or violent images. Though ultimately much of Instagram won’t change with this new setting, the communication about it should.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Unite turns monster battles into a team sport</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E-Xyh3SynIjahy1s396GuFDs4kQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69623068/Pokemon_UNITE___Team_Up._Take_Down.___Hero_Image___1080p.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SNDqmh"&gt;Games like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; are massively popular, and have been for the better part of a decade. But they can also be impenetrable to new players and viewers: there are so many characters and strategies that figuring out what’s happening on-screen is a huge challenge. The just-launched &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; aims to fix that. It doesn’t just add cute monsters to the genre, but also some clever fixes to streamline it and make things more approachable. It’s kind of like a mashup of a strategy game and basketball, but with a Gengar thrown in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5VkaP"&gt;For the uninitiated, a MOBA — or multiplayer online battle arena, to use the genre’s unnecessarily long full name — is a five-on-five competition where the goal, usually, is to destroy the opposing team’s base. You do this by forming a squad of characters, each with their own unique abilities, which you use to steadily destroy towers and level up so you can push your way into your opponent’s territory. It’s often slow and methodical, a genre that rewards smart decisions as well as quick reflexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HE7jzq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unite&lt;/em&gt; has many of these elements, including a varied cast of monsters to choose from. Charmander is a good all-around melee fighter, for instance, while Venasaur is better for ranged attacks. There are support characters and ones designed for defense. In a nice twist, many of the creatures will evolve over the course of the match. It’s fun starting out as a squat little Gible and ending the match as an imposing Garchomp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xSerpB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j86TTIMWBYY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pAtyYq"&gt;But the most interesting aspects of &lt;em&gt;Unite&lt;/em&gt; are where it differs from the traditional MOBA. For starters, instead of trying to destroy your opponents’ base, you’re scoring points. To do this, you have to defeat wild pokémon that spawn throughout the arena to earn points, which you then take to one of the opponent’s goal circles to score. Drop enough points to destroy a circle and you can move on to the next. It’s similar to how MOBAs usually work, but it’s also a lot simpler to understand. And the system also adds some new drama: if you’re killed, you’ll lose a big chunk of the points you’re holding, which makes things very tense if you have a lot stacked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bly9x4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"League of Legends: Wild Rift makes one of the world’s biggest games more accessible","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358213/league-of-legends-wild-rift-iphone-android-preview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kc76u1"&gt;The other nice thing about the game is that it has a strict time limit. Whereas a &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; match can stretch to close to an hour if it’s tightly contested, a single &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; match takes exactly 10 minutes. Once the timer runs down, whichever team has the most points wins. (Some matches can actually be shorter; I’ve already played a few where the other team forfeited early because of a lopsided score.) The time limit and points system make &lt;em&gt;Unite&lt;/em&gt; feel a bit more like a virtual sport, albeit one with experience points and spawning monsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hud93p"&gt;This idea of streamlining a MOBA isn’t exactly new. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/3/8712733/heroes-of-the-storm-review"&gt;Blizzard tried it with &lt;em&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Riot did something similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358213/league-of-legends-wild-rift-iphone-android-preview"&gt;when it brought &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; to mobile with the spinoff &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But, at least from what I’ve played so far, &lt;em&gt;Unite&lt;/em&gt; seems the most approachable. The rules are easy to understand, the matches are short and intense, and the world is already something millions of people know and love. So far, the only real issue I’ve run into is the copious amounts of virtual currency you can earn or buy. It gets weirdly complicated, to the point that you can spend as much time messing around in battle pass menus as actually playing the game. It doesn’t seem like you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to buy anything, but some of the fashion options are pretty tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1m6gK"&gt;Right now, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; is available as a free download on the Nintendo Switch, but it’s poised to become even bigger when it debuts on mobile in September (with crossplay and cross progression at launch). Developer TiMi, an internal studio at Tencent, already operates two of the biggest games in the world with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22340775/honor-of-kings-burberry-skin-fashion-video-games"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The combination of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; and MOBA could soon add a third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5Yymh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workers for Google Pittsburgh contractor HCL reach tentative union contract</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KF4y2MO_xBj0EI8H_WiPNx3h9pE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622797/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tC3WNl"&gt;The United Steelworkers Union (USW) &lt;a href="https://www.usw.org/news/media-center/releases/2021/usws-tentative-first-contract-with-tech-firm-hcl-improves-wages-job-security"&gt;said Friday&lt;/a&gt; it has reached a tentative contract deal with a sub-contractor for Google Pittsburgh. The announcement comes almost two years after employees of engineering and IT contractor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20882206/google-tech-contractors-union-vote-pittsburgh-united-steelworkers"&gt;HCL Technologies voted to unionize&lt;/a&gt;, saying that even though they worked alongside Google employees, they didn’t receive the same benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLtTx5"&gt;Amanda Parks, a member of the USW bargaining committee who works at HCL, said in a statement that the proposed three-year contract includes “meaningful wage increases” and addresses pay parity concerns. It includes language that offers job security and additional time off, according to the statement. “We work hard, and we deserve what all workers deserve, an agreement that reflects our important contributions to the company’s success,” Parks said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35BZRk"&gt;The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21509201/google-union-nlrb-hcl-america-offshoring-pittsburgh-organizing"&gt;filed a complaint against HCL&lt;/a&gt; in October, claiming that the company was outsourcing the Pittsburgh workers’ jobs in retaliation for union activity. According to the complaint, HCL failed to bargain with the Pittsburgh workers and transferred their work to offshore workers in Poland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcfmZy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html"&gt;Google’s contractor workforce&lt;/a&gt; has grown significantly over the past several years, to the point it’s nearly as large as its full-time workforce, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1FO3L"&gt;The tentative contract covers about 65 employees based in Pittsburgh and is scheduled for a ratification vote on July 30th. The contract would take effect immediately if it is ratified, the union said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGkleH"&gt;Google and HCL did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cp8xI9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="u9w6H7"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where our editors discuss the biggest stories in tech news this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyKtHh"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the show is split into three sections, hosted by &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;executive editor&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Dieter Bohn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pxt3rJ"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/7h77z4aQfhQHEtUiF8LEnr" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lPc2PF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqIewD"&gt;In part one, Dieter and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; managing editor Alex Cranz chat with &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;policy editor Russell Brandom to talk about President Biden’s criticism of Facebook’s handling of misinformation on its platform, the continuing fight for the right to repair, and the nomination of Google critic Jonathan Kanter to lead the Department of Justice’s antitrust division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wAnJ2C"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580620/biden-facebook-vaccine-misinformation-platforms"&gt;Biden says platforms like Facebook are ‘killing people’ with COVID-19 misinformation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lS3cyC"&gt;In section two, Dieter talks with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; deputy editor Liz Lopatto and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; space reporter Joey Roulette about Jeff Bezos’ trip to the edge of space Tuesday morning on Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOLHwu"&gt;Liz and Joey discuss details of the launch, the other members of the crew like aviation legend Wally Funk, the press conference after landing, and the backlash from the people back on Earth. Joey also describes his experience being at the launch site in person and asking Bezos some questions about pricing for these space flights. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="2idpFW"&gt;If you’re a listener of &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, you may have guessed the topics for our third segment this week — RCS and gadgets. On Tuesday, Verizon announced it will be switching to Android Messages as the default texting app on all Android phones it sells — which is a big step for pushing RCS as the new texting standard. Dieter and Alex discuss what this means for the texting platform and how Apple is still in the way of full adoption in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mN1Dpa"&gt;There are also a bunch of gadgets to talk about! Alex and Dieter discuss the video game handheld the Playdate, OnePlus’ Buds Pro, and Amazon’s latest announcements for developers on its Echo products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Z2Pqte"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584443/verizon-android-messages-rcs"&gt;Verizon is also switching to Android Messages as default for RCS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>The pandemic made it even harder to check on the ocean’s vital signs   </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GERMANY-SCIENCE-ARCTIC-CLIMATE-POLARSTERN" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GCX5sj9RF-S-c1kXTmfmlg004h8=/0x27:5517x3705/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622765/1229021779.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A man takes a picture of German icebreaker and research vessel “Polarstern” upon arrival at the harbour of nothern German town of Bremerhaven, on October 12, 2020, after a year-long mission, the biggest Arctic expedition in history, bringing home observations from scientists that sea ice is melting at a “dramatic rate” in the region. - The researchers’ observations have been backed up by US satellite images showing that in 2020, sea ice in the Arctic reached its second-lowest summer minimum on record, after 2012. The Polarstern mission, dubbed MOSAIC, spent 389 days collecting data on the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and ecosystems to help assess the impact of climate change on the region and the world.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h3z4Uq"&gt;After taking a hit during the pandemic, the coming months will be a crucial time for ocean research. People rely on data collected at sea for weather forecasts, understanding climate change, and keeping coastal economies afloat. To make that happen, scientists keep track of everything from the temperatures to salinity and oxygen levels in the deep. But the COVID-19 crisis interrupted research around the world, and ocean scientists are trying to recover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="9r9XbJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The coming months will be a crucial time for ocean research&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JbeMYd"&gt;“Overnight, our vessel transformed from a research ship observing a decade’s worth of ocean changes, into a simple express steam home,” Leticia Barbero, an assistant scientist at the University of Miami, said in a June 2020 &lt;a href="https://en.unesco.org/news/covid-19-disruptions-ocean-observations-could-threaten-weather-forecast-and-climate-change"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. She and her team rushed to deploy autonomous instruments to keep taking measurements for climate and weather forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXdzva"&gt;Despite the best efforts of Barbero and her fellow researchers, throughout 2020 and the first part of 2021, there was a 10 percent decrease in real-time data collected from the world’s ocean-observing networks, according to a &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/state-of-global-ocean-observing-system-2021-%E2%80%93-recovering-from-pandemic?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wmo%2FapqD+%28World+Meteorological+Organization+News%29"&gt;report card&lt;/a&gt; recently released by the Global Ocean Observing System’s Observations Coordination Group. Some networks saw bigger losses. What’s potentially more worrying is that there was a 15 to 20 percent drop in vital maintenance operations, which could endanger more data collection moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmN1EX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Mathieu Belbéoch, a technical coordinator and lead at the OceanOPS, the joint World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and UNESCO Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission about what happened last year and what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGkcva"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FanKn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do scientists usually gather data in the ocean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqHydk"&gt;Some instruments are set on board ships, mainly merchant ships. That’s the historical network of the WMO. The ship captains are capturing meteorological observations and logging that. This has been modernized and all that now is shared in real time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fv3IcT"&gt;Then there are surface drifters, that are drifting with the surface current. Many are used for meteorology. Then you have a set of moored buoys — a lot at the coastal level, but there’s also a very important network in the tropical bound in particular to monitor El Nino. And then there is the &lt;a href="https://argo.ucsd.edu/"&gt;Argo network&lt;/a&gt;, kind of a revolutionary network that was raised about 20 years ago to measure the entire water column with robots going up and down from the surface. There are 4,000 of these. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFWScR"&gt;All that is completed by a set of other systems — research vessels, some ocean gliders that you can steer a little bit. And also some animals are used to make measurements — elephant seals mainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kraUD7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What impact has the pandemic had on all of these observation networks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FT34jq"&gt;It’s a question we’ve been asked a lot in the last year or so. There was clearly some impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SD52rS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have to be a bit creative”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3hEMwq"&gt;The main impact was the lack of ship time available, which makes our lives harder. Some ships are used to make measurements but also to deploy those buoys. So we have to be a bit creative and we have been using some sailing boats, we’ve been partnering with some skippers. The &lt;a href="https://www.volvogroup.com/en/about-us/history-and-r-d-milestones/volvo-ocean-race.html"&gt;Volvo nautical race&lt;/a&gt; around the world, they have been deploying instruments for us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpAO7F"&gt;In terms of data, we see a little loss. One network that suffered is a network called Ship of Opportunity Program (SOOP). It’s using expendable bathythermographs, little sensors that are launched from merchant ships. Along a merchant ship route, you have an operator or an automatic system that is dropping, every hour or so, temperature probes in the ocean. This program has been degraded by 50 percent or more — or even 100 percent at some point, nothing happened for the first six months! So yes, we have lost some data there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bk3xwk"&gt;A few moored buoys were not maintained in time, maybe they will be in the next six months. If not, we will start to see the different networks switching off those little points on the map one after the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgTFWe"&gt;Moored buoys in the tropics are the best tools to monitor El Nino. That system is only working at 60 percent of capacity today, although that’s not all related to COVID because there are funding challenges and other difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlxK7L"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your recent report card says there’s been a 10 percent overall decrease in real-time data, how might that affect research or forecasting? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isqwcS"&gt;It’s tough to say, you know, what’s the price of a single observation. Some very important time series have not been done, so those data are lost forever. You are not there to take those data, so for climate recall this is a loss. For the rest of the series, you have a decrease in the accuracy of the forecast. But for now, the system is handling the shock pretty well, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="FJq4Yt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The heart of the system is autonomous”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X3Cmt1"&gt;The heart of the system is autonomous, it’s made of autonomous instruments. Those buoys, some will last a year or two, some others will operate five or more. So when they are launched, they can operate for a long time and if the telemetry infrastructure is okay, the system will continue to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65nXgK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you expect there to be more challenges moving forward as a result of the pandemic or have things started to go back to normal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfIYoj"&gt;The system can handle six months to a year flag — of delay of renewal. But more than that, we start to be serious. One surface drifter will live for about one year. So if you don’t go to sea for a year, you lose your entire network. And that’s the only way to get air pressure, for example. You don’t get the air pressure from satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpHq3E"&gt;This year will be critical because we accumulated a lot of deficits in deployment. So we have some stock to deploy this year, so there will be much more work to be done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMhAgR"&gt;You know, if nobody goes to replace drifters in the Indian Ocean this year — next year, you will have very bad data in the Indian Ocean, for the monsoons and all those critical applications. The models and the services will be degraded. We’re not there yet, but the community has to work hard this year to maintain the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HODyPr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Maintaining the system is a kind of struggle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eyE0Rb"&gt;It was already a challenge. I mean, maintaining the system is a kind of struggle. This important infrastructure for the world is funded by research at 70 percent, which means the scientists have to apply for proposals and for science projects every two, three, four years. It’s like if your highways were maintained by research, you know, you will find it very strange, because everybody needs a highway. And for the ocean-observing system, it’s the same. This critical infrastructure is maintained on short funding. So before the pandemic, the system was fragile already. And the pandemic has just kind of accelerated some of these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kGyXy"&gt;I would say if the delays continue again like last year, in the next six months or so, we will start to see some measurable impact. Today’s impacts are at the margin. And as I said, the heart of the system is surviving the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook brings cloud gaming to Apple devices with a web app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lZNgi_U6Ik1Fj2r7rlmm9IQtBh4=/0x0:720x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622505/acastro_210722_1777_facebookgaming_720.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hrbq5g"&gt;Starting Friday, Facebook is bringing its nascent cloud gaming service to iPhones and iPads &lt;a href="http://www.fb.gg/play"&gt;through a web app&lt;/a&gt; people will be able to add to their homescreens like a native app. The site will let you play simple web games like Solitaire and match-threes and stream more graphically intensive titles like racing games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0ICjR"&gt;But thanks to Apple’s rules, it’s unclear how people will find it, since third-party developers like Facebook are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;barred from steering their app users&lt;/a&gt; to websites featuring purchasing mechanisms that aren’t Apple’s own. It’s a huge point of friction with not just Facebook, but other gaming companies like Epic that have strongly protested Apple’s grip on iOS payments. Facebook’s library of web games, which include HTML5-based ones alongside more advanced titles that stream directly from the cloud, use the social network’s custom payments system called Facebook Pay to accept in-game purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykHrd8"&gt;Facebook’s decision to bring its game platform to iOS via the web mimics the approach of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455343/amazon-luna-apple-app-store-rules-cloud-gaming-streaming-google-nvidia"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554267/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-pass-ios-iphone-ipad-pc"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, which have also released Progressive Web Apps, or PWAs, for their respective cloud gaming services to get around the App Store. Last year, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358355/facebook-apple-app-store-policies-comments-facebook-gaming-ios"&gt;complained loudly&lt;/a&gt; when Apple blocked its attempt to put games in a standalone app for iOS and said it would look into alternatives. Shortly after that, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;changed its rules&lt;/a&gt; to allow for cloud-based games as long as they were submitted individually as apps to the App Store for review — a policy that Microsoft and others said didn’t address their desire to release their own gaming storefronts on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e1CZXB"&gt;“We’ve come to the same conclusion as others: web apps are the only option for streaming cloud games on iOS at the moment,” Facebook’s vice president of gaming, Vivek Sharma, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a statement. “As many have pointed out, Apple’s policy to ‘allow’ cloud games on the App Store doesn’t allow for much at all. Apple’s requirement for each cloud game to have its own page, go through review, and appear in search listings defeats the purpose of cloud gaming. These roadblocks mean players are prevented from discovering new games, playing cross-device, and accessing high-quality games instantly in native iOS apps — even for those who aren’t using the latest and most expensive devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ja2wpt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple’s policy to ‘allow’ cloud games on the App Store doesn’t allow for much at all”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e575v3"&gt;Facebook isn’t a major player in gaming yet, as it has mostly focused on courting streamers to broadcast their gameplay for fans to watch. But last year it acquired a cloud gaming startup and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21528438/facebook-cloud-gaming-beta-android-web-jason-rubin-interview"&gt;released a handful of free-to-play titles&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;Asphalt 9&lt;/em&gt;. It has since made its service available in more regions, added other titles like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Rebellion&lt;/em&gt;, and said 1.5 million people play its cloud games per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RID2dQ"&gt;While Facebook ultimately found a solution for getting its cloud games on iOS, there are still big limitations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22421912/iphone-web-app-pwa-cloud-gaming-epic-v-apple-safari"&gt;imposed by Apple’s Safari&lt;/a&gt; browser on web games. Sound is turned off by default, games can’t send push notifications, and graphics aren’t as powerful as they can be in native apps. And then there’s the problem of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1yA4z"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on its growth plans for the gaming website, but &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase"&gt;Apple’s rules&lt;/a&gt; say that developers can’t send users from a native app to a website with payments technology other than its own. Developers of the games Facebook features could do their own marketing, but those efforts would pale in comparison to the traffic that the main Facebook app could send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ulFZi"&gt;Facebook’s cloud games are currently available in the US and parts of Canada and Mexico, while HTML games are accessible elsewhere as cloud games are slowly brought to more regions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon to investigate allegations of harassment and discrimination in its AWS unit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/65it0m7FMQ1XqXI2wn2PjAB9OIU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622115/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mY6QZ5"&gt;Amazon will investigate allegations of discrimination and harassment within its Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit, following an employee petition that criticized AWS’s culture, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/19/amazon-suit-race-gender-discrimination/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. More than 550 Amazon workers signed the petition, which calls out AWS for its “underlying culture of systemic discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias against women and under-represented groups,” the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; reported. The petition further alleges that Amazon’s system to investigate claims of discrimination is “not fair, objective or transparent.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIZztV"&gt;The petition pointed to allegations from former AWS employees: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaB7PJ"&gt;In May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444635/amazon-five-discrimination-retaliation-lawsuits-warehouse"&gt;five women sued Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, alleging race and gender discrimination. One of the women, Cindy Warner, worked in the AWS division and had accused a manager of making homophobic comments. When she hired a lawyer, Warner said she was fired in retaliation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S741Ub"&gt;An Amazon spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company had conducted a thorough investigation of Warner’s complaints when she made them, and “we have found her allegations to be unsubstantiated.” Warner detailed her allegations in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@cindylwarner1/amazon-fired-me-for-reporting-gender-bias-now-others-are-speaking-out-e1ca420c3692"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medium&lt;/em&gt; post&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, saying she intended to move forward. “I will pursue my claims as far as I need to in order to show Amazon how wrong management’s actions were,” she wrote. “My wonderful colleagues at AWS will not be intimidated or silenced, either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qd9qio"&gt;Another incident referenced in the petition was an August 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-i-left-aws-laudon-williams/"&gt;LinkedIn post&lt;/a&gt; by former AWS employee Laudon Williams, who said he left the company because he saw instances of what he considered gender discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kE8hyp"&gt;Amazon said in its email to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it does not tolerate discrimination or harassment in any form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UBPCR"&gt;The petition was sent to new Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, the former head of AWS, and current AWS chief executive Adam Selipsky, the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; reported. Selipsky later wrote an email to the petition’s authors saying he shared their concerns, and that said Amazon was hiring an outside firm to investigate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFrM3P"&gt;“Given the nature of the concerns here, we have retained an outside firm to investigate and understand any inappropriate conduct that you or others may have experienced or witnessed,” according to the letter, which was provided in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;by a company spokesperson. “This firm is experienced and objective, and I personally will review their independent findings, which will help guide any further actions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zAAb9H"&gt;The petitioners want the company to conduct an independent investigation of AWS, to be completed by October 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iBrrU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 23rd 10:59AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added comment from Amazon and Cindy Warner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODlVRp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlbC7P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chevy Bolts recalled again for fire risk, as GM admits battery defects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ahJJwydJnC5NwRlNzLSAzesydjM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622476/akrales_170405_1582_0324.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BhCXo4"&gt;General Motors is &lt;a href="https://my.chevrolet.com/how-to-support/safety/boltevrecall"&gt;recalling&lt;/a&gt; 2017-2019 model year Chevy Bolts a second time because of a risk that the battery packs could catch fire. The new recall comes after two Bolts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577757/gm-chevy-bolt-fires-recall-fix-software-update-not-working"&gt;recently caught fire despite having received the purported software fix&lt;/a&gt; from the previous recall, which was first announced in November 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FoOFsR"&gt;GM has also finally shed a little light on the source of the problem. The automaker says that, working with battery supplier LG Chem, it discovered that some of the cells that make up the Bolt’s pack can have two simultaneous manufacturing defects. The company did not say specifically what these defects are, but when they are present they can cause a fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3T8Pd"&gt;GM says it’s still preparing the recall, and so it’s telling owners to take a bunch of precautions in the meantime until they’re able to check and attempt to fix every vehicle. The company says owners shouldn’t charge the vehicle to more than 90 percent, or let it drop below 70 miles (which is roughly 27 percent). That means owners will only be able to use about 60 percent (around 155 miles) of their vehicle’s capacity until GM is able to complete the new recall fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gqZBxq"&gt;Owners should also charge their vehicle after each use, according to GM. Of course, GM is still warning owners not to park their vehicles inside or near their house, and says they shouldn’t leave Bolts charging overnight. GM has more information, including customer support numbers, on &lt;a href="https://my.chevrolet.com/how-to-support/safety/boltevrecall"&gt;its recall website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E5iOVX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Don’t charge over 90 percent, below 27 percent, or charge overnight, or inside&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PK0YC4"&gt;Once GM is ready to perform the recall, technicians will inspect the battery packs for this particular defect and replace any modules that contain problematic cells. They were already supposed to be checking Bolt battery packs for defects like this during the prior recall, but GM tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the new defects were only recently discovered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQflES"&gt;About a dozen fires are thought to have occurred in these model year Bolts. The previous fix, which was shared in May — months after the recall was first announced — involved installing software on the affected Bolts that was supposed to “detect potential issues related to changes in battery module performance before problems can develop.” This extra software wasn’t enough to stop two more fires from happening, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ivy48"&gt;LG Chem also supplies the cells for the Kona EV, which Hyundai recalled after reports of fires, and even discontinued altogether in South Korea. The battery supplier has run into all sorts of problems with other products, too. It has recalled some home battery systems, and one of its grid storage projects caught fire, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/07/23/gm-announces-recall-after-a-dozen-bolt-ev-fires-6-key-questions-we-need-answers-to/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;. Porsche recently recalled the LG Chem-powered Taycan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22559051/porsche-taycan-ev-recall-12-volt-audi-etron-gt"&gt;over power loss problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D542OG"&gt;While it takes some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/3/17530646/tesla-battery-fire-electric-vehicles-transportation-science"&gt;special care and instruction&lt;/a&gt; to know how to extinguish a fire in an electric vehicle, there isn’t any data that shows they happen at any higher rate than fires in internal combustion engine cars. Occasional fires are bound to happen. But the situation that GM — and, really LG — has found itself in with these Bolts is much different. A few years ago the Bolt was one of the first legitimate long-range electric vehicles on the market. But now it’s running the risk of taking on a much different mantle. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Tokyo 2020 opening ceremony was filled with some of gaming’s greatest tunes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dragon Quest XI" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r2yCBAoh0FWxwJmc-0HGLROg6Cs=/65x0:1685x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622437/DQXI_InGameScreenshot_March28_C01.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="POdVWT"&gt;The opening ceremony of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics kicked off this morning, and tunes from classic video games played as all of the athletes from participating countries were welcomed into a crowd-free arena. There was plenty of representation on the RPG front, with well-known songs from franchises including &lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Phantasy Star&lt;/em&gt;, and more. Perhaps more surprising were some of the deeper cuts from &lt;em&gt;Chrono Trigger&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ace Combat&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Nier&lt;/em&gt;, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="c3CUbA"&gt;Naturally, you might want to hear some of these clips from the ceremony. You’ll need to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22589095/olympics-opening-ceremony-watch-start-time-how-to-live-stream"&gt;run through some steps to watch them at home&lt;/a&gt; (which includes some free options) to see the ceremony uninterrupted.

    <title>Judge rejects Wisk Aero’s effort to block rival air taxi startup Archer from using ‘stolen’ patents </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UbMC8ICOjkN1Zp79QLVgo-Z8_J0=/0x0:4884x3256/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622410/Archer4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Archer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1n1k5w"&gt;A federal judge in San Francisco rejected air taxi startup Wisk Aero’s request for a preliminary injunction against rival startup Archer Aviation, as Silicon Valley’s first big “flying car” legal drama heats up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DsiDhj"&gt;Wisk, a joint venture between Boeing and Kitty Hawk, wanted to block Archer Aviation from using any of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22369921/wisk-sues-archer-trade-secrets-theft-flying-taxi"&gt;52 trade secrets it alleges were stolen&lt;/a&gt;. Wisk is also seeking unspecified monetary damages from Archer in a lawsuit that was filed April 6th. Federal investigators are also looking into the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHKXLj"&gt;In his ruling, US District Court Judge William Orrick wrote that Wisk’s request was “too uncertain and equivocal,” though he acknowledged that there were “some arguable indications of misappropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R87aKl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“some arguable indications of misappropriation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uH1cWz"&gt;Archer celebrated the ruling by blasting Wisk’s lawsuit as meritless. “The record makes it clear that Wisk has provided no evidence — not a single document, not a single witness — that Archer ever received or used any Wisk trade secret,” Archer’s deputy general counsel, Eric Lentell said in &lt;a href="https://archer.com/news/archer-wins-defeats-wisks-motion-for-preliminary-injunction"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Wisk’s charges of massive theft are based entirely on conspiracy theories and outright misrepresentations of the actual record.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnVgPS"&gt;Archer claims that evidence introduced in the case will prove that its 12-rotor, battery-powered Maker aircraft was designed “independently, and well in advance of any effort by Wisk to develop a similar eVTOL [electric vertical and takeoff] aircraft.” Archer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529534/archer-maker-air-taxi-evtol-reveal-specs"&gt;officially unveiled&lt;/a&gt; its demonstrator aircraft at an event in Los Angeles last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zb3d1n"&gt;In its lawsuit, Wisk alleged that former employee Jing Xue improperly downloaded almost 5,000 data files onto a personal device that he subsequently gave to Archer after joining the company in January 2020. Lentell claims that Wisk is trying to defame Xue as the “poster child for the covert theft.” But when questioned in court about the files, Xue pled the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination, citing the federal investigation into the case. Archer has place Xue on administrative leave.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wc1NHt"&gt;Despite the setback, Wisk says that it intends to take its lawsuit all the way to a jury trial. “We are in the very early stages of a long legal process,” a spokesperson said in &lt;a href="https://wisk.aero/news/press-release/wisk-looks-ahead-to-archer-trial/"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;, “with in-depth evidence-gathering now to begin, and we fully intend to hold Archer accountable at trial.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlbJOa"&gt;Archer was founded by Adam Goldstein and Brett Adcock, co-founders of Vettery, a marketing software-as-a-service company, which the two sold to Switzerland-based staffing firm Adecco Group in 2018 for $100 million. The company came out of stealth in the spring of 2020 after having poached key talent from Wisk, which is jointly owned by Boeing and Kitty Hawk, the flying taxi company bankrolled by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/19/17586878/larry-page-flying-car-opener-kitty-hawk-cora"&gt;Google co-founder Larry Page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AX4nM"&gt;But Wisk argues that Archer didn’t just steal talent — it also stole trade secrets. Wisk has accused Archer of misappropriating “thousands of highly confidential files containing very valuable trade secrets, as well as the use of significant innovations Wisk has patented.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIau0A"&gt;Air taxis, sometimes misidentified as “flying cars,” are essentially helicopters without the noisy, polluting gas motors. A number of startups have emerged in recent years with prototype aircraft that are electric-powered, able to carry a handful of passengers, and intended for short flights within a city or regionally. Analysts predict that the flying taxi market could grow to $150 billion in revenue by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;
