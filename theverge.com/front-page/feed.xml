    <title>How to transfer your Google Authenticator 2FA to a new phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google apps 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QjVD9k3z6qn6JMeGSQem9PSIWf8=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67344098/1008258386.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fpM5Ry"&gt;Two-factor authentication (2FA) is one of the best and easiest ways to keep your online accounts secure. It works by issuing an authentication code on your phone when somebody tries to access the account; if that person doesn’t have the code, they (or you) don’t get in. By using a 2FA app, such as Google Authenticator or Authy, you can prevent somebody from accessing your data by getting your password. (You can have a code texted to you, but that is considered far less secure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/11/18564381/community-hacking-sim-hijacking-cryptocurrency"&gt;due to the rise of so-called SIM hacking&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czgQrl"&gt;There is, of course, a catch. Because 2FA uses a key specific to your phone, if you lose or break your phone, you can’t simply reinstall the app on your new phone and go on from there. You need to transfer the key code for that phone as well as the app itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="URpdzV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to set up two-factor authentication on all your online accounts","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/17/15772142/how-to-set-up-two-factor-authentication"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7PpqsB"&gt;Different authentication apps handle this in different ways. In this article, I’m going to look at Google Authenticator, including the easiest way to transfer the app to a new phone if you do have access to the old one, and how you can prepare for a possible problem (like a broken phone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Is3Vpn"&gt;Google Authenticator lets you establish 2FA by using your phone to scan a QR code generated by the app on a separate device or by entering a key code. It’s a relatively easy process — unless you find you have to move the app to a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02bKEg"&gt;Because 2FA uses security keys that are specific to each piece of hardware, you can’t simply reinstall Google Authenticator on your new phone and use it to log in. Instead, you have to transfer the keys to your new app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsZK4D"&gt;The easiest method, especially if you use 2FA with several apps, is to use the Authenticator app’s dedicated transfer feature to move your keys from one phone to the other. However, there are two assumptions here: first, that you have access to both the old and new phone, and second, that you have Android devices. If either of these assumptions doesn’t work for your situation, there are other methods you can use, which we’ll cover next. But first, the easy method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XquXdx"&gt;Transfer your Authenticator keys via Android&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VDaOp7"&gt;If you’ve got two Android phones, you can transfer your accounts to a new phone by exporting them via a QR code generated by the Authenticator app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="87Arix"&gt;Install Google Authenticator on your new phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Tzp7zN"&gt;Tap “Get started.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u8otzk"&gt;Tap “Scan a QR code.” You’ll get a grid and instructions to “Place QR code within red lines.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cQRq8O"&gt;Open Google Authenticator on your older phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c1Iuv5"&gt;Tap on the three dots on the top right of the screen and select “Transfer accounts”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VsTg7c"&gt;Select “Export accounts.” You may be asked to verify your identity via a fingerprint, password, or another method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iLMidD"&gt;Uncheck which accounts you don’t want to export. Tap “Next.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hvE9GK"&gt;You’ll be shown a QR code. Center it in the grid in your new phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xJTRaf"&gt;You should see the imported app now listed in your Google Authenticator app in the new phone. (Note: the app will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be deleted from your old phone.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zx8ufp"&gt;Alternative method #1: Use your backup codes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TyE2Kk"&gt;When you first set up Google Authenticator, you may be given a set of backup codes and asked to print them out or otherwise save them. And you definitely do want to save them; print them out and put them somewhere safe or create a PDF and save it where nobody else can access it. If your phone goes south, these codes will be a good way to reestablish authentication on your new phone — assuming, of course, you haven’t misplaced the codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSjHAl"&gt;This is also the way to reestablish your keys on a new iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3obrx"&gt;If you missed that step during the installation, you can get those backup codes anyway. For that, you have to &lt;a href="https://myaccount.google.com/"&gt;go into your Google account&lt;/a&gt; and then follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4qZ6C0"&gt;Click on “Security” in the left-hand column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nu4Jy8"&gt;Scroll down to and select “2-Step Verification.” You’ll probably have to enter your password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pX2cHM"&gt;Scroll down to “Backup Codes” and click on “Show Codes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on “Show Codes” to get your ten backup codes for your Google account. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CjOPbBjbxGfCYoaXJJsk4QjXWBo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22920572/Screen_Shot_2021_10_12_at_10.40.23_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on “Show Codes” to get your ten backup codes for your Google account. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="fK3y9x"&gt;You’ll get a list of 10 codes. Each code can be used once; if you use them all, you can get more by clicking on “Show Codes” and then on “Get New Codes.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UDvz7q"&gt;Alternative method #2: Take a screenshot of the barcode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fmnJtp"&gt;One way to create a backup in case you lose your phone is to take and save a screenshot of the barcode that is created for each 2FA-secured app. If you’ve mislaid your backup codes, but you’ve saved a screenshot of the QR barcode that you originally used to create your app’s authentication, you can use that screenshot to establish your credentials on a new phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbuGUo"&gt;Just throw the screenshot up on your computer, install Google Authenticator on your new phone, and use the plus sign on the app to scan the barcode. (You can also enter the setup key code if that’s what you saved.) Do this for each of your apps, and you’ll be all set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkGcse"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 12th, 2021, 11:20AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on September 2nd, 2020; the directions for transferring between Android phones have been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces October 18th event after months of Mac rumors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple October 18th event invitation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/POOvNv7zsPYLW-WxI4c3CpaPjmU=/92x0:1328x824/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69984773/image__7_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple October 18th event invitation | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xRoatW"&gt;Apple’s next hardware event will take place on October 18th, according to invites it sent out today. The company is widely expected to use its second fall event to launch a pair of new MacBooks, a redesigned higher-end Mac Mini, and possibly a pair of third-generation AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4gYMr"&gt;The invite video teases one word: Unleashed. As seen below in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1447956519132151810"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from Apple marketing exec Greg Joswiak, it appears in a dotted font that could hint at mini LED tech on the way. The “special” event will stream live on &lt;a href="http://Apple.com"&gt;Apple.com&lt;/a&gt; at 1PM ET / 10AM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTTWne"&gt;There have been reports for months that Apple is on the cusp of releasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models&lt;/a&gt;. The new MacBooks would be the latest step in Apple’s transition away from Intel chips, replacing them with an Arm-based processor called the M1X that Apple designs itself. The new chip could boost performance compared to the M1 chip that debuted last year, as &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-set-for-first-macbook-pro-revamp-in-five-years-on-oct-18?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman reports&lt;/a&gt; the M1X has ten CPU cores compared to the M1’s eight, plus graphics processors with 16 or 32 cores compared to seven or eight in M1-equipped machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8HShL"&gt;Other anticipated features include the return of fan-favorite MacBook features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;magnetic MagSafe charging&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;HDMI port, and an SD card slot&lt;/a&gt;. The maligned OLED touch bar, mercifully, could be on the way out. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1447700808821260292?s=20"&gt;Gurman recently noted&lt;/a&gt; that stock of the company’s existing MacBook Pro appears to be running low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A370IL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Unleashed! These next six days are going to speed by. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AppleEvent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/0ops2bVPvl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0ops2bVPvl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1447956519132151810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IisHHU"&gt;Rumors suggest that the same M1X processor will feature in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637477/new-mac-mini-design-ports-m1x-release-date-gurman"&gt;redesigned higher-end Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;. The new machine will reportedly have more ports than last year’s M1 model, with two Thunderbolt / USB 4 Type-C ports and two USB Type-A ports. The changes should make the new Mac Mini much better suited to power users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlrkgz"&gt;Finally, Apple may announce a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;pair of redesigned AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, representing the third generation of the company’s original true wireless earbuds. The AirPods are expected to adopt a design similar to the AirPods Pro, with shorter stems and a redesigned charging case. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe shows off upcoming Camera Raw support for Photoshop on iPad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPad Pro with the Liquid Retina XDR display" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0YgUt8gvg7fpJjI0QtjkngwZiYw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69984656/vpavic_210512_4592_0192.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3V1QJT"&gt;Adobe is bringing Camera Raw to the iPad version of Photoshop, and has demonstrated how it works in a hands-on video. Ryan Dumlao, senior product manager for Photoshop on iPad, shows how Camera Raw can be used to edit RAW and DNG photos directly imported from a camera — in this case a Fujifilm — or ProRAW files from the iPhone 12 Pro and 13 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1bLeF"&gt;Camera Raw is a long-standing plugin that allows for advanced RAW image editing within Photoshop, and it’s also the technical basis of Lightroom’s processing engine. Dumlao’s video shows how you can edit various settings and exposure parameters within Photoshop, including importing the RAW file as a smart object for non-destructive editing that can be carried over to the desktop version. In his demo, Dumlao uses Photoshop features to perform tasks like removing individual tree branches and adjusting the color of a specific rope in his photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PXVc1"&gt;While many photographers use Lightroom as their primary editing tool, adding Camera Raw to Photoshop for iPad will dramatically expand the photo editing capabilities for iPad owners who use Photoshop as a big part of their workflow. Adobe hasn’t announced exactly when the feature will be released, only saying that it’s “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ecobee’s smart thermostat is the first to have Siri voice control built-in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QKnXCnFQeDJZELqek4Yy_EJDyjk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69983626/ecobee_Siri_Oct._12.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Siri can now be set as the default voice assistant in the Ecobee SmartThermostat.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ecobee&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pVeLVf"&gt;First announced at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;Apple’s WWDC earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, Siri has now landed on Ecobee SmartThermostats. The Apple voice assistant arrives via a free software update allowing you to say “Hey Siri” to the thermostat to set the temperature, send an intercom message, and use all of Siri’s smart speaker features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zS1OHu"&gt;This is the first third-party device to include Apple’s virtual assistant Siri, although the feature is not exclusive to Ecobee. Apple said that all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523045/apple-wwdc-siri-third-party-devices-ecobee-watch-tvos-tv"&gt;HomeKit accessory makers will be able to integrate Siri&lt;/a&gt; voice control into their products starting this year. For any integration to work, you will need to have a HomePod or HomePod Mini on the same network, through which the device (in this case the SmartThermostat) will send the requests. The integration won’t work with just an Apple TV or iPad running as your HomeKit hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkTuSF"&gt;The function only works with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646398/ecobee-smartthermostat-review-alexa-announcement-price-specs-features"&gt;newest Ecobee SmartThermostat with voice control&lt;/a&gt; ($249.99), which has a built-in microphone and speaker and has supported Amazon’s Alexa since its release in 2019. You can’t have both AIs active at the same time, however; you have to choose, but you can switch back at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cyGAGPF6b55kbjqa9wlCrYXH-4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22920314/17844DDA_4994_4E50_85B5_2C1DA3F6D386.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Siri is now on the Ecobee SmartThermostat, but you still need a HomePod Mini on hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oXJiHk"&gt;Siri is my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22704860/siri-best-smart-home-voice-assistant-editorial"&gt;main smart home driver&lt;/a&gt;, so I have been impatiently waiting for this update. It landed on my thermostat this weekend and so far the experience has been pretty good (barring a few hiccups getting it going). It’s essentially like having a HomePod on your wall. I can do everything I can with a HomePod using the Ecobee instead: set timers, ask about the weather, find my iPhone, and control lights and other smart home devices. It was fractionally slower than using Apple’s own smart speaker for those tasks, but not enough to be an issue.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vmhBNS"&gt;The Ecobee’s microphones and speakers aren’t as ideally situated as on a HomePod — they’re in the back of the device against the wall, so it did have some trouble hearing me, and if you have an Apple device nearby — phone, watch, etc. — that device invariably picks up the request first. This is a good thing, though; really you want the thermostat to be the fallback device, not the primary one. With Alexa in the Ecobee, it often picks up the request over any other nearby Echo speaker, and I get music playing on its tinny speaker instead of the Echo Studio I’d intended it to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ea4HhF"&gt;The Ecobee speaker also shows up as an Airplay option, which was surprisingly fun, especially as you can group it with other Airplay speakers. I experienced a major smart home nerd moment when I was streaming music from a smart smoke alarm (Onelink Safe &amp;amp; Sound) and a smart thermostat, simultaneously. Welcome to the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEVmME"&gt;Music is one area the Siri integration is better than Ecobee’s Alexa integration. While Amazon’s voice assistant works out of the box with the thermostat and you can play music through the thermostat, it doesn’t work with Alexa’s multiroom feature. It’s pretty sad to try and rock out with music just from your thermostat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="tPA6jl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No one should go out and spend $350 just for this experience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wuNX2o"&gt;Setting up the integration is simple: pair the Ecobee to HomeKit from the thermostat’s screen, then add it as an accessory through the Home app, and an option to “Speak to Siri” will pop up. From there, you can tailor the experience (such as deciding if you want to enable personal requests). If your thermostat is already connected to HomeKit, a card will appear in the Home app asking if you want to enable Siri. You can switch between voice assistants in the integrations menu in settings on the thermostat or in the Ecobee app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3x3dI"&gt;Having Siri in more places in the home will help make the voice assistant a more useful smart home controller. However, putting it in a $250 thermostat doesn’t exactly make the HomeKit experience a less expensive one. Plus, you have to have a HomePod Mini for it to work. No one should go out and spend $350 just for this experience. It’s useful for those who already have this tech. But going forward, I would like to see some Siri-enabled accessories under $50 to help bring the voice assistant into more corners of your smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="iV1ciq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s essentially like having a HomePod on your wall — who doesn’t want that?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GLTT6f"&gt;In other Ecobee news, the company has been testing out some user interface changes on its optional Beta program. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ecobee/comments/q1rpk5/i_wish_the_temp_adjustment_was_tap_able/"&gt;According to a post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, one change is replacing the fiddly slider used to adjust the thermostat’s temperature with a tappable option. I asked Ecobee about this potential new interface and it told me: “We’re currently exploring some UI changes to the Home screen of the Ecobee SmartThermostat with voice control, and have invited several thousand thermostat users to participate in this optional Beta.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8mDRa"&gt;It’s a change that can’t come soon enough as the current slider method is one of the worst interfaces I’ve tested on a thermostat. Unless you have teeny, tiny fingers, it’s really tricky to manually change the temperature by just one or two degrees; it often jumps around five to 10 instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gh47fW"&gt;Siri on Ecobee officially launches on October 12th and is arriving on Ecobee SmartThermostats over the next few weeks. For the integration to work, you need to have a HomePod on software version 15 and an Ecobee thermostat on firmware 4.7.5.352.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6dRv6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhWKQ1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, October 12th, 11:52 a.m.: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that this integration will not work with an Apple TV or iPad as your only HomeKit hub, it requires a HomePod or HomePod Mini. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scream is back, and Ghostface is better at controlling my smart home than my phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SgOv1eI7Nw0fcmJyiSjKuR-nZqo=/580x0:2541x1307/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69984586/scrfp_018r.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Paramount Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G2KkRp"&gt;He’s back, and he’s coming for you — through your smart home. As if Ghostface’s reappearance after a decade laying dormant wasn’t scary enough, this time, the nineties-self-aware-slasher-killer knows how to control your door locks. And clearly, smart home manufacturers could learn a thing or two from him (or her). This dude’s got some killer protocols on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpdETg"&gt;The first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Scream&lt;/em&gt; dropped today. It’s technically &lt;em&gt;Scream 5&lt;/em&gt;, but apparently, we’re ditching numbers when it comes to horror movie re-boots. And it opens in &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; kitchen with another child star home alone. Disney darling Jenna Ortega steps in for the E.T. wunderkind as “Tara,” and while we need to get past the landline phone in the kitchen (what decade is this?), seeing as “Tara” is clearly inhabiting Drew Barrymore’s former pad, we can do that. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-ReoY020xjOIH8O1oDvvvS-AelA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22920616/scr11900rcr.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Paramount Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neve Campbell and Cortney Cox reunite to battle a tech-savvy killer in the latest Scream installment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8W0iqr"&gt;But this killer is tech-savvy, and the smartphone is Ghostface’s torture tool this time around. In the trailer, Tara texts her buddy “Amber,” who she thinks is pranking her and gets the response: “This isn’t Amber.” Strangely, it isn’t as terrifying in a green bubble as it was in analog times. But don’t you worry, that familiar scary voice is back for more fun and games and, this time, with some impressive home automation scares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spMNMR"&gt;In this future world (2022), smart homes work flawlessly, and Ghostface has some hacking skills that can unlock Tara’s front door instantly (hey, it’s a horror movie, not real life). As she backs away from the locked door, her phone helpfully pings her with an audible message: “All Doors Unlocked.” She frantically presses “All Doors Locked” in her generic smart home app (come on, Amazon, there was a killer product placement opportunity here!), and we’re treated to split shots of all these fancy (not smart) deadbolts doing a doorlock dance as killer and victim play smart home roulette. In the smart home, no one can hear your screams of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2szP3KseRdnuoBj6dxhXd0k-SAE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22920632/scrfp_018r.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Paramount Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostface has some new tricks up his sleeves in the new Scream re-boot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3f8UOz"&gt;Unrealistic smart homes aside, the next clip brings with it the relief that this is not just a schlocky rip-off; this is &lt;em&gt;Scream&lt;/em&gt; in all its gory nineties glory. We see Neve Campbell answering her smartphone, and when she utters the words “I’m Sidney Prescott, &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; I have a gun,” I got literal chills. Gen Xers, rejoice — the whole gang is back. Ex-husband and wife duo David Arquette (as Dewey Riley) and Courtney Cox (as Gale Weathers) team up again with the beleaguered Campbell (Sidney), along with a cast of suitably nubile and stabbable teenage movie stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHH42Z"&gt;This &lt;em&gt;Scream&lt;/em&gt; movie is set in the present time 25 years after the original murders (way to make me feel really old, Paramount), and a new killer is stalking the residents of Woodsboro (why does anyone still live there?). It’s the first &lt;em&gt;Scream&lt;/em&gt; since creator Wes Craven’s death, and the movie is helmed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett. Sadly, there are no Halloween scares on tap; we’ll have to wait until January 14th, 2022 to see the flick in the theaters. But that’s probably a good thing, really. This is not a movie you want to watch at home — and definitely not in a smart home. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DC’s new comic book Superman is coming out as bisexual in next month’s issue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C8uEp1NeziP9i1Q3qh2L9uJsb9I=/0x101:1138x860/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69984562/Screen_Shot_2021_10_12_at_10.43.50_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hrauWj"&gt;DC’s newest Superman is &lt;a href="https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2021/10/11/jon-kent-finds-his-identity-in-superman-son-of-kal-el-5"&gt;coming out of the closet next month&lt;/a&gt;, with the comics company revealing that Jon Kent will be starting a relationship with Jay Nakamura, a new character introduced earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4faMc"&gt;The son of the original Superman (Kal-El / Clark Kent), Jon took over for his father as the “official” Superman in DC’s mainline &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22593422/superman-dc-comics-jon-kent-son-of-kal-el-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Superman: Son of Kal-El&lt;/em&gt; comic earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; as Earth’s most powerful superhero. (For those not caught up, Clark is still around, albeit off dealing with some drama on Warworld in the &lt;em&gt;Action Comics&lt;/em&gt; and limited-run &lt;em&gt;Superman and the Authority&lt;/em&gt; lines.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qoldSW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Everyone needs heroes and everyone deserves to see themselves in their heroes.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hLjcT1"&gt;“I knew replacing Clark with another straight white savior could be a real opportunity missed,” &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/superman-bisexual-lgbt-jon-kent-dc"&gt;writer Tom Taylor told &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; in an interview&lt;/a&gt;. “But I’ve always said everyone needs heroes and everyone deserves to see themselves in their heroes. Today, Superman, the strongest superhero on the planet, is coming out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c78rNW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Superman: Son of Kal-El&lt;/em&gt; also looks to offer a more modern take on the character. Jon Kent’s version of the hero will not only face off against the usual run of supervillains but also contemporary issues like climate change and school shootings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edbart"&gt;DC isn’t shying away from similarities to Clark Kent’s famous romances, either: like Lois Lane (Jon’s mother), Jay is also a reporter, although Taylor teased in the same &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; interview that he’ll have some superpowers of his own that will allow him to meet Superman on his level instead of serving as another person for Jon to save. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SX0RI0"&gt;Jon Kent joins other prominent LGBTQ members of DC’s comics pantheon, following the reveal &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/22617395/robin-gay-queer-batman-dc-comics"&gt;that Tim Drake&lt;/a&gt; (one of several Robins in the Batman canon) was queer in an August issue earlier this year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aY9bR0"&gt;Jon and Jay are set to “become romantically involved” in next month’s issue number five of &lt;em&gt;Superman: Son of Kal-El, &lt;/em&gt;out on November 9th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge is now on your smart TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mhU1cYgohM2i9Z5BafOT1eAgz0Y=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963729/VergeApp_Roku_Splash_Screen_1080.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Stream Verge videos in 4K on Roku, Amazon Fire TV, and Android TV&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="CNRiWq"&gt;EDIT: We’ve identified an issue with the global release. Our app developer has made an update and the app should be available worldwide by Tuesday, October 12th.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is now available on your TV — in 4K. You can now watch our product reviews, in-depth tech and science explainers, exclusive documentaries, and much more on your favorite streaming devices: Roku, Amazon Fire TV, and Android TV. The app will be on Apple TV later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dYHPR"&gt;The app includes years of &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; videos, many available in 4K for the first time. You can binge your favorite videos from our team of journalists — including Dieter Bohn and Becca Farsace. The app will also be the first to stream our new documentary on the forgotten history of the Treo featuring The Verge’s Executive Editor, Dieter Bohn. Here’s a teaser: &lt;em&gt;Springboard: the secret history of the first real smartphone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JdNIKt"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ei64zL"&gt;You can also follow playlists of feature reporting and first looks or dive deep into topics like gaming and materials. And you can even use your TV to listen to your favorite podcast episodes from &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Decoder with Nilay Patel,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Why’d You Push That Button?&lt;/em&gt; hosted by Ashley Carman. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next big thing in podcasts is talking back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2_Pi7SWNLp4t_Bg-ABTFvOtH1hU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69984343/acastro_211012_4801_0001.7.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Poll, Q&amp;amp;As, and comment sections could turn podcasting interactive&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="LTh4KO"&gt;Vince Major and Michael Tucker, hosts of the podcast &lt;em&gt;Beyond the Screenplay&lt;/em&gt;, thought they knew what their audience wanted for their next episode: a deep-dive into &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future —&lt;/em&gt; a “no brainer,”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;says Major. To be sure, though, they decided to poll their listeners. They didn’t go to Patreon, Instagram, Twitter, or the other places creators often chat with their audience. Instead, they went where their listeners already tune into their show, Spotify, and used its new polling tool to ask. The people spoke up — they wanted &lt;em&gt;The Godfather&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DH8IIy"&gt;“[The polls] kind of just let the podcasting technology catch up in some ways,” Tucker says. “The place where people are actually listening, they can now also participate.” Although the co-hosts only started using these polls within the past year, they say their listeners are taking advantage. They’re talking back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zdFAZ"&gt;“Podcasting has always been this sort of one-way street,” says Mike Mignano, head of creation platform at Spotify. “A creator publishes content; the audience listens; that’s it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wlHeiJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The polls are coming into the podcast apps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5aDipR"&gt;Now, however, interactive elements are making their way into the space. Spotify is giving all its Anchor creators the ability to make polls and Q&amp;amp;As and is testing interactive ads. Other apps, like Facebook, are trying things as simple as just allowing listeners to leave comments — a mainstay YouTube feature — while podcasting apps in China already allow listeners to build “listening circles” and “discussion groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBVJIw"&gt;“When I first downloaded Chinese podcast apps, I was shocked at how interactive they were,” writes Helen Li in &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/what-spotify-and-apple-can-learn-from-chinese-podcasting-apps/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rMWrT"&gt;Although interaction is big abroad, it’s unclear how popular it can be in the US in these traditionally audio-only zones. Do people want to touch their phone while they’re in listening mode? “It’s not really in the mindset of podcasts yet to give that instant feedback to engage,” Major says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="N0Jm0U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Interactive elements are already popular abroad&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O7c0Du"&gt;In the US, interaction fervor is nascent but bubbling up. On the just-launched &lt;a href="https://firesidechat.com/"&gt;Fireside&lt;/a&gt;, the live audio app co-founded by Mark Cuban, the first thing you see when you go to its website in big, bold, white font reading: “The future of entertainment is interactive.” Same thing with Twitch&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;which itself is reportedly working on a specific live audio integration: “We build communities around live content that’s interactive, diverse, and always next level.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYeSa6"&gt;In Fireside’s case, viewers can react with emoji, ask a question, or leave a written comment. On Twitch, listeners can pay to have their name pop up in their favorite streamer’s video and join in the chorus of commenters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdvMTY"&gt;Amazon, which entered the podcasting space last year with podcasts on Amazon Music and Audible (and also owns Twitch),&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;might be working on something podcast-specific, too. In a survey provided to podcaster attendees of a recent industry conference, the company mentioned the possibility of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleyrcarman/status/1425202358175338511?s=20"&gt;a polling feature&lt;/a&gt;. Toys and games have also already relied on Alexa as a mediator and guide for interactive moments, so it’s easy to imagine the smart assistant taking on a bigger role in podcasting and ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="xWig1a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2nBw4I"&gt;“We haven’t really seen anyone yet crack the code on true listener-to-creator interactivity on listening platforms,” Mignano says. “So I think it’s just the natural evolution of content and media on the internet, and I think, hopefully now, we can finally catch podcasting up with the rest of the mediums.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0GV2M"&gt;There’s also the challenge of making interacting with audio feel natural. Backtracks, a podcast analytics and advertising platform, has developed an SDK that &lt;a href="https://backtracks.fm/blog/head-gestures-and-movement-for-airpod-pros-technology/"&gt;pairs with AirPods&lt;/a&gt; to detect head gestures. A podcast ad could say something like, “Nod your head to learn more,” and give you a chance to dive deeper into what you’re hearing. Backtracks CEO Jonathan Gill sees this as more palatable than asking someone who specifically is listening to something rather than watching it to look at their phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXLJbV"&gt;“If you’re asking someone a question, and you expect them to answer on the phone by looking at the phone, after a certain amount of time, you miss the use case of your audience,” he says. “So one reason to do this as part of the listening experience is somebody could be walking, running, they could be in their house, outside, and then if you ask a question or interact with [the gestures], it actually fits into the context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIEqGr"&gt;One of the biggest reasons behind this push for interactivity is the hope that it’ll make podcasts stickier. If you can talk to your favorite podcaster in one specific place or build a community in one app, chances are you’ll return to that place. Then, of course, there’s the ads functionality, an especially critical function in audio, which has primarily relied on promo codes to attribute sales to listeners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbkHVy"&gt;The business use cases are clear, but as is always the question with innovation motivated by corporate interests, does anyone outside of these platforms want this? Moreover, would they use it even if they wanted it? Tap the poll below to let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA clears Withings’ EKG and blood oxygen features</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F9VEwe"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21048522/withings-health-monitoring-scanwatch-ecg-afib-heart-sleep-apnea-blood-oxygen"&gt;over a year&lt;/a&gt; in limbo, Withings finally has Food and Drug Administration clearance for its ScanWatch, which monitors for abnormal heart rhythms through an EKG feature &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; flags nighttime breathing issues with its blood oxygen sensor. The watch has been available for sale in Europe, but not in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ok2NPs"&gt;This is the first smartwatch to get the FDA’s signoff on both types of health features. Apple, Fitbit, and Samsung all detect blood oxygen levels, but they don’t claim they can detect any medical conditions using that information, so they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21504023/apple-watch-ekg-blood-oxygen-fda-clearance"&gt;didn’t need to get the agency’s clearance&lt;/a&gt; in order to market the devices. Withings, on the other hand, is claiming that its device can flag nighttime breathing problems through a combination of blood oxygen levels, heart rate, and movement. Those breathing problems can be a sign of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and sleep apnea, the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="batkdg"&gt;Withings says its health features have been tested in clinical studies. One tested the EKG feature — the results from that study are not published, but &lt;a href="https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004508038-ScanWatch-Clinical-studies"&gt;the company said&lt;/a&gt; that it showed the feature was accurate and that it returned inconclusive readings one-fifth of the time. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8078374/"&gt;Its evaluation&lt;/a&gt; of the pulse oxygen feature, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Medical Internet Research&lt;/em&gt;, found that the readings from the ScanWatch matched up with the readings from a standard pulse oximeter. The study included 14 people with a variety of skin tones between the ages of 23 and 39 who didn’t have any medical problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLi5eA"&gt;The company also has an &lt;a href="https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004508038-ScanWatch-Clinical-studies"&gt;ongoing trial&lt;/a&gt; testing whether the ScanWatch can diagnose sleep apnea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lh5iHW"&gt;Other smartwatch companies are pursuing sleep apnea features, as well. Fitbit has been working on a similar feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/30/16227040/fitbit-sleep-apnea-tracking-ionic-smartwatch-sensors"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/fitbit-really-wants-to-be-able-to-diagnose-your-sleep-a-1841027997"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in early 2020 that it was planning to file for FDA clearance “soon.” Apple is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; working on the Apple Watch’s sleep and blood oxygen features with the goal of detecting sleep apnea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2MVeu"&gt;Sleep experts say that they’re excited about the potential for smartwatches to help detect conditions like sleep apnea, which often goes undiagnosed. But watches only track a few of the measurements doctors typically use to diagnose the condition, and for now, experts say they aren’t reliable enough to stand alone. They’re more useful as an initial screener, Seema Khosla, medical director of the North Dakota Center for Sleep, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455863/withings-scanwatch-review-health-sleep-features-price"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PcQXtI"&gt;Withings says the ScanWatch will be available in the US starting in early November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rb50VI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>8BitDo’s very good Pro 2 controller is getting an Xbox version soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="8BitDo Pro 2 for Xbox" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TNlGTwLudBvUjcRC2q8eXqnRCZo=/0x0:2331x1554/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69984199/pro2_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;8BitDo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n1VpTk"&gt;8BitDo is releasing a wired version of its Pro 2 controller for Xbox consoles and PC on December 8th, 2021. It’s nearly identical in terms of features to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364301/8bitdo-pro-2-controller-review-switch-back-buttons"&gt;the Bluetooth wireless model that my colleague Sam Byford reviewed&lt;/a&gt;, which supports Switch, mobile, and other platforms. Though, this new Xbox model’s wired-only connection means that it’s cheaper at $44.99. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P5K93ZN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can preorder it now&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5Vlpa"&gt;This Pro 2 is clad in black, with an Xbox home button in its middle. Yet, in addition to all of the other Xbox-specific buttons you’re probably expecting (share, menu, view), it has 8BitDo’s other two buttons near the analog sticks, which can be remapped to your liking in its Ultimate Software app available on iOS and Android. Additionally, there are two buttons on the back of the Pro 2’s grips that can be mapped as you see fit. Through the app, you can also customize vibration, trigger, and stick sensitivity, as well as make a shortcut to adjust volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaXLrR"&gt;You might be wondering how this wired controller is able to communicate wirelessly with your phone. 8BitDo told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the Pro 2 for Xbox has a Bluetooth chip inside, which allows it to connect to your phone for the purposes of remapping the controls. However, the functionality ends there. The company said that it is not compatible with other systems wirelessly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="8BitDo Pro 2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UO945l1CH3_sYU_F0QKG2CjKBYo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903055/pro2_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: 8BitDo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P51VPv"&gt;This controller seems to be made for people who aren’t married to the analog stick arrangement of Microsoft’s Xbox controller. This one’s stick layout is more similar to a PlayStation controller, though all of the necessary Xbox buttons are here. There’s also a 3.5mm port for audio passthrough if you have headphones or a headset to connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWNTfC"&gt;It’d be ideal if the Xbox-flavored Pro 2 was wireless, but $45 for a customizable wired controller seems like a good value. Given that 8BitDo’s build quality is usually higher than many other third-party accessory makers, this might make for a nice companion to your official Xbox wireless controller or as a replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nb0aAi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpuwgC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rItnzt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
