    <title>Razer Huntsman V2 review: no need for speed</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Fast optical switches plus a fast 8,000Hz polling rate&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="dqPNOx"&gt;Razer’s latest keyboard, the Huntsman V2, is all about speed. It’s equipped with optical mechanical switches that can theoretically register key presses far faster than their traditional mechanical counterparts. Then, its 8,000Hz polling rate means it can report that key press to your PC nearly instantaneously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erzdnL"&gt;So yes, it’s theoretically very fast, arguably faster than most people will notice. But this speed doesn’t come at the expense of any other important elements of a modern mechanical keyboard. There’s RGB lighting support, software to customize the keyboard’s key maps and lighting effects, and — in the case of the full-size model — a volume wheel and dedicated media controls. But Razer has also made some choices with the linear switches in particular, that means that the Huntsman V2 might not be to every gamer’s tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxoRz4"&gt;The new Huntsman V2 comes in at four different price points depending on whether you want a numpad, and whether you like your switches clicky or linear. The tenkeyless model starts at $149.99 with clicky switches, or $159.99 with linear, while the full-size model is $189.99 or $199.99. That’s relatively expensive by off-the-shelf mechanical keyboard standards, meaning the Huntsman V2 has a lot to prove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QZ8OkA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10771009"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Dp5Asm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10771013"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gu539g"&gt;I’ve been testing two of the variants for this review, a Razer Huntsman V2 with clicky switches and a Razer Huntsman V2 Tenkeyless (aka TKL) with linear switches, both with a UK layout (US is also available). The latter comes without a numpad, volume wheel, or media keys. But the core functionality of both keyboards are identical, including their switch options, polling rate, and construction, so it makes sense to talk about them as a pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihFwlR"&gt;I’ve never been much of a fan of Razer’s bright green and black gamer aesthetic, but I was pleasantly surprised with how understated Huntsman V2 keyboards are beneath their rainbow-colored RGB lighting, which is easily disabled in their settings. Both the TKL and the full-size models are plain black, and their keycaps use a nice neutral font for their lettering. Only the TKL model actually has any visible Razer branding, and even then it’s limited to a lettermark subtly printed above the arrow keys. On the full-size model, this space is taken up with indicator LEDs for things like caps lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeNTRN"&gt;This space-efficient design means that both keyboards are relatively compact considering their layouts. There’s no large forehead here like you’ll see on Corsair’s keyboards: the footprint of both Huntsman V2s is just a little bigger than the keyboard layouts they contain. Razer does include a wrist rest with both boards — a soft cushion of fake leather — which increases their footprint a little, but I think it’s a worthwhile addition. The USB cable is removable on the TKL and uses a standard Type-C connector on the keyboard end. It’s weirdly (and annoyingly) fixed in place on the full-size model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eq6j5C0SZpSm5OzrmD1quWjtbac=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869984/jporter_210920_4765_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The full-size board comes equipped with a volume wheel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ImA20W"&gt;The keycaps are made from relatively thin PBT plastic and use a double-shot design for their lettering, which allows their backlighting to shine through and should prove durable over time. All the keys here are standard sizes, so you shouldn’t have any problems finding aftermarket keycaps if you so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KlDDcB"&gt;The exception to this otherwise understated look is the keyboards’ RGB lighting, which by default cycles through a kaleidoscopic rainbow of colors. I far prefer an all-white color-scheme, and it was a simple matter of customizing this using Razer’s Synapse software. Using this software involves agreeing to Razer’s terms of service, but you can use it in guest mode if you’d rather not create a Razer account. Like Razer’s other products, this lighting can sync with various compatible games if you so choose. Its software also allows for the keyboard’s keys to be remapped, and for the most part it’ll remember these changes if you plug it into a different computer, although there are exceptions like lighting profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dhm4of"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Its double-shot PBT keycaps should be durable over time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GerB5i"&gt;Neither keyboard feels flimsy with little to no flex, but they lack the weight and heft of keyboards like the Keychron Q1. I think that’s only likely to matter if you want a heavy keyboard for the sake of having a heavy keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPXoNY"&gt;Razer’s big selling point for the Huntsman V2 lineup, and its big upgrade over its predecessor, is its 8,000kHz polling rate, which means that the keyboard is checking for key presses and reporting them back to your computer 8,000 times a second. That’s eight times faster than the original Huntsman and most other keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/je0t-yz6GxAo2ZNFaFlhJi4Px6k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869982/jporter_210920_4765_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The switches should be compatible with most keycaps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y3tr0GGsTGOVBQV_lv9cVK0U3rw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869981/jporter_210920_4765_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard is sturdy, though not particularly heavy. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LAg2QX"&gt;We’ve seen other keyboards offer similarly high polling rates like &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=corsair+keyboard+review+site%3Atheverge.com&amp;amp;oq=corsair+keyboard+review+site%3Atheverge.com&amp;amp;aqs=edge..69i57.3095j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;Corsair’s K70 RGB TKL&lt;/a&gt;, but Razer’s Hunstman has a couple of theoretical advantages. First off, while Corsair’s recent keyboard reports over USB at 8,000Hz, it’s actually only internally scanning for key presses at 4,000Hz. In contrast, Razer tells me the Huntsman V2’s entire stack is 8,000Hz, which should give it a small advantage in responsiveness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Voi8D4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I struggled to notice the responsiveness in practice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nWJku7"&gt;But more importantly, the Huntsman V2, like the Huntsman before it, uses optical mechanical switches. That means they use a small beam of light to detect when a key has been pressed, rather than using metallic contacts as with Cherry’s traditional MX switch design. This solves a problem with mechanical switches where the contacts can “bounce” together before making final contact. It’s something that only happens for a fraction of a second, but it means that traditional mechanical keyboards suffer from a “debounce delay” while they work out whether a keypress has actually happened. Optical switches don’t have this problem. So in the case of the Huntsman V2, you should be able to press a switch and have it report back to your machine with almost no latency, according to Razer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvWyY8"&gt;That’s the theory, but while I wish I could say that I feel the difference, I struggled to notice it in practice. I played around 10 hours of &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; on the Huntsman V2 with my frame rate at a more or less stable 90fps and struggled to notice any improvements in latency compared with my usual 1,000Hz Filco Majestouch 2 keyboard. That’s not to say there wasn’t an objective difference in latency. Filming myself hitting the spacebar in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; in slow-mo at 240fps with the game running at 100fps showed that the Huntsman V2 does indeed have a faster response time. It just wasn’t acute enough for me to feel in practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DLiZGummfghTdgPn9_SGhtpJvrA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869985/jporter_210920_4765_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only the Tenkeyless model has a detachable USB-C cable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qzOwFr"&gt;That said, these results will vary a lot depending on the kinds of games you play, and the frame rates they run at on your machine. So if you’re a fan of playing esports titles on a 240Hz or even 360Hz monitor, and have faster reflexes, then it could make more of a difference. But, for me, the difference was negligible. For most people, I don’t think the 8,000Hz refresh rate makes enough of a difference to warrant recommending the Huntsman V2 over an otherwise similarly specced competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jXozmO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The keyboard’s clicky and linear switch options are very different&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vKV8lQ"&gt;It’s at this point that I’d normally quickly outline the switch options of a keyboard and tell you to follow your heart: whether that be to smooth linear switches, bumpy tactiles, or clicky… clicky switches. But it’s not that simple with the Huntsman V2, which is available with either clicky or linear switch options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6R6jox"&gt;Yes, both switches share a lot of the same fundamentals. They’re both optical, obviously, and both have stabilizer bars built into each and every switch, which Razer says is to cut down on the amount of moving parts. But the linear switches specifically have been updated since the original Huntsman, and now have a built in “silicon sound dampener.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UBjkFc2h2l_4mCPqw-00BeO_XiM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869976/jporter_210920_4765_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s linear optical switches now come equipped with a silicon sound dampener.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4TKCF53oPAjvFfwGQV6SH6n8vyk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869977/jporter_210920_4765_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tenkeyless model is the more understated of the two.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ib2efY"&gt;It means the two switch types feel radically different, far more so than you’d expect when comparing the clicky and linear options on another keyboard. And I don’t think the changes Razer has made with its second generation linear optical switches are necessarily an improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzgaxF"&gt;That’s because this silicon sound dampener has a major impact on the way the linear switches feel. It’s similar to the effect you’d get by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcgamingrace.com%2Fblogs%2Fguides-resources%2Fwhat-are-mechanical-keyboard-orings&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22691381%2Frazer-huntsman-v2-review-optical-mechanical-keyboard-8000hz-polling-rate-linear-clicky-switches" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;installing rubber O-rings&lt;/a&gt; on a normal mechanical switch, only built into their design with no option to remove them. Yes, this makes for a quieter keyboard, but it’s at the expense of that crispness that I’d argue is part of the fundamental appeal of mechanical keyboards in the first place. It feels like you’re typing on a membrane keyboard, just with the improved responsiveness and durability of a mechanical keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRquRR"&gt;The clicky switches are better, but I still don’t think the typing experience is great. Although it’s not nearly as soft as the bottoming out feeling of the linear switches, there’s still a slight mushiness to the feeling here, and the keyboard’s stabilizers (the mechanisms under long keys that stop them from wobbling) have a bit of rattle to them. If you want a lovely crisp and clean-feeling typing experience, this isn’t it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hTA7b4KH-_P_hYEhygLpVtjZQPY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869983/jporter_210920_4765_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All the dedicated media keys you could need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IgA8H8"&gt;On paper, it’s hard to knock either the Huntsman V2 or the Huntsman V2 Tenkeyless. They’re responsive thanks to fast polling and optical switches, well supported with Razer’s software, and have designs that should work well on basically any desk. Each also has its own nice quality-of-life features, like a volume wheel on the full-size model and a detachable USB-C cable on the TKL version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pfQDth"&gt;But I think the improvement in responsiveness is marginal at best and only really relevant if you’re playing an esports-focused title at higher refresh rates. Then, when it comes to the Huntsman V2’s overall typing experience, it simply can’t match up to other similarly priced keyboards available elsewhere. It’s a very functional keyboard, but it falls short of matching this functionality with quality.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney sues to keep its Avengers copyrights assembled</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/094KRpcgJcrnHH8TyXU7fla_nME=/7x0:4096x2726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69904611/7845a8b610b38e85a4395b809d7764c6_4096x2726_322c95ed.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cqpdzf"&gt;Disney-owned Marvel is suing relatives of Steve Ditko and other Marvel comics creators to retain control of classic characters, including Iron Man, Daredevil, Spider-Man, and Black Widow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLafA7"&gt;The lawsuits, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/marvel-suing-avengers-copyright-termination-1235020110/"&gt;covered earlier today by &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, were filed in New York and California against the heirs of &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.567067/gov.uscourts.nysd.567067.1.0.pdf"&gt;Steve Ditko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.832358/gov.uscourts.cacd.832358.1.0.pdf"&gt;Don Rico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.567078/gov.uscourts.nysd.567078.1.0.pdf"&gt;Don Heck&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.469853/gov.uscourts.nyed.469853.1.0.pdf"&gt;Gene Colan&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Stan Lee’s brother and Marvel collaborator &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.567054/gov.uscourts.nysd.567054.1.0_1.pdf"&gt;Lawrence Lieber&lt;/a&gt;. They ask courts to declare that Disney has sole ownership of comics like &lt;em&gt;The Avengers, Iron Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Amazing Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Strange Tales&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tales of Suspense&lt;/em&gt; — including the characters and story elements that have formed the basis for Disney’s lucrative Marvel Cinematic Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSEmrJ"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; notes, the suits follow Lieber and others sending termination notices to reclaim part of the rights on many Marvel characters. They’re an attempt to head off litigation that might follow from those notices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6BWkC"&gt;Termination notices are meant to let creators and their heirs share in publishers’ profits. But Disney’s attorneys argue that Marvel had sole creative control over the characters and comic books in question, saying it paid writers and artists on a work-for-hire basis that precluded any rights to the resulting books. “This case thus involves an invalid attempt, by means of termination notices ... to acquire certain rights to iconic Marvel comic book characters and stories,” says the suit against Lieber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PobUwN"&gt;Artists and authors, as well as their families, have fought repeated legal battles for the rights to iconic comics characters. The efforts have had limited success. In 2014, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/business/media/marvel-settles-with-family-of-comic-book-artist-jack-kirby.html"&gt;Disney and the children of Marvel legend Jack Kirby settled&lt;/a&gt; a lawsuit that saw an appeals court rule in Disney’s favor, concluding that Kirby had worked on a for-hire basis. The same year, an &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2014/01/superman-warner-bros-dc-comics-copyright-lawsuit-668850/"&gt;appeals court affirmed&lt;/a&gt; DC parent company Warner Bros’ victory over the family of Superman co-creator Joe Shuster. And in Marvel cases specifically, the comics giant has cited its collaborative “Marvel Method” as an argument in its favor — saying it makes it difficult to assign ownership to a specific author or artist.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2oTvpo"&gt;Twitter is bringing Topics to Spaces so that hosts can tag their Spaces with up to three relevant Topics, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1441438483717836802"&gt;according to the Spaces Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a small addition to start: there are only 10 Topics to choose from, limited to English, for some people on the Android app. Twitter says it will expand to iOS and add more Topics and languages soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btNsuS"&gt;The initial 10 Topics — including Entertainment, Gaming, and World News — align with the ones that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20948547/twitter-topics-launch-sports-gaming-entertainment-test"&gt;currently exist across Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, which people can choose to follow to get related content on their timelines. Adding Topics to Spaces brings it even closer to how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586845/clubhouse-open-beta-invite-access-android-ios"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; works, with different topics to explore and clubs to join based around those topics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="00vkpm"&gt;One of the nicer things about Twitter is finding people who share your possibly niche interests, so it makes sense to add at least some of its Topics to Spaces. There are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/flow/topics_selector"&gt;several hundred available&lt;/a&gt;, and some of them get pretty specific: you can choose to follow the Topics for Dinosaurs, Bollywood Dance, Drone Racing, Unexplained Phenomena, and Adam Sandler, to name a few. (I’m losing hope that an Antique Glassware Identification Topic will materialize, but that might just be me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fE72gG"&gt;Twitter has been steadily updating Spaces since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187490/twitter-spaces-test-voice-chat-rooms"&gt;started testing late last year&lt;/a&gt;. In recent months, it’s begun &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644283/twitter-ticketed-spaces-live-audio-test"&gt;rolling out Ticketed Spaces&lt;/a&gt; and added more options for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640097/twitter-spaces-attending-listening-follow-top-of-feed"&gt;discoverability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611609/twitter-spaces-co-host-feature-moderate-manage-social-audio-rooms"&gt;moderation&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

Canadian authorities &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18128057/huawei-cfo-canada-arrest-iran-sanctions-violation"&gt;arrested the Chinese executive in December 2018&lt;/a&gt; on suspicion of violating US sanctions, and she has remained there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/11/18134938/huawei-cfo-meng-wanzhou-bail-house-arrest-us-china"&gt;on house arrest&lt;/a&gt; ever since, fighting US attempts at extradition. Hearings in her extradition case ended in August, with the ruling scheduled for October 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKwrEt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/09/24/world/meng-wanzhou-huawei-trial?action=click&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&amp;amp;module=&amp;amp;state=default&amp;amp;region=header&amp;amp;context=breakout_link_back_to_briefing#huawei-meng-wanzhou"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that during Meng’s appearance Friday afternoon, she pleaded not guilty to the charges against her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KMWho"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; earlier reported that prosecutors will arrange to defer and later drop the charges in exchange for admitting some wrongdoing, however according to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, that will not include entering a guilty plea. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-reaches-deal-with-huawei-executive-11632494001?st=n81fv8iy9e669cs&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Justice Department officials under the Biden administration revisited negotiations that had broken down under President Trump. Its sources report that Huawei itself is not a part of the deal and will continue to fight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/16/18185771/huawei-trade-secrets-charges-federal-investigation"&gt;its charges of fraud and trade secret theft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKzs4A"&gt;Meng was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18201023/us-charges-huawei-fraud-stealing-t-mobile-justice-department"&gt;indicted on fraud charges claiming the Chinese technology and telecommunications company misrepresented its relationship with an Iranian affiliate&lt;/a&gt;, along with accusations it stole intellectual property from T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46hhwq"&gt;Spokespeople for the US Attorney’s Office and Huawei have not commented publicly on the matter. According to the &lt;em&gt;CBC&lt;/em&gt; sources, Meng will pay a fine as part of a plea deal, while &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;says the agreement reached with US prosecutors will allow her to leave Canada and return to China. A former Canadian diplomat told the &lt;em&gt;CBC &lt;/em&gt;he expects her release would lead to China deporting two Canadians it arrested and charged with espionage following Meng’s arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFIHHw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 24th, 2:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add Meng’s court appearance and not guilty plea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Lightning port isn’t about convenience; it’s about control</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xhSBZJ"&gt;The European Commission shook the iPhone world to its roots this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"&gt;announcing a new policy&lt;/a&gt; that would require all smartphones to adopt USB-C ports for physical charging in an effort to reduce e-waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxSmPd"&gt;Apple, of course, doesn’t offer a USB-C iPhone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070848/eu-apple-european-commission-common-charger-lightning-cable-port"&gt;having argued to the European Commission in the past&lt;/a&gt; that “Legislation would have a direct negative impact by disrupting the hundreds of millions of active devices and accessories used by our European customers and even more Apple customers worldwide, creating an unprecedented volume of electronic waste and greatly inconveniencing users.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wYvKqy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple obviously prefers Lightning to USB-C&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yyc1No"&gt;Switching to USB-C, Apple says, would actually be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; wasteful than sticking with Lightning, since customers would need new cables and adapters — despite the fact that Apple already offers USB-C ports on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features"&gt;iPads&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/9/8372335/12-inch-macbook-review"&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; and has managed to switch over those popular products without major issues or customer revolts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PpyaTz"&gt;Notably absent from Apple’s argument, though, is the fact that cutting out a Lightning port on an iPhone wouldn’t just create more e-waste (if you buy Apple’s logic) or inconvenience its customers. It also means that Apple would lose out on the revenue it makes from every Lightning cable and accessory that works with the iPhone, Apple-made or not — along with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/21/3793488/apple-changes-iphone-accessory-guidelines-is-not-standing-in-the-way-of-pop-accessory"&gt;control it has&lt;/a&gt; over what kinds of hardware &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/24/3801436/kickstarter-charging-station-pop-back-on-after-apple-changes-lightning-accessory-rules"&gt;does&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/20/3789504/kickstarter-charger-pop-turns-to-competitor-to-process-refunds-apple"&gt;doesn’t&lt;/a&gt;) get to exist for the iPhone and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/3/3451032/apple-lightning-certification-accessory-restrictions"&gt;which companies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-revokes-monsters-authority-to-make-licensed-accessories-1434481512"&gt;get to make them&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhZP2X"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://mfi.apple.com/"&gt;MFi program&lt;/a&gt; means that if you want to plug anything into an iPhone, be it charger or adapter or accessory, you have to go through Apple. And Apple takes a cut of every one of those devices, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ca7ugP"&gt;Want to connect an external display? You’ll need an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMD826AM%2FA%2Flightning-digital-av-adapter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F24%2F22690338%2Fapple-iphone-lightning-ports-convenience-control-usb-c-eu-wireless-charging-mfi-magsafe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple-approved adapter&lt;/a&gt;. Import photos and videos from an SD card or flash drive? An &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMD821AM%2FA%2Flightning-to-usb-camera-adapter%3Ffnode%3Da07275593a4e170d81156b6668259dc502a6abe2eb6c0ce924c9284c8a53605fa614c8df300fda18d0ae87dfa52f3d6da397bb6af24f8704e28a44772c60a3e40378d4927a3ee59ae4e80ca3a9dd46ac61bff748b417b45d1f0991f0acbf0c77a680f4c5607c22125bd513c593c20e34%26fs%3Df%253Dadapter%2526fh%253D458e%25252B45b0&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F24%2F22690338%2Fapple-iphone-lightning-ports-convenience-control-usb-c-eu-wireless-charging-mfi-magsafe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple-approved adapter&lt;/a&gt;. Want to use a DAC to take advantage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;Apple Music’s new hi-res lossless audio&lt;/a&gt;? Again, you’ll either need an MFi device or an Apple-approved USB dongle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fsr815"&gt;The same, of course, isn’t true of Apple’s USB-C-based devices, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/2/20750137/apple-ipad-pro-usb-c-hubs-hyperdrive-belkin-satechi-kanex"&gt;which have a robust ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; that can broadly be defined as virtually every product that uses USB-C. With a USB-C iPad, you can simply plug in flash drives and keyboards and displays and any number of useful additions that make those devices better. Apple even made a point of that fact during its latest keynote when announcing the new iPad Mini. And of course, USB-C iPads can be charged by any standard USB-C cable that’s capable of putting out enough wattage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjYAaL"&gt;The European Commission's rule could theoretically do the same for iPhones by forcing into existence the USB-C iPhone that Apple has adamantly refused to make thus far. But the new change may mean that Apple could shift towards (or accelerate its plans for) a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307716/apple-lightning-portless-iphone-usb-c-magsafe-charging-kuo-rumor"&gt;completely portless iPhone instead&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than give into USB-C ports, the company could eschew ports entirely in order to shift customers towards using its proprietary charging methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kJVkbU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The EU’s USB-C proposal might give us a portless iPhone instead","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689432/eu-iphone-usb-c-switch-portless-design"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FsqIic"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689432/eu-iphone-usb-c-switch-portless-design"&gt;It’s the sort of solution that seems obvious&lt;/a&gt; — it’s practically an intentional loophole in the EU policy — until you consider how little sense a portless iPhone makes, absent Apple’s desire to defend its accessory fees and ecosystem control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmVHtW"&gt;Switching to USB-C, a standard that’s used by virtually every other major tech product (including many of Apple’s own, like its recent MacBook and IPad lineups) would make sense. The iPhone is possibly the most popular device in the world that uses a proprietary charger, and a switch to USB-C would simplify charging setups for the millions of iPhone owners around the world. And USB-C would still allow for similar waterproofing, data transfer, and charging speeds compared to Lightning (as evidenced by any number of Android phones or Apple’s iPads.) There’s a reason the European Commission is looking to institute the new change, after all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91pWVK"&gt;If the EU allowed Apple to stick with Lightning, keeping that standard around also makes a certain amount of sense, even if it’s frustrating to those (like me) who would prefer a more unified charging standard. Lightning is an established ecosystem that millions of customers already have cables for, with fast data transfer and charging speeds. Like USB-C, it offers waterproofing capabilities, and it gets Apple both its licensing fees and ecosystem control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mz6m3y"&gt;But a portless iPhone that relies on MagSafe (or another wireless standard) is a baffling proposition. It would force millions of customers to have to switch to new chargers, generating tons of e-waste in the process. The result of all that cost and effort would be a charging and data transfer system that is slower and less power efficient in every way compared to wired cables, while also being larger and bulkier than a Lightning or a USB-C wire — just compare the size of one of Apple’s MagSafe cables, or the smallest Qi wireless charger, to a regular wired plug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pLiv34"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple could weather a switch to USB-C just fine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="erbqvz"&gt;Apple is a $2.4 trillion company; it likely would be just fine without the revenues it gets from Lightning cable fees, should it switch to USB-C entirely. After all, there’s still plenty of proprietary Apple chargers and technologies out there to license, too, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, AirPlay, Find My, or the rumored new magnetic laptop chargers that may be in the works for later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWMXCq"&gt;But profits aside, a switch to USB-C would mean relinquishing another piece of control over what iPhone owners can do with their devices outside of Apple’s carefully curated walled garden. And that, as we’ve seen time and again, is something that Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"&gt;loath to allow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vwlMwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"},{"title":"Apple should switch the iPhone to USB-C if it really wants to help the environment","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21522980/apple-iphone-12-pro-usb-c-lightning-environment-charger-box-electronic-waste"},{"title":"Adding USB-C to the iPad isn’t enough to fix Apple’s messy port strategy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/31/18043062/apple-usb-c-ipad-pro-strategy-iphone-macbook-port-dongle"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Here’s how much that free iPhone really costs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aoo6ErNbF9KL1EZXp8uvg7yf2gU=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69904305/lcimg_8043788f_4592_4b97_9d19_6cf11041bc74.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prices for iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone Pro Max, as announced at the 2021 Apple Event.&lt;/em&gt; | Sean Hollister&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0oPG4N"&gt;With all the carriers dangling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22678111/iphone-13-carrier-promotions-new-signups"&gt;sweet, sweet trade-in and upgrade offers&lt;/a&gt; to essentially give you a “free” iPhone 13 (or two) this year, one can’t help but wonder: which one is the best deal? In this case, that would be the offer that costs you the least money but gets you the iPhone you want. Between all the convoluted conditions and confusing industry jargon, the carriers certainly don’t make it easy to compare different offers or make clear what you’re signing up for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJ8Hta"&gt;Carriers might be eager to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22678111/iphone-13-carrier-promotions-new-signups"&gt;sign up new customers for their bottom lines&lt;/a&gt;, but you need to look out for yours too. After all, is it better to opt for a cheaper unlimited plan that requires a 36-month commitment or get instant trade-in credits to pay a little less sales tax upfront? Should you look for deals that give you instant trade-in credits or get trade-in credits in the form of bill credits over the course of your agreement? It’s sometimes hard to understand all the details until you’ve already signed the contract. To save you the trouble, I took a closer look at the fine print of these deals and did some back-of-the-napkin calculations to find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lQYt37"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"},{"title":"iPhone 13 Pro review: a better display, the best camera, and incredible battery life","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"},{"title":"How to buy the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22665165/apple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCbB4ruy8_POK4LyN7eYl8Gt1vg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874502/lcimg_a194780c_218b_4835_a70c_847baa93d76f.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sean Hollister&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many of the carrier trade-in offers are so aggressive that you can get an iPhone 13 Pro for “free.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EaCcga"&gt;In this case, I wanted to figure out which deal offers the best overall value over the long term. For example, what are my upfront and long-term costs in getting the newest iPhone for as low as free? For the sake of this exercise, I pretended to be a new customer in New York City, shopping for a single phone line, who wants to trade her iPhone 11 for an iPhone 13 or an iPhone 13 Pro,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSsTVt"&gt;Some important caveats about the numbers I’ll be referencing: they are by no means definitive and only serve to demonstrate how these deals work. For one thing, these carrier offers are time-sensitive and may already be different by the time you read this. The specifics of your carrier plan are influenced by many personal factors, like your credit history, your local tax rate, how many lines you need, and any special discounts that you’re eligible for (e.g., military/veteran). I can only present a relatively basic set of numbers that don’t reflect all the many possible variations in the universe, so take my numbers with a grain of salt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMqT8G"&gt;After comparing similar offers from AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile / Sprint, Verizon, Apple.com, I’ve noticed a few tips that would help you shop for the best deal for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1u5JP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My key takeaways...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In some scenarios, it might make sense to pay for a device in full and instant trade-in credits, rather than rely on trade-in credits in the form of bill credits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k9wZNK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at the plans, not the free phone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPPJpa"&gt;Most of the trade-in credits are so high that they basically cover the cost of an iPhone 13 or iPhone 13 Pro — assuming your trade-in device is from the past two years and in good condition. So when you look at these deals, you should not get distracted by the allure of a free iPhone. Instead, focus on the cost of the plan after 24 to 36 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYHS5M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contract Length Matters Most&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrP3h3"&gt;The duration of the contract has the biggest impact on separating the best value deal from the bad. While AT&amp;amp;T offers the cheapest unlimited plan among its competition ($65/month), after 36 months (the required length you need to have service for to get the best offer), it ended up costing the most money ($2,445.30). Since most of its rivals’ plans are only 24 months long, I did the math on the AT&amp;amp;T plan at 24 months just so that I could compare apples to apples. It turns out the $65-per-month plan is the least expensive one after 24 months ($1,630.20) and is even cheaper than the special promotion between Apple and T-Mobile / Sprint ($1,713.60), which includes an extra $500 discount on the phone when you sign up for the $85 Magenta / Sprint Max plan. It’s worth gaming out the full cost of the plan for the duration of the contract before you sign on the line because this is where you’ll be spending the majority of your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxJeXh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instant Trade-in Credits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmQkZL"&gt;If you can pay for the balance of your phone in full at the time of purchase and live near an eligible Apple store, you might want to take advantage of the instant trade-in credits that Apple offers. The beauty of the instant trade-in credit is that you get the value right at the time of purchase, which lowers the sales tax you pay at checkout — unlike the online trade-in process where your device has to be mailed to a third party to be evaluated before its actual value will be credited to your monthly bills in a few months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5Jmy6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trade-offs with Trade-ins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpKrTX"&gt;Although my hypothetical trade-in credit for the iPhone 11 (between $800 and $1,000) effectively renders my monthly device payments to $0, because I am required to be on a monthly device payment plan as part of any trade-in offer, I may not terminate my device plan earlier than 24 months. If I do, I would be responsible for paying for the balance of this “free” iPhone, lose the remaining value from my trade-in device, and (potentially) pay an early termination penalty. Now, if I paid for the device upfront (ideally with an instant trade-in credit), I could choose a plan that better reflects my actual data consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSMYJp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Fees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rm4lO4"&gt;In some cases, the carrier might require you to pay a down payment or an activation fee and offer you different contract lengths based on your credit history. While you won’t be paying for your iPhone directly when your trade-in credit kicks in, you still have to pay the sales tax on the full price of the phone — there is no bill credit to reimburse that cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuCwrG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Winner: Verizon &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FL7vlP"&gt;Out of all the carrier offers, Verizon actually had the lowest overall costs with its 24-month payment plans, even though it doesn’t have the cheapest 5G plan or the shortest agreement length. At $2,077.36 for the iPhone 13 and $2,086.36 for the iPhone 13 Pro, these totals don’t even include the $500 gift card that Verizon is offering to customers who switch providers. The most expensive carrier offer, on the other hand, is from AT&amp;amp;T and its extra-long 36-month contract. Not only does it cost more of your hard-earned money, but your iPhone 13 will be so out-of-date after three years that you may want to pay to end your contract early. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If audio is missing from your Instagram Stories, a fix is here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CwWIgZEdR_WxjciZ0JSrDh4SL40=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69900354/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="naTnU7"&gt;Following the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 update&lt;/a&gt;, some users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/psjmqp/anyone_facing_audio_issue_when_phone_is_on_mute/"&gt;have reported strange behavior on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; — when an iPhone’s ringer switch is set to silent mode, stories play without audio. &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252"&gt;A new update released on Friday&lt;/a&gt; appears to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVHNp9"&gt;Silent videos might sound like a blessing for friends who love to put every new song Spotify suggests to them in their Instagram Story, but that’s not exactly how the switch is supposed to work. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/psjmqp/anyone_facing_audio_issue_when_phone_is_on_mute/"&gt;Silent mode is primarily meant to control system sounds&lt;/a&gt; like ringtones and text tones, not the audio you hear inside apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fYb3oH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook is working on a fix&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cpFWyN"&gt;Before the update, I was able to recreate the behavior on my own iPhone running iOS 15. For some users, the issue popped up even earlier during the public beta of Apple’s software update. It’s not clear if this issue impacted users running older versions of iOS, and Facebook didn’t confirm if the issue was specifically related to iOS 15. The company did provide the following statement promising a fix, however:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="dRYHtH"&gt;We’re aware that some people are having trouble hearing their audio in Instagram Stories. We’re working to fix this issue as quickly as possible and apologize for any inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8KO1BY"&gt;As of Friday, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252"&gt;the update is available to download&lt;/a&gt;, and at least on my device, the problem is gone. Audio plays in Instagram Stories with the ringer off after a press of the volume button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC4ENM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 9/24 12:48PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Instagram’s update that fixes the issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BChkja"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7SQeS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China’s central bank bans cryptocurrency transactions to avoid ‘risks’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s86HgiiJu25QCboxUsPaX7n1A94=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903772/acastro_bitcoin_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZowYTL"&gt;The People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank, &lt;a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4348556/index.html"&gt;said Friday&lt;/a&gt; that cryptocurrency transactions are illegal, saying such currencies “do not have legal tender status” and therefore “cannot be circulated as currency in the market.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnH7Fk"&gt;In a statement, the bank said that bitcoin and other virtual currency transactions have disrupted economic and financial order, contributing to a rise in “money laundering, illegal fund-raising, fraud, pyramid schemes, and other illegal and criminal activities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qW3flT"&gt;Crypto transactions are now considered criminal financial activity in China, the bank said, and the country will “resolutely curb the hype of virtual currency transactions, severely crack down on illegal financial activities and illegal criminal activities related to virtual currencies, protect the safety of the people’s property in accordance with the law, and make every effort to maintain economic and financial order and social stability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXuPEk"&gt;Friday’s announcement is the culmination of an ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading"&gt;crackdown on crypto&lt;/a&gt; in the country; the Chinese government began issuing warnings about trading in mining cryptocurrencies in May, and in June, the bank &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/21/china-says-banks-must-block-crypto-transactions-market-falls/"&gt;told financial institutions&lt;/a&gt; to stop processing digital currency transactions. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-24/china-deems-all-crypto-related-transactions-illegal-in-crackdown?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that one major reason for the Chinese crackdown on cryptocurrencies is the amount of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275243/teslas-bitcoin-purchase-clashes-climate-change-mission"&gt;energy needed to mine cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; transactions. China is in the midst of an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/global-energy-crunch-leaves-china-facing-more-power-shortages?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;energy crisis&lt;/a&gt; that has already affected many other industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOBaWY"&gt;Cryptocurrency prices were down &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BTC-USD?sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwifoYvH75fzAhXkF1kFHUmRC0YQ-fUHegQICBAS"&gt;sharply in late-morning trading&lt;/a&gt; following China’s announcement. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 Mini still gets slower MagSafe charging speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the same camera sensor as last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KWeuXMt7N7rde9EUNmOF4cRROwU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903718/vpavic_210918_4760_0703.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HLI4SC"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini is out Friday, and while it has a number of welcome improvements over the 12 Mini, it shares one limitation with its predecessor: the 13 Mini is still limited to peak power delivery of up 12 watts over MagSafe wireless charging, according to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211829"&gt;an Apple support document&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/iphone-13-mini-12w-magsafe/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That means it, like the 12 Mini, has a lower maximum MagSafe charging speed than the rest of the iPhone 13 lineup, which can all charge at up to 15 watts over MagSafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHvjDm"&gt;While it might be disappointing to hear that the smallest iPhone can charge slower over MagSafe, it does have improved battery life. Apple says you should get up to 1.5 hours more battery life than you would with the iPhone 12 Mini, so you may not need to charge the 13 Mini as often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MASWUp"&gt;That said, the 13 Mini offers less battery life than the rest of the iPhone 13 models, and it can still run out quickly. Here’s Dieter Bohn’s early impressions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;from his review&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hoFcnE"&gt;However, I do have an early impression of the iPhone 13 Mini’s battery life. It’s that Apple’s one-and-a-half hour longer claim seems reasonable, but that is faint praise. I used the iPhone 12 Mini a lot over the last year, and what I said when I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;first reviewed it&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be true: if you use this little phone like it’s a big smartphone, you will drain the battery by early afternoon or even lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycbIf"&gt;The iPhone 12 and 13 Minis are meant to be minimalistic both in size and also in how much you use them. If you are constantly using your phone all day, the smaller battery in the Mini isn’t likely to be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Gig work is precarious no matter the country</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Zomato delivery man seen riding along the streets of..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_FTUMnl_OSix0Ze1lmEqhSAkdaU=/0x0:3978x2652/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903538/1233964644.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YV0bBA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;The lives of delivery workers in major US cities&lt;/a&gt; are dangerous, surprisingly expensive, and largely only possible because of the support app-based laborers offer each other. But a &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-global-gig-workers/"&gt;new editorial series from &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that the experiences of US-based gig workers aren’t unique — trying to make a living while at the whims of indifferent platforms is difficult no matter what country you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZCTJu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;’s overview is based on a survey of over 4,000 gig workers across the world. The publication’s findings are extensive — there’s plenty to examine from just about every angle you can imagine — but &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/gig-workers-around-the-world-are-finally-organizing/"&gt;the similarities drawn between workers in different countries&lt;/a&gt; is striking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="GOCQDu"&gt;Many [workers] — more than 60% — said that they were financially satisfied. But, at the same time, 62% also said that they were frequently anxious and scared on the job, afraid of accidents, assaults, illness, or simply not making enough money to cover their costs. More than two-thirds of the workers surveyed by &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; said they want out within a year. More than a quarter said they were planning on quitting within a month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="J5c5c9"&gt;Those parallels appeared in another aspect of platform work the series analyzes: &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-how-platforms-set-women-up-to-fail/"&gt;the treatment of women in the gig economy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; found women’s historically marginalized status in traditional economies was replicated on apps and platforms. &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;survey indicated&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;women worked fewer hours — and many had caregiving duties on top of gig work. They also worked lower-paying gigs and “earned less overall ... than their male counterparts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsDdSU"&gt;The gig economy’s strangling, kudzu vine-like spread is &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-investors-behind-gig-work-model/"&gt;largely possible because of massive sums of money from investment funds&lt;/a&gt; and, sometimes, other platform companies. Individual profiles included in the series further highlight that reach: &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-telemedicine-doctor-india/"&gt;a doctor working on a telehealth app&lt;/a&gt; in India, &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-delivery-driver-south-korea/"&gt;a delivery worker dealing with back pain&lt;/a&gt; in South Korea, and more. There’s too much to possibly summarize in one place, which is all the more reason why you should &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-global-gig-workers/"&gt;check out the entire &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; series here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHXepk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGV77r"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akcmkp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aynC8Q"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUL6FT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1owo6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
