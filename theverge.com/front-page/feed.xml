    <title>Amazon Music Unlimited offers six months free of Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S1rt2Ej7ZfbLHGeIa4ly9ExSfaU=/103x0:1218x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69515302/download.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F1Y4Uh"&gt;Amazon Music Unlimited customers can now score several months of Disney Plus for free, and the offer extends to new subscribers as well as existing users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL0YPF"&gt;Amazon announced Monday that existing Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers in the US and Canada can activate three months of Disney’s streaming service for free through &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/amazon-music-disney-plus-promotion"&gt;a new promotion&lt;/a&gt;. New Amazon Music Subscribers, meanwhile, will be able to access six months of Disney Plus through the offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0t2Ym"&gt;Amazon’s ad-free music streaming service costs $8 a month or $80 annually after a trial period. It is separate from Prime Music, the music service bundled with an Amazon Prime subscription. But where Prime Music has a catalog of roughly 2 million songs, Amazon Music Unlimited’s library comprises roughly 75 million songs and podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tAk6dq"&gt;The promotion is not, however, valid for users who already subscribe to Disney Plus. But if you’ve yet to subscribe to Disney’s streaming service, now’s not a bad time. New titles are releasing on the service every week, and the company has said that users can expect 100 new titles from Marvel, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, and National Geographic to hit the service each year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook has become a $1 trillion company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GrqSG-nohPSsyEr7S-IBnpGeX6s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69515217/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zLlhqZ"&gt;Facebook has joined the ranks of companies valued over a trillion dollars as of today’s market close. The company’s market cap is sitting at $1.008 trillion &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB?p=FB"&gt;according to Yahoo Finance&lt;/a&gt;, putting it over the mark for the first time in its history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqESF5"&gt;Some of the most notable of Facebook’s divisions are the Facebook site itself, along with Messenger, as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus. On &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17638764/apple-worlds-first-1-trillion-company-market-cap-stock-price"&gt;the list&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069458/google-alphabet-trillion-dollar-market-cap-apple-microsoft"&gt;of US tech companies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819160/amazon-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value"&gt;that have passed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18515623/microsoft-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value"&gt;the $1 trillion valuation&lt;/a&gt; mark, Facebook is the only one founded in the 2000s, making it the newest — as long as you’re counting from the date that Google was started (which was in 1998), instead of Alphabet (which was created 2015). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VCfxd"&gt;The news comes alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;the dismissal of the FTC’s case&lt;/a&gt; to unwind Facebook’s Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions, after a federal judge stated that the FTC did not offer enough evidence that the company is a monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Say farewell to the BMW i3, the kooky electric hatchback that couldn’t quite make it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BMW i3 hero" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ssvkhGIZAwjCnKaqZxZk-gz5y3M=/2x0:1099x731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514972/BMW16_2040.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M7rrZO"&gt;BMW will stop selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/17/5317032/bmw-i3-driving-the-electric-rebel-in-munichs-stable"&gt;the i3 electric hatchback&lt;/a&gt; in the US starting next month. It’s the latest pint-sized vehicle to fall victim to American car buyers’ insatiable appetite for huge, towering, climate-killing trucks and SUVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuI2kv"&gt;First released in 2013, the i3 was BMW’s first real electric vehicle. Always intended to be more of a city car than anything intended for long trips, the i3 maxed out at 80 miles of range from a 22kWh battery, with a modest 170 horsepower. The battery capacity grew 50 percent — to 33kWh — after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/1/11550026/bmw-i3-2017-electric-vehicle-range-larger-battery"&gt;2017 update&lt;/a&gt;, increasing the range to 113 miles. Thanks to its kooky, futuristic, and polarizing design, it was never a sales juggernaut, but it certainly developed a cult following over time. The i3 was able to carve out a niche in the nascent EV market and, all told, BMW has sold about 100,000 of them globally since it launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pP25D6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the i3 was BMW’s first real electric vehicle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zkca7l"&gt;But its relevance was certainly on the wane. &lt;a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2021/06/25/bmw-i3-era-comes-to-an-end-in-the-u-s-this-july/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;BMW Blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the i3’s inventory for the US was at its lowest point over the last 12 months, with customers often experiencing difficulties securing a production slot. Last year, only 1,052 i3s were sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cR2Av"&gt;In an email, a spokesperson for BMW confirmed that US production of the i3 will end July 2021. “At the time of its launch in 2013, the BMW i3 represented a pioneering moment in electric vehicles and lightweight construction,” the spokesperson said. “Not only was the BMW i3 of the world’s first purpose-built electric vehicles, but the use of carbon fiber reinforced plastic and aluminum in the vehicle’s construction, made it truly unique.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P07Yha"&gt;The “success” of the i3 has helped lay the groundwork for the imminent release of the BMW iX SUV and i4 sedan, which together represent the tip of the spear in the automaker’s belated effort to recapture its early sales momentum for EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuYR4E"&gt;BMW fans were disappointed that the automaker never made successors for the i3 or the plug-in hybrid i8 sports car in the years since those cars were released. But the company is iterating on the underlying electric technology. Now, that next-gen tech will not only power &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462746/bmw-ix-suv-ev-price-specs"&gt;the iX SUV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462504/bmw-i4-ev-price-specs-photos-release-date"&gt;the i4 sedan&lt;/a&gt; but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17279482/bmw-ix3-concept-specs-beijing-motor-show"&gt;the China-made iX3&lt;/a&gt; (which is now officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171762/bmw-ix3-long-range-electric-suv-us-market-china-europe"&gt;not destined for the US&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZS3Tf"&gt;Of course, the iX and i4 will be more expensive than the i3, which started at around $44,000. The base model i4 will start at $55,400, while the iX is expected to sell for $83,200. Both EVs will go on sale in the US starting in early 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41Oth0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Federal court dismisses FTC’s bid to unwind Instagram from Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/31Q8Uyv6kjS3tSwv5ISFIbxIZdo=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514871/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KrJR4W"&gt;On Monday, a US District Court dealt a huge blow to the federal government’s antitrust case against Facebook by &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20974146-ftc-facebook-dismissal"&gt;dismissing a complaint&lt;/a&gt; filed against the company by the Federal Trade Commission. The lawsuit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;filed late last year&lt;/a&gt;, sought to unwind Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The judge also dismissed an associated case filed by a group of state attorneys general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4e8WJ"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/191-0134/facebook-inc-ftc-v"&gt;its initial complaint&lt;/a&gt;, the FTC alleged that Facebook violated federal antitrust laws by purchasing a would-be competitor in the social media market. But in his decision to dismiss the complaint Monday, Judge James E. Boasberg wrote that the FTC offered insufficient evidence for its central claim — that Facebook wields monopoly power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ozLskU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This case involves no ordinary or intuitive market”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6nPtzD"&gt;“The FTC has failed to plead enough facts to plausibly establish a necessary element of all of its Section 2 claims —namely, that Facebook has monopoly power in the market for Personal Social Networking (PSN) Services,” Boasberg wrote. “The complaint contains nothing on that score save the naked allegation that the company has had and still has a ‘dominant share of th[at] market (in excess of 60%).’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8GvgF"&gt;Boasberg also dismissed the claims against Facebook’s interoperability restrictions, finding that the policies were implemented too long ago to be subject to FTC action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caHK8N"&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. However, the company’s stock stock surged in response to the dismissal, clearing $1 trillion in market capitalization for the first time in Facebook history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zSp7R"&gt;The ruling also struck down a parallel anti-monopoly case against Facebook filed by a coalition of state attorneys general. Nearly every state attorney general signed onto a lawsuit against Facebook in December, making similar allegations as the FTC case. But Boasberg dismissed that case &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20974156-govuscourtsdcd2249231370_1"&gt;in an accompanying decision&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, holding that &lt;a href="https://pivotallawgroup.com/Blog/2019/08/Case-Law-Update-The-Doctrine-of"&gt;a specific civil law doctrine&lt;/a&gt; prevented the coalition from challenging acquisitions settled so many years in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXI0vd"&gt;Notably, Judge Boasberg left room for the FTC to revise its case and unwind past Facebook mergers. The commission has until July 29th to file a new complaint outlining its argument regarding Facebook’s market dominance, and the judge made it clear that the FTC’s case was not affected by the civil doctrine that doomed the state attorneys general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsoGJD"&gt;“An injunction under Section 13(b) is a theoretically available remedy in a Section 2 challenge to long-ago mergers,” Boasberg wrote in the FTC opinion, “so long as the defendant still holds the purchased assets or stock, as is the case here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXeGo1"&gt;Boasberg also noted the inherent difficulty of establishing monopoly power for a free online service, as the FTC is now required to do. “This case involves no ordinary or intuitive market,” Boasberg’s opinion reads. “Rather, PSN [Personal Social Networking] services are free to use, and the exact metes and bounds of what even constitutes a PSN service — &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, which features of a company’s mobile app or website are included in that definition and which are excluded — are hardly crystal clear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqqYvo"&gt;The court’s dismissal could provoke more aggressive action from the legislature, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;Congress is currently pushing forward&lt;/a&gt; on sweeping tech antitrust reforms. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee approved a slate of bills targeting Big Tech’s market power, including bans on large mergers and new interoperability requirements. All six measures are headed to the House floor and parallel bills are expected to be introduced in the Senate over the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmgwV6"&gt;“Today’s development in the FTC’s case against Facebook shows that antitrust reform is urgently needed,” Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1409594342860283904?s=20"&gt;said in a tweet Monday&lt;/a&gt;. “Congress needs to provide additional tools and resources to our antitrust enforcers to go after Big Tech companies engaging in anticompetitive conduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Je4TVF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W7rfJa"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20974146-ftc-facebook-dismissal/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="ftc-facebook-dismissal (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Foursquare founder Dennis Crowley stepping down from full-time role</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dennis Crowley, co-founder of Foursquare" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fotqHMsSaZgaBIniWUmsp2UNkLQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514859/1173502621.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dennis Crowley, co-founder of Foursquare, is stepping down from his full-time role with the company | Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="82cd"&gt;Foursquare founder and former CEO Dennis Crowley is stepping down from his full-time role at the company, he wrote &lt;a href="https://dens.medium.com/after-12-years-im-stepping-back-from-foursquare-10c75372123d"&gt;in a Medium post on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. He’ll remain on the board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EPiQ9j"&gt;“What started around my kitchen table in the East Village back in early 2009 has grown to nearly 400 people working around the world in 2021,” Crowley wrote. “What started as a quest to ‘build a Marauders Map’ and to ‘turn the real world into a game’ and ‘build a hipster version of Clippy’ has turned into one of the world’s leading location technology platforms, powering location services for thousands of apps and top brands around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPCkaS"&gt;Crowley and Naveen Selvadurai launched Foursquare in 2009 as a smartphone app that let people use their then-fledgling iPhones with built-in GPS to check in at their physical locations. It gamified the collection of location data, letting people earn badges for a certain number of check-ins (how many places were you “mayor” of?). Venues offered rewards to entice customers to check in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="r6wHFI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;After 12+ yrs, I’m stepping back from Foursquare (tho I’ll remain on the Board). FSQ has been the best job I’ve ever had, with the best people I’ve ever worked with. Huge thx to our team, investors, partners, superusers &amp;amp; fans. Much love &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoFoursquareGo?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GoFoursquareGo&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="https://t.co/oTAtR1J6Y7"&gt;https://t.co/oTAtR1J6Y7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dennis Crowley    (@dens) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dens/status/1409506346391719941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xG0kIJ"&gt;But Foursquare did away with the check-ins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/1/5666062/foursquare-swarm-new-app"&gt;in 2014, and introduced its Swarm app&lt;/a&gt;, which was much less popular (no more mayors!) and became a way for users to check in with friends and create “lifelogs.” Foursquare’s main business pivoted away from consumer tech toward a B-to-B model — consider that it was sitting on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/7/3068529/all-new-foursquare-andrew-hogue-big-data"&gt;massive trove of user data&lt;/a&gt; — and provided its location technology via its &lt;a href="https://medium.com/foursquare-direct/on-announcing-foursquares-pilgrim-sdk-cb3f6ab9cfa8"&gt;Pilgrim SDK&lt;/a&gt; to other companies. It claimed Uber, Twitter, Snapchat, WeChat, and Apple Maps among its clientele.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ceurqk"&gt;Crowley says in the Medium post (and has said in numerous interviews) that the point of Foursquare “was never to build an awesome check-in button,” but rather to invent “the future of location tech.” Foursquare “did over $100M+ in revenue in 2020, and we’ll do *well over* $100M+ in revenue in 2021,” according to the post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ioW6w"&gt;He says he’s departing the company he cofounded to spend time with his family and because he has “lots of things I still want to build — many of which don’t fit neatly into the Foursquare of 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7SSVm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s xCloud game streaming is now widely available on iOS and PC</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QwiF2U"&gt;Microsoft’s xCloud, the cloud game streaming component of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate that doesn’t require a console to use, is rolling out fully to iOS devices, including iPhones and iPads, as well as PCs and macOS computers via the web. It’s been in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391561/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-xbox-game-streaming-beta-features"&gt;invite-only beta period since mid-April 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but Game Pass Ultimate subscribers &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http://xbox.com/play&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391561/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-xbox-game-streaming-beta-features&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22155602__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can now access games right from their devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BgVvlR"&gt;Microsoft says that on PCs, xCloud can be accessed through the Edge browser and Google Chrome. We’ve gotten it to work within macOS on Microsoft Edge and Safari. More than 100 games are available, and the service is compatible with Bluetooth controllers or ones connected via USB. On iOS, it’ll work as a web-based app via Safari, and you’ll have a choice between a controller or touch controls for certain games. &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/06/28/xbox-cloud-gaming-now-running-on-xbox-series-x/"&gt;Microsoft also shared in its blog post&lt;/a&gt; that xCloud is now powered by Xbox Series X consoles, setting the streaming at 1080p at up to 60 frames per second with a fast enough internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ciTfZ6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting today, Xbox Cloud Gaming is running on custom Xbox Series X hardware, and available to all &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxGamePass?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@XboxGamePass&lt;/a&gt; Ultimate members with Windows 10 PCs and Apple phones and tablets, via browser, across 22 countries. &lt;a href="https://t.co/HYuvbHGBUg"&gt;https://t.co/HYuvbHGBUg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxGamePass?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#XboxGamePass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xbox Wire (@XboxWire) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxWire/status/1409587759614885889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KVwCVj"&gt;The road to getting xCloud on iOS was a bumpy one, with Apple’s App Store guidelines initially blocking not just Microsoft but also Google’s Stadia and Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud streaming services from launching on the App Store. Apple eventually carved out some loopholes to allow them to operate via the web (but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;not without caveats&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7crOwz"&gt;To celebrate the launch, Microsoft put its “Designed for Xbox” badge on one of the best mobile gaming accessories around: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;Backbone’s One controller&lt;/a&gt;. This new version is physically identical to the preexisting model that has been available since late 2020 because it’s technically the same. What’s changed is the physical packaging that now calls out its Xbox compatibility, and despite no increase in price ($99.99), it comes with a complimentary three-month trial to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for new members, which usually costs $45 on its own. It’s available through &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fbackbone-one-mobile-ios-gaming-controller-for-xbox%2F8x4fhh4x4mhx%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplaybackbone.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F28%2F22554267%2Fmicrosoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-pass-ios-iphone-ipad-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Backbone’s website&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="JUBTBU"&gt;Backbone has recently updated its app with some deep Xbox integration, like tagging gameplay that you’ve recorded through xCloud. You can edit footage within the app and upload it as a link. It also features a new dynamic Xbox Game Pass feed to tell you about new games to try out and other suggestions based on your friends’ activities.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hold off on updating Snapchat for iOS — the latest version is crashing on launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat white ghost logo on a bright yellow background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wu7ItIATayqYYKLGHTtE5ta4qUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514767/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yBtjoK"&gt;If you haven’t updated to the latest version of Snapchat on iOS, dubbed version 11.34.0.35 and released late Sunday&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; don’t — the app is crashing on launch (&lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/28/dont-update-the-ios-snapchat-app-until-its-fixed"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Apple Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1409501297737359366?s=20"&gt;company has tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that it’s aware of the issue and is working on a fix, but for now if you want to stay snapping you should probably stick with the old version. The bug doesn’t appear to be affecting the Android version of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9d2Z7F"&gt;On my iPhone 12 Mini, the app stays open just long enough to give me a message that something went wrong, before crashing to Springboard. It is worth noting, though, that it was giving me that message before I updated as well, indicating that something may be amiss with Snapchat overall. The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j1we3B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Oh snap &lt;a href="https://t.co/yC2BKjhzmw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yC2BKjhzmw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1409582267270270976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MPdSne"&gt;If you’ve got automatic updates on for the App Store, but the buggy version of Snapchat hasn’t made it to your phone yet, you can turn auto-updating off by going to your iPhone’s Settings &amp;gt; App Store, and toggling App Updates off under Automatic Downloads. Just be sure to remember to turn it back on when this clears up — we’ll be sure to let you know when that happens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best free apps for video calling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Italy Continues Nationwide Lockdown To Control Coronavirus Spread" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sBOloN_0dkwsgGMSI0vJ1f76A3Y=/0x1111:2667x2889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66922524/1214094439.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Stefano Guidi/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jz5xAw"&gt;Things are starting to open up, but for now, the COVID-19 pandemic is still with us and many are still relying on video calls to keep in touch with work colleagues, family, and friends. And for most of us — especially those who are facing financial difficulties — free is best. Zoom continues to top the list of videoconferencing apps, but there are a bunch of applications out there that will allow you to meet others online for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBifoi"&gt;We’ve listed a few of the best known videoconferencing apps, along with a couple of popular text chat apps that include video calling features. While most of these already have free versions, some are offering access to additional features for those who are currently working from home or who want to check up on friends and relatives online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCcs6d"&gt;There are a number of apps we have not included, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and FaceTime, that allow you to do video chats. We’ve left them out because they require that all participants be members of a specific social network (Facebook, WhatsApp) or that you use a specific type of device (FaceTime, which is Apple-only). We’ve also tried to concentrate on applications that allow you to participate without having to download the app (unless you’re the host), and that allow at least ten or more participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8yIwt"&gt;A good idea is to try one or two out for yourself to see how well they fit in with your style and those of your friends. This list is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6libON"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="LQuFKh"&gt;The most popular video meeting app&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Zoom is one of the most widely used video meeting apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t5zsGsMM_zzRUfccXF_2EdkoflI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491368/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_1.20.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoom is one of the most widely used video meeting apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CYiJpA"&gt;Zoom has become one of the most well-known videoconferencing apps — in fact, its name is quickly becoming synonymous with video meetings. Before the pandemic hit, the company pushed Zoom mostly for corporate use, but it also provides a free basic version for individuals. At first, because Zoom didn’t expect its sudden popularity among non-business users, there were several missteps involving privacy and security; the company quickly instituted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230962/zoom-update-security-privacy-features-improvements-download"&gt;a number of changes and updates&lt;/a&gt; to address these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66nndg"&gt;The free version of Zoom allows up to 100 users to meet, but there is a 40-minute limit on meetings of more than two people, which can be pretty limiting. As of this writing, Zoom was not offering any special deals for those now working at home, but it does have a page &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fdocs%2Fen-us%2Fcovid19.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering help and advice&lt;/a&gt; to new users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BYNFVw"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RHNl6l"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="b91yn2"&gt;One-on-one meetings:  No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JIlwSK"&gt;Group meetings: 40-minute limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XpI4G1"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kF9xF4"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="81FqBb"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skype.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; Meet Now&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id="StW6sf"&gt;A longtime go-to for online calls&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Skype’s Meet Now feature supports up to 50 people with a four-hour time limit. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DjOAVSTCxLE9SAzc8jmS5cISMQQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489407/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_2.42.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skype’s Meet Now feature supports up to 50 people with a four-hour time limit. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WfOsT4"&gt;Skype has been the go-to platform for one-on-one conversations since the beta was released in 2003. Its Meet Now feature (which is accessed by choosing the “Meet Now” button on the left side of the app) allows for videoconferencing; up to 50 people can meet with a generous four-hour time limit on meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JB02lU"&gt;There is also a separate page that lets you &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skype.com%2Fen%2Ffree-conference-call%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;create a free video meeting&lt;/a&gt; without having to actually sign up for the service. However, you get more features using the app, so if you’re okay with registering for a free account, you’re better off doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FQrF4L"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lgPZGp"&gt;Maximum participants: 50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PS5plA"&gt;One-on-one meetings:  No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3x7cKx"&gt;Group meetings: Four hours per call, 10 hours per day, 100 hours per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oFvVzA"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sDu0pA"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5SlZUs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webex.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cisco Webex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4k2CRu"&gt;A corporate app with a solid freemium version&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Webex, a videoconferencing app that has been around since the ‘90s, has a useful free version." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ah3jKqqaHJRvvLdrj0b-aTaTz0U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489405/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_2.49.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Webex, a videoconferencing app that has been around since the ‘90s, has a useful free version.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XcIFOJ"&gt;Webex is a videoconferencing app that has been around since the ‘90s; it was acquired by Cisco in 2007. While it’s been mainly known as a business application and continues to focus on serving companies, it does have a &lt;a href="https://cart.webex.com/sign-up-webex?experienceType=Unified&amp;amp;ft=selfsignup"&gt;fairly generous free version&lt;/a&gt; that’s worth checking out. During the current pandemic, it has widened the features of the freemium version from 50 to 100 participants, and you can meet for up to 50 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iVgdLr"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="B6FO7y"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZhF2Xh"&gt;One-on-one meetings:  50-minute limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gTTnlh"&gt;Group meetings:  50-minute limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ruv0bm"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3aAMO5"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7pIZFI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://meet.google.com/"&gt;Google Meet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5QusdH"&gt;Now featured on your Gmail page&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A7O1n6NkE0ge6ERXOwjV7S5TmVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489403/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_2.52.53_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="msl2WU"&gt;Meet offers a very simple and efficient way to video chat with colleagues, friends, and family — assuming they all have Google accounts, which is a requirement for both hosts and participants. In fact, Google is not only pushing people to use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21265533/google-meet-gmail-hide-video-call-email-shortcut"&gt;its Meet videoconferencing app&lt;/a&gt; instead of Zoom but also instead of its own soon-to-be-sundowned Google Hangouts app. (We previously included Google Hangouts in this roundup, but Hangouts users are now being actively urged from within the app to use Google Meet for their video chats.) You can find a Meet link in the Gmail app and in every appointment you make using Google Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="v1Sc5Q"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ndFlQU"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9l2AqB"&gt;One-on-one meetings: 24-hour limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Vykzc"&gt;Group meetings: 24-hour limit through June 28th, one-hour limit after&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="a6cOEo"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JUU1Sr"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h4bFcC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fmicrosoft-teams%2Fteams-for-home" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0gleS7"&gt;Not just for business&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e6cKl0CUoE2ruyM1Bb3kGununBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489400/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_2.58.33_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="celGBu"&gt;Microsoft Teams was built as a competitor to Slack and is an especially good idea if you’re part of the Office ecosystem. While the application is mainly focused on business use, Microsoft has stepped out of its three-piece suit and unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349783/microsoft-teams-texting-calls-videoconferencing-how-to"&gt;a free personal version of Teams&lt;/a&gt;, which lets anyone chat, talk, or have video meetings — you just have to create an account with Microsoft in order to use it. Currently, due to the pandemic, Microsoft has extended the maximum number of participants from 100 to 300, and it has pushed the time limit from 60 minutes to 24 hours, which gives it an edge over most other free videoconferencing apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="z7fDpG"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VPM1Xz"&gt;Maximum participants: Normally 100; extended to 300 during pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3OY8iA"&gt;One-on-one meetings: Normally 60-minute limit; extended to 24 hours during pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MaDoxu"&gt;Group meetings: Normally 60-minute limit; extended to 24 hours during pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OU4H3U"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lqJ1wZ"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZdqxTy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://duo.google.com/about/"&gt;Google Duo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kdg4C0"&gt;A mobile app best suited to one-to-ones&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S0KN9x"&gt;You don’t really expect Google to only offer one simple videoconferencing app, do you? Besides Google Meet, Google also has its mobile app Duo, which was built as a consumer app (whereas Meet was originally designed as a business app). While Duo was first touted as the app to use for one-to-one conversations and could only be used on phones, it now allows you to create groups of up to 32 participants and includes a web app. All participants must have Google accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hrdSff"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aqu3zn"&gt;Maximum participants: 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="k4gNud"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Rd9Yef"&gt;Group meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3Tah4o"&gt;Screen sharing: Mobile only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bdHECg"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dSGznj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.starleaf.com/resources/remote-working-hub/"&gt;StarLeaf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="05W8yJ"&gt;A corporate meeting app with a free basic version&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_xVXExpwfdFlYEda9IYnq6kfTQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489394/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.08.31_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XSzst4"&gt;If you’re not a company, you may not have heard of StarLeaf. It’s really a platform for companies rather than individuals; its lowest-cost paid plan starts with five licenses suitable for a small business. But it is now offering a basic video and messaging product free of charge for those trying to keep in touch during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWyY2P"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="W5dlgk"&gt;Maximum participants: 20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0hGcJD"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gtv4JL"&gt;Group meetings: 45-minute time limit&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TzLjf1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://meet.jit.si/"&gt;Jitsi Meet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4Zxxcw"&gt;Open source with plenty of features&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MVwxTZMGAegmePx6edtBU9gdi0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489390/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.11.38_PM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YYifcw"&gt;Another “you probably haven’t heard of it” videoconference app, Jitsi Meet is an open-source platform that lets you easily meet online by simply navigating to the site and clicking on “Start meeting.” If you’re a developer, you can build your own conferencing app via &lt;a href="https://jitsi.org/jitsi-videobridge/"&gt;Jitsi Videobridge&lt;/a&gt;, but most people will be happy with the quick web version, which offers many features found in more well-known apps, such as fake backgrounds, chat, session recording (to Dropbox), and the ability to “kick out” unruly participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VhdHjO"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JlbkKB"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bN9uN0"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3n0cX0"&gt;Group meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GpB4PM"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wCwVWj"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GEZRsM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://whereby.com/"&gt;Whereby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0tRyD7"&gt;Single meeting rooms with up to 50 participants&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/47xmn6lLGej9EWf2brZ_EXrP7f0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489313/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.13.49_PM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yb3ZHs"&gt;Whereby’s free version gives you the use of a single meeting room with up to 50 participants, along with the ability to lock rooms (participants have to “knock” to gain entrance). Each room has its own URL that you get to choose, which is great — assuming that nobody else has already taken that name. (For example, I first tried &lt;a href="http://whereby.com/testroom"&gt;whereby.com/testroom&lt;/a&gt; and found it was already taken.) But it also has a chat function, lets you share a screen, allows you to mute or eject users, and offers breakout groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NQQ6g6"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="kgniVF"&gt;Maximum participants: 50	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rbf1TD"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bJgo7v"&gt;Group meetings: 45-minute limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MknVjh"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EXQvVY"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bZ2xUb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.glip.com/"&gt;Glip Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YTpiKZ"&gt;A wide range of free features&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VsGToiLppKzDnrooRK78tgpe8E8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489298/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.18.20_PM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AYVdrv"&gt;Glip Pro offers a nice range of features for a free video meeting app. It does insist that you have either a work email address or a Google account, and wants access to your contacts on that account. But if you’re good with that, you get 24 hours of meeting time (as long as you sign up by July), screen sharing, recording, chat, and virtual backgrounds, among others. It even offers closed captions (although, as with a lot of AI transcription software, some of the captions leave something to be desired).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d0yA3C"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="u3cQbc"&gt;Maximum participants: 100 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Mm37EN"&gt;One-on-one meetings: 24-hour limit (for signups by July 2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hVRYgE"&gt;Group meetings: 24-hour limit (for signups by July 2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OxL6TK"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PWP4sP"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZLto1d"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.spikenow.com/blog/team-collaboration/spike-a-free-video-conferencing-solution-for-everyone/"&gt;Spike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FU8i90"&gt;A simple web-based system&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Spike can be used without having to download anything." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e8slY15BZb4EfX-9Tc_mSoiiyuY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496903/Screen_Shot_2021_05_06_at_3.49.27_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spike can be used without having to download anything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C5n46v"&gt;Spike, an expanding email service, offers videoconferencing to its subscribers, but it has also made a basic video meeting web app available to anyone who wants it. It’s quick and easy to use: just go to &lt;a href="https://video.spike.chat/"&gt;video.spike.chat&lt;/a&gt;, type in a name, and click on “Join Video Chat Meeting.” Spike generates a unique URL for the chat and even lets you share your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zCfIFs"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="3KJGq9"&gt;Maximum participants: 200 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jw8spn"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vZrJNH"&gt;Group meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xHQSKV"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NNElO2"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WbxkWo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://telegram.org/"&gt;Telegram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Telegram has introduced group video chats." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/crODlHv9Ut59DJjE8hTXp3uc4xk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22686759/Screen_Shot_2021_06_28_at_9.27.02_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Telegram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Telegram has introduced group video chats.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AbKf3x"&gt;Telegram is a messaging chat app that, as of June 2021, is offering video group chats also. It’s well set up for that: the app already has a feature that lets you create groups with up to 20,000 members, and you can have either private or public groups. For now, video chats are limited to 30 people; the company says it plans to increase that in the future. While it was a little slow to add this feature compared to some other messaging apps (considering the demand for it during the pandemic), it is a welcome add-on for Telegram users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7ENYLr"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0s7zsb"&gt;Maximum participants: 30 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VKbWLy"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iHG3f9"&gt;Group meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="591ur3"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lXEPnm"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cL6ktK"&gt;More alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oQsh6Y"&gt;There is a wide range of other Zoom alternatives out there, including &lt;a href="https://www.remotehq.com/"&gt;RemoteHQ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://talky.io/"&gt;Talky&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.8x8.com/"&gt;8x8&lt;/a&gt; (which acquired Jitsi in 2018). Some of these don’t have a free version or the number of participants who can use the free version is limited. For example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluejeans.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BlueJeans&lt;/a&gt; starts at $9.99 per month for unlimited-time meetings with up to 100 participants, while the free version of &lt;a href="https://www.zoho.com/meeting/"&gt;Zoho Meeting&lt;/a&gt; only permits a maximum of three participants, and &lt;a href="https://www.intermedia.com/anymeeting-video-conferencing"&gt;Intermedia AnyMeeting&lt;/a&gt; allows four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nhBhm"&gt;Other apps offer some video meeting as an added feature. &lt;a href="https://slack.com/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; is mainly set up for text chat, but it does give you the ability to make voice and video calls as well. If you’re on the free version of Slack, you can make a video call to an individual. But if you want to host a meeting between several people, as opposed to a one-on-one conversation, and want to do it for free, you’ll need to look for an alternative. The messaging app &lt;a href="https://signal.org/en/"&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt; offers group video calls with a maximum of eight participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqAFyA"&gt;There are also apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21229590/houseparty-how-to-video-chat-call-games-talk-friends-app-ios-android"&gt;Houseparty&lt;/a&gt;, which lets up to eight people use a virtual room to chat. In fact, anybody can drop into a friend’s online session without an invitation (although you can “lock” your room to prevent intruders). However, it does demand that all participants register in order to use it — and registration includes your name, email address, birthdate, and phone number. So we didn’t include it among our recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d0ADE9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 4th, 2021, 2:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on June 11th, 2020. Since then, all entries have been updated; in addition, two apps have been dropped (Hangouts and Spike) and Glip Pro has been added.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fBE0Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 5th, 2021, 9:15AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect the fact that Whereby’s breakout groups feature is out of beta and to add Signal to the list of alternatives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hd3p07"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 6th, 2021, 4PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add Spike back to the main list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngMfAf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 28th, 2021, 2:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add Telegram.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft won’t confirm exactly which CPUs work with Windows 11 — yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHGt8Lsj5n1rx5ay86ropHfokKg=/0x88:2100x1488/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514522/Windows_11_PC_Devices.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4c6xVF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/28/update-on-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements/"&gt;In a blog post today&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft is making another attempt at clarifying the minimum requirements for Windows 11, which have confused many, especially regarding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549725/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-tpm-hardware-requirements"&gt;what generation of CPUs&lt;/a&gt; the new OS will support. The post is clear that Intel 6th Gen Skylake and earlier CPUs, along with non-Zen AMD processors, will not meet “principles around security and reliability and minimum system requirements for Windows 11.” That lines up with the company’s original statement that Windows 11 would require Intel 8th Gen Coffee Lake or Zen 2 CPUs and up, but there is some hope for Intel 7th Gen Kaby Lake and Zen 1 users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tEqtRb"&gt;Where things get confusing again is the news that its first Insider build of Windows 11, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553639/microsoft-windows-11-download-available-preview-features"&gt;which is available today&lt;/a&gt;, won’t require TPM 2.0 or specific CPUs. Microsoft will use data from testers to inform potential adjustments to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/22544171/microsoft-windows-11-system-requirements-hardware"&gt;the minimum requirements&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft will be paying extra attention to users with Intel 7th Gen CPUs and AMD Zen 1 CPUs to see if they’re getting the performance that Microsoft is looking for when it comes to reliability and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RMyiR"&gt;This news seems to confirm people’s fears that Windows 11 won’t support older CPUs, some of which can still keep up with the newer models on a pure performance basis. In the blog post, Microsoft claims that the reason Windows 11 won’t run on those CPUs is to maintain a higher level of security, stability, and reliability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrKw2w"&gt;Microsoft will also be “temporarily removing” the PC Health Check App, which was designed to tell people running Windows 10 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550951/microsoft-pc-health-checkup-app-update-windows-11-compatibility-tool-details"&gt;whether they’d be able to update their computers to Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. The company says the app “was not fully prepared to share the level of detail or accuracy” that users expected, but it said the app would be available again for Windows 11’s launch in the fall (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553666/microsoft-windows-11-october-20th-release-date-hint-rumor"&gt;likely October&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new Google-based smartwatch software addresses a lot of old annoyances</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WbQTDagnka64SQbxB_rCkJBb0uM=/297x0:3063x1844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514225/Screen_Shot_2021_06_25_at_5.17.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dqJ6KU"&gt;Samsung has taken the wraps off it and Google’s new unified smartwatch platform at MWC 2021 — sort of. The company isn’t announcing a new Galaxy Watch today, or even what the new platform will be called (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443809/google-samsung-wear-os-tizen-things-we-know"&gt;it’s unofficially referred to as Wear&lt;/a&gt;); those announcements will come later this summer at a proper Galaxy Unpacked event. But what Samsung did show off was a first look at what its new One UI Watch software will look like, and it elaborated on just what the new Google / Samsung partnership could mean for future Galaxy Watches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXs5DU"&gt;To be clear: what Samsung is showing of One UI Watch won’t be what &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; smartwatches built on the new unified Google / Samsung platform look like — it’s an added layer on top specifically for Samsung devices. It’s similar to what Samsung’s One UI does for Samsung’s smartphones. The goal is a consistent look and experience across all of Samsung’s hardware and software, and so far it looks lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VpDntizip9qD_EroeA_tFBI83og=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22686589/One_UI_Watch_App_Ecosystem_2.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Sua81Z"&gt;The Settings menu has been redesigned to look more like the phone’s menu, and things sync from the phone: if you have additional time zones set in your clock app, they’ll be there on the watch, and blocked callers on the phone will be blocked on watches, too. Samsung also showed off a new watchface design tool, which will be available for Android developers later this year to easily create new watchfaces for the platform. It’s unclear yet if current Tizen or Wear OS watchfaces will work with the new OS or One UI Watch, but the current options have also been seriously lacking, so any new choices — even ones largely reliant on developers — are welcome. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DbWGOVOAADsmuVyYh0pO4ZsACDE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22686621/Screen_Shot_2021_06_28_at_10.32.25_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s new watchface design tool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H4l1Ho"&gt;Best of all, similar to the Apple Watch, when you install a smartwatch-compatible app on your phone, the corresponding watch app will automatically install on the watch as well. You won't need to manually install anything as you currently do on Tizen-based watches, or &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/wow-google-show-us-how-you-really-feel-about-wear-os-1846674295"&gt;deal with the weird on-wrist app store&lt;/a&gt; that has made getting apps on Wear OS frustrating. You’ll just download an app to your phone and it should appear directly on your wrist, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="qrybd4"&gt;The new One UI Watch experience is expected to first appear on Samsung wearables at a Samsung Unpacked event later this year. Given other recent Samsung hardware rumors, it sounds like this Unpacked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;should be a big flipping deal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgxjYY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 28th, 1:43PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added images from Samsung’s Mobile World Congress 2021 presentation. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ndu9Vn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Samsung’s new watchface designer will be available to developers later this year, not next year as we originally said. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
