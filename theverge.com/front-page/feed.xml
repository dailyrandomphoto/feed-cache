    <title>eBay accidentally suspended ‘a small number’ of users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="EBay Headquarters Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K-p-9XgnfYtA4lTec1lMjfOlO2g=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70230974/1234603350.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xJ3kCT"&gt;eBay inadvertently suspended an unspecified number of users on December 3rd. The platform has since acknowledged the issue, noting that users who were accidentally suspended have received a notification so they can resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJl2ko"&gt;Users across social media began reporting that they’ve been suspended from eBay on Friday, despite not knowingly breaking any rules on the platform. An &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/ebay_is_apparently_going_on_a_suspending_spree_if/"&gt;entire Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; on r/ebay is dedicated to the issue, and although the original post has since been deleted, dozens of other users have added their own experiences to the thread. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn4m6pp/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;One user&lt;/a&gt; describes their own account of the situation, much of which is echoed by other comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XZ5Ywp"&gt;Suspended tonight with no chance of appeal, did an online chat and the woman just told me it wouldn’t be discussed and then cut me off. Member since 1999, 100% positive, haven’t sold anything for years, no disputes, have bought 5 small items over the last month with no issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Qs2k29"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn5fda1/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn5bs7u/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; claim that eBay canceled their bids on products that they’ve already purchased and received, some of which were “Buy It Now” items, which users can buy outright. As for the justification for these bans, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn5e4j3/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn4pirc/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; they got an email from the company saying that they put “the eBay community at risk.” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn4simb/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn50mei/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; allege that when they contacted eBay’s customer service about it, their bans were upheld, and no further information was given to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rSeIjb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yesterday, a small number of eBay accounts were inadvertently suspended. The issue is resolved &amp;amp; any users who need to take action have been notified. If you still need help, please DM your name, email &amp;amp; zip so we can check it out. ~Beca  &lt;a href="https://t.co/KlP3BGeZjr"&gt;https://t.co/KlP3BGeZjr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ask eBay (@AskeBay) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AskeBay/status/1467223956168052738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zCV4MI"&gt;Outside of Reddit, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TSteeplejack/status/1466869336732311552?s=20"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Zebulooon/status/1466772689499086853?s=20"&gt;across&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Onioncakes1/status/1466902427102179329?s=20"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; also complained of the seemingly random suspensions that took place on the 3rd. The next day, eBay responded to some of the reports, noting that users can DM the @AskeBay Twitter account with their information to sort out the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJwxag"&gt;“On December 3rd, a small number of eBay accounts were inadvertently suspended,” said eBay spokesperson Trina Somera in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The issue has been resolved and any users who need to take action have been notified. We regret any concern this may have caused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g28jkJ"&gt;Although eBay has acknowledged the issue, we still don’t know how many users were accidentally suspended, as well as why this occurred. However, we can speculate that the mass suspensions might’ve been caused by some kind of error with eBay’s algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite: Chapter 3 officially revealed with new island, Spider-Man, and plenty more changes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-1PfRxJvbR_4SbZkk8nvk0VbWU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70230178/19BR_KeyArt.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TexQAX"&gt;And then there were three. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22815391/fortnite-the-end-event-chapter-2-recap-highlights-news"&gt;a dramatic live event on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is moving on to Chapter 3, which introduces some big changes for the battle royale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7Bbec"&gt;This morning developer Epic detailed season 1 of the new chapter, called “Flipped,” and the most dramatic change is the shift to a fresh, snow-covered island, one that features weather conditions, along with new locations like Sanctuary — which appears to play a large part in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; lore — and the Daily Bugle. Those who pick up the new battle pass will also be able to get their hands on characters like Spider-Man and (eventually) The Foundation, voiced by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. You can get the full run-down of the battle pass right here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="94buvi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/knAYcg7Tt8E?rel=0&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qPD4Fk"&gt;(It’s been a busy weekend for spider-news, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817957/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-part-one-sequelanimated-multiverse-miles-morales"&gt;a trailer for the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Into the Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; also dropping&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYvIt7"&gt;It also appears that the core gameplay will be shaken up quite a bit. Chapter 3 features two new mechanics — sliding and swinging — that could make the experience even faster and more vertical, particularly for high-level players. And for those who spend time in the game’s creative mode, there’s now an option to earn battle pass XP in player-made experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDrIdT"&gt;Outside of that, developer Epic is introducing some persistent elements to the game. Here’s how the studio explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hD9tXF"&gt;This new chapter brings camps, where players and their squad can heal and store items from match to match — bringing new persistent, social gameplay options to&lt;em&gt; Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Plus, there are new weapons and items to help win a victory royale and earn the all-new, ultimate prestige — the Victory Crown. Keep winning to keep the crown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Fmcw69"&gt;Many of these details &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817525/fortnite-chapter-3-leaked-trailer-spider-man-new-island-gears-of-war"&gt;leaked out earlier on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of an intense live event that saw the previous island literally flip over. Since then the game has been down as players stare at their characters adrift in a vast ocean. You can check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22815391/fortnite-the-end-event-chapter-2-recap-highlights-news"&gt;our full recap&lt;/a&gt; of the event right here, or watch it all in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uAoyWR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Rasl5UwwNY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xjiVOi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s second chapter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20905428/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-black-hole"&gt;launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end"&gt;a surprise black hole event&lt;/a&gt;, and similarly led to an all-new island. It spanned eight seasons that included everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670317/fortnite-alien-invasion-season-7-end-event-operation-sky-fire"&gt;an alien invasion&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;an Ariana Grande concert&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;a Marvel superhero takeover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fYnSD"&gt;While we have the details for Chapter 3, the update isn’t live just yet, and it’s not clear when players will finally be able to jump in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first trailer for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) teases a stunning animated sequel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TSuGUZhbcNjXJz00BK8RRzS-DnU=/460x0:1972x1008/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70229604/Screen_Shot_2021_12_04_at_7.59.46_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FAreQb"&gt;The first trailer for the highly anticipated sequel to the animated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18115201/spider-man-into-the-verse-movie-review-miles-morales"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; just dropped, revealing both the title — &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) &lt;/em&gt;— and the surprise that the upcoming adventures of Miles Morales will actually be a two-part affair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ojuIL"&gt;The first-look trailer picks up right where the last Spider-Verse movie left off: with Miles (Shameik Moore) lying in bed, before a portal to Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) and her universe opens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXCqdb"&gt;From there, it seems like &lt;em&gt;Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) &lt;/em&gt;is going to be trying to one-up the already stellar animation of the original film, with Miles bouncing across multiple animated universes in a variety of art styles as he dukes it out with Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac, who voiced the character in the post-credit scene of the first movie.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GoqE05H4JRnpDK541_WdnxGZ_u0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063667/Screen_Shot_2021_12_04_at_8.14.28_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oEFYAZ"&gt;According to the official description, the upcoming sequel will “transport Brooklyn’s full-time, friendly neighborhood Spider-Man across the Multiverse to join forces with Gwen Stacy and a new team of Spider-People to face off with a villain more powerful than anything they have ever encountered.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OloYN"&gt;Sony isn’t saying who that villain is (although it’s possible the movie could draw on the 2014 &lt;em&gt;Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; comic crossover, which saw the multiverse’s Spider-People under attack from Morlun and the Inheritors), although whatever the threat is, it appears that it couldn’t be contained to just a single film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QExGhY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One)&lt;/em&gt; is set to hit theaters on October 7th, 2022, with Part Two set to follow sometime in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaGNWF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel mail-in repairs have allegedly twice resulted in leaked pics and a privacy nightmare</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bcBWgEOXjkthOdLprXGr52IZhPk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70229533/acastro_180130_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1il5Xu"&gt;After game designer and author Jane McGonigal sent her Pixel 5a to Google for repair, someone allegedly took and hacked her device. This is at least the second report in as many weeks from someone claiming they sent a Google phone in for repair, only to have it used to leak their private data and photographs. McGonigal &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/avantgame/status/1467192779973398531"&gt;posted a detailed account of the situation on Twitter on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; and advised other users not to send their phones in for repair with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="d7nvn6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yeah, don't send your Google phone in for warranty repair/replacement. As has happened with others, last night someone used it to log into my gmail, Drive, photos backup email account, dropbox, and I can see from activity logs they opened a bunch of selfies hoping to find nudes&lt;/p&gt;— Jane McGonigal (@avantgame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/avantgame/status/1467192779973398531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4yzw22"&gt;In October, McGonigal sent her broken phone to an official Pixel repair center in Texas. She tweeted later that Google said it never received the phone, and during the ensuing weeks, she was charged for a replacement device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0LDcrt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The photos they opened were of me in bathing suits, sports bras, form-fitting dresses, and of stitches after surgery”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yVbtpF"&gt;But according to McGonigal, FedEx tracking information shows the device arrived at the facility weeks ago. Late Friday night — a few hours after she says she finally received a refund for the device — someone seems to have used the “missing” phone to clear two-factor authentication checks and log in to several of her accounts, including her Dropbox, Gmail, and Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PpG6P9"&gt;The activity triggered several email security alerts to McGonigal’s backup accounts. However, she speculates that whoever has the phone may have used it to access her backup email addresses and then dumped any security alerts into her spam folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJj3MV"&gt;“The photos they opened were of me in bathing suits, sports bras, form-fitting dresses, and of stitches after surgery,” McGonigal writes. “They deleted Google security notifications in my backup email accounts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lc3msi"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Google spokesperson Alex Moriconi says, “We are investigating this claim.” It’s still unclear whether the device might have been intercepted within the repair facility or while it was in transit, or who has it now. Google’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/9004345?hl=en"&gt;official repair instructions&lt;/a&gt; recommend backing up and then erasing a device before sending it in. Still, as Jane McGonigal points out, that’s either hard or impossible, depending on the damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4lC6n"&gt;The whole situation reminds us of the security concerns whenever we hand over our devices for repair, and unfortunately, such activity has precedent. In June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522560/apple-repair-multimillion-iphone-nude-photos-privacy-settlement-pegatron"&gt;Apple paid millions to a woman&lt;/a&gt; after repair technicians posted her nude photos to Facebook. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22787245/apple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy"&gt;recently said it would start selling DIY repair kits&lt;/a&gt;, giving users the chance to fix their own phones, or at least have the task done by someone that a user trusts, as opposed to sending it in or dropping it off at an Apple Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmMRii"&gt;For Pixel phones, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/10227672?hl=en"&gt;your options for official service&lt;/a&gt; are either via mail-in or, in some countries, local service through an authorized provider. In the US, Google partners with &lt;a href="https://www.ubreakifix.com/"&gt;uBreakiFix&lt;/a&gt; franchises. Whatever phone you have, the options for repairs are still somewhat limited, and you end up having to trust that no one with bad intentions will get their hands on your phone while it’s out of your possession.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Fortnite island flipped over during Chapter 2’s final event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/grMczVYlvJUGjzCq69ngk9D3VGw=/81x0:3212x2087/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70229219/IMG_1459.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7y7ROd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; big chapter-ending event just ended, and it was a big one. After an all-out war against UFOs, zombies, and the Cube Queen, players were saved in a rescue mission led by Dwayne Johnson. (Well, his in-game character.) Then, the island flipped over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ltc4yY"&gt;The event&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rrOiPg"&gt;Let’s back up a bit. The game’s latest season has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22666441/fortnite-chapter-2-season-8-battle-pass-cubes"&gt;all about the cubes&lt;/a&gt;, and right when the event loaded up, a mysterious giant blue cube spawned on the map next to all of the players in my lobby. Jumping at the cube bounced players away, but it otherwise, didn’t do anything beyond loom ominously. We also could look at the Cube Queen in the distance, which has been floating in an energy ball over the center of the island for part of the season. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello, blue cube.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xyZP7rFCyAS1qvKdo_vUhKGC-l8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063427/IMG_1457.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cube Queen floats menacingly in the distance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xW8QJz"&gt;When the even’t countdown clock reached 10 minutes, the Cube Queen’s evil laugh echoed over the island and zombies started spawning in front of our base. Fortunately, weapons were added to everyone’s inventory, so players worked to fend off the incoming zombie troopers (though the zombies didn’t seem to pose any real threat).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MNK_riUlL539Qrsz07GmoNafueA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063437/IMG_1458.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stay back!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1YFjl"&gt;When the clock reached zero, an alarm blared over the island, and the Cube Queen’s pyramid shone bright. She launched a beam into the sky that opened up a huge portal revealing a horde of giant UFOs. During the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22519431/fortnite-season-7-superman-flying-saucers-aliens"&gt;seventh season&lt;/a&gt;, the island was under the shadow of just one UFO; the Cube Queen had brought an army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDKtJG"&gt;UFOs and zombies approached the blue cube as players tried to fend them off. But the battle began to look unwinnable, and things went from bad to worse when a UFO blew up the blue cube. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fpGGsy-uxF_jTLehS2yfywUrpME=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063439/IMG_1465.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yikes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RwJ5A0"&gt;After that, the event took an interesting twist, moving the perspective under the surface of the island to a CGI cutscene. (It was kind of like if Netflix made a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; TV show.) The game’s main character, Agent Jones, was strapped to a laboratory chair with a device on his head, and Doctor Slone, who betrayed players at the end of last season, was seemingly about to end Jones’ life. Then, a hulking figure known as The Foundation burst in to save the day — and he took off his mask to reveal that he’s played by, &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/12/02/fortnite-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-teases-his-role-as-the-foundation-in-new-energy-drink"&gt;as suspected&lt;/a&gt;, none other than Dwayne Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfX7Gc"&gt;As Jones and The Foundation tried to get to safety, two other characters dressed similarly to The Foundation rescued players on the surface and brought them down to the inner island. Players were then given control to follow someone called The Scientist to get to Jones and The Foundation. But during the escape, the island began to tip over bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DgPM-iYrIV5Gcz4oWBV0kinPzkQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063440/IMG_1462.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The island began to tip over slowly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x2bUzD"&gt;Eventually, players made it to Jones and The Foundation at the Zero Point (essentially a big ball of energy that has been a key plot point in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;). The Scientist assured everyone that we were safe, but then one of the giant zombies smashed a window, causing water to rush in and for all of us to be forced out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W38q40"&gt;Soon, my character surfaced and watched as the island slowly tipped up to be completely vertical and then fall the other way. That crushed the Cube Queen, which caused the giant portal with the UFOs to close up. Then the island flipped all the way over revealing a whole new landscape. At a distance, you could see a little bit of the new areas to explore, but a tidal wave quickly swept my player out to sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jDiqjZ"&gt;When will Fortnite be back?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ymml0JsfclZsh1AYTFxU1dG5h8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063392/IMG_1464.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just me and the open water.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8U68t5"&gt;Now, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; just shows my player at sea on an empty log. I can’t move, and there’s hardly anything on screen except for me, my log, and the vast open ocean. It’s all reminiscent of the &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/dca1e75e-a6d7-45c9-bcfe-687edf804521#:~:text=https%3A//www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite%2Dgame%2Dshutdown%2Dblack%2Dhole%2Devent%2Dstorytelling"&gt;bla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite-game-shutdown-black-hole-event-storytelling"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/dca1e75e-a6d7-45c9-bcfe-687edf804521#:~:text=https%3A//www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite%2Dgame%2Dshutdown%2Dblack%2Dhole%2Devent%2Dstorytelling"&gt;k hole&lt;/a&gt; that bridged the transition between Chapters 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zc195h"&gt;There’s no timer or any sort of indication of when Chapter 3 might be playable. But if you want a sneak peek of what’s to come, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817525/fortnite-chapter-3-leaked-trailer-spider-man-new-island-gears-of-war"&gt;a leaked trailer&lt;/a&gt; looks to have spoiled a lot of what you can expect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkeLHf"&gt;This chapter, which kicked off in October 2019 after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite-game-shutdown-black-hole-event-storytelling"&gt;multi-day downtime featuring the black hole&lt;/a&gt;, pushed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"&gt;growing narrative ambitions&lt;/a&gt; with events featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21291458/fortnite-device-event-agency-explosion-water-storm"&gt;first-person storytelling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;an arcade shooter against a Marvel villain&lt;/a&gt;, a thrilling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333635/fortnites-season-6-single-player-event-storytelling"&gt;single-player event to try and stabilize reality&lt;/a&gt;, and even a mission inside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670317/fortnite-alien-invasion-season-7-end-event-operation-sky-fire"&gt;an alien mothership full of cubes&lt;/a&gt;. Chapter 2’s concluding event took things another step forward, and now we’ll have to wait and see what Epic has in store for Chapter 3. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard won’t play a part at The Game Awards this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Game Awards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dcd527AmZe8fDHYM2xNpt-Ux18s=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70229215/TGA2020_PosterPack1_PosterB_HD.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Game Awards&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FAxe1p"&gt;Geoff Keighley, the executive producer and host of The Game Awards, sent out a tweet to confirm that outside of its nominations, Activision Blizzard “will not be a part of this year’s #TheGameAwards.” This is in light of claims about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602655/activision-blizzard-employees-accusations-allegations-lawsuit"&gt;the company’s toxic culture&lt;/a&gt;, as well as allegations of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;CEO Bobby Kotick’s history of abuse and harassment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lzDblY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Beyond its nominations, I can confirm that Activision|Blizzard will not be a part of this year’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGameAwards?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TheGameAwards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1467007741214347264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pm3aij"&gt;In an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/12/03/game-awards-announcements/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Keighley hinted at Activision Blizzard’s potential removal from the award show, noting that he was contemplating how to “navigate” the situation with the company without harming its developers or employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPUQZG"&gt;Although Activision Blizzard won’t have a role in this year’s Game Awards, the company may still cast some influence over the show. Rob Kostich, the president of Activision Blizzard serves on &lt;a href="https://www.thegameawards.com/about"&gt;The Game Awards’ board of advisors&lt;/a&gt;. While the board doesn’t have a say in terms of which games receive nominations and awards, it still helps “guide and advance the mission” of The Game Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="svBS8v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There is no place for abuse, harassment predatory practices in any company or any community”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eW5G9M"&gt;Other game companies have spoken out about the controversy surrounding Activision Blizzard, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787848/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-calls-out-activision-blizzard-staff-memo"&gt;PlayStation sending out a company-wide notice&lt;/a&gt; to condemn the claims, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789881/microsoft-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-deeply-troubled-by-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick"&gt;Xbox boss Phil Spencer saying&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft is reevaluating its relationship with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUpXjR"&gt;“There is no place for abuse, harassment or predatory practices in any company or any community,” Keighley wrote. “We all need to work together to build a better and a more inclusive environment so everyone feels safe to build the world’s best games.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify removes popular comedians’ content over royalties dispute</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rci_RmjlUAmzi6qNx9Tet_QCtGs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70228946/acastro_180213_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KDBNxY"&gt;Spotify has pulled the works of some of the most popular comedians, including Kevin Hart, Tiffany Haddish, John Mulaney, and Jim Gaffigan due to a royalties dispute. First reported by &lt;a href="http://wsj.com/articles/spotify-removes-some-comedians-work-from-streaming-service-11638626401"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a number of high-profile entertainers are pursuing royalty payments for their jokes when they’re played on the radio, as well as on services like Spotify, Pandora, YouTube, and SiriusXM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zZqTr3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;After failed negotiations with Spoken Giants, Spotify removed hundreds of comedians’ content from the service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MHdoNv"&gt;The comics’ efforts are backed by global rights administration company, Spoken Giants, which works to ensure that entertainers are properly compensated for spoken-word content. As the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes, comedians are typically paid by their label or distributor — along with digital performance rights organization SoundExchange — when a digital service plays their content. However, they’re technically not compensated for writing that content, something that Spoken Giants hopes to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uhuy2q"&gt;After failed negotiations with Spoken Giants, Spotify removed hundreds of comedians’ content from the service. In a statement to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, Spotify said that it already paid “significant amounts of money for the content in question, and would love to continue to do so.” &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Spotify with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CM5o5"&gt;There’s no word whether Spotify will try to reach an agreement with Spoken Giants again, or if the comedians’ content will ever return. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22746682/spotify-q3-2021-earnings-podcast-music-streaming-financials"&gt;Spotify expected to have over 400 million users&lt;/a&gt; by the end of the year, the affected comedians may be missing out on massive amounts of visibility.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked Fortnite trailer reveals Spider-Man and a new island for Chapter 3</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tovuV8bRglAD53Ee0Hfv3nvecbo=/238x0:2635x1598/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70228889/Screen_Shot_2021_12_04_at_11.50.22_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man appears to be coming to &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://streamable.com/3jtpmq" target="_blank"&gt;Streamable video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D4jpqK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; Chapter 2 comes to an end on Saturday, but a trailer for Chapter 3 has already leaked, reportedly from Epic Games’ Polish YouTube channel (&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-chapter-3-trailer-leaks-revealing-spider-man-1848161056"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Based on &lt;a href="https://streamable.com/3jtpmq"&gt;the trailer,&lt;/a&gt; the next chapter is poised to be a significant update, adding a brand new island, new mechanics, and your friendly island Spider-Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fYa1gy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NEW FORTNITE CHAPTER 3 TRAILER LEAKED ONLY WATCH IF YOU WANT TO!! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FortniteChapter3?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#FortniteChapter3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/N0SBoJaF4I"&gt;pic.twitter.com/N0SBoJaF4I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— GalaxyBoi ❄️ (@DaRealGalaxyBoi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaRealGalaxyBoi/status/1467063354745257985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="spKmVP"&gt;The Chapter 3 island looks to have a lot of new areas to explore, including the Daily Bugle and a location reminiscent of the Aztec-themed Sunny Steps from &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; first chapter. There appear to be new ways to get around, such as sliding down hills to get some extra speed and swinging from high places. And it seems you’ll be able to retrieve stashed weapons from previous matches using tents, which could add some extra strategy to playing a few rounds with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzeQF4"&gt;The leaked trailer shows some new playable characters joining the game, including Spider-Man (who looks to be available in the battle pass) and skins for Marcus Fenix and Kait Diaz from &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt;. Epic also appears to be adding The Foundation, a mysterious character from Chapter 2 who &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/12/02/fortnite-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-teases-his-role-as-the-foundation-in-new-energy-drink"&gt;might be played by Dwayne Johnson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZu0fs"&gt;One thing the trailer doesn’t reveal is exactly when &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Chapter 3 will be available. The black hole downtime between chapters 1 and 2 lasted for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20905428/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-black-hole"&gt;nearly two days&lt;/a&gt; — hopefully, we don’t have to wait as long to swing onto the new island in Chapter 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53bnKL"&gt;If you want to watch the end-of-chapter event, you might want to log on soon, as it kicks off at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22799221/fortnite-chapter-2-end-date"&gt;4PM ET Saturday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter reportedly suspended accounts by mistake after extremists abused new private media policy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nfC6_5lNHTJKQcUxm4WS-LFt9mw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70228616/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="woLOsv"&gt;Twitter has reportedly suspended a number of accounts by mistake after far-right extremists began exploiting the platform’s new private media policy, according to a report by &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/03/twitter-admits-error-in-account-suspensions/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5oEoq"&gt;The platform has since launched an internal review of the matter and has made the necessary corrections, &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; notes. Twitter’s new policy, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809746/twitter-ban-personal-information-private-media-photo-videos-harassment"&gt;allows individuals to request takedowns of photos or videos&lt;/a&gt; that contain them, has become the target of far-right activists who seek to remove pictures of them taken at hate rallies. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1465738076978774018"&gt;platform originally said&lt;/a&gt; that the rule was put in place to “curb the misuse of media to harass, intimate, and reveal the identities of private individuals,” which Twitter says disproportionately affects “women, activists, dissidents, and members of minority communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHrHpr"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; notes, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/02/twitter-media-rule-used-by-extremists/"&gt;extremists began abusing Twitter’s new system&lt;/a&gt; shortly after it debuted. Far-right activists reportedly used services like Telegram and Gab to organize against anti-extremist accounts that work to expose and keep track of white supremacists at hate rallies — they sought to get these accounts suspended and have their personal photos removed (via &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z8ITie"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;URGENT: As we feared, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TwitterSafety&lt;/a&gt; is already locking and suspending the accounts of extremism researchers under its new "Private Media" policy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The video is from September (predating the policy) and shows two right-wing extremists IN PUBLIC, planning violent assaults. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dp7zlt1u4r"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dp7zlt1u4r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chad Loder (they/them) (@chadloder) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chadloder/status/1465831941157052416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FPiMMq"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; points out, some extremist researchers learned that their accounts had been suspended for violating the platform's rules “against posting media of an individual from a country with a recognized right to privacy law” the same day that Twitter launched the policy. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Twitter spokesman Trenton Kennedy reportedly told the outlet that the company has been hit with a “significant amount” of wrongful reports, resulting in “a dozen erroneous suspensions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F7kpna"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So far, Twitter's new “private information policy” has disproportionately penalized working journalists and researchers of the far-right. Some have been locked out over photos they took at *public rallies.*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If this is the bar, we've all crossed it. &lt;br&gt;Fix this &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TwitterSafety&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/bRJtTqSjLc"&gt;https://t.co/bRJtTqSjLc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Andy Campbell (@AndyBCampbell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndyBCampbell/status/1466887540745674755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fxzTu6"&gt;Twitter has faced criticism over the vague wording of its new policy, specifically because of the ramifications it could have on journalists or other users who have a legitimate reason for posting others’ photos online. In a thread on the feature’s launch day, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1465738082292887554"&gt;Twitter said&lt;/a&gt; that it “will take into consideration whether the image is publicly available and/or is being covered by journalists,” and that “images/videos that show people participating in public events (like large scale protests, sporting events, etc.) would generally not violate this policy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ywgLzo"&gt;It remains unclear if Twitter plans on taking steps to clarify this policy, and whether it will specifically outline what types of personal photos are and aren’t allowed on the platform. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Twitter with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ludwig’s livestream was interrupted by a copyright warning days after joining YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDebIKeFdsOfEX217bwtUVrhZEw=/208x0:2620x1608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70228280/ludwig_youtube_suspended_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ludwig via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=API5Lt8t7Ho" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3oQbdo"&gt;Just three days after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808873/ludwig-ahgren-twitch-subathon-youtube-gaming"&gt;Ludwig Ahgren left his massive Twitch following for YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, he was hit with what he thought was a suspension from the platform. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/former-twitch-subathon-star-ludwig-suspended-days-after-1848156400"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Ahgren was playing other YouTube videos during his stream, when he landed on the infamously catchy &lt;em&gt;Baby Shark&lt;/em&gt; song. His stream was shut down shortly thereafter, giving his viewers — and himself — the impression that he was banned for violating YouTube’s copyright policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LSzvcl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;you could say the switch has been going well... &lt;a href="https://t.co/dnkjSUkT0o"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dnkjSUkT0o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ludwig (@LudwigAhgren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LudwigAhgren/status/1466576027858001928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ifzAuO"&gt;However, Ahgren wasn’t actually struck with a copyright strike or a suspension. “Ludwig wasn’t suspended,” Lauren Verrusio, the head of creator and consumer communications at YouTube told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our Content ID tool picked up his playing of an unlicensed video while he was going live to fans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSufM1"&gt;The whole incident was just a case of confusion. “If Ludwig were to have just stopped playing the copyrighted material, he could have continued the livestream just fine,” Verrusio explained. “But he wasn’t sure of what he was seeing on the backend and thought it was a suspension.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cx7RrR"&gt;Ludwig addressed the incident in a video on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDPKQb86Qw0"&gt;his secondary channel&lt;/a&gt;, in which he interprets the warning as a ban. “I’m pretty sure the corporate overlords who own &lt;em&gt;Baby Shark&lt;/em&gt; have, like, an iron fist on YouTube, and so they took me down.” Verrusio notes that YouTube is in touch with Ahgren to explain the platform’s copyright rules, and that Ludwig plans on going live again today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="on0k1Y"&gt;DMCA, or the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, has caused issues across all video sharing and livestreaming platforms, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/24/18635904/copyright-youtube-creators-dmca-takedown-fair-use-music-cover"&gt;with creators getting videos unknowingly taken down and demonetized&lt;/a&gt; for having copyrighted material. Earlier this year, Twitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335929/twitch-dmca-vod-mass-delete-copyright-strike-dmca"&gt;rolled out a tool&lt;/a&gt; that makes it easier to delete old videos that contain copyrighted music, and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458481/twitch-streamers-dmca-takedown-wave-warning-notice"&gt;issued a wave of copyright strikes&lt;/a&gt; in response to DMCA complaints. Like Twitch, YouTube also operates with a three-strike policy — accrue three copyright violations and you’re permanently banned. To help soften DMCA’s blow, YouTube started telling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335728/youtube-checks-monetization-copyright-claim-dispute-tool"&gt;creators if their content contains copyrighted material&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; their videos are posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJkTE5"&gt;As Ludwig gets acquainted with his new streaming hub, his mistakes likely won’t go unnoticed. He currently has 2.19 million subscribers on YouTube, with more bound to trickle in from what’s left of his fanbase on Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
