    <title>Nobuo Uematsu’s beautiful Fantasian soundtrack is now on Apple Music</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="fantasian" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Mz7Ag417bBX1L7mAX_6kFXM5so=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69611089/1_4k.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7GvpnB"&gt;One of the most exciting things about &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;-style roleplaying game that debuted on Apple Arcade earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; — was how it reunited two industry legends. Hironobu Sakaguchi served as the creative director of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;the handcrafted adventure&lt;/a&gt;, while longtime &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; composer Nobuo Uematsu returned for the soundtrack. Now, all of that beautiful music is finally available to stream on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Falbum%2F1576490134&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F21%2F22586744%2Ffantasian-soundtrack-apple-music-nobuo-uematsu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I6Fl7x"&gt;It’s a hefty album, too, with 58 songs spanning more than two and half hours of music and a wide range of genres. Prior to &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;’s release, Uematsu said that he was worried this might be his last soundtrack. “Will I get another chance to work on an entire game?” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJR1wua8OJs"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;. “I didn’t want to have any regrets.” Sakaguchi expressed similar concerns, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “Let’s be honest, I’m in the latter chapters of my game development career, and each game can take years to go from conception to release.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Biden administration should take the First Amendment as seriously as Facebook misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Joe Biden speaks in front of a banner promoting Vaccines.gov with the slogan “WE CAN DO THIS”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PagTtoPHJ32eL_Z2cRaCR4sRBEE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69611033/51269419295_91e28ca1df_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;White House / Adam Schultz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bgjSWb"&gt;Last week, the White House declared war on anti-vaccine misinformation and Facebook’s moderation system. President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580620/biden-facebook-vaccine-misinformation-platforms"&gt;said that Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and other social networks were “killing people” by hosting false information about vaccines, although he later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583809/joe-biden-facebook-covid19-coronavirus-vaccine-misinformation-killing-people"&gt;softened the attack&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/17/22581683/facebook-biden-remarks-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation"&gt;disputed the accusation sharply&lt;/a&gt;, promoting its vaccine efforts. And yesterday, the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/biden-sec-230-review-covid"&gt;hit back&lt;/a&gt; with a troubling — and unnecessary — promise that it was “reviewing” internet law in response to misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1nwFj"&gt;I want to be clear: the White House’s vaccine push is a good thing. American COVID-19 cases are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22579247/covid-vaccine-misinformation-delta-antivirus"&gt;abruptly rising&lt;/a&gt; as the virus’s Delta strain spreads, fewer than half of all Americans are fully vaccinated, and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-941fcf43d9731c76c16e7354f5d5e187"&gt;nearly all recent US COVID-19 deaths&lt;/a&gt; have been among unvaccinated people. A significant number of Americans &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftoday.yougov.com%2Ftopics%2Fpolitics%2Farticles-reports%2F2021%2F07%2F15%2Fwhy-wont-americans-get-vaccinated-poll-data&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22585152%2Fbiden-white-house-facebook-vaccine-misinformation-section-230-first-amendment" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;report believing theories&lt;/a&gt; like “the US government is using the COVID-19 vaccine to microchip the population,” an idea that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22516823/covid-vaccine-microchip-conspiracy-theory-explained-reddit"&gt;literally made up&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/microchipped-vaccines-15-minute-investigation/619081/"&gt;wouldn’t even work&lt;/a&gt;. Companies like Facebook help &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/facebook/despite-facebooks-covid-19-promises-anti-vaccine-groups-are-thriving"&gt;spread these theories&lt;/a&gt; even if they’re also promoting trustworthy content. And elected officials can urge companies to stop doing something that’s harmful even if it’s legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tLFlIk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To emphasize: promoting vaccination is a good thing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2s4xCd"&gt;But the White House hasn’t spelled out the last part of that equation. Instead, it’s offering blurred lines between reasonable guidance and an unreasonable government crackdown by condoning the idea that Facebook should be legally “accountable” for false claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="257k6W"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/biden-will-make-every-effort-to-convince-americans-to-get-vaccinated-wh-117059141549"&gt;In an interview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/white-house-social-networks-should-be-held-accountable-for-spreading-misinfo.html"&gt;with MSNBC&lt;/a&gt; about anti-vaccine misinformation, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield responded to a question asking if Biden would change Section 230 to make companies “liable for publishing that information, and then open to lawsuits.” Bedingfield responded that “we’re reviewing that, and certainly they should be held accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7y6IYm"&gt;The idea that Section 230 is holding back a crackdown on misinformation is... well, misinformation. (And it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070403/joe-biden-president-election-section-230-communications-decency-act-revoke"&gt;not the first time Biden’s suggested it&lt;/a&gt;, either.) Section 230 protects against lawsuits involving illegal content. With limited exceptions, the First Amendment allows people to lie and be wrong online. There’s nothing for the Biden administration to “review” unless they believe one of three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HDCKtt"&gt;Vaccine misinformation falls under existing First Amendment exceptions like defamation or fraud, and Section 230 should no longer shield companies that host it. (Posts doing things like selling non-vaccine COVID-19 “cures” might fit that bill, but probably not &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/17/covid-misinformation-conspiracy-theories-ccdh-report"&gt;general false messaging about vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u9Kfaq"&gt;Vaccine misinformation is so harmful that it should be made illegal and Facebook should then be held liable for letting users spread it. (Congress could theoretically define and ban “misinformation,” but it would be an uphill battle against the First Amendment’s protections.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qbA2Eg"&gt;People should be encouraged to punish Facebook for hosting bad but legal content by making it fight frivolous lawsuits that it will almost certainly win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Ise6ot"&gt;The White House can encourage removing false medical information without supporting the idea of taking Facebook to court over it. As attorney and writer Ken White (also known as Popehat) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Popehat/status/1416132396034846720"&gt;pointed out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Biden could have emphasized from the start that Facebook has a First Amendment right to allow much false information, even if he thinks the site has a moral duty to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Grp9U1"&gt;Bedingfield could easily have made a similar point in her interview, even leaving the door open to changing Section 230 in other ways — something like “we believe in holding Big Tech accountable and are reviewing laws including Section 230, but we also respect platforms’ right to moderate legal content as they see fit and hope they’ll use that power responsibly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dhghz8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Section 230 is holding back a misinformation crackdown’ is misinformation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MUvRJc"&gt;And when it comes to most false information online — especially information involving the coronavirus pandemic, where even good-faith medical advice and scientific consensus changes continuously — the US government should continue to respect the right to host that content. As Bedingfield later pointed out in the interview, it’s not like Facebook is creating anti-vaccination posts from scratch; major outlets like Fox News have &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-has-undermined-vaccination-efforts-nearly-60-all-vaccination-segments-2-week-period"&gt;pushed against vaccination efforts&lt;/a&gt;. Letting people sue Facebook for platforming them would be an indirect crackdown on the press and individuals, not simply “Big Tech” regulation. At least one group has directly sued Fox News for its coronavirus coverage, and the case &lt;a href="https://www.rcfp.org/fox-news-washlite-lawsuit-analysis/"&gt;was thrown out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BC7Inj"&gt;While the First Amendment’s protections aren’t limitless, trying to ban scientific misinformation would almost certainly backfire. Encouraging lawsuits over it would let companies pressure Facebook to take down stories about alleged pollution, dangerous products, or other unflattering but contested incidents. And “fake news” laws in other countries have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/12/3/20991422/singapore-fake-news-law-censorship-politics-usa"&gt;become tools to silence&lt;/a&gt; legitimate protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiBK5B"&gt;The Biden administration making this clear wouldn’t silence every critic who believes all social media moderation is censorship. (After all, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566729/trump-lawsuit-facebook-twitter-google-social-media-censorship"&gt;former president Donald Trump sued Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for voluntarily seeking policy guidance from &lt;em&gt;his own administration&lt;/em&gt;.) But it’s the right way to handle a complicated problem — one that preserves the White House’s commitment to protecting the First Amendment along with Americans’ health.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the latest teaser trailer for Netflix’s upcoming animated Witcher film</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PTnu7fpxOim7lGBmuYdGy-d9ZEw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69610939/Vesemir_Character.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I8sqWI"&gt;Netflix has dropped the latest teaser trailer for its animated &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; prequel, giving us a better look at the film’s characters and allowing us to hear its English-language voice actors for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6gh63"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf &lt;/em&gt;focuses on the early life of Geralt’s mentor, Vesemir, “a cocky young witcher who delights in slaying monsters for coin,” as per Netflix’s synopsis. Available plot details are thin, but the film involves Vesemir confronting “a strange new monster” and “demons of his past” in a politically-fraught kingdom. (So far, so &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yuHzkO"&gt;The film is being made by Korean animation house Studio Mir, which has previously tackled a number of Netflix animations, including &lt;em&gt;Dota: Dragon’s Blood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Voltron: Legendary Defender&lt;/em&gt;, as well as shows like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra. &lt;/em&gt;The trailer includes a fun nod to &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/12/the-witcher-bathtub-geralt-meme.html"&gt;infamous bathtub meme&lt;/a&gt;, with Vesemir, instead of Geralt, enjoying a nice soak.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kc1-8y2fQM86zDf03Gq7ZnMlqUw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22708735/E54CqchWQAc5I42.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hv30Rz"&gt;The voice cast features Theo James as Vesemir, Lara Pulver as Tetra, Graham McTavish as Deglan, and Mary McDonnell as Lady Zerbst. The film has been written and produced by Beau DeMayo and co-produced by &lt;em&gt;The Witcher s&lt;/em&gt;howrunner and executive producer Lauren Schmidt Hissrich, with Studio Mir’s Kwang Il Han directing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfq6YL"&gt;Expect to see even more &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; content from Netflix in future, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340050/netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-live-action-prequel-announced"&gt;live-action spinoff in the works&lt;/a&gt; and a second season of the main show, starring Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22566778/the-witcher-season-2-release-trailer-netflix-henry-cavill"&gt;arriving on December 17th&lt;/a&gt;. It’s no surprise given that &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; was Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;most popular first season ever when it debuted&lt;/a&gt; (though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252580/bridgerton-netflix-82-million-households-biggest-show-ever-caveats"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; has since stolen that record&lt;/a&gt;). You tossed a coin to your witcher, and Netflix is happy to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to jump on TikTok trends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lgnVzfdO-uR7tYg7kIaYq0xhGZ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69610844/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tJzH59"&gt;So you’ve started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22567211/tiktok-video-how-to-beginners"&gt;posting videos on Tiktok&lt;/a&gt;, and now you’re ready to up your game. One of the easiest ways to make your videos more entertaining and to potentially get more views is to jump on trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfdI43"&gt;The way the TikTok algorithm is designed, it rewards videos that use certain trending sounds, effects, or hashtags. These videos are more likely to receive views because they’re pushed to other people who also enjoy that trend, and they’re easier to find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22574404/tiktok-videos-for-you-page-curate-algorithm-discover-how-to"&gt;when browsing in the Discover tab&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s how to improve your TikTok strategy by using trends to your advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bZyaOb"&gt;Identify trends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ltAdLA"&gt;Trends can originate from a variety of features on the app: sounds, dances, transitions, or hashtags. One of the easiest ways to identify trends is to browse via the Discover tab, which will feature a variety of trending sounds or topics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3aPkd9"&gt;In fact, there’s a hashtag that you can follow that does the work for you. &lt;a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMdG2L2uM/"&gt;#trendalert&lt;/a&gt; is a popular hashtag that some TikTokers use to identify trending features that others can follow. They take it upon themselves to scour TikTok and identify what is gaining in popularity, usually by watching the ratio of sounds to the videos made using those sounds, and looking for quick growth. The appeal of following this hashtag is that all you have to do is jump on whatever trend they’ve identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Qla3w9WktxL7ouWmwEYbi_3PAg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729034/IMG_8195.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TikTok’s Discover tab is useful for trending features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LggQfM4b1KWVAY8dQ9TFaVVGl4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729036/IMG_8196.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;#trendalert is a popular tag for TikTokers that identify trends for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="52qcAm"&gt;Trends can also vary depending on what niche of the algorithm you are trapped in. For example, what’s trending on &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge?lang=en"&gt;Tech TikTok&lt;/a&gt; may not be trending on Fashion TikTok. That’s totally okay, though, because this helps get your videos onto the For You pages of people who will appreciate that trend. If you are in a niche or want to be, finding trending features requires you to just pay attention to your For You page. If you notice a sound is appearing every few videos, it’s likely that it’s gaining traction. Same goes for hashtags, dances, or some transitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ECQFEy"&gt;Use a trending feature &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oJGZ7i"&gt;This can apply to anything that’s trending, but for the purpose of this article, I’ll be focusing on sounds. If you’ve found a song or other audio that is popular, add it to your favorites for easy access later. And don’t worry about repeating it — it’s common for a creator to use a sound multiple times. Once you’ve identified the sound, make a video using whatever matches that trend. Often, it’s a dance or lip-syncing skit. When you’ve finished recording your video, add your caption, slap on a few appropriate hashtags, and upload! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMgISg"&gt;The key to successfully using a trending sound to get more views, though, is to ensure the sound is still popular. TikTok’s algorithm is designed to tailor your For You page to show things you like — it doesn’t pay as much attention to &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; a video was posted so much as it does the content &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; that video. This means you may have been following a sound from weeks ago that is no longer popular. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MIqCD5g7Pipu2-Itsyt8IYWzX2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729042/IMG_8197.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trending sounds are easy and fun to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mMIWm5VCN3mnvLzmoYh1o1f-N_k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729045/IMG_8199.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The date above the caption can help you identify whether a sound may be old.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TCCnQe"&gt;The best way to ensure the timeliness of a sound is to go to the sound’s page and look at the most recent videos that use it. Ideally, they’ll have been posted as recently as a day or two ago. If most of the videos are over several days or weeks old, it’s safe to assume the window for high views on a video with that sound has passed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GemAj6"&gt;Don’t let that hold you back, though! TikTok is all about having fun, so post your video anyway! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVY91i"&gt;Trends are a great way to boost your following and viewership if that’s what you’re interested in — but keep in mind that they change frequently and can be hard to keep up with. At its core, TikTok is a social media platform, and what makes social media so fun is participating in a way that’s fun for you! Bucking the trends and creating the content you want can be just as rewarding as learning the latest dance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom will now let you add third-party apps to your calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cSl338uMyFVigsx5tZvIEE2bVNY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69610851/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gysxg2"&gt;Zoom is furthering its ambitions to be your go-to app for virtual meetings and events by making Zoom Apps and Zoom Events widely available starting Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLpBNB"&gt;Zoom Apps are third-party integrations that will show up right in your Zoom call. There will be more than 50 apps available, including apps like Asana, the Pexels backgrounds app, or even games like &lt;em&gt;Heads Up. &lt;/em&gt;If you’re on the latest version of the Zoom client, you’ll be able to install apps from a new Apps tab you’ll see on the toolbar during Zoom calls (though your company administrator may need to enable them). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCnEes"&gt;Zoom’s events platform, Zoom Events, offers features to help you host robust virtual events. For example, you can make a hub that provides details about the event and set up a chat in the hub. You’ll also be able to sell tickets through Zoom Events, and the company won’t take a cut of those sales. Zoom will still offer &lt;a href="https://on.zoom.us/"&gt;OnZoom&lt;/a&gt;, its events platform designed for small businesses that acts more like a marketplace for virtual events, though it will remain “in beta,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlhcnT"&gt;Zoom first announced OnZoom and integrated third-party apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515902/zoom-marketplace-paid-events-onzoom-third-party-app-integrations-zapps"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. The Zoom Events platform was first revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442919/zoom-live-events-paid-tickets-conferences-chat"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford’s self-driving cars will be available on Lyft’s platform in Miami and Austin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q2sgGUKsA4Rzy8Y5eYKI86GdTZU=/0x1:6596x4398/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69610493/A6F7BB49_6C6C_4D75_BB29_93B5FB8DEA91.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A1C88n"&gt;Lyft customers in Miami will be able to hail a robotaxi from Argo AI, an AV startup backed by Ford and Volkswagen, by the end of the year, the companies announced Wednesday. Next year, riders in Austin, Texas, will be able to do the same. It’s the latest move to make more autonomous vehicles available for public use after initial predictions about the wide-scale availability of AVs failed to materialize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2o7eA"&gt;For years, Ford promised that it would launch a full-scale autonomous vehicle business, including robotaxis and driverless delivery, by 2021. That later got pushed to 2022, with the automaker citing delays due to the coronavirus pandemic. It also said it would use a purpose-built autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or pedals to power its commercial ambitions, which it has yet to reveal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UZa5wX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The deal with Lyft is the first sign that Ford is still trying to make good on its initial promises&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QVuYwU"&gt;The deal with Lyft is the first sign that Ford is still trying to make good on its initial promises.  It will be the first time that Ford or Argo have invited members of the general public to go for a ride in their autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cd3e8B"&gt;The fleet size will be “modest” at first, with “less than 100 vehicles” collectively across both cities by next year, an Argo spokesperson said. But the company says it is “laying the groundwork” for the deployment of 1,000 autonomous vehicles across multiple markets over the next five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpPY3r"&gt;By the end of the year, Argo’s autonomous vehicles will be available on the Lyft platform in Miami, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/15/18096338/ford-self-driving-car-miami-argo-av"&gt;where Argo has been testing its technology for the last several years&lt;/a&gt;. If Lyft customers are within a defined geographic area, they will be offered the choice to ride in an autonomous vehicle to their destination. Those vehicles will still include two safety drivers in the driver and front passenger seats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IkXAxX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10661912"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p0XWxb"&gt;The announcement also signals that, despite selling its self-driving business to Toyota earlier this year, Lyft is still interested in keeping a toehold in the AV industry. The ride-hailing company already brokers trips in self-driving cars &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17718018/lyft-aptiv-self-driving-cars-las-vegas-5000-trips"&gt;in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; with Aptiv and in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18536003/waymo-lyft-self-driving-ride-hail-app-phoenix"&gt;Phoenix with Waymo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vev6l0"&gt;But the company won’t have a hand in the development of the technology after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404406/toyota-lyft-autonomous-vehicle-acquisition-amount-deal"&gt;off-loading its Level 5 autonomous vehicle research division to the Toyota-owned Woven Planet Holdings&lt;/a&gt; for $550 million last April. The company followed its rival Uber in selling off its costly autonomous vehicle division in a bid to excise the money-losing portions of its business. Last year, Uber sold its AV project to Aurora, a startup founded by the former head of Google’s self-driving project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vBKCVy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lyft isn’t just a passive player in this deal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XbmxOQ"&gt;But Lyft isn’t just a passive player in this deal. The companies have signed a “network access agreement” that will give Lyft a 2.5 percent equity stake in Argo in exchange for the ride-hailing company’s data on the self-driving trips. Ford, Argo, and Lyft say they will use the data generated from Miami and Austin to figure out how to grow a full-scale robotaxi business. According to the press release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="M45uXH"&gt;Argo will use anonymized service and fleet data from Lyft that will enable Argo to overcome the challenges faced by other autonomous vehicle companies by focusing on where they can build a sustainable business and can validate deployment through localized safety data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qLHitI"&gt;That could turn out pretty lucrative for Lyft, if Argo follows through on its plans to go public at a value of $7 billion. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/ford-backed-argo-said-to-choose-citigroup-jpmorgan-to-go-public?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the startup could go the traditional initial public offering route, or it could attempt a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/10/14579126/ford-argo-ai-one-billion-investment-self-driving-cars"&gt;Ford invested $1 billion in Argo in 2017&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20690722/ford-vw-alliance-self-driving-argo-investment-valuation"&gt;VW made its own investment of $2.6 billion&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6dHIUh"&gt;Argo has been testing its fourth-generation vehicles in Miami, Austin, and Washington, DC, for the last few years as well as Pittsburgh, Detroit, and California. The company is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22430813/vw-argo-autonomous-delivery-ride-pooling-germany"&gt;preparing to launch an autonomous micro-transit and delivery service with VW&lt;/a&gt; in Germany, using its fifth-generation autonomous technology, starting in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Maps will help you avoid crowded mass transit in way more cities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h2V1i3yF4x5l9Eg0IClF2dOudio=/0x0:2250x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69610323/google_maps_crowded.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where available, users can report on how busy a transit option is.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K4B0jz"&gt;Google is expanding the number of cities where Maps offers information about public transport crowding. The number of cities covered is increasing from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761187/google-maps-transit-crowded-delays-predictions-train-bus-subway"&gt;around 200 today&lt;/a&gt;, to “over 10,000 transit agencies in 100 countries,” the company says. As well as crowdedness, Google says Maps is also being updated to offer more information about past travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OnhPJP"&gt;Google Maps’ crowdedness information originally launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761187/google-maps-transit-crowded-delays-predictions-train-bus-subway"&gt;pre-pandemic in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but over the past year social distancing has made it more important than ever. Crowdedness information is generated from a mixture of historical location data, as well as self-reporting from Maps users on individual trains. Google says it anonymizes the location history data used.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ENedSIamq5JIxCbBuwg5jGu4V8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22730352/Train_Level_Crowdedness.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google is testing giving information on the crowdedness levels of individual carriages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k6gkOx"&gt;As well as expanding the crowdedness predictions to more cities, Google is also making them more granular in New York and Sydney. In these cities users will see how crowded individual train carriages are instead of just general crowding on the transit line. The feature works using data provided by transit agencies themselves, and Google says it plans to expand the capability to more cities soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kbps0GLrWhk2DAgVAuoEJumzJAI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22730338/Timeline_Insights.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new timeline feature shows details about past journeys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxbgPL"&gt;Google is also adding a couple of new features to Maps’ Timeline section on Android, which is accessible by tapping your profile image and then selecting “Your Timeline.” A new “Insights” tab shows trends about the amount of time and distance you’ve spent using different transport methods and the places you’ve visited. There’s also a “Trips” tab that gathers together places visited, including the option to export them as a list if you want to pass them on as travel recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lQYvX"&gt;Alternatively, if you don’t like the reminder of how much data Google Maps is capable of collecting about you over time, you can turn this off (and lose access to the new Timeline features) by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21401280/android-101-location-tracking-history-stop-how-to"&gt;disabling Location History on your phone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIiSjA"&gt;Finally, Google is also offering more review options for restaurants in the US, with new prompts to share information about meal pricing and whether you got takeout and delivery. The new review options are available on both iOS and Android, and Google says they’ll eventually be available for businesses beyond restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35IK7j"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRYza0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Dish ‘fix’ for the T-Mobile-Sprint merger seems more shortsighted than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/my8K5uIl5Ie7w6wkVmMn7HcqoaQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69610250/acastro_200804_1777_dish_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S5QtMQ"&gt;To sell regulators on their $26 billion mega merger, T-Mobile and Sprint executives told anyone who’d listen that the deal would provide &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634195/t-mobile-sprint-merger-conditions-access-coverage"&gt;near-miraculous benefits&lt;/a&gt;. But economists warned that US telecom merger promises &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962739/t-mobile-sprint-nextel-merger-prices-rural-coverage-promises"&gt;are historically meaningless&lt;/a&gt;, and the reduction in overall competitors would — sooner or later — result in higher prices and job cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2G54r"&gt;Instead of heeding their warnings and blocking the deal, US antitrust enforcers &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/technology/sprint-t-mobile-merger-antitrust-official.html"&gt;concocted an elaborate workaround&lt;/a&gt;: they would erect Dish Network as the nation’s new fourth major wireless carrier. Under the plan Dish received some T-Mobile spectrum, the Boost Mobile prepaid brand, and the assurance that T-Mobile would help Dish run a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) while it got its own nationwide network up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwB2t9"&gt;But squabbling between the companies culminated this week in Dish announcing it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583799/dish-network-att-mvno-t-mobile-5g-4g"&gt;replacing T-Mobile with AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; as its primary partner, indicating that T-Mobile and Dish were simply incapable of getting along, and the government was never that interested in forcing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EEyMI"&gt;“If T-Mobile is able to shirk this regulatory obligation with impunity, what’s to prevent future consent orders from being ignored?” Hal Singer, an economist who testified against the merger approval tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJTjGh"&gt;Earlier this year, Dish called T-Mobile a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;grinch&lt;/a&gt;” for shutting down its CDMA network earlier than Dish had expected. In complaints to &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/dish-california-regulators-t-mobile-inquiry-reopen-9d87c61c-8349-440c-97eb-8cde807ba9bf.html"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/dish-tmobile-network-shutdown-fcc-466e406c-db9d-4318-8cec-3579a54fdf04.html"&gt;federal&lt;/a&gt; regulators, Dish accused T-Mobile of reneging on its merger promises, and claimed the shutdown risked leaving many of Boost’s 9 million wireless customers without service in 2022. T-Mobile has denied fault and effectively accused Dish of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;not understanding its own agreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HW4Gc"&gt;So far the Biden administration, focused largely on Big Tech policy conversations, hasn’t taken much action in the telecom space. The administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570567/biden-net-neutrality-competition-eo"&gt;has yet to fully staff the FCC&lt;/a&gt;, and only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585590/joe-biden-jonathan-kanter-antitrust-lina-khan-tim-wu-google"&gt;just appointed a DOJ antitrust enforcer this week&lt;/a&gt;. Dish’s deployment goals are far off, and any meaningful government action, if it comes at all, likely remains years away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hE81zs"&gt;The deal gives Dish until 2025 to deploy its wireless network to 70 percent of the population. Given that 70 percent of the US lives on roughly 3 percent of the country’s landmass, that shouldn’t have been a particular challenge. (Dish hasn’t given any public indication that it’s nearing that goal yet.) But it’s getting to 95 percent coverage where Dish needs help, given that the remaining chunk lives on ten times the land mass as the initial 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bi9tZJ"&gt;That’s where Dish’s $5 billion deal with AT&amp;amp;T comes in. Under &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001001082/000100108221000019/dish-20210714x8k.htm"&gt;the proposal&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T will grant Dish MVNO customers access to AT&amp;amp;T’s 4G and 5G networks in rural and harder to reach markets, as Dish focuses on building out its own 5G network in major cities. Dish will still have access to T-Mobile’s network until 2027, but AT&amp;amp;T will now be Dish’s primary partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFpfHC"&gt;In a research note to investors, Wall Street analyst Craig Moffett argues that while Dish’s relationship with T-Mobile may have soured, the deal with AT&amp;amp;T likely increased Dish’s chance of survival as a wireless operator — for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bN6QEo"&gt;“Under the T-Mobile agreement, Dish had until 2025 to satisfy the FCC, but only two more years afterwards to satisfy the much more exacting demands of customers,” Moffett says. “That was always the real challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6k0EQv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;How many major cellular carriers does it take to prop up their supposed competitor?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LCHLlj"&gt;Given that AT&amp;amp;T has never offered CDMA access, the arrangement won’t solve Dish’s complaints about T-Mobile’s decision to shutter its CDMA network, potentially harming Boost Mobile subscribers. AT&amp;amp;T, meanwhile, nabs significant wholesale revenue with the dangerous bet that Dish will never become successful enough to erode AT&amp;amp;T market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Po3IgU"&gt;But with Dish bleeding &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/dish-sheds-363k-wireless-subs-warns-t-mobile-3g-shutdown"&gt;wireless&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/dish-loses-230000-pay-tv-subscribers-in-first-quarter-4175362/"&gt;TV subscribers&lt;/a&gt; at an alarming rate, the clock is ticking on Dish’s overall survivability. In the next six years, Dish has to remain financially viable, build out a massive and popular next-generation wireless network, keep state and federal regulators happy, and somehow steal meaningful market share from a US telecom sector historically averse to being meaningfully disrupted by competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyRnnZ"&gt;It’s a big ask for a company long criticized — &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/t-mobile-takes-huge-swing-at-dish-for-hoarding-spectrum"&gt;including by T-Mobile in 2018&lt;/a&gt; — for gobbling up troves of valuable spectrum, then not delivering on its promises to put that spectrum to use. While the government deal bars Dish from selling its spectrum for six years, analysts have long pondered if Dish will just string regulators along, sell its spectrum, then use the immense profits to laugh off any remaining regulatory, legal, and contractual obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5uoo4"&gt;Moffett tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Dish has already spent upward of $10 billion in long-term cellular tower leases, and risks losing its spectrum in addition to financial penalties for missing deployment goals. Singer, however, remains unimpressed by the integrity of the merger arrangement with the government and still thinks an early Dish exit remains possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ffcTb"&gt;“The decree always gave Dish an easy out,” Singer says. “The real target of the regulation was T-Mobile. And now T-Mobile is getting to slither out.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KCqm6"&gt;The saga could also end with &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/19/dish-and-atts-new-wireless-partnership-potentially-foreshadows-directv-deal.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T buying Dish Network&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T nabbing Dish’s vast spectrum holdings, the US wireless industry consolidating even further, and everybody involved pretending none of this ever happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bdCjJ0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“jobs positive from day one” turned out to be a joke&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dw34vb"&gt;Meanwhile, other merger promises remain unfulfilled. T-Mobile’s promise that the deal would create new jobs — still viewable over &lt;a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/new-t-mobile-creating-jobs"&gt;at the company’s website&lt;/a&gt; — wound up not being worth much. Despite claiming the deal would be “jobs positive from day one and every day thereafter,” the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429587/t-mobile-sprint-merge-jobs-promise-pandemic"&gt;eliminated 5,000 positions so far&lt;/a&gt;, much as critics like Singer predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxE94E"&gt;Historically, antitrust enforcers are supposed to look at the available evidence of a proposed union and act accordingly. In the case of Sprint and T-Mobile, the Trump FCC approved the deal &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-360243A1.pdf"&gt;before even seeing impact analysis&lt;/a&gt;, and the Trump DOJ’s top antitrust enforcer Makan Delrahim &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/technology/sprint-t-mobile-merger-antitrust-official.html"&gt;personally worked with all three companies&lt;/a&gt; to ensure deal approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2JIMG"&gt;Instead of simply blocking the merger and finding a way to prop up Sprint, the resulting solution always required a great deal of optimism in both the integrity of corporate merger promises and the competency of US regulators. Now consumers are left waiting for a network that may never arrive, based on relationships that were sour from the start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGJTtK"&gt;“Just as Delrahim scripted it,” Singer jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvGNUW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWPVRc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple AirPods update to arrive later this year with iPhone SE refresh coming 2022: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csz6F4-t8Kc9zJwssBSsQVlCehg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69610248/akrales_170124_1410_A_0093.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CtMfh8"&gt;Apple will start production on updated AirPods next month, with plans to launch the third-generation earbuds later this year, according to a &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-to-go-all-in-on-5G-for-its-2022-iPhone-lineup"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the latest rumor regarding Apple’s product schedule, which will reportedly include an all-5G iPhone line-up in 2022, including a revamped iPhone SE sporting the as-yet-unannounced A15 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5QeOa"&gt;A refresh of Apple’s entry-level AirPods have been rumored for a while now, with previous generations launched in 2016 and 2019. Back in May, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the earbuds will have a design similar to the AirPods Pro, with “a new case and shorter stems poking out of the bottom of each one.” If &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; is right about production starting next month, we can expect to see the new-look AirPods revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;alongside the iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; this September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4qe52"&gt;In addition to the earbuds, Apple might also release new versions of the MacBook Pro later this year, says &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;. This rumor seems pretty solid, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;previous reports&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that the new laptops will be available in 14-inch and 16-inch screen sizes, with next-gen Apple-designed Arm processors, the return of MagSafe charging, and the end of the Touch Bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhhfLd"&gt;Looking ahead to 2022, Apple is expected to equip all new iPhones that year with 5G compatibility. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; says the company will not update the smaller iPhone 12 Mini in 2022 after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;disappointing sales&lt;/a&gt; (though &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/05/2021-iphone-13-name-report/"&gt;reports suggest&lt;/a&gt; it will offer an iPhone 13 Mini later this year). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0zPpn"&gt;Instead, in 2022, the company will refresh the cheaper iPhone SE with 5G and an A15 processor. The updated iPhone SE will reportedly use a Qualcomm chip for 5G compatibility, an interesting note given that Apple is reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168779/apple-leak-cellular-modem-johny-srouji-town-hall"&gt;building its own modems&lt;/a&gt; in order to further wean itself off third-party designs. The new iPhone SE will also reportedly keep its 4.7-inch LCD displays, says &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;, making it the obvious choice for consumers who prefer a smaller device. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/23/2022-iphone-se-details/"&gt;Earlier reports&lt;/a&gt; about the third-generation SE said it will also retain the home button and Apple’s Touch ID sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve will replace Big Picture mode with the new Steam Deck UI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xJ_x0TfJoS9yUVFESBJoQ5x4mGE=/0x0:1612x1075/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69610106/steam_deck_004.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qsneG1"&gt;Big Picture, the mode that converts Steam’s user interface into a more console-like design better suited to TVs and controllers than monitors and mice, may not be long for this world. According to austinp_valve, a Valve employee &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigpicture/discussions/1/5167301764850695635/"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; on the Steam community forums, the plan is for the new UI from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;just-announced Steam Deck handheld PC&lt;/a&gt; to replace Big Picture mode on the desktop version of Steam as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1YNsg"&gt;Valve announced Big Picture mode in 2011 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/3/3723508/valve-steam-big-picture-leaves-beta-launch-sale"&gt;released it the following year&lt;/a&gt;. The mode formed the basis of the UI for SteamOS, the version of Linux that shipped on console-style devices that were part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/5/8733139/valve-steam-machine-half-baked"&gt;Valve’s ill-fated Steam Machine project&lt;/a&gt;. With the Steam Deck running an all-new version of the operating system called SteamOS 3.0, it makes sense that the redesigned UI would make its way back to the PC client — especially since Big Picture has felt outdated for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EKusfTBeQSEh2iGkaiyjJ_Zdr_s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22730287/steamos3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;SteamOS 3.0 on Valve’s Steam Deck.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ry7zDW"&gt;Valve isn’t giving an ETA for when the new UI will make its way to existing PCs. The Steam Deck is set to start shipping in December, though the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22582617/new-steam-deck-reservations-q2-q3-valve-hand-held"&gt;level of demand&lt;/a&gt; has meant that new orders are being pushed out to midway through next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsuG4w"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
