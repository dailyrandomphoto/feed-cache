    <title>A fistful of Samsung Galaxy S21 phones is perhaps the ultimate leak  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image of a person purportedly holding three Samsung phones" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tEWMfFPMZgHBrxzC6_GgE115vMo=/0x481:1150x1248/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68664608/Ero0eYGXUAIs5en.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: @We_The_Techies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EuglGL"&gt;You’ve seen the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/13/22229034/samsung-galaxy-s21-leaks-news-rumors-stylus-ultra-plus-carrying-case-video-trailer-specs"&gt;leaks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwmw_o6_3LQ"&gt;renders&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187074/samsung-galaxy-s21-leaked-colors-plus-ultra"&gt;leaked renders&lt;/a&gt;. Now, only a day before the launch, you can see what the entire Galaxy S21 lineup looks like in a real person’s hand, thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/We_The_Techies/status/1349448741640613889?s=20"&gt;Twitter user Mr.Techie&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-family-1192643/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKoTzc"&gt;The images also provide a good size comparison between the rumored regular, Plus, and Ultra variants of the phone. We also get to see at least three of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227941/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-plus-brown-zune-unpacked-2021"&gt;the colors&lt;/a&gt;, and in my opinion the purple is looking &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; nice, but does seem to continue the trend of collecting fingerprints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zkfrB3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Samsung sent &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MrTTechie?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MrTTechie&lt;/a&gt; a few demos ahead of tomorrow’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Unpacked2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Unpacked2021&lt;/a&gt; event. Thread of my first impressions ...  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeTheTechies?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WeTheTechies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SamsungUnpacked?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SamsungUnpacked&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Samsung?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Samsung&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyS21Series?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GalaxyS21Series&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/wwyP2QswKr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wwyP2QswKr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mr.Techie - We The Techies (@We_The_Techies) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/We_The_Techies/status/1349448741640613889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HgBJ7u"&gt;Mr.Techie also mentions that the S21 Ultra is on the thick side, though given its dark color it can be a bit hard to compare with the other phone he’s holding in the image. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/13/22229034/samsung-galaxy-s21-leaks-news-rumors-stylus-ultra-plus-carrying-case-video-trailer-specs"&gt;Given the rumored specs&lt;/a&gt;, that may not be too much of a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LU4b7R"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/S21Ultra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#S21Ultra&lt;/a&gt; is THICKKKK  I haven't held such a thick flagship in years.  Makes the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Note20Ultra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Note20Ultra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iphone12promax?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#iphone12promax&lt;/a&gt; seem razr thin &lt;a href="https://t.co/IzRs5HwslB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/IzRs5HwslB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mr.Techie - We The Techies (@We_The_Techies) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/We_The_Techies/status/1349449700563410946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8e45mu"&gt;These leaks are coming in just under the wire, as the launch event is happening tomorrow. If these pictures don’t quite satisfy your curiosity, you can check &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22220913/samsung-unpacked-event-date-time-galaxy-s21-phones-earbuds"&gt;out our article about what to expect at the event&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, it’s hard to imagine how anything more about these phones could be leaked, short of them showing up at people’s doorsteps tomorrow morning before the reveal. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla asked to recall 158,000 cars for failing displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/REWMOTn5-CRwadpgWvXTS2aZPkk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68664472/twarren_170912_1995_0032.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Lee Quinones&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wIa3Lf"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has asked Tesla to recall some 158,000 Model S and Model X vehicles that could suffer from failing display consoles, according to a &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2020/INRM-EA20003-11321.pdf"&gt;letter published by the agency on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The failures of the so-called “media control units” in these vehicles can sever the owner’s access to their vehicle’s backup camera, climate controls, and Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistance system, increasing the risk of a crash, the safety agency says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nGM7m"&gt;The problem at the heart of the defect that NHTSA wants Tesla to fix involves worn-out flash memory chips used in the displays of 2012-2018 Model S sedans and 2016-2018 Model X SUVs. Each time an owner turns on one of these Teslas, it eats away at the total capacity of the the 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory chip onboard the NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor that powers the displays. When that capacity is reached — usually about five to six years later, the agency says — the displays become bricked. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvgxqp/worn-out-flash-memory-is-suddenly-bricking-tesla-cars"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt; on the issue in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGlbcL"&gt;Tesla confirmed to NHTSA that all units with this chip “will inevitably fail,” according to the agency, and also provided a statistical model showing projected weekly repairs lasting from 2020 to 2028, with the most failures happening in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2YguS"&gt;NHTSA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301676/tesla-nhtsa-touchscreen-failure-investigation-model-s"&gt;opened a formal investigation into the problem last June&lt;/a&gt;, and said Wednesday that the probe is still ongoing despite the request that Tesla recall the vehicles. It’s unclear if Tesla will comply. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxdVRP"&gt;In the letter, NHTSA acknowledges that Tesla has issued over-the-air software updates meant to mitigate the failures, but the agency believes those don’t go far enough — especially because the problem cuts access to the backup camera, which is now a federally mandated feature. “[T]hese updates are procedurally and substantively insufficient,” the agency writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sll7M"&gt;While Tesla popularized the use of large touchscreen displays in cars, it had more than one problem with these earlier models. Beyond the flash memory issue at the heart of NHTSA’s recall request, early Tesla displays also suffered from bubbling and yellow banding since &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/27989/teslas-screen-saga-shows-why-automotive-grade-matters"&gt;they were not up to typical automotive standards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdX7Oh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Asus Fanless Chromebox could easily be mistaken for a wireless router</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o63O9QXsLqB0UFalZN9K4gpOw1E=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68664201/Commercial_Chromebox_4_Hero_celeron.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="szUq4j"&gt;Asus has announced a new fanless addition to its family of Chromeboxes: the Asus Fanless Chromebox. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575494/asus-chromebox-4-mini-pc-chrome-os-intel-10th-gen-announcement"&gt;Asus’ previous models&lt;/a&gt;, the Fanless Chromebox’s compact size is designed to be mounted to the back of a display or desk to save space in size-conscious work environments. Perhaps unintentionally, it also looks almost exactly like a wireless router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWTWD8"&gt;The Asus Fanless Chromebox dimensions come out to about 8.15 x 5.82 x 1.26 inches, which gives its aluminum chassis a small, rectangular shape. But the real wireless router aesthetic comes from the ridged design on the top of the box and the two adjustable antennas on the back. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NHmn_xETS_Ii-WloLUMJEm92ukc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233606/Fanless_Chromebox_mount_celeron.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Fanless Chromebox piggybacking on the back of a display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lftIHu"&gt;Inside, the Chromebox features either a 10th Gen Intel Core or Celeron processor: you can choose between an Intel Core i7-10510U, an Intel Core i5-10210U, an Intel Core i3-10110U, or a Celeron 5205U. It also offers up to 16GB RAM and up to 256GB SSD storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRpYSA"&gt;Depending on the configuration, the Chromebox offers different ports, with the major difference between the Celeron and Core models being the number and type of USB ports: the Celeron model has a mix of two USB 2.0, one USB 3.2, and one USB-C port, while the Core models have three USB 3.1 and one USB-C port. All configurations have two HDMI 2.0 ports for connecting to displays and one microSD card slot for adding extra memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pg3Bj"&gt;Asus says the specs of the Chromebox, along with its fanless design, should let it power up to three 4K displays while running Chrome OS (and Android apps from the Play Store as well). With a starting price of $399, the Asus Fanless Chromebox could be a solid desktop Chrome OS experience — just don’t buy a wireless router by mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kT3pTH"&gt;The Asus Fanless Chromebox will be available in the US in February 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ latte dispenses movies instead of coffee and milk</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GAumssSlrzC898ri8cmHglCFsX4=/0x0:696x464/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68663967/feature.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fDb20X"&gt;Asus announced its &lt;a href="https://edgeup.asus.com/2021/asus-zenbeam-latte-l1-portable-projector-ces-2021/"&gt;new ZenBeam Latte&lt;/a&gt; at CES 2021 today, and it’s kind of cute. It’s a mobile movie projector that looks like a one-eyed, fabric-covered mini-robot of sorts. Importantly, it fires out its 720p image using up to 300 lumens of LED light, making it brighter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/6/20683533/nebula-capsule-ii-mini-projector-review-tv-netflix"&gt;than capsule projectors we’ve seen from the likes of Anker&lt;/a&gt;, and it has an integrated 10W Harman Kardon-tuned speaker system to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWelhD"&gt;Weirdly, Asus insists that its projector looks like a coffee cup. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y85sH-NlzadMV-iofKj8xVHowAc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233590/feature.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenBeam Latte projector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BS2lle"&gt;It does not. It’s not the right shape (just watch the video!), and why would a “homey” coffee cup (Asus’ word) be gray instead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227941/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-plus-brown-zune-unpacked-2021"&gt;a glorious brown&lt;/a&gt;? Asus also claims it is “the first projector to offer a fabric exterior,” &lt;a href="https://www.mi.com/us/mi-smart-compact-projector"&gt;which is demonstrably false&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KH8EgE"&gt;Of course, you cannot drink Asus’ latte because it only dispenses light and sound. It can wirelessly project your phone or an HDMI device, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHTEfF"&gt;So consider this an opportunity, gadget makers: build the coffee cup that Asus didn’t. Just make sure it lasts longer than a movie — Asus quotes three hours from a 6,000mAh battery — and gets bright enough to create a decent-sized screen. Asus says this one can produce a 40-inch picture when placed one meter from the wall, 80 inches at two meters, and a maximum of 120 inches (presumably at three meters). Don’t expect a 300-lumen projector to be very bright at nine feet away, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfWMQz"&gt;Asus says it’s coming to the US in the second quarter of the year, but there’s no word on pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Samsung Galaxy S21: all of the rumors and news as it happens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung reservation page" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tb1K5arqACZZowqEDnQbI9ipG8c=/0x0:614x409/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68663893/galaxys21reservation.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;All of the things we’re expecting to unpack on January 14th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="rUvTfn"&gt;Samsung will be holding its Unpacked event on January 14th at 10AM ET, and we’ve already got a pretty clear picture of what it’ll be releasing. Obviously, the Galaxy S21 will be shown off in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570706/samsung-galaxy-s21-phones-leaks-rumors"&gt;regular, Plus, and Ultra varieties&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems like we’ll be seeing a new pair of wireless earbuds and tracking tags alongside the phones. This post has all of the rumors we’ve gathered up until now, and we’ll be adding all of the news from the event as it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roxUjy"&gt;Samsung hasn’t been shy about the fact that it’s releasing a new phone — you can even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202683/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-plus-s-pen-preorder-reserve"&gt;already reserve a preorder for it&lt;/a&gt;. The company has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;more or less confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that the S Pen stylus, previously limited to the Note line of phones, will be coming to the Galaxy S line. Rumors also indicate that the phones will include a wide variety of cameras but not a charger in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y88PdC"&gt;It’s also expected that Samsung will launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/24/22198622/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-price-specs-active-noise-cancelation"&gt;a $199 set of wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, dubbed the Galaxy Buds Pro, which are rumored to have active noise cancellation. We may also see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221020/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-smarttags-s21-ultra-pre-order-january-14th"&gt;a tracking tag&lt;/a&gt; meant to compete with the likes of Tile, possibly called the Galaxy SmartTag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DInwvC"&gt;The hours are short until the event, but if you’d like to see a list of all the things we expect to see, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22220913/samsung-unpacked-event-date-time-galaxy-s21-phones-earbuds"&gt;you can check out our full roundup&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, we’ll see you back here when everything kicks off so you’ll have all your Unpacked news in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="iMaorN"&gt;Qualcomm has just made a &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/01/13/qualcomm-acquire-nuvia?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWm1RMk1qazFOV0ZqT1dWaCIsInQiOiJpdWM0WjJIUitvMlgxOHNvS1Y2WWY3VXBBQ2xZY0lSd1I1eXNRdVpIRVJNcXlEd2d1QlZKcUljMHl4WnhDYmgrRWhcL3Irc3VFTEo3M3lLUDVQUHQzZUdaS3BtTUZlTitXMTB5bEFhdXZoRWlieGZ4d3QwM2lVS1FoNDVyYWVSOU8ifQ%3D%3D"&gt;splashy acquisition&lt;/a&gt; in the chip market that’s sure to shake up the semiconductor industry in substantial fashion. The company Qualcomm is purchasing, Nuvia, was formed in 2019 by three former engineers and chip specialists, all of whom &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/15/three-of-apple-and-googles-former-star-chip-designers-launch-nuvia-with-53m-in-series-a-funding/"&gt;worked at Apple on the A-series chip line that powers the iPhone and iPad&lt;/a&gt;. And now, Qualcomm is paying an eye-popping $1.4 billion for the firm, placing a huge bet on the team’s talent and its focus on building next-generation CPUs for use in data centers, mobile, and other devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdD4RT"&gt;Qualcomm is specifically calling out the growth of 5G as one of the reasons it’s paying such a handsome sum for a company of just a couple hundred employees founded only two years ago. “5G is further accelerating the convergence of mobility and computing. The acquisition of Nuvia builds on Qualcomm Technologies’ Snapdragon technology leadership, delivering step-function improvements in CPU performance and power efficiency to meet the demands of next-generation 5G computing,” Qualcomm said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMpB2x"&gt;All three of the company’s co-founders — Gerard Williams, Manu Gulati, and John Bruno — will be joining Qualcomm, which expects to integrate the company’s chips “across Qualcomm Technologies’ broad portfolio of products,” including the components that make their way into data centers, smartphones, laptops, vehicles, and other devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p7npXr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nuvia is just two years old, but Qualcomm is paying $1.4 billion to acquire its technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M5vI10"&gt;“CPU performance leadership will be critical in defining and delivering on the next era of computing innovation,” Nuvia CEO Gerard Williams, formerly chief CPU architect at Apple, said in a statement. “The combination of Nuvia and Qualcomm will bring the industry’s best engineering talent, technology and resources together to create a new class of high-performance computing platforms that set the bar for our industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twDKSg"&gt;Qualcomm is collecting tech and talent and taking aim at the data center industry at a time of significant change in the chip market. Many companies that once used to rely on big-name chipmakers like AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm have spent much of the last decade building out their own internal chip design teams to lessen their reliance on third-party companies and to better integrate their hardware and software. This is true not just of Apple, at which Nuvia’s co-founders gained their expertise, but also Amazon, Google, Facebook, and others, too. (Nuvia’s other two co-founders worked on chip design at Google, too.) All of these companies are building their own chips for use in everything from data centers to smart speakers and everything in between, often licensing the Arm architecture to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZcE2Q"&gt;That’s put Qualcomm at odds with companies it used to consider core partners. Apple and Qualcomm, in fact, engaged in a bitter multiyear patent infringement legal battle the two companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18410985/apple-qualcomm-settle-royalty-dispute-patent-licensing-terms-high-fees"&gt;settled in 2019,&lt;/a&gt; but the message was clear: Apple was tired of paying other companies to license their tech and would rather go it alone using Arm-based designs. That was only further cemented by Apple’s landmark decision to drop Intel in the CPU field for Apple’s own custom-designed line of M1 processors, which arrived on the scene last fall powering the first of many new Apple computers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;critical acclaim thanks to their huge performance gains&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWPZV7"&gt;While Apple and Qualcomm cut a deal for the iPhone maker to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525962/qualcomm-apple-settlement-4-5-billion-dollars-patent"&gt;continue using Qualcomm’s modems&lt;/a&gt;, including its 5G ones that enable the network capabilities on the latest iPhones, Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168779/apple-leak-cellular-modem-johny-srouji-town-hall"&gt;reportedly hard at work on building its own cellular modems&lt;/a&gt; to further extricate itself from Qualcomm in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="auSOKt"&gt;And that’s where a company like Nuvia comes in. While many companies are building their own Arm-based CPUs to compete with AMD and Intel in the data center — like &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd"&gt;Amazon’s Graviton chip&lt;/a&gt; — Nuvia is &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/24/nuvia-raises-240-million-to-design-arm-based-cpus-for-datacenters/"&gt;reportedly building a more flexible custom chip core&lt;/a&gt; (also based on Arm) called Phoenix. That chip core could result in a variety of different CPUs down the line, not just those designed to act as data center processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWkUEz"&gt;“We’re designing our own core from the ground up,” Williams &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/24/nuvia-raises-240-million-to-design-arm-based-cpus-for-datacenters/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;VentureBeat &lt;/em&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, when the company raised $240 million in a Series B funding round. “Our secret sauce is really physical design capabilities and microarchitecture. And that’s where you see the differentiation coming into play for almost anybody that builds a processor.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAsNbS"&gt;Williams said at the time that the speed and efficiency of its chip core was “very much like a mobile core in terms of size and power,” but with with “substantially higher” performance, a prescient statement to make considering Qualcomm’s plans to use Nuvia technology in its mobile Snapdragon system-on-a-chip line. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0eLZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch SE review: pay a lot less to give up only a little","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6p1Qub"&gt;The best deal right now on the Apple Watch SE 40mm with GPS is at Amazon, which has knocked $9 off its normal price in gold or space gray, bringing the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5W9QWZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=f487a960520964ac860d89f77404bb1b&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;price down to $270&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYyAAC"&gt;The 44mm with GPS is also on sale at several retailers. The lowest you can currently get this model for at Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XTRZD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b1bbcc98b9b514babd7b0198463cd917&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$270 in space gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5QB5QT/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=f16e9235da90ab510af5e23d08d74daf&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$280 for silver with a white band&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5V7H7H/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b1bbcc98b9b514babd7b0198463cd917&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$294 for gold&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Noiy2M"&gt;Following the disastrous launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; CD Projekt Red says it will release the first update within the next 10 days, with “a larger, more significant update, in the weeks after.” In a video released today, co-founder Marcin Iwinski issued a mea culpa to players, adding that he and the board members are “the final decision makers” for the game’s faulty release. “Please, don’t fault any of our teams for what happened,” Iwinski said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Etczl1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;launched on December 10th, 2020, with immediate problems. While the game’s PC release was mostly praised by critics, console players — particularly those playing on the older generations — ran into widespread bugs, frame rate issues, and more. A week after the game’s release, Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;pulled &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;from the PlayStation Store and began offering refunds. An investor is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/25/22199768/cdprojekt-cyberpunk-2077-lawsuit-launch"&gt;suing CD Projekt Red&lt;/a&gt; over the disastrous launch. Today, you can buy the PC version of the game for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/1/13/22228682/cyberpunk-2077-pc-sale-deal-gog-sony-headphones"&gt;nearly half-off&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYB3ER"&gt;In the five-minute video posted today, Iwinski said that “despite good reviews on PC, the console version of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; did not meet the quality standard we wanted it to meet. I and the entire leadership team are deeply sorry for this.” Iwinski went on to point to the massive scope of the game and the developer’s grave underestimations of how much work it would take to match vision to reality, as well as the difficulties of working from home due to COVID. “We really believed we would deliver in the final days,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CFC3kO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O3V4UBZmC9o?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gnEufC"&gt;On its site, CD Projekt Red outlined concerns in an FAQ. In response to the quality gap between the PC version of the game and older-generation consoles, the developer said it made the work “more difficult for ourselves by first wanting to make the game look epic on PCs and then adjusting it to consoles — especially old-gens. That was our core assumption. And things did not look super difficult at first, while we knew the hardware gap, ultimately, time has proven that we’ve underestimated the task.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igKnU7"&gt;Moving forward, CD Projekt Red says it is “committed to fixing bugs and crashes and will continue to work and improve the game via future updates to make sure you are enjoying the game regardless of the platform.” That work will apparently impact the game’s free DLC, planned for release this year, as well. “We have decided that our priority is working on the most important fixes and updates. We will be releasing free DLC afterwards — we’ll have more to say about that in the coming months.” The developer added that it intends to do so without “obligatory” overtime, despite the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/21575914/cyberpunk-2077-release-crunch-labor-delays-cd-projekt-red"&gt;months of crunch&lt;/a&gt; leading up to the game’s release. “Avoiding crunch on all of our future projects is one of our top priorities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hpkvlz"&gt;As for the game’s return to digital storefronts, the developer says it is “working on fixes and updates, and are working with Sony to bring &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; back to PlayStation Store as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFMc19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Period tracking app settles charges it lied to users about privacy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2jDuuIR-ZoUEP0FSiiuznE-6q5Y=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68663380/Main_Screen_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R5x65L"&gt;A popular period and fertility tracking app has &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/01/developer-popular-womens-fertility-tracking-app-settles-ftc"&gt;settled with the Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt; over allegations that it lied to users about sharing private health information with third-party firms, including Facebook and Google. Flo, a period and ovulation tracking app, has more than 100 million users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tnSKKJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/flo_health_complaint.pdf"&gt;In the complaint&lt;/a&gt;, the FTC alleges Flo told users their information would be kept private. Then it shared their sensitive health data, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/20/18508382/apps-mental-health-smoking-cessation-data-sharing-privacy-facebook-google-advertising"&gt;including the dates of their periods and their pregnancy plans&lt;/a&gt;, with outside companies that provided marketing and analytics services to the app. It also failed to limit how this data would be used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZQdHTY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The move could have allowed Facebook to match sensitive health information with users’ profiles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ak0GGY"&gt;The move could have allowed Facebook to match sensitive health information with users’ profiles and target ads at them more effectively. As some users are more willing to share private information with an app like Flo than a major social network, the disclosures can feel invasive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIv6WZ"&gt;“Apps that collect, use, and share sensitive health information can provide valuable services, but consumers need to be able to trust these apps,” said Andrew Smith, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “We are looking closely at whether developers of health apps are keeping their promises and handling sensitive health information responsibly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufIW8K"&gt;News of the settlement follows a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636?mod=e2tw"&gt;2019 report from &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which revealed that Flo was secretly sharing sensitive user data with Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qp7MdY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/20/18508382/apps-mental-health-smoking-cessation-data-sharing-privacy-facebook-google-advertising"&gt;A 2019 study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also showed that apps marketed to people with depression or who wanted to quit smoking were sharing health data with Facebook and Google as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZzx93"&gt;As part of the settlement, Flo has to notify users about how their personal information was shared and ask for their permission before sharing more information in the future. The company also has to receive an independent audit of its privacy practices. It did not admit any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Va1UZG"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a spokesperson for Flo said: “We are glad to have reached an agreement with the FTC and resolved the matter. We will be conducting a compliance review into our policies and procedures as requested as part of the Consent Agreement and providing the FTC with regular updates. We are committed to ensuring that the privacy of our users’ personal health data is absolutely paramount.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADGTDr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 13th, 4:35PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated with a statement from Flo. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xj6Uc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20fV8a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5kmVc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oN8TS5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve’s Steam Year in Review shows PC gaming on the rise — and VR, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/scfReSYwtQBxRsX7HiwfD1d5FF0=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68663334/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pBFmV0"&gt;Valve is doing its part to illustrate gaming’s growth last year with &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/2961646623386540826"&gt;its Steam 2020 Year in Review&lt;/a&gt; report. It includes some rather impressive numbers, like the fact that PC gamers increased their playtime by over 50 percent last year, and that &lt;em&gt;each month&lt;/em&gt;, 2.6 million people bought a game on Steam for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Tg4vd"&gt;2020 was a rough year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536084/video-games-ps4-ps5-xbox-series-x-among-us-animal-crossing"&gt;many of us used gaming as a way to escape&lt;/a&gt; from the awfulness of everything going on in the world — an aim helped by the fact that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22158504/best-games-2020-ps5-xbox-nintendo-tlou2-animal-crossing-miles-morales"&gt;so many good games&lt;/a&gt; were released last year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215786/video-games-covid-19-animal-crossing-among-us"&gt;Over half of Americans played video games in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and while Steam’s numbers only represent the PC (and doesn’t count games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; that appear on rival PC stores), it still speaks to the fact that PC gaming is not just surviving, but thriving. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-bzE4az-Wzhwgc1Ac74UyTSkefI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233454/ca3ca74e50490d1db3dfdd3823bc73f7514e9606.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The statistics bear out what we all felt: 2020 was a year for gaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e6wAaF"&gt;In addition to the extra time spent playing and the newcomers to the platform, Steam’s data also shows that the number of games sold grew by 21.4 percent, and the platform had as many as 24.8 million people playing at once, setting a new record for concurrent players &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21181272/steam-concurrent-user-record-set-cs-go"&gt;for the second time that year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vle4Ao"&gt;2020 was also the year that Valve’s own &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; came out, which we hoped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20977938/half-life-alyx-vr-reactions-opinions-verge-staff"&gt;might finally be a killer app for VR&lt;/a&gt;, a game that would finally entice people to give VR a go. Do Steam’s numbers bear that out? Well, VR certainly grew, with 1.7 million people using Steam’s VR interface for the first time, potentially due to new headsets coming out to rave reviews, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;like the Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;. Valve also reports that there was a 71 percent increase in VR sales, with &lt;em&gt;Alyx&lt;/em&gt; alone making up 39 percent of them. People were playing more in VR as well, with playtime going up by 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KjzdzxpXMJdo9DooiKWkGQWqUyA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233451/f82d7d992ee4f90f6b3a4d54670692e4b9367e21.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steam’s VR stats are looking up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0H2aUd"&gt;Speaking of PC games being played outside the traditional “mouse and keyboard connected to a Windows machine” model, Valve also notes a 66.6 percent increase in game sessions that were played with a controller. Steam also notes its work on bringing games to Linux with its Proton runtime and calls out &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; as games that were available on the OS soon after they were released on Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vnJgC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
