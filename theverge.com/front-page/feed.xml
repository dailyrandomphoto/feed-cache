    <title>Amazon’s Echo Frames can now come with sunglass or blue light filtering lenses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ym3i-_tLuZPCyPHp_hSXc7OBtiQ=/0x0:8688x5792/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304369/Echo_Frames_Classic_Sunglass_Lens.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Frames with Classic sunglass lenses.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T1qTQH"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="http://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/echo-frames-now-offers-sunglass-and-blue-light-filtering-lenses"&gt;is launching new lens options&lt;/a&gt; today for its Echo Frames smart audio glasses: two types of polarized sunglass lenses for use outside, and blue light-filtering lenses for staring at bright screens. The blue light and blue mirror sunglass options will ship on May 18th, and the “Classic” dark sunglass lenses will arrive later on June 9th. All three varieties will be available in the black version of the Echo Frames for $269.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVgx5h"&gt;Echo Frames are far simpler in comparison to other smart glasses, like Google Glass. Essentially, they’re a glasses frame with Amazon’s Alexa assistant built-in, along with some microphones and downward firing speakers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;In our review of the Frames&lt;/a&gt;, we found Alexa’s abilities to be pretty limited (especially on the iPhone) because the assistant defaults to Amazon’s services. Frames are much more compelling as a straightforward audio device, which is where these new lens options seem to come in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0jYR1eIA1QcSaumJCXHZ0dv-3B0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521560/Echo_Frames_Blue_Light_Filtering_Home.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Frames with blue light filtering lenses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X8oOK6"&gt;Take the sunglasses variety. Echo Frames might not make sense as a smart assistant you interact with all day, but for a bike ride or hike, it could be very helpful to have your sunglasses pull double duty as headphones for music or podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEigYH"&gt;You could use the same kind of logic for the blue light-filtering lenses. Say you’re going heads down on a long project and you know you’re going to look at screens for an extended period of time. Having a way to listen to music or take calls while still keeping your ears free could be handy. (Keep in mind blue light &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/17/17724658/screen-time-blue-light-blindness-science"&gt;might not be as damaging or eye-straining&lt;/a&gt; as some headlines suggest.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jKWaqYtOJ3-_Cs52b4_SfsaT3Yk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521578/Echo_Frames_Blue_Mirrorr_Sunglass_Lens_Dog_Park.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Frames with mirror blue sunglass lenses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lEN9sF"&gt;The limit on either of these use cases is the battery life of the Echo Frames. When we originally reviewed the Frames we weren’t able to make it through a full day, despite Amazon’s more open-ended battery life claim of 14 hours of “mixed use.” For an afternoon outdoors, it seems like the sunglasses should last, but using blue light glasses inside, listening to music all day, you might have to keep a closer eye on the Frames’ battery. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The BlackBerry keyboard lives on in this new Android phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BVzzJYtocOfElCkblMsP62xwykE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304306/IMG_20210518_162259.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EuW3H4"&gt;Even though the iPhone arrived as a harbinger of doom for phones with physical keyboards well over a decade ago, the fanatical enthusiasm for BlackBerry isn’t something that just goes away completely. People loved their BlackBerry keyboards, and their relative efficiency when compared to touchscreens wasn’t really the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nApvQN"&gt;Still, the niche gets tinier by the year, and it falls on similarly tiny companies to serve it. Now we have the Titan Pocket, a new Android phone launching today &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jellyphone/titan-pocket-the-smallest-qwerty-android-11-smartphone"&gt;on Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; from Unihertz, which previously released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332385/jelly-2-phone-size-screen-kickstarter-price-specs-features"&gt;miniature Jelly phones&lt;/a&gt; and, more pertinently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20826305/unihertz-titan-phone-keyboard-hands-on-kickstarter-specs-price-features"&gt;another BlackBerry-esque device called the Titan&lt;/a&gt; back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDQl9C"&gt;The Titan was like a rugged take on the BlackBerry Passport, which was a weird phone even for BlackBerry fans. Its sibling, the Pocket, keeps the rugged style but comes in much more manageable dimensions. The 3.1-inch LCD screen is actually a little smaller than a BlackBerry Classic’s, though it has a similar resolution at 716 x 720, which makes for a fairly sharp pixel density of 328 ppi.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9XBpKRDDFEQI2oCJ2f11S3ryzRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522380/IMG_20210518_162324.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Titan Pocket is a lot more rugged than the average BlackBerry.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BgELwz"&gt;Obviously, you can’t fit all that much content on a screen like this. The Gmail app only shows three emails at once, for example. But if you’re longing for the days of firing out email blasts on your Blackberry, well, the Titan Pocket shows about as much of your message as any other smartphone would when bringing up a touchscreen keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0u9iY"&gt;I was never a BlackBerry addict myself, so those who were may feel differently, but I think the Titan Pocket’s keyboard is pretty good. I’m way faster on a touchscreen, of course, but the keys are responsive and easy to distinguish, and the backlighting looks much better than it did on the bigger Titan. The Pocket delivers on its promise of a satisfyingly tactile typing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Z7Cd2n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tUh5H6"&gt;Unfortunately, the keyboard doesn’t do much more than that. The Pocket runs a basically stock version of Android 11 that hasn’t been customized much for its form factor. There aren’t the same kind of keyboard shortcuts that BlackBerry users were used to. Pressing or holding down a letter key on the home screen just starts typing in a Google search, for example. This would still be a useful feature if not for the fact that the cursor appears in the search bar behind the first letter you typed, making it essentially useless since you’ll have to fix a typo on every single search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCAPwV"&gt;And as with the larger Titan, you’ll find many examples of how Android apps don’t really know how to deal with square screens. Games are mostly out, and fullscreen video usually only plays on its side. (Then again, I suppose the BlackBerry Bold wasn’t exactly an incredible entertainment device itself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fY84pp"&gt;Accordingly, the Titan Pocket is not a powerful phone. It has a MediaTek P70 processor, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage; you’ll sometimes see some lag when scrolling through Twitter and so on, but generally performance seems adequate for the kind of thing you’ll be doing on a phone like this. Other features include a microSD card slot, an IR blaster, and a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJSbGO"&gt;The standout spec is the 4,000mAh battery, which is no doubt helped by the sturdy, 16.8mm-thick design and should give the phone some pretty serious endurance considering the small screen and low-power processor. This phone’s vibe is decidedly less C-suite than an actual BlackBerry, but if you need to send emails while hiking, it could be for you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oEF6k_lvl3malWN2WedCaY8DLfo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522379/ptp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Titan Pocket doesn’t do a great job with moving subjects or low-light conditions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7UlRgl"&gt;As long as you don’t also need to take stunning photos on the hike, that is, because the Titan Pocket’s single 16-megapixel camera predictably isn’t very good. It should do a reasonable job in bright conditions, like just about anything else, but the square-by-default results aren’t great for low light or moving subjects. Like my dog most of the time, as you can see above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DcPZb"&gt;But hey, this is a niche device at a pretty low price. Its camera might be worse than most other phones out there, but its physical keyboard is better than all other phones out there by virtue of existing at all. Its &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jellyphone/titan-pocket-the-smallest-qwerty-android-11-smartphone"&gt;Kickstarter pricing&lt;/a&gt; starts at $159 and goes up to $219, making it a potentially viable option as a second device despite its obvious limitations. Unihertz has a good record shipping crowdfunded phones, and while this one doesn’t do much for me personally, I can imagine it might for others.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new iMac brings M1 goodness to the desktop</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A new design, new processor, and new screen make for a winning combination&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="iFtSbd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10505348"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7EU4aE"&gt;This is an iMac unlike any other iMac we’ve seen before, and it all comes down to the M1 chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Vsjmw"&gt;Sure, there are some other differences between this 24-inch iMac and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18311920/apple-imac-27-21-5-2019-review-specs-features-price"&gt;21.5-inch model&lt;/a&gt; from 2019 that it’s replacing. There are better microphones and better speakers. There are fewer ports, and some of them have moved around. The screen is bigger and better. The keyboard now has TouchID. But the M1 is the star of the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zrowl"&gt;It’s not just the performance increase. It’s not just the fact that you can run iOS and iPadOS apps natively on the system. It’s not just the new advanced image signal processor, which helps create better low-light images than I’ve ever seen from an integrated webcam. It’s also the groundbreaking efficiency with which this processor runs, which has enabled Apple to create a slim, sleek, and quite unique iMac chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGUpSW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fP9ib"&gt;Whether you actually get every upgrade here depends on the configuration you choose. The entry-level iMac is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac%2Fblue-24-inch-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-7-core-gpu-256gb%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22440059%2Fapple-imac-m1-2021-24-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,299&lt;/a&gt; for 256GB of SSD storage, two Thunderbolt / USB 4 ports, 8GB of unified memory, and a seven-core GPU — but that’s only available in four colors and doesn’t come with TouchID. The model I tested bumps the storage up to 512GB and the memory up to 16GB. It has two USB-3 ports in addition to the two Thunderbolt, an eight-core GPU, Touch ID, and a gigabit Ethernet port (which is in the power brick). I also received both the Magic Mouse and the Magic Trackpad with my model. You’d need to pay a total of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac%2Fblue-24-inch-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-512gb%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22440059%2Fapple-imac-m1-2021-24-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,028&lt;/a&gt; to get everything Apple sent me (and which I’ll be sending back, for the record). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaSzRz"&gt;In short, this device costs money. And it’s true that you’d get similar performance and save a few hundred bucks, if you just plugged a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; into an external display. But this iMac has almost everything that most people need in one package: processing power, sure, but also a camera, speakers, microphones, a keyboard, a mouse, a trackpad, and a display. And they’re all good. This is a computer you can plonk on your desk and never think about again. And for some of the iMac’s target audience, that’s probably worth the extra money. You’re paying for simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UpRmCz9Ppj-0ehz9LDIpXBXeGCY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521222/akrales_20210515_4583_0105.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iMac is completely redesigned, but instantly recognizable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7kPngM"&gt;The M1 processor uses what’s called a “hybrid” configuration. The easiest way to conceive of this is that most competing Intel and AMD chips have a number of equally “okay” cores, where Apple’s M1 has four very fast cores and four lower-powered high-efficiency cores. This allows M1 devices to deliver arguably the best performance-per-watt in the world. It also means that they’re nearly unbeatable in single-core workloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wq56PF"&gt;That advantage bore out in our benchmark testing. This iMac model achieved a higher score on the Geekbench 5 single-core benchmark than &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks"&gt;any Mac&lt;/a&gt; we’ve ever seen before — even the &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/imac-pro-late-2017"&gt;iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt;. That means if you’re looking for a device for simpler everyday tasks that don’t scale to every available CPU core (and that largely seems to be the demographic that Apple is trying to sell this machine to), there has literally never been a better iMac for you to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LTQC7"&gt;You can see the rest of our benchmarks below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dwvoxG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10504220"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FbG1jZ"&gt;These results help illuminate where this iMac fits into Apple’s all-in-one lineup, and where its limitations are. The 24-incher is a significant improvement over the 21.5-inch &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/7833298"&gt;iMac&lt;/a&gt; in both single-core and multi-core workloads. And it’s very comparable in &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/2820056"&gt;graphics&lt;/a&gt; tasks — which is quite impressive, given that the 21.5-inch iMac has a discrete GPU and this one relies on what’s integrated with the M1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn3FMw"&gt;On the other end, these results (with the exception of single-core performance) are not close to what we’d expect from the &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/2828013"&gt;27-inch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/imac-27-inch-retina-mid-2020-intel-core-i7-10700k-3-8-ghz-8-cores"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=38756"&gt;iMac&lt;/a&gt; with discrete graphics. In this comparison, multi-core results are more important. They indicate that the 27-inch iMac is going to do much better on the types of tasks that owners (or prospective buyers) are likely to be doing: intense multitasking, computations, design, video work, and other more complex loads that may leverage the GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59K7fR"&gt;There are other limitations that may put some workloads out of reach. As is the case with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; and Mac Mini, you can’t configure the iMac with more than 16GB of memory and 2TB of storage; we wouldn’t recommend those specs to anyone who regularly edits 4K or 8K video, for example. The memory and storage are soldered, so you can’t upgrade them after purchase. Only one external display is supported (up to 6K resolution at 60Hz). Ports are also bizarrely limited; the base model has just two Thunderbolt / USB-4 ports and a headphone jack, while more expensive models have an additional two USB-3 ports and Gigabit Ethernet. These all may be reasons Apple is pushing this iMac as a “home and family” PC, even though its processor is clearly capable of all kinds of professional work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DRv0bG79h2KwzeQthF_qkXdCpR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521218/akrales_20210515_4583_0025.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M1 processor’s efficiency allows the iMac to get away with a thin design and minimal fan noise, and still maintain performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fmvaSR"&gt; Another way to interpret these numbers is that I was getting effectively the same performance out of this machine as we got from the M1 MacBook Pro and the Mac Mini. That’s completely unsurprising, since these devices all use the same processor. But it’s a good proxy for gauging whether the iMac can handle your work: if you expect you could get a task done with the M1 MacBook Pro, you should be able to do it on this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LN8P9M"&gt;More anecdotally, I was able to use my test unit for all kinds of daily tasks, from emailing to YouTube to amateur photo and video work. I was able to hop between over 25 Chrome tabs with Cinebench looping in the background, with no stutter or slowdown whatsoever. If you’re buying the iMac for this kind of thing, I can’t imagine you’ll see too many spinning wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="q2t0Y1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The M1 processor in the iMac is just as capable as it is in the 13-inch MacBooks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b6Pxe8"&gt;During this testing process, I also got a sense of just how well cooled this chassis is. On thinner laptops that I test often (including the fanless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;), you’ll see performance decrease if you run heavy tasks over and over again. None of that on this iMac: I looped Cinebench R23 as well as a Premiere Pro 4K video export several times over and never saw scores go down. It took a lot to get the fans going — they were checked out during my daily office multitasking. When they did spin up, mostly while I was working in Premiere, I could barely hear them. They were quieter than the background hum of my refrigerator. That’s quite a quality-of-life improvement over prior Intel iMacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNPpjB"&gt;The M1’s advantage, after all, has never been raw power; it’s the combination of power and efficiency. We saw much better battery life in the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro than we did in their Intel predecessors. Battery life obviously isn’t a concern with the iMac, but efficiency certainly is. Chips are limited by two things: the power available and how well their systems can keep them cool. They vent almost all the energy they use as heat, and because the M1 has such incredibly high performance per watt, Apple doesn’t need a heavy-duty cooling system to keep it from frying itself. Because it doesn’t need that heavy-duty cooling system, Apple has finally been able to redesign the iMac from the ground up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LGQelZSqyCDpUfFGJ6BVlQlIDfM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521208/bfarsace_20210514_4583_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iMac’s chassis is so thin it looks like a big iPad minus the touchscreen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="lgcBjS"&gt;This iMac is sleek. Even though it has a 24-inch screen, it’s close in size to its 21.5-inch predecessor. Apple reduced the screen’s borders by close to 50 percent in order to squeeze the bigger screen into the compact chassis. This device is also 11.5 millimeters thick, or just under half an inch — which is quite thin as all-in-ones go. Next to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356416/apple-imac-27-2020-review-price-specs-features"&gt;27-inch iMac&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like a tablet on a stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="GDimtP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10504858"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RZJbN7"&gt;Size isn’t everything; this iMac also comes in seven colors. There’s blue, green, pink, orange, purple, yellow, and the boring silver we know and love. I’m not quite convinced that the jazzier models will fit in outside of especially stylish homes and offices. But I will say: I’ve never seen so many of my friends, or so many people on TikTok, as excited about a tech product as they seem to be about the colored iMacs. The hues are a nice change, aren’t obnoxious, and are clearly a hit with certain crowds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzqNj3"&gt;Some traditional iMac touches remain, of course. The bezels are still substantial compared to those of some modern monitors. You can’t raise or lower the display height — the built-in stand only allows tilt adjustments. (You can also buy it with a built-in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac-vesa&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22440059%2Fapple-imac-m1-2021-24-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;VESA mount adapter&lt;/a&gt;.) And there’s still that pesky chin, though it’s no longer emblazoned with the Apple logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oKs4o"&gt;Pretty much every other notable part of the iMac has been upgraded in some way. There’s a 4.5K (4480 x 2520) Retina display, a step up from the predecessor’s 4096 x 2304 Retina display (though both have effectively the same pixel density). It has Apple’s True Tone technology, which automatically adjusts colors and intensity based on your surroundings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItlCCp"&gt;But the screen is also another reminder that this iMac doesn’t have “Pro” in its name. Twenty-four inches is on the small side as screens go; most of the best external monitors are 27 inches or larger these days. Professionals on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s video team also noticed some vignetting on the sides of the screen, which caused issues with off-angle viewing — we had a similar issue with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161358/mac-pro-review-apple-display-xdr-adobe-hardware-software-price-video"&gt;Apple’s Pro Display XDR&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, neither of these limitations were a problem for my untrained eye; I thought the display looked great, with sharp details and plenty of room for my Chrome tabs and apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKKf6W"&gt;Elsewhere, Apple has upgraded the camera, microphones, and speakers. The company claims that they’re the best camera, mic system, and speaker system that have ever appeared in a Mac. I’d believe it. The six-speaker sound system is easily on par with a good external speaker. I played some music in my kitchen, and it was audible all over the house. Percussion and bass were strong, and I felt very immersed in the songs. It also supports spatial audio when playing video with Dolby Atmos. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new camera has a higher resolution and better picture quality for video calls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are just two or four USB-C ports on the new iMac, depending on configuration. You’re going to need dongles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The power adapter is now external, like a MacBook, but it conveniently includes an Ethernet port&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LHanB4"&gt;I don’t have too much to say about the three-mic array except that nobody on my Zoom calls had any trouble hearing me. But the webcam was a very pleasant surprise. The iMac has a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, which has a higher resolution than the 720p shooter that lives in the 21.5-inch iMac (as well as the MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and many other AIOs). The M1 also lends a hand here: its built-in image signal processor and neural engines help optimize your picture in low-light settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkDq3B"&gt;I wouldn’t say I looked &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; on my Zoom calls — parts of my background were sometimes washed out, and the image looked processed in some dimmer areas. But I was visible and clear, which is better than you get from most webcams these days. And the difference between this webcam and the grainy mess the MacBook Pro has is night and day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LEFbdsaGxN98UQu-vdJOMEUUbUs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521209/bfarsace_20210514_4583_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iMac is the computer to get if you just want to buy it and not think about it for the next five to ten years&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="aIC4vt"&gt;When I review a computer, my task is usually to figure out for whom that computer is made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1SSY8"&gt;But all kinds of people use iMacs, from college students to accountants to podcast producers to retired grandparents. And this model has arguably the most widespread consumer appeal of any iMac that Apple has made in recent years. So it’s much easier to figure out for whom this iMac &lt;em&gt;isn’t &lt;/em&gt;made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A1duJQ"&gt;It’s not for people who can’t handle dongles and docks; I kept a USB-C to USB-A dongle next to me on my desk while I was testing the iMac, and I used it &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;frequently. It’s not for people who already own a 27-inch iMac, because it would be a downgrade in display size and quality, port selection, upgradability, and raw power. And it’s not for people with serious performance needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jNnmQ"&gt;It’s not for people who are looking for the very best value for their money. Most folks won’t need the specs and accessories that I tested here, but even $1,299, the base price, is certainly more than plenty of people want to spend on a computer. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmac-mini%2Fapple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-256gb%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22440059%2Fapple-imac-m1-2021-24-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;base Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is $600 cheaper than the base iMac; plug that into a monitor and some speakers (you can find plenty of good ones for well under $600), and you’ll get the same M1 performance at a massive discount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="baWViv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’re paying for the iMac’s simplicity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M5Uui4"&gt;And that, right there, is the biggest reason that this iMac, despite its power, is primarily targeting the family market. Because it’s asking you to pay more in order to do less. You’re paying $600 not to have to research and budget out monitors, speakers, webcams, docks, keyboards, and mice. You’re paying not to have to arrange thousands of things on your desk. You’re paying for a device where everything, out of the box, works well. You’re paying to eliminate fuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPGV2A"&gt;Tech enthusiasts (especially those who want to pop their machines open and make their own upgrades) may see that as a waste of money. And for them, it probably is. But they’re not the target audience for this Mac — even if its specs might suit their needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="STI36u"&gt;Could Apple have done more with this iMac? Of course. I was hoping to see a 30-inch, 6K iMac with a powerhouse 12-core workstation chip this month as much as the next person. But I have faith that we’ll get one in the future — and in the meantime, I’m glad Apple released this. It’s not earth-shattering in its design; it doesn’t redefine its category. But it’s fun. It improves upon the 21.5-inch iMac to offer a simple, attractive, and very functional device for users across all kinds of categories. It’s not the iMac to beat — but it is the iMac for most people to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7B2un5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2jyVK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dkiYtY"&gt;It’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188669/google-i-o-canceled-2020-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;over a year since Google last held I/O&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the pandemic, but with the COVID-19 outlook slightly more positive in 2021, the company is making its triumphant return to the (virtual) stage with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371782/google-io-2021-date-announcement-virtual-online-event-date-android"&gt;an entirely online Google I/O developer conference&lt;/a&gt;. And with a year and some change between I/O 2019 and now, there’s plenty of room for&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22435116/google-io-2021-rumors-android-12-pixel-buds-a-series-chip"&gt; interesting announcements&lt;/a&gt; when everything kicks off at 10AM PT (1PM ET) today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSKyr1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; is expected to make its official debut, with rumors swirling that the new update will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274071/google-android-12-ui-screenshots-privacy-indicator-conversations-widget-leak-rumor"&gt;shake up the visual style&lt;/a&gt; of the mobile operating system, among other improvements. We’re also hoping to hear more about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419835/google-pixel-buds-a-series-tweet-photo"&gt;a less expensive version of the Pixel Buds&lt;/a&gt; and maybe more information about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;the Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;, after both products leaked in the lead-up to the event. There’s also a good chance there’ll be improvements to Google Assistant and possibly an introduction to the custom system on a chip &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364543/google-pixel-6-custom-in-house-processor-gs101-whitechapel-arm-report"&gt;Whitechapel&lt;/a&gt; that Google is rumored to be developing to compete with Apple’s A-series chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ibJn9"&gt;To stay on top of I/O’s exciting news, we’ve got all the ways you can watch and read alongside us below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IzLx24"&gt;WHAT TIME IS THE GOOGLE I/O 2021 KEYNOTE?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d04dck"&gt;The live stream starts at 10AM PT / 1PM&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;ET on Tuesday May 18th or at the following times outside the US: London: 6PM / Berlin: 7PM / Moscow: 8PM / New Delhi: 10:30PM / Beijing: 1AM (May 19th) / Tokyo: 2AM (May 19th) / Melbourne: 3AM (May 19th)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OY891K"&gt;Google will replay the keynote on its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK8sQmJBp8GCxrOtXWBpyEA"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; and the Google I/O website. If the last years are any indication, you’ll also be able to watch a recording of the event once it’s ended to catch anything you may have missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yabBD1"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH THE GOOGLE I/O 2021 KEYNOTE?&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Gogoro is joining the battery swapping revolution in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P3fEbH4blPZzcgyinmZoiv6VBpk=/0x83:1981x1404/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69303868/Gogoro_Swap_Guy_L.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="io8EKq"&gt;Electric scooter company Gogoro continues to expand outside its home country of Taiwan in a big way, as it just announced new partnerships with a pair of China’s leading two-wheel manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="md8Jjw"&gt;DCJ, the top gas-powered motorcycle company in China, and Yadea, one of the biggest makers of electric scooters, motorcycles, bikes and mopeds, have each agreed to develop new two-wheelers that will use Gogoro’s swappable batteries and electric drivetrains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvZIOm"&gt;Gogoro CEO Horace Luke tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;the deals with DCJ and Yadea have been in the works for around two years and that the Chinese companies dug deep into Gogoro’s technology before deciding to partner up. The three companies are announcing the deals just as the Chinese government has begun to embrace battery swapping in a big way, like adopting a national standard for the &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/china-ev-swappable-battery-standards-approved/"&gt;tech in larger passenger vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRKRtC"&gt;To that end, DCJ and Yadea will deploy networks of Gogoro’s vending machine-sized battery swapping stations, starting in Hangzhou, as they work on new vehicles built on the Taiwanese startup’s tech. Gogoro’s battery swap stations can also help a local electric grid meet moments of high demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qomgGH"&gt;“We are on the path to make Gogoro’s standard the de facto standard with the intention of making these cities cleaner, better, and safer for all of us in the future,” Luke says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqdGXl"&gt;The announcement comes just a few weeks after Gogoro revealed that it’s entering the Indian market by way of a partnership with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394575/gogoro-india-hero-motorcorp-electric-scooters-battery-swap-stations"&gt;that country’s leading two-wheel manufacturer, Hero MotorCorp&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDVvQi"&gt;But while Gogoro will be working with Hero to essentially create the market for electric scooters in India, China presents the opposite opportunity. It’s the biggest market for electric two-wheelers in the world, but many of those scooters are using older battery technology that is a pain to charge and bad for the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZNyhf"&gt;“China is completely the reverse, [where] a majority of the two-wheelers on the road today are electric. However, they’re shitty electric. The scooters are using lead-acid batteries that are clunky, [and] they don’t last very long,” Luke says. “When they use lithium battery, you [have to] carry the lithium ion battery back home to charge, it’s unsafe.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwafCv"&gt;Gogoro’s batteries, meanwhile, are compact but energy dense, and can be easily popped in and out of the battery swapping stations. Luke says they’re extremely durable, too, claiming that the very first ones that Gogoro released into the wild are still being swapped in Taiwan today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtj33G"&gt;Terms of the deals were not disclosed, but expanding into China is a massive step for Gogoro, which came out of stealth mode in 2015 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7484171/gogoro-smartscooter-electric-scooter-removeable-battery"&gt;at the Consumer Electronics Show&lt;/a&gt;. In the years since that debut, Gogoro has built out a massive network of scooters and battery-swapping stations across Taiwan, but Luke now refers to that as a “trial” ahead of these much larger partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Who needs Super Nintendo World when an English town looks like this?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dFt_gfrGvDacVaDDnN_VVDp7TL8=/0x0:615x410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69303826/0_updated_plant_p_678004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Anita Maric / SWNS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tsRARN"&gt;In March this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"&gt;Nintendo opened its Super Nintendo World theme park&lt;/a&gt; in Osaka, Japan. Now, just a few short months later, the &lt;a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/council-under-fire-over-leaving-20596223"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birmingham Mail &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that over a dozen giant green plant pots have been installed in Walsall, UK’s town center, prompting immediate comparisons to the Super Mario franchise. I’m not saying the two events are related, but the dots connect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="soaadV"&gt;“It makes the place [look] more like something from Super Mario Brothers,” florist Andrea Loveridge told the &lt;em&gt;Mail&lt;/em&gt;. “They look like those warp pipes Mario jumps down.” This is apparently a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qotxlt"&gt;According to local councillor Adrian Andrew, the pots are part of improvement works designed to “promote a feeling of wellbeing and safety and enhance the town centre environment.” He added that “a key element of this work was to introduce more planting into the town centre to create a more social space outside the Walsall Art Gallery.” Naturally, the warp pipes will also serve the immediate transportation needs of local Italian plumbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xyjYrL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Council under fire over leaving town centre looking 'like something from Super Mario Brothers' &lt;a href="https://t.co/FXFjEPFFU9"&gt;https://t.co/FXFjEPFFU9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Birmingham Live (@birmingham_live) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/birmingham_live/status/1393141590819065861?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rb1QIn"&gt;“The colour is vile, they are a garish eyesore and a complete waste of taxpayer’s money,” resident Joanna Parrish told the &lt;em&gt;Birmingham Mail&lt;/em&gt;, while supermarket worker Sue Morrisson added that “they would look ok in a vibrant, modern town but in a dilapidated and tired looking town like Walsall, they just stand out like a sore thumb.” Critics also raised concerns about the cost of the pots, at a time when the council is having to slash millions from its budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znRH8g"&gt;Personally, I appreciate that a town is willing to take a punt on a weird bit of street furniture when so many are made up of the same identical collection of chain stores. Then again, I’m not the one who has to look at them every time I leave the house to buy a sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lamborghini will debut its first all-electric supercar after 2025</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_KeDOLdtFe4re_wxxHQswN7HK3Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69303610/lamborghini_terzo_millennio_7786.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Aht6wh"&gt;The first all-electric Lamborghini is on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfXkQ3"&gt;The Italian automaker finally unveiled its electrification plans, which will proceed in two distinct phases over the next decade. By the end of 2024, the company plans to roll out gas-electric hybrid versions of its entire lineup. Following that, Lamborghini will debut its first all-electric model sometime before the end of the decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaVAyZ"&gt;That means plug-in hybrid versions of Aventador, Huracán, and Urus models will be arriving within the next three years, as well as limited production Sián roadsters. And sometime before 2030, Lamborghini will unveil a completely new all-electric fourth model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3NMYau"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“For sure, it’s the torque and the acceleration”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FR3U6r"&gt;Like other sports car companies, Lamborghini has been slow to embrace electric drivetrains, fearful of ostracizing its loyal customers who crave loud V8 and V12 engines and neck-snapping speed. But with emissions regulations tightening around the world and electric motors able to deliver 0–60 mph times that rival some of the fastest gas-powered supercars in the world, Lamborghini finally appears ready to change direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMS3Z0"&gt;“For sure, it’s the torque and the acceleration,” Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann said when asked what his customers will find appealing about an electric supercar. “And also to fill the gaps now when you shift the gears and helping you to have a constant curve, which is, in my opinion, the things that they are going to appreciate the most.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGKnQf"&gt;But it’s not just about the driving experience. Competition is heating up, with &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ferrari-ev-bumped-to-2025/"&gt;Ferrari announcing&lt;/a&gt; that its first electric model will debut by 2025. Other companies, like &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/25/drako-gte-1-million-electric-supercar-driving-snow/"&gt;Drako&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21116675/aston-martin-electric-rapide-lagonda-delay-stroll-investment"&gt;Aston Martin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17086808/rimac-concept-two-electric-hypercar-geneva-motor-show-2018"&gt;Rimac&lt;/a&gt; have all been working on electric supercars with varying degrees of success. Lamborghini’s parent company, Volkswagen Group, has said it would spend 16 billion euros ($19 billion) and cease production of new internal combustion engines in favor of shifting toward electric vehicle production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svfSvv"&gt;Lamborghini hasn’t said whether it plans to completely phase out production of its gas-powered vehicles, but Winkelmann said the company is targeting a 50 percent “or more” reduction of its CO2 emissions by the beginning of 2025. The company plans to spend 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) on the hybrid and electrification transformation. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xyzy7MYS_RPc5gyd_mNOJmM-2Bs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9621731/Lamborghini_Terzo_Millennio_3_4_front.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Lamborghini&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Terzo Millennio is a “technological demonstrator” of what an electric Lamborghini could look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aL6WYQ"&gt;“We are speaking about the biggest investment ever done in Lamborghini,” he added. “[It is] very important to keep a growth which is sustainable, to have a growth which is taking into consideration the needs of the planet, but also keeping this in line with the dream of our customers to have a super sports car which is excellent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMtIxU"&gt;Lamborghini’s sudden interest in electrification isn’t coming completely out of the blue. In 2017, the company unveiled its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/11/6/16613998/lamborghini-terzo-millennio-electric-concept-car-photos"&gt;Terzo Millennio concept&lt;/a&gt;. Designed in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the static concept car was a treasure chest of wild, futuristic ideas, including the idea of using supercapacitors to replace standard lithium-ion batteries and a self-repairing process to help prevent cracks in the body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J3uMZa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The technology is very fast moving”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7aNWyl"&gt;It’s not clear whether Lamborghini plans to apply anything from the Terzo Millennio, which Winkelmann called a “technological demonstrator” to its new hybrid and electric models. “The technology is very fast moving,” he said. “So we will have to adapt everything to what needs to be valid a decade from now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8BM13"&gt;That said, Lamborghini said it will spend the next two years “celebrating the combustion engine,” which it says has contributed to the company’s recent financial success. The Italian automaker had arguably one of its best years in 2020, despite even a mandatory two-month factory shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It delivered 7,430 cars during the year, down only 9 percent from the record high in 2019. Sales topped 1.6 billion euros ($1.9 billion), down 11 percent from 2019, but the company said profits increased to a record high as customers ordered more pricey, highly customized cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkdLCY"&gt;Whether Lamborghini’s “celebration” of its classic gas-powered vehicles will mean the introduction of new one-offs or special models, Winkelmann wouldn’t confirm. “Wait a few weeks and then we will have some nice things to show for sure,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZG81B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is in talks to buy MGM for $9 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MGM Logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wegblktq-oWrF2eqz4NAKJbeeSk=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69302360/mgm-logo.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SHv5gJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;James Bond&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rocky&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stargate&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Robocop&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Legally Blonde&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vikings&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Holdings#Content_libraries"&gt;a historic catalog&lt;/a&gt; of films dating back many decades, an array of production and distribution companies, and the content network Epix — these are the things that Amazon might own if it buys storied film giant MGM for billions of dollars in the very near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7ZW6h"&gt;Amazon has reportedly offered $9 billion for the company, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/amazon-mgm-acquisition-talks-9-billion-1234975168/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, following &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-pondering-deal-to-buy-mgm?"&gt;a scoop from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the day that suggested a range of $7-10 billion for a potential deal, and &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;suggests that $9 billion was &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; the amount that MGM was reportedly hoping to get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzrCGA"&gt;Between those factors, the fact that MGM has been up for sale since December 2020, and the jealousy that comes with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439964/at-t-warnermedia-discovery-merger-spin-off"&gt;sudden impending existence of a new media giant earlier today as AT&amp;amp;T spins off WarnerMedia and combines it with Discovery&lt;/a&gt;, it wouldn’t be very surprising if Amazon and MGM made a deal. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; was slightly less bullish in its report today, though, writing that “The status of Amazon’s discussions with MGM is unclear and it’s possible no deal will result.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tc4EHb"&gt;In December, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/22/hollywood-giant-mgm-puts-itself-up-for-sale-at-5bn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that MGM has a library of 4,000 films and 17,000 hours of TV. James Bond in particular is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films#Highest-grossing_franchises_and_film_series"&gt;one of the most valuable film franchises ever made&lt;/a&gt; — a list that’s only growing smaller as the Disney umbrella and Marvel Cinematic Universe swallow as many rivals as it can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D92P09"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VfQnBwLbLIeiZEVOPMuNUumuNok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/akrales_190723_3560_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MyfWR7"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or simply use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling through Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while a niche piece of tech, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with no other functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon has dominated the space for years with its Kindle products. Right now, there are three Kindle models you can choose from, each with pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current Kindles available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one or, in some instances, all of the products. In that case, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know when is a good time to buy the e-reader at a discounted rate. But most of the time, there’s some deal going on. Whether you’re looking for a new model or to grab a bundle that includes a few extras, these are the best Kindle deals right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle (10th Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, usually costing $90. Released in 2019, this base Kindle model includes a front light, comes in one storage configuration of 8GB, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07978J597?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a 10th-gen Kindle with lockscreen ads&lt;/a&gt; for $90, which is its usual price. If you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1ccac7c6dd4bb605e9b24952e83a00de&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab it for the usual price of $110. Both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VT322X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;models&lt;/a&gt; also have a promotion where you can receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $120 ($15 off its usual price); it includes one of three printed covers and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Kids Edition (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019, Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $110 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost. You can grab one for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its normal price of $110&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7AYlh"&gt;Right now, Amazon is also offering the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Essentials-including-Protector-Adapter/dp/B07XW24MVK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition Essentials Bundle, which is $128&lt;/a&gt; and includes all of the things previously mentioned above, plus a screen protector and power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (Fourth Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P1C5xu"&gt;Amazon released the fourth-generation Kindle Paperwhite in 2018. Starting at $130, the Paperwhite comes in three different configurations: 8GB Wi-Fi, 32GB Wi-Fi, and a second 32GB model that drops the ads from the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qneu65"&gt;The Paperwhite features a six-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get one over the base Kindle. The 2018 model added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;No deals are currently available, but if you want to buy one in the near future, the Kindle Paperwhite is on sale for the price it usually tends to sell for; you can buy an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB Kindle Paperwhite with ad support&lt;/a&gt; for $130 or for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTCW9G7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 without ads&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PP49ZDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Paperwhite with ads for $160&lt;/a&gt;; if you want an ad-free model, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PT96B3T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this configuration for $180&lt;/a&gt;. Just like the base Kindle, Amazon currently running a promotion where you can grab the e-reader plus three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;Amazon also discounted its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HL49FCK/ref=mako_bundletwister_mt1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader bundle for $170&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKT4M5K/ref=mako_bundletwister_mt1?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 if you buy the 32GB&lt;/a&gt; (with ads). If you’re a fan of Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy, Amazon also offers a bundle that includes a Kindle Paperwhite, a power adapter, and a Mockingjay-emblazoned cover. It’s currently available in two ad-supported configurations and colors: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB version for $160&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $190&lt;/a&gt;, both of which save you $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Oasis (Third Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get the product with or without ads on the lockscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The Kindle Oasis 2019 model looks very similar to its previous model. It still maintains its waterproof, seven-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks by connecting to Bluetooth. Yet, the biggest change to the Kindle Oasis 2019 is that it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the Kindle Oasis go down to as low as $200 if you get the 32GB model, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, you can grab one of the many configurations plus three free months of Kindle Unlimited for the normal price starting at $250. The ad-supported &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $250 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $270&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $280 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 without&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal list price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RNPKRKW/ref=mako_bundletwister_cg1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-support configuration for $290&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RSTQZ9M/ref=mako_bundletwister_cg1?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $320&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple HomePod and HomePod mini can’t play lossless Apple Music, either</title>

  &lt;p id="wpQZWb"&gt;Today, we learned that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440788/apple-airpods-max-lossless-music-explainer-spatial-audio"&gt;Apple’s ultra-premium $550 AirPods Max headphones aren’t ready for the new lossless audio catalog&lt;/a&gt; coming to Apple Music next month — and they’re not alone. Apple confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the HomePod and HomePod mini won’t support lossless audio, either. (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/homepod-wont-support-lossless-audio/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; confirmed the same thing with sources&lt;/a&gt; earlier this afternoon.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brjFbG"&gt;The good news is that the HomePod and HomePod mini will indeed support the company’s new &lt;em&gt;spatial&lt;/em&gt; audio experiences, which are supposed to provide more immersive audio than a standard stereo or virtual surround mix — we were fairly intrigued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;trying spatial audio on the AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s also coming to Apple Music next month in a bigger way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z13Cjy"&gt;And, Apple says, it’s not like any of these devices will fail to play back lossless tracks completely. They simply won’t be playing them at lossless quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNasQp"&gt;Still, it seems like one more reason that Apple should really strongly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434783/apple-homepod-stock-problems-discontinued-sale"&gt;consider having a fire sale for the original HomePod&lt;/a&gt;, which is somehow still available for a increasingly hard-to-justify $300 months after officially being discontinued. &lt;/p&gt;
