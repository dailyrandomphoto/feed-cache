    <title>Samsung is bringing its lowest-cost 5G phones to the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eNy7tQ3zzU7D1HzCcoipD2oNM0o=/0x1:2000x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088752/Galaxy_A02S_A12_A32_A42_5G_5G_A52_5G_Lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C4wNQQ"&gt;Until now, we’ve known almost everything about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22334392/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-a72-specs-price-camera"&gt;Samsung’s newest Galaxy A-series phones&lt;/a&gt; (which were announced recently at the company’s Unpacked event) except for a couple of key details: which models would be sold in the US and for how much. That’s the announcement Samsung made today, with three low-cost 5G phones leading the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cIkjQ"&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G, A42 5G, and A32 5G will all go on sale in the US later this week, with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231420/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-europe-cheapest-5g-phone"&gt;sub-$300 A32&lt;/a&gt; clocking in as Samsung’s lowest-cost 5G model to date. They’ll each ship loaded with Android 11 and with charging bricks included in the box. Also arriving Stateside soon: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21628573/samsung-a12-a02s-phones-budget-price-specs-2021"&gt;entry-level Galaxy A12 and A02s&lt;/a&gt;, each costing under $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4QvV6M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10432345"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2LYuk9"&gt;The A52 5G is the highest specced A-series model US customers will see this year; the A72, which was unveiled at the same Unpacked event, is missing from today’s list. The A52 5G follows up on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"&gt;last year’s solid A51 model&lt;/a&gt; and includes a 6.5-inch OLED with 120Hz refresh rate, a Snapdragon 750G processor, IP67 water resistance rating, and a 4,500mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pAGFLFoROgD83eL_GtiW2VvuNI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424833/Galaxy_A52_5G_Awesome_Black_Front_Back.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G features a stabilized main camera, IP67 weather resistance, and a 120Hz screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="726Ua2"&gt;Its camera hardware is also a step up from the other models in this bunch, including a 64-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization. The A52 5G supports sub-6GHz 5G only (no mmWave), and like the other two 5G models, it supports C-band frequencies at a hardware level. It will be sold with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for $499 starting on April 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gGqZrgSgCd2Gxqqitc7DCtn1-mI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424847/GalaxyA42_5G_Variants.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A42 5G supports sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wrCzlm"&gt;The A42 5G is the only model of the bunch to support mmWave 5G in addition to sub-6GHz. It also features a 6.6-inch OLED with standard 60Hz refresh rate, and like the A52 5G, it will use a Snapdragon 750G chipset. The A42 5G features a 48-megapixel main camera and doesn’t include an IP rating. It will include 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and is going on sale for $399 starting on April 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6X-DqtsUzJueeQ8sMP0LUxnmmX8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424854/Galaxy_A32_5G_Awesome_Black_Front_Back.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A32 5G is Samsung’s least expensive 5G model to date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k6jEFV"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy A32 5G skips out on quite a few features in order to hit its low price point. It includes an LCD rather than OLED — a 6.6-inch panel with 90Hz refresh rate — and uses a MediaTek 720 processor rather than a Snapdragon chipset. It will include 4GB of RAM and a skimpy 64GB of storage, thankfully expandable by microSD. It will sell for $279 starting on April 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m-Vc98jOIvuWYPmFTFnFYQKl_ig=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424856/Galaxy_A12_Black_Front_Angled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A12 offers a 6.5-inch LCD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7igkht"&gt;Rounding out the set are the LTE-only, budget-oriented A12 and A02s, each featuring a 6.5-inch LCD with standard refresh rate and a 5,000mAh battery. The A12 gets a 16-megapixel main camera and a 5-megapixel ultrawide and will offer 3GB of RAM. The A02s includes a 13-megapixel main camera without the ultrawide and offers just 2GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlVP9f"&gt;Both phones will ship with Android 10 and (thankfully) offer storage expansion via microSD; with just 32GB of built-in storage each, some extra space will be a necessity. The Galaxy A12  will sell for $179 starting on April 9th; the Galaxy A02s will cost $109.99 and arrive on April 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIuR0V"&gt;All of these A-series devices will be sold unlocked by Samsung, though the company could only confirm that the A52 5G would be available this way on April 9th; all others would be coming at some point later this spring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAsXdC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>So you’re vaccinated — what are you waiting for?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ykXO0D5HG2yOHWpcUPjCAyNhnsw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088651/vrg_illo_4510_foldableSign.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;I asked experts when vaccinated people can resume high-risk activities — and got a whole bunch of answers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Au1Dis"&gt;It’s been over a year since my office shut down. Over a year since I went to a bar, a fitness class, a movie theater, a concert, a Knicks game, or to the many other public events that were once centerpieces of my social life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KeMjm"&gt;But there’s finally, &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; a finish line in sight. There are three safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines authorized and available in the US — and at least &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/most-americans-will-be-eligible-covid-19-vaccine-mid-april-n1262369"&gt;90 percent of all adults&lt;/a&gt; will be eligible to receive one by April 19th. If our current vaccination pace continues, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tracking-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-11611355360?mod=article_inline"&gt;75 percent&lt;/a&gt; of adults will have at least one dose by early summer. Reader, I am dying to get back to my favorite activities, and I can tell that people around me are, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcwQcb"&gt;But according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, vaccinated people aren’t out of the woods yet. The agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html"&gt;current guidelines&lt;/a&gt; still severely limit some activities that are a big part of many people’s “normal” and some people’s livelihoods: theaters, concerts, bars, sporting events, and the like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5MkN9"&gt;Now, I know concerts aren’t more important than public health, and I’m happy to follow expert advice for as long as needed to stop the spread of COVID-19. But that hasn’t stopped me from wondering “when?” When can our pre-pandemic lives resume, without distancing, capacity limits, quarantines, and other restrictions? When can I go clubbing again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqgsSf"&gt;Lately, there’s been a lot of great writing about what vaccinated people should and shouldn’t do &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;. But that didn’t help me get a clear picture of what the future might hold. So I spoke to seven experts, who have all been involved in studying or treating COVID-19, about a slightly different question. I asked them: What signs are we waiting for? When will we know that we can get back to “normal”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CO5gRw"&gt;Those are difficult questions to answer because there are a lot of uncertain variables, and the situation is changing rapidly. The US is averaging over &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tracking-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-11611355360?mod=article_inline"&gt;3 million doses per day&lt;/a&gt;, and some states are already dropping their pandemic restrictions — but COVID-19 cases are still on the rise, and officials are worried about an &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccinations-are-picking-up-pace-but-new-cases-are-still-rising-11617190131"&gt;upcoming surge&lt;/a&gt;. To understand what our “normality” goalposts are, it’s important to first understand what those unknowns are and why the CDC is asking people to keep being patient after they get their shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vgXT0I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Real-world evidence shows that the COVID-19 vaccines work","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358085/covid-vaccines-effective-real-world-infection-protection-cdc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="qwdW5n"&gt;Let’s start with the basics: if I’m fully vaccinated, why should I still avoid crowds?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uDeh3R"&gt;When you’re fully vaccinated, you want to avoid coming into close contact with unvaccinated people. For one, no vaccine is 100 percent effective. Some experts I spoke to believe they’re effective enough that vaccinated people can justifiably stop worrying about their own risk, while others continued to urge caution. But everyone agreed that while we have data on the efficacy of the vaccines in preventing you from getting severe COVID yourself, we have less information about how well they prevent you from potentially passing it to unvaccinated people. Every expert I spoke to cited this as a reason vaccinated people still needed to be cautious while COVID is widespread in their area. It’s also mentioned in the CDC’s guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hA9JE0"&gt;I pressed on this, though, because it’s not the case that we have &lt;em&gt;no &lt;/em&gt;information on this topic. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-israel-vaccine-int/israeli-studies-find-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-reduces-transmission-idUSKBN2AJ08J"&gt;Preliminary studies from Israel&lt;/a&gt; have indicated that Pfizer’s vaccine greatly reduces transmission, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358085/covid-vaccines-effective-real-world-infection-protection-cdc"&gt;CDC recently found&lt;/a&gt; even more evidence that Pfizer’s and Moderna’s shots are highly effective at preventing infection in vaccinated frontline workers. So I asked the experts how much more information they’d need before they were comfortable with vaccinated people returning to public crowds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69qdbc"&gt;I got a wide variety of responses here. Brian Cruz, regional medical director of PhysicianOne Urgent Care, says he’s waiting for more peer-reviewed studies. The Pfizer data from Israel, for example, isn’t peer reviewed, and the researchers have stated that further &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-israel-vaccine-int/israeli-studies-find-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-reduces-transmission-idUSKBN2AJ08J"&gt;study is needed&lt;/a&gt;. And while the CDC’s findings indicate that the US vaccines are likely effective in preventing COVID infection, Cruz notes, they don’t settle the question of whether a vaccinated person can be an asymptomatic carrier. He doesn’t think it’ll take too long for all of that to be cleared up. “There’s a strong push to get that information out,” he tells me. “I think we’re getting to that point.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iUcGR"&gt;Others don’t feel that they’ll be satisfied with transmission research at any point in the near future. Before a majority of people are vaccinated, “regardless of the science that might come up ... I don’t think it’s responsible to gather in medium or large-sized groups,” says epidemiologist Matthew Weissenbach, senior director of clinical affairs at Wolters Kluwer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D41Jcb"&gt;Epidemiologist Brian Castrucci, who is president of the de Beaumont Foundation, stressed that uncertainty around transmission is less of a concern when a high proportion of people are protected. “This is a novel virus and a novel vaccine. We’re going to be learning for a while as to how it interacts and how it works,” he says. What we do know, he adds, is that “the more people who are vaccinated, the less the virus has a path forward.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7Lork"&gt;With those answers in mind, I began asking about the future. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5AW87JyaCZcsGGWBMUmM30KaASk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425446/vrg_illo_4510_stoplight.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pyvuSM"&gt;When can I go see &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; in the room where it happens — instead of on TV?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dzmOc5"&gt;You can’t control who else attends large public events (theater, clubbing, concerts, religious services, basketball games, and the like), and a vaccinated person will run the risk of coming into close contact with unvaccinated people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5KVoa"&gt;Some of these events can happen in a low-risk manner with modifications — small religious gatherings outdoors with six feet between participants, for example. But I wanted to know what it will take to get the full nine yards back: indoor crowds, full capacity, screaming and cheering, the works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vd8xmp"&gt;The big thing to look out for with local events is the pace of vaccination &lt;em&gt;in your community&lt;/em&gt;, since most venues like bars, churches, and, yes, theaters, largely draw local patrons. (There are exceptions, of course — more on those later.) The CDC is &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; vaccination rates, case counts, hospital utilization, deaths, and other metrics by county. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRarRF"&gt;Experts say they’ll be watching for a few things. One is case counts. A positive test rate of 0.5 percent or lower would be a good sign, according to Mireya Wessolossky, an infectious disease specialist at UMass Memorial Medical Center and associate professor at UMass Medical School. Another is hospitalizations. “There need to be no people in the hospital, or once in a while,” Wessolossky says. Another is the overall direction of cases and hospitalizations — “What we need to see is that all the trends continue in the right direction as we start to get back to normality,” said Andrew Catchpole, virologist and chief scientific officer at hVivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmfbQk"&gt;And a fourth is the proportion of people in your community who are vaccinated. Most of the experts I spoke to said they’ll be most comfortable with large, public events when the area in question has a vaccinated proportion sufficient for herd immunity — the point at which enough people are immune to a disease that a community as a whole is protected, including those who don’t have immunity themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dexKuH"&gt;When can I have my birthday party? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lfJmzP"&gt;Here’s the good news: your birthday party, book club meeting, and other personal gatherings should be fine now, provided that everyone invited is fully vaccinated. So if you’ve been holding out on throwing an indoor birthday party, you should be waiting until &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/08/fully-vaccinated-americans-spend-time-together-indoors-unmasked/"&gt;two weeks after&lt;/a&gt; everyone on your invite list has had their shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwoAbc"&gt;Weddings are the one area where experts seem to diverge. Weissenbach thinks they should wait for herd immunity (or should be held outdoors, with distancing precautions) since there are likely to be outside staff involved with ambiguous vaccination status. “You probably have food vendors, you probably have a DJ,” he says. “I’m not super comfortable with it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8QRI9"&gt;Others were tentatively okay with indoor weddings of fully vaccinated guests sooner. But everyone did agree that for weddings (or parties or other sorts of indoor, unmasked, and close gatherings) with unvaccinated guests, herd immunity is the goal. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pnnsjiK6KSo9pA-UKpJnWZ3u0zQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425444/vrg_illo_4510_Crosswalk.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Tk6zi7"&gt;Okay, cool. So how many people need to be vaccinated for herd immunity against COVID-19? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lbN1rN"&gt;Unfortunately, we won’t know that for a while. The threshold for herd immunity varies between diseases, and COVID-19 is a new virus. The best we can do for now is make educated guesses based on our knowledge of other viruses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llfkMG"&gt;It’s possible that COVID’s number is very high — a population needs a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20herd%20immunity%20against,the%20threshold%20is%20about%2080%25."&gt;95 percent&lt;/a&gt; vaccination rate to achieve herd immunity against measles. However, COVID is unlikely to be as contagious as measles, and many of the experts I spoke to were comfortable with a rough estimate of 70 to 80 percent. That’s also the range Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/12/16/80percent-of-the-population-needs-to-be-vaccinated-to-reach-herd-immunity-fauci.html"&gt;projected in mid-December&lt;/a&gt;. “I would feel good about 70 to 80 percent,” says Castrucci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1msAz"&gt;Some were more optimistic: Michelle Prickett, an associate professor at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, says she’d be okay lifting some restrictions above the 50 percent mark. And others are less so. Catchpole tells me, “To operate at maximum safety and minimum risk, we’d want to see as close to a 100 percent takeup of the vaccine as possible before pre-pandemic normality is brought back.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M8TKFm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/20/us/us-herd-immunity-covid.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;Plenty of factors&lt;/a&gt; could impact what those thresholds are, and how long it takes to reach them. But overall, this goalpost is clear: we want a large majority of people to be fully vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pMNdO"&gt;Got it. So can I plan to attend the Stanley Cup playoffs this year?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UBsjMm"&gt;This year’s Super Bowl was &lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/03/03/tampas-super-bowl-was-not-a-coronavirus-super-spreader-officials-say/"&gt;not a COVID superspreader event&lt;/a&gt;, according to health officials. Fifty-seven cases were linked to official Super Bowl festivities, and 25 people were exposed at the events — over 280,000 people participated. That said, this year’s Super Bowl was held in an open-air stadium at &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/sports/football/super-bowl-2021-covid-coronavirus.html"&gt;less than half capacity&lt;/a&gt;, and fans were required to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/nfl-plan-super-bowl-2021-safety-covid19-risks.html"&gt;wear masks&lt;/a&gt; and adhere to social-distancing measures. So I asked what it would take for the experts to go back to indoor games with full crowds.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBKy9W"&gt;Castrucci says nationwide vaccine rates are more important here than local numbers — the 70 to 80 percent threshold is the goal. Even if they’re taking place in your area, big sporting events and gatherings at similar scale may bring in fans from all across the country. You may not know whether other attendees you’ll encounter are vaccinated, where they came from, or what vaccine rates are in their area. “Something like a Super Bowl, that’s something to be thoughtful about,” Castrucci says. “We’re only going to be as safe as the group that is vaccinated least.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VZoDdU"&gt;Seventy to 80 percent seems high — are we actually going to hit these numbers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4fy7GI"&gt;I got a chorus of emphatic yeses; the experts I asked believe that number is realistic. “A little bit of patience and we’re going to get to that point,” says Cruz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrRiHA"&gt;The segment of people who plan to get a vaccine is promising. A recent poll indicated that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22316094/covid-19-vaccine-supplies-us-antivirus-newsletter"&gt;69 percent&lt;/a&gt; of US adults had already gotten the vaccine or were willing to get one (and that proportion may be much higher in your region). And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331619/covid-vaccine-second-dose-cdc"&gt;nearly everyone&lt;/a&gt; who gets the first dose of a two-shot vaccine has been getting their second one within the recommended window. Kids also make up &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-shots-for-children-hold-key-to-herd-immunity-11616923801"&gt;22 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the US population, and it’s looking like 12- to 15-year-olds could have access to shots &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359883/covid-vaccine-pfizer-adolescents-effective"&gt;before the next school year&lt;/a&gt;. Opening up that bracket will likely make up for some adult hesitancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzkw6R"&gt;It’s also likely that more hesitant people will be pushed to get the shot if schools and other institutions make COVID vaccines mandatory. And there’s also a normalization factor at play. “Once someone initially resistant to getting a vaccine shot knows other people within their peer group who have had a vaccination, they’re more likely to change their mind,” says Catchpole. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BKGi3E0i4OjP-fHfhiaKmmEknRg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425448/vrg_illo_4510_Train_Crossing.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sgE7Gc"&gt;What about that Cancun vacation I’ve been putting off?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv7Y2R"&gt;International travel will take longer. Many countries around the world are not open to US tourists, and some that are have still &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/us-international-travel-covid-19/index.html"&gt;highly discouraged leisure travel&lt;/a&gt; and are requiring arrivals to test and quarantine before they can enter. If you’re planning an international vacation, that’s going to be an even longer waiting game than getting tickets to any big event. Some experts caution that countries might open their borders prematurely but still recommend that fully vaccinated people keep six feet of distance from others during their trips and quarantine before and after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvsk0C"&gt;Wessolossky says travelers should be looking at the proportion of people who have been vaccinated at their destination, once it’s open (as well as other metrics like positive test rates and hospitalizations). That’s especially true because if you’re vacationing, you may want to visit restaurants, bars, or other indoor attractions where the virus and variants of the virus can spread easily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XTG0JY"&gt;Shoot, now I’m thinking about variants. How do they factor into vacation planning?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uTh8NS"&gt;Even if the country you’re aiming to visit is open and vaccinated at high rates, Wessolossky says, it would be a bad idea to visit if there’s a new variant circulating there and you can’t find research on how it interacts with your vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nO29E"&gt;But like transmission, variants aren’t a topic we know &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; about. Some &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-vaccines-efficacy-variants-south-africa-uk-brazil-2021-3"&gt;current research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that while our vaccines may be less effective against some concerning variants, they likely still provide some degree of protection. So I asked: what information are we waiting on regarding the variants we’re currently worried about, and given that future variants are a perpetual question mark, will we ever know enough? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LG5qps"&gt;The answer to both questions appears to be infrastructure: tests for detecting variants &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/labs-cant-tell-you-if-you-have-a-covid-variant-a-problem-for-tracking-and-prevention"&gt;aren’t yet approved&lt;/a&gt; for diagnostic use in the US, and only a small number of US labs can validate them, so variant-focused contact tracing is difficult. “If we had the science infrastructure to sequence variants … things would become clearer,” Castrucci says. “We haven’t made those investments.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUYBDm"&gt;Prickett says she’s waiting for the US to scale up that monitoring and testing capacity before she’ll feel comfortable with total normality. “The best way to get a hold of variants is to do early observation, and we need a bit more infrastructure here in the US and globally,” she says. The Biden administration has committed nearly $200 million to expanding that capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85avsZ"&gt;Weissenbach says variants just underscore the need for countries to reach herd immunity. “It’s like a wildfire in California,” he says. “They’re going to continue to crop up. We’re just trying to put a squash on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PvtnMcKEOFWy6blkfEdIYP-wL84=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425447/vrg_illo_4510_trafficSign.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O2CkKH"&gt;Bottom line: what are we waiting for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TEInwd"&gt;After getting such a wide variety of answers to so many of my questions, I am left hopeful but also frustrated. How should laypeople like me navigate our lives post-vaccine when even medical experts disagree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9rNhW"&gt;While it may seem tempting to draw the conclusion that this all comes down to a value judgment — you should weigh your risk tolerance against how much you value your wedding or vacation and make your own decision — that doesn’t sit right with me. Our risk is our business, sure, but we’re also asked to restrict our behavior to keep other people safe. And I’ll be brutally honest: I miss live entertainment, traveling, and even indoor dining enough that if I really believed that my post-vaccine decisions came down solely to my own risk-reward calculus, I’d probably drop all pre-vaccine restrictions as soon as I was two weeks out from that last shot. That’s a decision I think every expert in this article would agree is the wrong one because there’s an element of responsibility in the equation as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6CdlB"&gt;Some folks will certainly disregard all public health guidelines and start globetrotting immediately after their second shot. Others may swear off concerts for the rest of their lives. But many people (myself included) feel an obligation not to contribute to spread but would also benefit from knowing there’s an end in sight — knowing that there’s a time coming when the risk of spread will be low enough that we can go back to our favorite pre-pandemic joys with science on our side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egkCRD"&gt;So here’s my takeaway, for what it’s worth. Experts across disciplines have conflicting advice. As vaccination rates rise, we’ll likely see some authorities relax their demands, while others continue to urge caution. Governors will allow things to open, and people on Twitter will urge you not to go. It’s going to be a confusing time, and different areas will move at different paces. But for the riskiest indoor activities, there’s a tentative finish line in sight: we’re waiting for a large majority of our communities to be fully vaccinated, and for cases and hospitalizations to decline. Here’s my mental finish line: with the caveat that variants and other circumstances could change the equation, and that precautions should be eased carefully rather than thrown to the winds, 70 to 80 percent is the rough threshold I’m watching for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCDPlz"&gt;To gut check this conclusion I turned to Ben Bates, a professor at Ohio University who studies health communication and messaging. He’s not surprised that I’d had trouble finding straight answers. He emphasizes that communicating public-health guidance is challenging, and he thinks some of the expert messaging around COVID has underweighted the value of social gatherings. “The way science and public health work is you want to accumulate as much evidence as possible and test it over and over,” Bates says. “By nature these are very cautious, conservative people. I don’t think we’ll hear for a good long time ‘It is now absolutely safe to go out.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Doafe9"&gt;But Bates thinks the prospect of US communities hitting a high vaccination threshold, and seeing a subsequent decline in community transmission, is “quite realistic” and agrees that it’s a reasonable milestone to wait for that fairly balances risk aversion against the costs of restrictions and the high value of social gatherings. “Politicians, and business folks, and church leaders and so on will rightly say, ‘This is the kind of number you said would help protect us, and we’ve reached that number,” Bates says. “That’s when I think things will be pretty darn opened up.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Arcade finally got the boost it needed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GNbAP2eGnJ4kxD39kEkqb8vSygk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088559/opening2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VoZQ7K"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362388/apple-arcade-game-subscription-update-monument-valley-threes-iphone-ipad"&gt;Apple Arcade received its biggest update since launching back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. More than 30 titles were added to the subscription service, including much-anticipated games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362624/fantasian-release-date-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;Hironobu Sakaguchi’s roleplaying epic &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But while the quantity and quality of titles added were impressive, the most important part of the announcement was a change in direction. Among those big-name exclusives were a number of classics, ranging from &lt;em&gt;Monument Valley&lt;/em&gt; to chess to &lt;em&gt;Threes&lt;/em&gt;, that help round out the service. Apple Arcade has finally matured into something close to a Netflix for mobile games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="xRwD9v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10432584"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cKXwLy"&gt;Since the beginning, the pitch for Apple Arcade has been entirely centered on quality. While the App Store continues to devolve into a space dominated by free-to-play games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893691/apple-arcade-subscription-gaming-price-premium-games-zach-gage-noodlecake-snowman"&gt;Arcade provided an alternative&lt;/a&gt; where some of the most talented developers in the world could create great mobile games without having to worry about monetization. It launched alongside new games from the likes of Zach Gage and Ustwo, and it has continued to add titles on a near-weekly basis. Subscribers get all of those games for a flat monthly fee. It’s been a solid service — but it’s always felt like something was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91717B"&gt;When you sign up for something like Netflix, it might be because of one of the service’s big exclusive titles like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;. But that won’t necessarily keep you hooked. Part of what makes Netflix so compelling is &lt;em&gt;everything else&lt;/em&gt;, from reality shows to classic sitcoms, that give you something to watch after you’re done with the big tent poles. Frequently, these aren’t traditional exclusives: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297077/the-office-friends-peacock-hbo-max-streaming-wars-disney-plus-star"&gt;think of how important &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; have become in the age of streaming TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1gxGs"&gt;Those kinds of experiences are something Apple Arcade didn’t really have before this shift. Now, though, when you’re done playing a short narrative game like, say, &lt;em&gt;Creaks&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Assemble With Care&lt;/em&gt;, there’s a lot more to keep you invested with recent additions like &lt;em&gt;Good Sudoku&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Threes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EjgYix6_JhkfSAb-fHIf2BxEsqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425030/01_Welcome.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonderbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kM6Tyn"&gt;Even better, while many of these games are available on other platforms or through the App Store, the Arcade versions are generally improved because they feature no form of in-app purchases or monetization. You won’t find puzzle or card games saddled with ads or have to open loot boxes in &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K21&lt;/em&gt;. There’s even &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Legends&lt;/em&gt; — essentially a character-collecting gacha game — which almost feels strange to play without being prodded to spend money. (This lack of microtransactions makes Arcade &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164414/apple-arcade-family-kids-crossy-road-butter-royale-loud-house-netflix"&gt;a very family-friendly service&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ayy0Rw"&gt;It’s also important to note that this change in strategy is additive. Apple has introduced two new categories to Arcade — one for older App Store hits, another for classic games like chess or solitaire — but it’s still releasing those big exclusive titles. In addition to &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;, last week’s update included &lt;em&gt;Wonderbox&lt;/em&gt; (think &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; for younger players), &lt;em&gt;World of Demons&lt;/em&gt; (the latest action game from PlatinumGames, the team behind &lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bayonetta&lt;/em&gt;), and &lt;em&gt;Taiko no Tatsujin: Pop Tap Beat&lt;/em&gt; (a new entry in an excellent long-running rhythm game series). It’s a great and diverse lineup of experiences; sometimes scrolling through games on Arcade can feel like heading into an alternate reality version of what mobile gaming could have been if the race to free-to-play never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAVEO8"&gt;Obviously, none of this is a guarantee of success. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308657/apple-arcade-canceling-games-subscription-service-engagement"&gt;if previous reports are to be believed&lt;/a&gt;, the shift appears to be a result of Arcade’s inability to keep subscribers hooked. While the subscription model is now dominant for the music, film, and television industries, it’s still relatively nascent for games. Outside of Xbox Game Pass, there hasn’t been a major success to date. Apple Arcade arguably faces a greater challenge being on mobile, where users have long been conditioned to expect games for free. The Netflix of games still feels inevitable, even if we’re not there yet — but Arcade feels closer than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>When will the global chip shortage end so you can finally buy a PS5?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ePU06M8Owg78ymj7yiaSrnZU9tY=/7x0:2293x1524/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088535/Qualcomm_Snapdragon_8c_Compute_Platform___Chip_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SCyevf"&gt;There aren’t enough chips to go around. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363232/global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-pandemic-consoles-cpus-graphics-cards-cars"&gt;ongoing global semiconductor shortage&lt;/a&gt; means the difficulty of buying a PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or high-end GPU from companies like Nvidia or AMD could go on for months — if not for the rest of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ND4cPv"&gt;And it’s not just gaming gear: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;car companies like Ford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; are having problems with their truck production, Apple supplier Foxconn is warning of part delays that could last until 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325999/gogo-5g-network-delay-chip-shortage"&gt;5G rollouts are getting delayed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;Samsung is warning of a “serious imbalance”&lt;/a&gt; in the semiconductor industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBVgdD"&gt;There are a lot of reasons why this shortage is hitting now: trickled-down delays from COVID-19 shutdowns of factories last year, a surge in demand from customers stuck at home during the pandemic who want new laptops, along with more political issues like former President Trump’s trade war with China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1IhAXj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not that there aren’t enough chips, so much as there aren’t enough chipmakers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qo3y7G"&gt;But the issues lie even deeper than that: it’s not that there aren’t enough chips, so much as there aren’t enough chipmakers. “In the year 2000, we used to have 30 companies that made their own integrated circuits. Then, they discovered that it’s cheaper to outsource,” explains UCLA professor Christopher Tang in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9pyHU"&gt;As demand for products — and the increasingly computerized nature of even more mundane products like cars or smart home accessories — has spiked, there’s never been more need for chips. But at the same time, the industry has become smaller over the past several decades, as many technology companies, and even chipmakers like AMD, have switched to a fabless model where they outsource the actual manufacturing to other companies (like Samsung or TSMC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVD0BT"&gt;Solving &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; chip shortage, though, will likely just be a matter of time: eventually, demand will stop outpacing the limited supply, and things should go back to normal (and you’ll be able to just buy a PlayStation without jumping through online hoops and endless digital queues). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0RCsD"&gt;But preventing future shortages will probably require bigger changes to how the industry at large sources semiconductors to reflect our increasingly digital world. We’re already seeing some of them: &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tsmc-investment-plan/tsmc-to-invest-100-billion-over-3-years-to-meet-chip-demand-idUSKBN2BO3ZJ"&gt;TSMC has announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to invest $100 billion over the next three years to increase its capacity to meet rising demand. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;Intel plans to spend $20 billion&lt;/a&gt; on expanding its fabs in Arizona, as well as opening its doors to produce chips for other companies (similar to how TSMC and Samsung already operate), adding a new major supplier to the marketplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3j6lP"&gt;But those changes will take time and a commitment from the industry to actually build a healthier supply chain over the next several years and decades. And very little is likely to make it easier to buy that hard-to-find gadget in the next few months. But those changes could eventually make buying a hypothetical PlayStation 6 or Xbox successor easier down the line. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring’s new floodlight camera borrows features from its best doorbell</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1poXivw99Svt3d7UMkMSez-GisA=/651x0:7676x4683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088552/20210217_image_lifestyle_insitu_flcprogen1_daytime_rgb_crop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QjTD84"&gt;Ring has announced a new floodlight with an integrated camera called the Floodlight Cam Wired Pro. As its name suggests, the Floodlight Cam Wired Pro borrows several features from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359973/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-review"&gt;recently released Video Doorbell Pro 2&lt;/a&gt;, including 3D Motion Detection with radar and a top-down view of someone’s movements in front of the camera, which the company calls Bird’s Eye View. The Floodlight Cam Wired Pro, which I will refer to as the Floodlight Pro from here on out, is available for preorder in either white or black starting today, April 7th, for $249.99, with shipments starting on May 6th, 2021. Ring is also keeping the original Floodlight Cam in the lineup at a new $199.99 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vz4mN5"&gt;Like the first Floodlight Cam, the Floodlight Pro is a motion-activated, 2,000-lumen LED floodlight with a camera mounted between its two articulating lights. It has a 110dB siren, supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi, records 1080p HDR video with color night vision, and has improved microphones and a speaker for better two-way audio communication. The new 3D Motion Detection uses a radar sensor to track movement across a certain threshold that you define in Ring’s app, which is then presented as an aerial map in the recorded video clip. The Floodlight Pro is hardwired and can be mounted on a standard round outdoor junction box. Given its name, I wouldn’t be surprised if Ring has a wireless version in the works, but the company isn’t announcing anything on that front right now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Floodlight Cam Wired Pro is available in either white or black color options&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

The new model upgrades the black and white pre-roll video that debuted on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174876/amazon-ring-new-video-doorbell-3-plus-chime-pro-pre-roll"&gt;last year’s Video Doorbell 3&lt;/a&gt; to full color, allowing you to see four seconds of motion in color before the doorbell is pressed. It also has a new Quick Replies feature that lets you have the doorbell automatically respond to visitors when you aren’t home or otherwise don’t want to be disturbed. You can use the Doorbell 4 with either 2.4GHz or 5GHz networks.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Video Doorbell 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cb0kje"&gt;The Video Doorbell 4 records up to 1080p video, but it lacks the square aspect ratio that I found so useful in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359973/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-review"&gt;my review of the Video Doorbell Pro 2&lt;/a&gt;, instead sticking with the traditional wide 16:9 field of view. The 4 also doesn’t have the Pro 2’s more advanced Alexa integration to answer the door — though, based on my testing, I don’t think you’ll miss much there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cz00nw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELf1ARbITMY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vALnzy"&gt;Ring says the Video Doorbell 3 and Video Doorbell 3 Plus will remain available, though I’m not sure why you’d buy those when the 4 is out and costs either the same or less. The Video Doorbell 4 is available for preorder starting today and will be shipping starting on April 28th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s Mother’s Day Gift Guide 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qJ2V7vh7OHBfN0Z7Knm3RGK1cCc=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088546/VRG_ILLO_4487_Mothers_Day_Gift_Guide_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j6ndHY"&gt;It’s been a very hard year for us all — but especially for moms, who have had to deal with not only the worry about the pandemic itself, but its effect on their work schedules, their kids’ schooling and socialization, and all of the other issues that have come up over the past year. So for Mother’s Day this year, it could be a good idea to give mom a gift that will allow her to relax, if only for a few hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRBC5Q"&gt;We’ve put together a list of about 30 possible gifts that might give your mom — or you — a short vacation from stress. Have a look, and see if any of these work for you or at least give you some ideas of the ways that you, your family, and your friends can take a break.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="NZJH6Z"&gt;These are the best wireless earbuds to get for music, podcasts, and calls, especially if mom operates in the Apple ecosystem. They’ve got great sound and are easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="BkLDmx"&gt;Wireless earpods that offer pleasing bass-heavy sound, reliable performance, and can connect with two devices — like a phone and laptop — at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cPeHX2"&gt;A 10-foot cable (with a charger) lets mom charge her phone in bed or in the comfort of her favorite armchair, without having to rig up an unsightly extension cord to the nearest outlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1JBSg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/KINPS-Certified-Lightning-Charging-Compatible/dp/B07Z9V5L4Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$12 at AMAZON (Lightning to USB-C)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="qpAvBg"&gt;Knowing you can find your keys can remove a major source of tension. Tile, the best-known tracking device, has released a collection of limited edition trackers that are decorated with designs with names like Watercolor Dream and Nightbloom, making them both practical and pretty gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XrCQA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetileapp.com%2Fen-us%2Flimited-edition-tiles&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22358371%2Fmothers-day-gifts-ideas-best-mom-tech-gadgets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$63 at TILE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="10gheL"&gt;Streaming video subscription&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zwidEM"&gt;One way to relax is by watching a great film or TV series, and several streaming services offer gift subscriptions. You can buy gift cards from Hulu and Netflix that can be exchanged for subs. And if mom is a cinephile, you can get her a year’s subscription to the Criterion Channel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="CZx75b"&gt;Who doesn’t like a good murder mystery? These games provide two puzzles in one: you can find clues to the murderer’s identity by solving the jigsaw puzzle. It’s a great way to spend a relaxing evening at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rf078b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0085093IC/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A1LJQB0JA6R2YV&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$31 at AMAZON&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="K0Z4FP"&gt;Judged to be the best gaming mouse by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, this wireless mouse is comfortable, feature-packed, fast, and accurate — the perfect gift for an enthusiastic gamer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="64vDXB"&gt;The Snackeez cup lets you simultaneously hold a 16-once drink and a snack. Mom can watch her favorite streams while sipping on fruit punch and munching on pretzels. And this is the ideal cup for road trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5bs9Zx"&gt;These rice cookers can be really useful, especially for somebody who is juggling several workloads. A rice cooker frees up your stove’s burners and makes the whole process basically automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FDxFn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Proctor-Silex-37534NR-uncooked-resulting/dp/B01GVGXB5C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20 at AMAZON&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="eSLOjk"&gt;It can cheer you up to drink your morning coffee out of something unique and special, like this handmade mug, which holds 10 ounces of hot or cold liquid (12 ounces to the rim). Got an AeroPress? Don’t worry, this will fit it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alienware’s M15 R5 is its first AMD-based gaming laptop in over a decade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-UH-XwL5q9IIRfdfYs7u7uamLjY=/0x0:2160x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088309/alienwarem15r5lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RcZ5Tu"&gt;Alienware has announced the latest revision to its flagship gaming laptop lineup, the 15-inch Alienware M15 R5. It’ll start shipping on April 20th in the US, costing $2,229.99 to start. The company is going big with its messaging that it’ll host AMD’s fast Ryzen 5000 H-series processors (up to the octa-core Ryzen 9 5900HX) and up to Nvidia’s RTX 3070 graphics chip. Dell says this is the first Alienware laptop since 2007 to feature an AMD processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GG4Xam"&gt;In case you haven’t noticed, AMD’s processors have been on a tear in the past year, delivering great performance without compromising on efficiency when you aren’t gaming. This is just the latest company to join along the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus&lt;/a&gt;, Lenovo, and even Dell with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few. AMD-touting laptops are already among some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptops you can buy&lt;/a&gt;. Yet Alienware is possibly the most well-known gaming brand to go AMD yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q0sGxs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Big boost clocks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SV1J9c"&gt;The base configuration of the M15 R5 has the octa-core Ryzen 7 5800H processor and Nvidia’s RTX 3060. You can upgrade to the Ryzen 9 5900HX octa-core processor and the RTX 3070. Both the RTX 3060 and 3070 have a total graphics power level of 115W with 10W of extra boost available for up to 125W of maximum graphics power. Interestingly, the 3060 has a higher base and boost clock (base: 1,387MHz, boost: 1,702MHz) than the 3070 option does (base: 1,110MHz, boost: 1,560MHz). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1JWLj"&gt;Either way, these are some of the highest clock speeds we’ve seen yet in a reasonably thin 2021 gaming laptop. Alienware is pushing the boost clocks nearly all the way to the ceiling, and it’s great that it’s transparent about these power specs, since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;Nvidia now requires that manufacturers share it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dfMrwvr3yTE2o6ne4aOc9aiYSo8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425146/m15r5tilt.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ryzen Edition will ship in this silver configuration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vycfFh"&gt;Speaking of dimensions, the R5 is thicker and heavier than the previous R4 generation. The base configuration weighs 5.34 pounds (up to 5.93 pounds, depending on the components inside). The R4’s base configuration weighed 4.65 pounds, for comparison. The R5 is 19.25mm thick at its front (up to 22.85mm thick near the hinge), 272.5mm deep, and 356mm wide. Each configuration will ship with an 86Wh battery, like what shipped in the M15 R4 and R3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPCP0y"&gt;Screen-wise, the R5 can be configured with a range of high-refresh-rate displays. The base FHD screen has a 3ms response time screen with a 165Hz refresh rate, and your options for upgrading are either a dimmer 300-nit 1080p panel with a faster 360Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and only 100 percent sRGB color coverage, or a brighter 400-nit QHD screen that has a 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, 100 percent DCI-P3 color gamut, plus G-Sync, which should deliver the smoothest experience even if your framerate dips. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u8ZNx3elRaRztqbZyTWPlgJOUXg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22421558/m15r5inpost.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M15 R5 looks similar to the previous two generations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6X0UV"&gt;If you want to output to a separate display, the laptop’s HDMI 2.1 port means it can display up to 120 frames per second at 4K resolution if your monitor (or TV) supports it. This laptop also features an 2.5Gbps Ethernet port, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port, and a headphone jack. There’s no Thunderbolt port, but that Intel technology might find its way into an Intel-based version later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIr2w0"&gt;Dell says this is the first Alienware laptop to feature fast 3,200MHz DDR4 RAM, and it’s also user-configurable with two SO-DIMM slots. This is a move in the right direction, as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21459895/alienware-m15-r3-gaming-laptop-review-intel-rtx-nvidia-15-inch"&gt;M15 R3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/alienware-m15-r4-review"&gt;R4&lt;/a&gt; both had their RAM soldered onto the board, making it impossible to upgrade after you bought it. There are two M.2 slots inside so you can upgrade storage post-purchase, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oic6c0"&gt;The company says the laptop’s paint has been engineered for “increased stain-resistance and premium surface feel.” This model can be configured to feature Cherry’s Ultra-Low Profile mechanical switches. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22333684/alienware-m15-m17-gaming-laptops-cherry-mx-ultra-low-mechanical-keyboard-switches-price"&gt;Dell announced this keyboard collaboration for the M15 R4&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll be available as a $150 add-on for this new model, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s speckled G15 brings high-end AMD Ryzen processors to value-minded gamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dell G15 Ryzen Edition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IlncbVhgpTl5ELQw8owsn-rw1cs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088327/g15lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Budget-friendly gaming laptops are looking better than ever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WfNhlU"&gt;Alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22131848"&gt;Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition&lt;/a&gt;, Dell is also launching a more affordable 15-inch Dell G15 Ryzen Edition gaming laptop. It’s for people who still want to experience AMD’s fast Ryzen 5000 H-series processors, along with an Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics chip, but for less. If the M15 R5’s $2,229.99 starting price is too high, the G15’s $899.99 entry-level configuration might be a more reasonable price point for you to jump in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1czH6"&gt;The G15’s speckled design might look familiar to you. That’s because Dell actually launched the Intel-based version of this model already, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319292/dell-g15-gaming-laptop-2021-announced-china-paint-speckles-specs"&gt;but in China first&lt;/a&gt;. This new Ryzen-based laptop is landing first in China as well, on April 30th, followed by a May 4th release elsewhere around the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dw7cHg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s an Intel version, too, but it’s running last-gen chips&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRKvJz"&gt;The starting configuration of the G15 Ryzen Edition will be fairly barebones in terms of RAM and storage, shipping with 8GB of 3,200MHz DDR4 RAM, and 256GB of NVMe M.2 capacity. It packs plenty of power otherwise for a $900 laptop, with a Ryzen 5 5600H hexa-core processor and an Nvidia RTX 3060 with 6GB of VRAM. In case you want something more powerful, the CPU be tweaked up to the Ryzen 7 5800H octa-core CPU, RAM can be added (either through Dell or by opening the laptop yourself), and you can configure it with up to 2TB of solid-state storage. The more powerful processor can also come with a bigger six-cell 86Wh battery, though you’ll get a three-cell 56Wh pack at the $900 mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJfDip"&gt;At launch, the G15 can also be configured with a 120Hz refresh rate FHD panel at a fairly standard 250 nits of brightness, or a brighter 300-nit screen with a faster 165Hz refresh rate. Dell says a 360Hz refresh rate screen will be available later in the spring. Dell says the new G15 has adopted an “Alienware-inspired” thermal design to keep it running efficiently, and it certainly looks the part. It’ll come in at least two speckled colors at launch, a green and a grey. Later this year, an all-black model will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dell G15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eDa_LwrJ4rKWAvkVlxxAn-aydXM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422232/g15ryzenlede.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G15 takes some cues from Alienware’s M15 series of much pricier gaming laptops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dbdemy"&gt;This laptop ships by default with non-backlit, spill-resistant keyboard, but there are some upgrades you can make here. The first step up adds orange backlighting beneath the entire keyboard and emphasizes WASD. If orange doesn’t do it for you, there’s a four-zone RGB backlit keyboard that you can customize for a more colorful presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wb4zdQ"&gt;If the Ryzen Edition G15 is anything like last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt; in terms of performance, I’m excited to test it out. Assuming that it does, even the lower-end model should be reasonably powerful for people trying to stretch their dollar as far as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAhgPX"&gt;If you really want the Intel version, Dell says a variant of it will launch in the US on April 13th for $799.99, but it’ll feature a last-gen 10th Gen Intel processor. Dell included this bit of information practically as a footnote, to give you an idea of how much emphasis it’s putting behind Ryzen this time around. The starting model features a Core i5-10200H quad-core CPU with Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1650 graphics chip. Upgrading can net you the vastly more powerful Core i7-10870H octa-core CPU with the RTX 3060, and you can get Thunderbolt ports. Dell didn’t share the price for the high-end Intel model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s new gaming monitors support variable refresh rate for consoles, not just PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dell 34-inch gaming monitor" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OmjYOONQ7N0xGIb4UlnUe9msbPs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088306/dell34inchcurved.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dell’s new 34-inch curved screen is a behemoth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cpImm2"&gt;Dell has announced four gaming monitors, three of which are curved, that are releasing in the US between late May and late June. It unfortunately isn’t sharing prices for them yet, but the company says that all of them support AMD FreeSync Premium or Premium Pro, as well as variable refresh rate (VRR). VRR should make them as good of a fit for consoles like the Xbox Series X and PS5 (though the latter console hasn’t actually received its promised VRR update yet). This feature limits screen tearing as the frame rate adjusts due to hits or gains to performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cI02fV"&gt;Starting off big, the company has a new 34-inch ultrawide, curved gaming monitor (pictured above, model S3422DWG) that has a 1800R curve, which won’t envelop your peripheral vision as much as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;Samsung’s extra-curvy 1000R Odyssey G9 monitor&lt;/a&gt;. This model will release first in China on May 7th, then North America on May 27th, and finally on June 22nd in Asia-Pacific regions. It has a WQHD (3440 x 1440) resolution, VA display with a 144Hz refresh rate. Dell touts that it has DisplayHDR 400, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/12/16767160/vesa-displayhdr-specification-screen-monitor-hdr10-400-600-1000-standard"&gt;that’s not the spec you should be looking for to provide a bright, vibrant HDR image&lt;/a&gt;. This one supports 90 percent of the DCI-P3 color range.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dell 32-inch curved gaming monitor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HwMiNdw-HrNj675sCtsViYeyKUQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424421/dell32inchcurved.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the 32-inch curved screen Dell will release on June 22nd.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L61OJ2"&gt;Dell’s also making a 32-inch curved QHD gaming monitor (model S3222DGM) that has a VA panel with a 165Hz refresh rate and a 2ms response time. It’s making a 27-inch version (model S2722DGM) that has the same specs, except it’s actually slightly more curved at 1500R than the 1800R 32-inch model. These will both release in China on May 7th, and availability will open up globally on June 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dell gaming monitor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ltA_hAVt9aGP4TyeGJ47d0jJv8Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424427/dell25inchgamingmonitor.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dell’s 24.5-inch monitor seems like an awesome choice, but we don’t know the price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N1Fchk"&gt;It might look similar to the last image above, but the fourth monitor being announced today might especially appeal to people who have an Nvidia graphics card. It’s a non-curved 24.5-inch FHD gaming monitor (model S2522HG) with an IPS panel with G-Sync compatibility in addition to FreeSync Premium. It has a 240Hz refresh rate and a 1ms response time. This one will release in China on May 7th, and it’ll be available in other regions on May 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aU2OmM"&gt;As usual, each of Dell’s new monitors have have stands that offer a full range of motion, including height, pivot, swivel, and tilt adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="1F3Fm5"&gt;You may think you’re familiar with &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings, &lt;/em&gt;but nothing can quite prepare you for an adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s classic fantasy text made in the Soviet Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EARurJ"&gt;The made-for-TV film first aired on Leningrad Television in 1991 and was thought to be lost to time, as first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/05/soviet-tv-version-lord-of-the-rings-rediscovered-after-30-years"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But the station’s successor, 5TV, recently unearthed a copy from its archives, and uploaded the entire work to YouTube in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vquKyNdgH3s&amp;amp;ab_channel=%D0%9F%D1%8F%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B9%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLevCLNnLmg&amp;amp;ab_channel=%D0%9F%D1%8F%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B9%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F"&gt;parts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yhXZVZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Low budget special effects and Soviet mood music&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bZOBUu"&gt;With a running time of around 1 hour and 50 minutes, this adaptation focuses only on the first book of Tolkein’s trilogy, &lt;em&gt;The Fellowship of the Ring&lt;/em&gt;, and is a riot of low-budget special effects, bizarre camera work, and Soviet mood music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dch2c"&gt;Rather than the epic Hollywood fantasy captured so well by Peter Jackson, this adaptation feels like a weird fairy tale told by a pipe-smoking madman in the woods. In other words: it captures a completely legitimate aspect of &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, just not one we’re necessarily used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T62CET"&gt;If you’ve not got time to watch the whole thing, here are a few choice moments, as helpfully identified and time-stamped by YouTube user Chris Staecker in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vquKyNdgH3s&amp;amp;lc=Ugy0nG5qmlHawj74T2N4AaABAg"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLevCLNnLmg&amp;amp;lc=UgyBqlAITgmcRGCkKcJ4AaABAg"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="K4D1QX"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vquKyNdgH3s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opening sequence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Featuring music composed by Andrei Romanov of Russian rock group Akvarium, an incredibly bleary shot of the One Ring, and snippets of the Nazgûl riding through the snow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="mdInJL"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vquKyNdgH3s?t=439"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gandalf’s arrival at Bilbo’s birthday party and a fireworks display&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Look, when we said the special effects weren’t up to much, we meant it. Gandalf is missing his familiar staff and wizard’s hat, but otherwise looks perfectly wise and / or smug. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2sYHxAkPIPgDA9eqgBF9mTOz0p0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22426321/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_11.12.08_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="TvAt26"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vquKyNdgH3s?t=1272"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sméagol fights Déagol, claims the One Ring and turns into Gollum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;For the Soviet adaptation there’s none of that “slow transformation into a hideous shadow of his former self” for Sméagol. Nope: he puts on the ring and suddenly he’s mister green skin sneaky hands. And why exactly is the chorus going “rrrrrrr” over and over in the background? That, my friend, is a little thing called ambience. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fKj3q7zMgSgB9OC7o_DurHUYudk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22426322/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_11.14.22_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="U6EGjP"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vquKyNdgH3s?t=2127"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hobbits set out on their adventure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If this bit looks like behind the scenes footage from a 1990s theater troupe that’s because it is. Where did the sleigh come from? Why is that one hobbit arguing with a mouthful of food? Who gives a damn. Skip forward also to see them trapped in the Old Forest. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UHBQNZEbKSelrky6ENvU5JD27iI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22426324/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_11.19.15_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="TiZvcR"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vquKyNdgH3s?t=2509"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s old Tom Bombadil, that merry fellow!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Here he is: one of the oddest of Tolkien’s characters, a mysterious figure &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/mw9uKzy4GRs"&gt;who might be god&lt;/a&gt;, and who was left out of Peter Jackson’s adaptation for being extraneous to the plot. He can certainly be removed from the story without much damage but it’s still a joy to see him here with his wife Goldberry. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gDRtZ-GVJVlO-uk1gjM8COpG7ew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22426325/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_11.22.16_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="GBQXKO"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oLevCLNnLmg?t=700"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frodo meets Aragorn at The Prancing Pony&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As Staecker notes, the creators have, by this point, given up on trying to make the hobbits look smaller than the other characters. Soviet Aragorn has decidedly less sexy mystique than Viggo Mortensen, but really who doesn’t. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xkVJcpZhZXT02Skon2rqEU53Fc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22426327/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_11.26.45_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="bW4CAr"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oLevCLNnLmg?t=1586"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The council of Elrond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It feels more like a scene from one of Shakespeare’s history plays than the lush elegance of Jackson’s Rivendell but it does the job. Skip forward to see Saruman warn Gandalf of the coming &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oLevCLNnLmg?t=1960"&gt;orc army&lt;/a&gt;, beautifully rendered as little dudes in horned helmets swiping at nothing at the bottom of the screen.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OdHc_tAJln_g1J-4VEIukkzRifg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22426331/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_11.31.22_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Pztk7m"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oLevCLNnLmg?t=2061"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gandalf makes his escape with the help of the eagles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Could they have picked a less bug-eyed bird toy to depict the eagle? Maybe. But why don’t &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; go make an adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; with a budget of $50 and see if you can do any better. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZzUBy1nRy43LQuZ11s9LBu8ILbU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22426334/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_11.34.18_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="TDViC4"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oLevCLNnLmg?t=2510"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battling orcs in Moria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Orcs here are less monstrous creatures and more just “some dudes I guess.” What’s lacking in special effects is more than made up for with shaky camera work. Skip forward to see them traversing The Bridge of Khazad-dûm, and Gandalf is dead I guess?? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r2mkW-7dvBW2OjI-D0UlW47r7wE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22426336/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_11.36.07_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="yb01oh"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oLevCLNnLmg?t=2865"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter Galadriel and the magic ... of dance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;This is pretty much how I remember this scene from the books. Elves are immortal and live forever in weird enclaves. That means you’re basically a cult. The hobbits, meanwhile, are stunned by how good they are at dancing and then get drugged. Skip forward a few minutes and you can see Galadriel &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oLevCLNnLmg?t=3363"&gt;get tempted by the One Ring&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/583HagW_ywQBD-pHuRlm1AfJYnM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22426338/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_11.40.14_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="LRp11R"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oLevCLNnLmg?t=3527"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frodo breaks an apple in two with his hands!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;No, I know this scene is otherwise a bit boring and is mainly about Boromir getting weird and clingy but the apple thing is still cool. Have you ever tried to do this? It’s damn hard. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XhbiySGB_uwWzY2RWcjHv98bkIo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22426341/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_11.45.11_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="kx22nd"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oLevCLNnLmg?t=3749"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frodo and Sam are doing it for themselves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Everyone else is corrupted by power: only friendship remains! I absolutely love the ending here, particularly the music choice. This is really what &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings &lt;/em&gt;is about at heart: just guys being dudes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kCTjr6NcDTJBY_ojn7_1ajzoiW0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22426344/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_11.47.29_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YwGGtE"&gt;And that’s it! What’s really amazing to consider is that this adaptation also aired only a decade before the first of Peter Jackson’s blockbuster trilogy. If only the Soviet Union had survived a little longer we could have seen similar renditions of &lt;em&gt;The Two Towers&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Return of the King&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
