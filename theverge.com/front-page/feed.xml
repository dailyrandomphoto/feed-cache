    <title>As WandaVision arrives, Marvel Studios is about to enter a never-ending cycle </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Mi5NmqaOn9tBk2T9Z_MB7g8qeQ=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68666628/wandavision.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EqylzT"&gt;If Marvel Studios has its way, people will get a new entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe nearly every week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXGbvJ"&gt;Everything starts with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168373/wandavision-trailer-disney-plus-marvel-studios-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Marvel’s new nine-episode show, which follows Elizabeth Olsen’s Wanda Maximoff and Paul Bettany’s Vision living out an absurd suburban life in an alternate universe, kicks off on January 15th. Two episodes will premiere, with new episodes releasing every week for the rest of the season. Just two weeks after &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;ends, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591343/falcon-winter-soldier-premiere-date-disney-plus-sebastian-stan-anthony-mackie-august"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;arrive. It’s then three weeks until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591175/black-widow-theatrical-release-streaming-disney-plus-hbo-max"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;hits theaters&lt;/a&gt; (unless it’s delayed again) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168459/loki-trailer-marvel-studios-disney-plus-tom-hiddleston-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;lands on Disney Plus. By the time &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;ends, it’ll be time for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18264438/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-shang-chi-destin-daniel-cretton-direct-asian-led-film"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44uzF3"&gt;You get the picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMKpWx"&gt;Before Disney Plus launched, Marvel Studios solely worked on films. Television shows fell under Marvel Entertainment’s separate TV division. This includes the Netflix suite of series (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/18/18229507/jessica-jones-punisher-netflix-canceled-iron-fist-daredevil-luke-cage-defenders-disney"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), shows on Hulu (&lt;em&gt;The Runaways&lt;/em&gt;), and ABC titles like &lt;em&gt;Agent Carter &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D&lt;/em&gt;. It’s what kept the Marvel Cinematic Universe separate from everything else, even if those events were referenced. When Disney Plus came along, everything got shuffled. Disney needed new Marvel shows to bring in subscribers and keep them (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188706/the-mandalorian-season-2-episode-8-rescue-star-wars-grogu-skywalker-saga"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;did&lt;/a&gt;). Jeph Loeb, former head of Marvel TV, was effectively ousted as everything came under Marvel Studios chief and MCU architect Kevin Feige. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ParNOq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Having a new Marvel thing each week is either a blessing or a curse&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tZUKuu"&gt;Under Feige, the MCU is now expanding. The various shows and films will interweave with one another. &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;will feature characters from &lt;em&gt;Thor, Ant-Man, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt; and will connect somehow to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21059975/doctor-strange-scott-derrickson-multiverse-madness-disney-plus-marvel-loki-wandavision"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While former &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20956718/disney-plus-marvel-movies-series-wandavision-loki-doctor-strange-star-wars-avatar"&gt;Disney executives told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that viewers won’t need to watch every movie or show to keep up, the strategy is designed like comics — references made to events that happened elsewhere that fans may want to watch to understand the full context.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWiHzu"&gt;Depending on people’s opinions of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, having a new Marvel thing each week is either a blessing or a curse. The question is when does it tip into oversaturation? Some people may feel like we’ve hit that point. While studios and networks are making more movies and TV shows than ever before (including outside the superhero genre), few things dominate the box office and conversation like Disney properties, most notably Marvel and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. Ushering in a never-ending wave of Marvel TV series, on top of three or four films a year, could be what tips the world over into total franchise fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKLjEt"&gt;Except it likely won’t. Franchise fatigue is a popular phrase that gets thrown around, but it’s &lt;a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/franchisefatigue"&gt;ultimately flawed&lt;/a&gt;. Superhero movies remain some of the biggest box office successes that drive people to theaters at a time when US audiences are, on average, attending fewer movies a year. In China, Marvel movies remain some of the best performing films made by US studios, and the Chinese box office is the second largest box office demographic. This isn’t to imply that Marvel movies are the be all, end all of film (far from it), but mainstream audiences aren’t tired of them. Prior to &lt;em&gt;Infinity War &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, entries like &lt;em&gt;Black Panther &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel &lt;/em&gt;drove some of the MCU’s largest successes — and those were new characters within the MCU, not Captain America. The audience demand hasn’t disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgkB2v"&gt;Marvel Studios and Disney’s more pressing concern isn’t franchise fatigue — it’s trust. Think about &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. With the exception of &lt;em&gt;Solo&lt;/em&gt;, each &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; film released over the last five years has performed exceptionally well, but critical opinion of the films has soured. People argued &lt;em&gt;The Force Awakens &lt;/em&gt;is just a remake of &lt;em&gt;A New Hope&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Rise of Skywalker &lt;/em&gt;is consistently dunked on, &lt;em&gt;The Last Jedi &lt;/em&gt;sits at the center of its own ongoing debate, and &lt;em&gt;Solo &lt;/em&gt;feels like two movies mashed into one messy affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fuZDQp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Marvel Studios and Disney’s more pressing concern isn’t franchise fatigue — it’s trust&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qNDVJp"&gt;Productions were plagued by directors and writers being fired, with Disney rushing to get out a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; film a year, leaving little room for proper rewrites. Disney arguably lost the trust from fans over its ability to make consistently good &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; movies — or, as analyst and venture capitalist, Matthew Ball, &lt;a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/starwarsfatigue"&gt;says, it’s “accrued disappointment.”&lt;/a&gt; Disney tried to rush everything. It didn’t seem like there was a 10-year plan for &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. Marvel Studios’ greatest asset is that Feige was able to archetype what the universe should look like. It’s not exactly quality over quantity — they keep making more MCU movies every year — but quantity without losing the overarching story thread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAqPPs"&gt;Ironically,&lt;em&gt; Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; also points to how having more Marvel can still work. Like &lt;em&gt;Rogue One &lt;/em&gt;before it, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;succeeds because it’s familiar but stands on its own. It’s obviously &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, and there are enough references to key &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; figures and moments that diehard fans can dig into the nitty-gritty. It’s also new and unique enough, however, to not feel like a rushed entry in a universe that generates a ton of money for Disney. &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s creators, Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni, were given time to figure it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suJmMH"&gt;By all accounts, &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;is in the same boat. The characters are familiar, but the show is so different from anything within the MCU that it hopefully feels entirely refreshing. Keeping people’s trust and avoiding accrued disappointment is playing to streaming’s opportunity. Experimentation should be encouraged. If it works, the opportunity for success and ongoing profitability has no ceilings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHbRws"&gt;If it doesn’t, it’s more forgivable on a streaming service, where people are paying monthly for new content on top of their favorite films and TV shows. It’s not the same as &lt;a href="https://www.natoonline.org/data/ticket-price/"&gt;paying $10 or more&lt;/a&gt; for a movie ticket or tens of millions of dollars in losses for Disney. Reserve safe bets for big, splashy tentpole movies that more than return on the original investment and marketing campaign; experiment on Disney Plus where people are looking for &lt;em&gt;something &lt;/em&gt;to satiate their appetite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlZgKF"&gt;Streaming’s main pitfall is thinking because there’s a monthly demand from subscribers that speed is a priority. Consistency is, but consistency also means quality and originality — especially with properties like Marvel and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. The stakes are higher; there’s a precedent for great, a precedent for awful, and a hungry fan base that will only accept sub-par movies or TV for so long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apgs8n"&gt;The good news is that Marvel Studios just needs to keep doing what it’s already doing. Feige — an architect who designs Marvel storylines a decade in advance, figuring out how to make a giant universe feel tangible and new — is now in charge of ensuring that same level of attention gets applied to the Disney Plus world. We’re about to enter a period where there will constantly be a new piece of Marvel Studios content. It sounds exhausting — but it doesn’t have to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hVx64E"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pi0fYZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Bn4XmFudVtY8vHhBtRz_W8keJk=/0x2:3680x2455/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68666561/samsung-747.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mqso8u"&gt;Samsung will be presenting its latest flagship phone, the Galaxy S21, today at the streaming event titled Galaxy Unpacked 2021. The company is so confident that people will want the new device that it is inviting people to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202683/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-plus-s-pen-preorder-reserve"&gt;get in line to preorder&lt;/a&gt; before the phone is actually introduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fcqesv"&gt;Samsung hasn’t been shy about the specs of the upcoming S21. As reported by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Chaim Gartenberg and Sean Hollister, the company is widely expected to announce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202864/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-specs-leak"&gt;three new smartphones at the event&lt;/a&gt;, including a pair of matching S21 and S21 Plus phones (that are expected to be largely similar, except for size), and a higher-end S21 Ultra that will offer even better specs and cameras.  There should also be an optional stylus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIOW19"&gt;But wait, there’s more: there’s a good chance that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221020/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-smarttags-s21-ultra-pre-order-january-14th"&gt;Samsung will also use the event&lt;/a&gt; to launch the Galaxy Buds Pro, its new wireless headphones, and the Galaxy SmartTags, the company’s answer to the Tile tracking device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bRvUP"&gt;If you want to see this all yourself as it happens, here’s the when and where of it: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lu9iPJ"&gt;WHEN DOES SAMSUNG UNPACKED START?&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Philips Hue launches a long-awaited light switch module and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nFurApxsPpvPKJLk-ISkM5UfkcQ=/0x15:1200x815/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68666556/Philips_Hue_wall_switch_module_product_shot_dark_Kopie.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Philips Hue Wall Switch Module make the switch smart, not the bulb.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Philips Hue&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CwOyYY"&gt;Signify is introducing &lt;a href="https://www.signify.com/global/our-company/news/press-releases/2021/20210114-switch-up-your-smart-home-with-the-newest-philips-hue-outdoor-luminaires-and-accessories"&gt;three new Philips Hue products&lt;/a&gt; today: an in-wall Hue module for existing light switches, a new outdoor light bar, and a refined dimmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmwwGc"&gt;The Philips Hue Wall Switch Module solves a problem long suffered by Hue smart light owners. Namely, you install a so-called “smart” Hue bulb into a lamp or ceiling fixture and then marvel at your ability to control it from your phone until a roommate flips the wall switch and cuts power to the bulb, rendering your expensive lightbulb useless. The new Wall Switch Module — powered by a battery with at least a five year lifespan, according to Signify — puts the intelligence right inside of the wall to make the switch smart. Unfortunately, the Switch Module doesn’t make regular lights smart, it only controls Hue smart lights. The Hue Wall Switch Module will cost $39.95 / €39.95, or $69.95 / €69.95 for a two-pack when it launches in Europe this March, followed by North America in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GJCHCm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Coming soon: the wall switch module! Make any light switch smart by installing this little gadget behind the wall plate. Your smart lights stay reachable — and you can use the light switch to set your favorite light scenes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Europe: spring 2021 &lt;br&gt;North America: summer 2021 &lt;a href="https://t.co/197GqSye4c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/197GqSye4c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Philips Hue (@tweethue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tweethue/status/1349675902628737024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BjBBYi"&gt;All the details about the in-wall installation can be found at &lt;a href="https://hueblog.com/2021/01/14/the-most-important-answers-about-the-new-philips-hue-wall-switch-module/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hueblog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you’re interested in replacing your home’s light switches with Hue. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nBCCZFjDXwyzzvfPZ7q7XNoNMFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235085/Philips_Hue_wall_switch_module_explanation.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Philips Hue&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some installation and basic electrical knowledge is required. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rpifO9"&gt;The Philips Hue Amarant is a $169.99 / €149.99 light bar that can be installed outdoors to bathe the side of a house, hedgerow, or fence in multicolored light. Amarant measures 79.5-cm (31 inches) wide and maxes out at 1,400 lumens. It requires a Hue power supply unit which can be purchased separately. The Philips Hue Amarant is available now in Europe but won’t ship in North America until early March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2fvCQRWEsi4w3CQWQR9btS_jTA8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235027/Amarant_CityGarden_color.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Philips Hue&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two Amarants on a single power supply.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GifontWrskxx5_aieBfQ5p33qTg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235028/Philips_Hue_Amarant_product_shot_dark.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Philips Hue&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bathe an outdoor wall in light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hRDq6D"&gt;Lastly, there’s an upgrade to the magnetic Philips Hue dimmer switch with a detachable wall plate that lets your family and guests control Hue lighting without an app. Unlike the new in-wall module, the dimmer is a faux wall switch that adheres to any wall with tape. At least in Europe, the new dimmer reduces the list price slightly from the original, &lt;a href="https://hueblog.com/2021/01/14/no-surprise-new-dimmer-switch-from-philips-hue-is-coming-in-january/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Hueblog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while maintaining all the same functionality in a somewhat refined form. It’s available starting on January 26th in Europe for €19.99 before coming to North America on February 23rd for $24.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8qWViNKc8Wf2EqpvW8ZWRqse0RY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235029/New_Philips_Hue_dimmer_switch_lifestyle_shot_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Philips Hue&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The magnetic dimmer can be attached to the wall plate or detached for use as a remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PmTjZO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 14th, 9:08AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional details about the Wall Switch Module.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 10X running on a single-screen device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XcZBm4"&gt;After years of waiting, it looks like Microsoft now has a true answer to Chrome OS. A new and near-final version of Windows 10X has leaked, and it offers a first look at the changes Microsoft has made to the upcoming operating system to get it ready for laptops. Windows 10X first started off life as a variant of Windows 10 designed for dual-screen devices. It was supposed to launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20889000/microsoft-surface-neo-windows-10x-hands-on-features-price-photos-release-date"&gt;alongside Microsoft’s Surface Neo&lt;/a&gt;, a tablet-like device with two separate nine-inch displays that fold out to a full 13-inch workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqQPu7"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;revealed last year&lt;/a&gt; that Windows 10X is now being reworked for “single-screen” devices like laptops, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21214637/microsoft-surface-neo-windows-10x-release-date-delay"&gt;Surface Neo has been delayed&lt;/a&gt;. While the company has spent years differentiating Windows 10X for foldable and dual-screen hardware, it now looks and feels more like Chrome OS than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fbUHZtdDDA55ldazszxcoUojraU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235019/10xdesktop.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 10X out-of-box experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S8iQfc"&gt;The latest version that has leaked is a near-final form of what will ship on Chromebook-like devices later this year. Windows 10X isn’t an operating system you will upgrade to, or an update that will appear for existing machines. It will only ship on new hardware, and it’s a lightweight version of Windows designed for those who might be tempted to buy a Chromebook instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8K5SZ"&gt;Windows 10X &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132826/microsoft-windows-10x-features-dual-screen-foldable-hands-on-developers"&gt;already looked a little Chrome OS-like&lt;/a&gt; on dual-screen devices, but it’s even more apparent now that it’s designed for single-screen laptops instead. Microsoft has simplified almost every area of Windows inside Windows 10X, to the point where it feels like a portal to the web rather than a portal to Windows apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fulpCv"&gt;The Start button is now centered on the taskbar, with a Start menu that acts like a launcher. It doesn’t have the Live Tiles found on Windows 10; instead, it’s a list of apps and recent documents. You can also search for apps, documents, or even content on the web through Microsoft’s Bing search engine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-bn_Y_mCCrwPrBroA3ZIG9sn7-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235022/10xwindowing.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windowing apps in Windows 10X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F44Ltb"&gt;The comparisons to Chrome OS are immediately obvious here, with a launcher and the focus on web apps. You can even install Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) from the built-in Chromium Edge browser and pin them to the taskbar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ozkl0W"&gt;This Windows 10X taskbar is also an area of the OS that has been massively simplified. You might be used to seeing lots of system tray icons from apps, but these are nonexistent in Windows 10X. Instead, there’s a simple Action Center that displays the time and pops out to reveal quick settings like shutting a machine down, enabling a VPN, connecting displays, or managing the volume. This also includes access to notifications and an updated widget to control media playback.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y11yGrzfA0LcAlNJ7zr-_Fh2pNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235025/10xactioncenter.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Action Center in Windows 10X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AqFuCu"&gt;Windowing in Windows 10X has also been simplified compared to Windows 10. You can drag and drop apps to run them side by side, but there’s no way to allow apps to freely resize. As a result, the middle button you’re used to seeing in the top right-hand side of apps (which switches between full-screen and windowed modes) has been removed in 10X. You can simply minimize apps or close them here. Laptops that ship with Windows 10X will also have gesture trackpad support for multitasking apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4iBGYe"&gt;Microsoft has also been working on a modern version of File Explorer in Windows 10X. It’s primarily designed as a way to access OneDrive cloud files, but you can also manage downloaded files here or ones from USB storage. There’s no way to access local files in this new File Explorer, as 10X is primarily designed for cloud storage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EOUK41BN2cJ4MN0mfM6eRRFWtcQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235026/WhCqwih.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new File Explorer in Windows 10X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7F2cCW"&gt;It appears that Microsoft might not be shipping desktop app support in Windows 10X, at least initially. Microsoft has built a container technology to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132822/microsoft-windows-10x-emulator-dual-screen-os-testing-apps-compatibility-features"&gt;run traditional desktop apps in a lightweight virtual machine&lt;/a&gt;. This was originally designed to be used to ensure legacy apps worked properly with dual-screen devices and didn’t hit their battery life or interfere with how apps are displayed on multiple screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFETEN"&gt;Microsoft is still working on this container technology, and it appears as a developer-only mode in this latest version of 10X. That could mean end users won’t be able to install regular desktop apps on Windows 10X when it ships. Either way, it’s clear Microsoft is focusing on a combination of apps from the Microsoft Store here as well as web apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32Q2OF"&gt;In some ways Windows 10X feels like a preview of some of the UI and UX changes we’ll likely see in regular Windows 10 later this year. Microsoft is planning a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;,” which will include a modernized Start menu, File Explorer, and built-in apps that make the overall Windows 10 UI feel more consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcMcQz"&gt;Microsoft still hasn’t officially confirmed when Windows 10X will ship, or which laptop manufacturers will be launching devices with this OS variant. It’s clear this is a more direct attempt to challenge Chromebooks, after Microsoft has tried for years to awkwardly position &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/2/15506378/microsoft-windows-10-s-os-operating-system-announced-features"&gt;Windows 10S as an alternative&lt;/a&gt;. That project failed and turned into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/3/16968024/microsoft-windows-10-s-mode-editions-features"&gt;simple S Mode&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast, Windows 10X feels like a much bigger effort to recreate the simplicity of Chrome OS with the added benefit of Microsoft services and apps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW’s Digital Key Plus will let iPhones unlock the iX from a pocket or bag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aK_LSvSPVvGtpA6JaqPXSSuCvEI=/291x0:4071x2520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68666289/P90411221_highRes.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMW’s all-electric iX will be first to support the Digital Key Plus feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: BMW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZYx0y1"&gt;BMW has announced an upgraded version of its mobile car key technology dubbed &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0324128EN/bmw-announces-bmw-digital-key-plus-with-ultra-wideband-technology-coming-to-the-bmw-ix"&gt;Digital Key Plus&lt;/a&gt;. It promises to allow iPhone owners to unlock select BMW cars without having to take out their phones. The feature relies on ultra wideband (UWB) which has been included in Apple’s flagship iPhones since the iPhone 11 thanks to the U1 chip. Digital Key Plus will debut on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21558833/bmw-ix-inext-electric-suv-range-price-specs"&gt;all-electric BMW iX&lt;/a&gt; which launches later this year in Europe and next year in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xYGGm"&gt;The big benefit of Digital Key Plus, according to BMW, is that it uses UWB so it works with an iPhone that’s still in your pocket or bag. In contrast, the current Digital Key system used by Apple and BMW is NFC based, so you have to hold an iPhone (or Apple Watch) near the car’s tag to unlock it. BMW also emphasizes the security of its new UWB approach, noting that it’s resistant to relay attacks that might try and jam or intercept its signal and offers “the greatest possible security.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OXUmYC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;BMW claims ultra wideband offers “the greatest possible security”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YTWZPC"&gt;At present, only a limited number of iPhones include the U1 chip that offers UWB support. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20859550/apple-iphone-11-pro-airdrop-u1-locator-chip-tag-tile-bluetooth-tracking"&gt;debuted in the iPhone 11&lt;/a&gt; and was later included in the iPhone 12, but was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222731/apple-iphone-se-u1-locator-chip-wifi-6-express-cards"&gt;missing from the budget iPhone SE 2020&lt;/a&gt; that released early last year. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/15/21438497/apple-watch-series-6-u1-locator-ultra-wideband-location"&gt;U1 chip was also included&lt;/a&gt; on the Apple Watch Series 6, released last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFrQ8D"&gt;Apple built support for digital car keys into iOS with &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/apple_releases_ios_136_with_digital_car_keys_and_new_health_features-news-44287.php"&gt;version 13.6 last year&lt;/a&gt;, following its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299182/apple-carkey-ios-14-13-digital-key-unlock-car-iphone-wwdc-2020"&gt;announcement at WWDC 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/13/bmw-digital-key-plus-ultra-wideband/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that BMW is currently the only car manufacturer to use the technology, though &lt;a href="http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=58446"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Korea&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Hyundai has plans to adopt the feature later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwcCBT"&gt;There’s a push to make UWB a standard for digital keys. When it announced support for digital car keys in June last year, Apple said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299182/apple-carkey-ios-14-13-digital-key-unlock-car-iphone-wwdc-2020#dfYYdo:~:text=Apple%20says%20it%E2%80%99s%20working%20on%20an,instead%20of%20relying%20solely%20on%20NFC."&gt;working on an industry-wide standard&lt;/a&gt; that would use its U1 chip. In today’s announcement, BMW says it’s working with Apple and the Car Connectivity Consortium to build UWB support into version 3.0 of the Digital Key specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7WBK0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgrCUA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With the Samsung Galaxy S21, it’s time for Bixby to put up or shut up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FQ2xWZUtfBN8OSG41vsKCfp0NlQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68666219/vpavic_220317_1557_0163.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lkivyw"&gt;Today, Samsung will unveil the Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21 Plus, and Galaxy S21 Ultra (I’ll take the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227941/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-plus-brown-zune-unpacked-2021"&gt;Zune-inspired brown one&lt;/a&gt; thanks). It’s happening a couple months earlier than usual for the S line of phones, but otherwise the script will remain the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="StxdLf"&gt;Here’s the script. Samsung will be the first major Android maker out of the gate with Qualcomm’s newest chips, this time with the Snapdragon 888. Samsung will use its unseemingly immense marketing budget and longstanding carrier relationships to ensure it will be seen as the default option if you want a premium Android phone — &lt;em&gt;especially &lt;/em&gt;if you are making that purchase in a US carrier store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpXxp6"&gt;Other parts of the script are not necessarily guaranteed but are safe bets. They will probably be excellent phones, well-balanced and capable. Samsung will make big camera claims that will require rigorous testing to verify. And of course the ever-swinging pendulum of Samsung’s OneUI software will continue its current arc towards being overloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="h9Nrsj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9028921"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sLXQPb"&gt;That last part of the script has me thinking about one of the major recurring characters in it: Bixby. Samsung’s digital assistant launched in 2017 with the Galaxy S8. It was yet another digital assistant, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15094720/samsung-galaxy-s8-design-safety-vs-note-7-battery-explosion"&gt;as Dan Seifert wrote at the time&lt;/a&gt; it had a very clear and very good remit that helped to distinguish it from Alexa, Siri, and Google. Samsung wasn’t trying to turn Bixby into a general-purpose, know-and-do-everything assistant. It had &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NkAcum"&gt;Samsung knows it can’t compete with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others when it comes to raw machine learning power and putting vast amounts of information at your fingertips, so it’s using Bixby to solve a simpler task, one that those companies have largely ignored. Bixby isn’t going to try to be the everything-assistant. Instead, it will be that “bright sidekick” that complements those other services. It’s a new user interface, not a new way to ask how tall the Eiffel Tower is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ1AqL"&gt;Bixby was to be an interface, not an assistant. Was that really a viable strategy? Who knows! Certainly not Samsung, which very quickly did what Samsung tends to do with software: give in to feature creep. Over the last few years, Bixby has turned into the thing it originally was designed &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to be: a worse version of the Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZvqmB"&gt;Samsung tried to push Bixby. It created a dedicated button for it. It later dropped that button but assigned it to a long press of the power button. It built out Bixby routines (which was related to Bixby’s original purpose). But then it associated Bixby with a chum-feed of content that lived left-of-homescreen. And it announced independent smart Bixby speakers that never really shipped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nXt6F"&gt;On The Vergecast we have a running joke that &lt;a href="https://bixbyshoes.tumblr.com/"&gt;Bixby is a dog that wears shoes and is also a butler&lt;/a&gt;. It’s well-meaning and eager to please, but ultimately stumbles around a lot and doesn’t do a very good job serving drinks or answering the door because &lt;a href="https://bixbyshoes.tumblr.com/post/171592540108"&gt;it is a dog, wearing shoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZUPu2j"&gt;
&lt;div class="tumblr-post" data-href="https://embed.tumblr.com/embed/post/3negucxstVdHs6YbOvHoDA/171592540108" data-did="da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bixbyshoes.tumblr.com/post/171592540108"&gt;https://bixbyshoes.tumblr.com/post/171592540108&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://assets.tumblr.com/post.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ncO1cS"&gt;Speaking of shoes, put yourself in Samsung’s. Why does it continue to develop Bixby? I can only think of two reasons, one good and one bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGopDR"&gt;The good reason: a hedge against Google and Android. It’s always possible Google might do something egregious and Samsung would want to bail and do without Google’s services (or even Android itself). It’s not a terrible idea to have your own digital assistant percolating just in case. If nothing else, it might serve as a signal to Google that Samsung is, in fact, willing to just walk away and do Tizen and Bixby in certain negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXQj4X"&gt;That’s the good reason — or at least as close to a good reason as I can come up with — but I don’t know if it’s the real reason. I suspect the real reason is one and the same as the bad reason: Samsung is &lt;em&gt;still, &lt;/em&gt;after all these years and after all its successes, trying to be Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJR5nc"&gt;Being Apple is shorthand for having an end-to-end ecosystem where your users live and breathe your services and are thereby locked into your products. If you’re going to have an holistic, all-encompassing ecosystem you need to cover all the bases, and so: Bixby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlKK64"&gt;And also: your own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215172/samsung-neo-qled-4k-8k-tv-announced-specs-ces-2021"&gt;fitness service&lt;/a&gt;. And your own health app and ecosystem of connections. Your own family of Bluetooth headphones. Your own tracker tag (before Apple even announces its tracker tag). Your own tablets. Your own music service. Your own news service. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INAaIx"&gt;All of these are things that Samsung has either tried or is actively trying to do now. Some of them are really successful! Samsung’s Galaxy Buds line will today consist of three different variants of earbuds, each with its own clear reason for being and each quite good (presuming the new Galaxy Buds Pro don’t whiff). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJW7R5"&gt;Samsung has always had aspirations to build up a whole world (or, er, Galaxy) for its users to live in, just like Apple. What’s frustrating is that Samsung is very good at so many things and if it would just lean a little more into those things, it could chart a more innovative and interesting path. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmGeha"&gt;Take Samsung DeX, for just one example. It’s the thing that allows you to connect your phone to a bigger screen like a TV or a monitor and get a full desktop interface. It’s genuinely cool but, I suspect, more of a tech demo than an oft-used feature. But the Snapdragon 888 that will be in these S21 phones will in many ways be just as powerful as the chips that are going to be running Arm-based Windows laptops this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8A0qP"&gt;There’s untapped potential with DeX that Apple couldn’t match for years if Samsung could figure it out. Instead, it’s putting effort into getting Tile-esque tracking tags out the door before Apple can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONvSxX"&gt;If Samsung would focus a little more on where it’s already ahead and a little less on where it’s woefully behind, it would make much more exciting products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxuQXt"&gt;That’s why I’m calling it: I’ve had it with Bixby. If Samsung can’t either bring it up to snuff with Siri (a low bar!) or find a way to bring it back to its more focused roots, it’s time to send it to the farm. Or at least give users the option to remap the power button to the Google Assistant (without needing third-party hacks). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Urm3Xz"&gt;There is a tiny glimmer of hope. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8aD3a6gHZeQ?t=63"&gt;Jimmy is Promo’s leak&lt;/a&gt; of the new version of Samsung’s OneUI version of Android shows that users will be able to choose between the Google feed or Samsung Free feed on their home screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUEQVH"&gt;Samsung’s user interface on top of Android has swung like a pendulum between two poles. It becomes overloaded with features and weird UI for a few years, then the pendulum hovers there at the end of its arc before swinging back to a cleaner, simpler UI. It’s time for the pendulum to swing back. And that means it’s time to let Bixby go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EIFHf5"&gt;The last of CES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1256224424"&gt;Are all of these technically CES announcements or are some of them merely CES-adjacent? When CES is all virtual is it an event where things happen or merely a mood, a state of mind? Am I using jokes about philosophical quandaries as a smoke screen to cover up my inability to determine whether or not these things technically are a part of CES or not?&lt;/p&gt;

You really do need a dark room for it to be any good, but you’d be surprised how much more convenient it is to just plug an HDMI cable into the projector you’ve got than it is dealing with whatever TV might be at the hotel or Airbnb. I might be interested in switching to this, as the Nebula’s version of Android TV is old, buggy, and poorly supported.&lt;/p&gt;

These laptops will use the third generation of Nvidia’s Max-Q design, which is engineered for thin gaming and content laptops. The new GPUs also include a new Dynamic Boost 2.0 technology that leverages AI to balance power between CPU, GPU, and GPU memory in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Samsung Display promises thinner laptop bezels with unproven under-screen webcams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZwyVrQo9wzMU5iT19i6XYToNWlw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68666096/msedge_rwEweZw7ip.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The technology makes for smaller bezels, without having to relocate the laptop’s webcam.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://weibointl.api.weibo.com/share/195887625.html" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Display&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mUHESj"&gt;Samsung Display has released a teaser for its under-screen camera technology meant for laptops, dubbed “Samsung Blade Bezel,” &lt;a href="http://weibointl.api.weibo.com/share/195887625.html"&gt;on its Weibo page&lt;/a&gt;. It promises that its “UPC” (Under Panel Camera) tech can make a laptop’s bezels smaller without having to relocate its webcam, while also making the OLED display itself be both thinner and lighter. There’s no mention of the impact of the technology on the webcam’s image quality, however, which has become increasingly important in the age of social distancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvmR21"&gt;We saw the first smartphone with an under-display selfie camera release commercially last year. However, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;ZTE Axon 20 5G’s&lt;/a&gt; implementation of the feature simply wasn’t very good. The quality of its selfie camera photos was poor, and the portion of the display that covered the camera suffered from much lower resolution than the rest of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTQogr"&gt;This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about Samsung Display’s under-panel camera plans. Previously, however, attention has focused on its use in smartphones, where manufacturers have obsessed over reducing bezel size in recent years. Back in 2018, Samsung Display mentioned under-display camera technology &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-display-under-display-camera/"&gt;during a presentation&lt;/a&gt; about the future of phone design, and the following year an executive said the technology could be ready for use in smartphones “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265265/samsung-all-display-phone-under-screen-selfie-camera-no-cutout"&gt;in the next 1-2 years.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sKrJBr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Wow ⊙∀⊙! Samsung Display reveals its under-Display camera technology for the first time, which will be used for OLED notebook screens first &lt;a href="https://t.co/Fu4Ublvsru"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Fu4Ublvsru&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ice universe (@UniverseIce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1349591727854682112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Cbicw"&gt;Now, it seems, the technology is also headed to laptops, where it could allow for smaller bezels without having to relocate the webcam to below the screen. That’s the approach taken by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17396818/huawei-matebook-x-pro-laptop-review-specs-price"&gt;Huawei’s MateBook X Pro&lt;/a&gt; which has small screen bezels thanks to a webcam that’s built into its keyboard. Unfortunately, this placement means the webcam is directed at you from a very low angle, when ideally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21202907/zoom-tips-video-call-lighting-audio-look-your-best"&gt;you want it to be positioned at eye-level&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; has a small bezel that’s still big enough for a webcam, but the camera’s quality isn’t great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCgcpl"&gt;While the technology could make for better-looking laptops, it’s unlikely to do much for the image quality of built-in webcams themselves which continue to suffer from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daqPLDDAntA"&gt;stubbornly low-quality&lt;/a&gt; despite their sudden importance &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22173744/webcam-gadget-of-the-year-2020"&gt;in the age of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, laptops with better webcams, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20932406/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-13-5-inch-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;Surface Laptop 3&lt;/a&gt;, tend to have larger bezels needed to house beefier imaging components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BwAfiP"&gt;Samsung Display provides panels to a variety of different manufacturers. That means we could see Samsung Blade Bezel technology appear in laptops across the industry, rather than being confined to Samsung’s own devices. Today’s teaser doesn’t mention when the first laptop with the technology could release, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaeCLU"&gt;As for when an under-display camera could appear in Samsung’s smartphones, a recent &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=8012"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;suggested that it might make its debut in the company’s third-generation Fold.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Oculus Quest is getting multi-user support soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LB63rmJnH3-_dNuYqomdQTdw0n8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68666018/akrales_200904_4160_0390.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RZggSU"&gt;Oculus Quest headsets will soon support multiple users, Facebook has &lt;a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/multi-user-accounts-and-app-sharing-coming-soon/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;. The functionality will allow Quest owners to set secondary accounts on their headsets, which will allow other people to log in and access content shared by the primary user while maintaining separate save data and achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YRqzWp"&gt;The primary account holder will be able to add three secondary accounts and share apps on a single device, though Facebook says you’ll later be able to share purchases across three headsets; the company may also adjust these parameters based on feedback. Apps will be automatically opted-in to the sharing functionality, but developers can opt out before February 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jRkpbU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Facebook’s ‘one identity’ rule has to change for&amp;amp;nbsp;VR","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22221251/facebook-reality-labs-boz-andrew-bosworth-interview-privacy-moderation-horizon-ar-vr"},{"title":"Oculus Quest 2 review: better, cheaper VR","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="S7Y4Kj"&gt;The Quest 2’s Facebook account requirement has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375118/oculus-facebook-account-login-data-privacy-controversy-developers-competition"&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt;, and unsurprisingly nothing changes here — secondary account users will have to log in with a Facebook account of their own. For households that already have multiple Quest users, though, the features should make life easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vn2e2q"&gt;Facebook says the functionality will come to the Quest 2 next month in experimental form, meaning you can switch it on with a toggle in the settings menu before it gets released to all Quest headsets, including the original model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Nintendo World opening delayed due to Osaka state of emergency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9teXrkJIcY62hIDrM7vxlf2Gnao=/0x0:2756x1837/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68665821/image.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mrvm20"&gt;Universal Studios Japan has &lt;a href="https://www.usj.co.jp/company/news/2021/0114.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Super Nintendo World will not be opening next month as planned. The Nintendo-themed zone of the Osaka park was supposed to open on February 4th after its launch was delayed from last year, but with Osaka being placed under a state of emergency declaration yesterday until at least February 7th, that’s no longer going to happen. USJ says it will announce a new opening date once the state of emergency has been lifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdrjCh"&gt;The state of emergency in Japan was initially issued for Tokyo and its surrounding areas, but yesterday the order was expanded to cover a total of 11 prefectures, Osaka included. The countermeasures aren’t particularly strong compared to COVID-19 lockdown restrictions elsewhere — people are discouraged from making non-essential trips outside, and establishments like restaurants and movie theaters are asked to close earlier in the evening — but it obviously still is not the ideal time to open a theme park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exjDr0"&gt;Super Nintendo World is an important project for Nintendo, representing the most ambitious attempt yet to expand its IP into new business opportunities. The park was initially set to open in time for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, which themselves remain in serious doubt. When it does eventually open, it’ll feature attractions like an AR-powered &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt; rollercoaster.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is working on a fix for Pixel 4A 5G touchscreen woes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="You probably don’t need 5G yet, but the Google Pixel 4A 5G has other strong benefits." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WA4VgG46-A0OT6SNdczAkoyuvQA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68665252/akrales_201013_4137_0289.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Pixel 4a 5G’s 6.2-inch touchscreen has been acting up for some users. | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TUco78"&gt;Google says it’s aware of a problem with Pixel 4A 5G touchscreens and is working on a fix. Some devices are failing to respond consistently to taps on the lower part of the screen, which is particularly impacting folks who have opted for three-button navigation rather than swipes. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/12/pixel-4a-5g-touchscreen-issue-can-make-navigation-buttons-hard-to-use/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; spotted complaints&lt;/a&gt; from 4A 5G owners experiencing the issue, which seems to have cropped up after the December security patch was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrWHuU"&gt;Google’s response comes courtesy of &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/87628791?hl=en"&gt;a Pixel support forum post&lt;/a&gt;. The company says it will address the problem ”in an upcoming software update”, but it’s looking like that will be at least a couple more weeks away since &lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;reports January’s security patch didn’t address it. In the meantime, Google advises users to work around the issue with some specific instructions on tapping navigation controls: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="oR34Vr"&gt;1. When tapping icons on the edge of the screen, tap the center of the button or the side of the button/icon furthest away from the edge of the display.&lt;br&gt;2. When tapping icons, including the navigation buttons on the bottom of your screen, use the tip of your finger or thumb instead. This will help improve touch recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SjP3BP"&gt;It’s not an easy task to try and consciously change the way you do something like tap a button on your phone screen, so hopefully Pixel 4A 5G users will only have to attempt these awkward workarounds for a little while longer.&lt;/p&gt;

So while the touchscreen issue persists, at least an audio bug that was causing crackling sounds in some situations is no longer a problem. &lt;/p&gt;
