    <title>Pokémon Go creator Niantic is making a Transformers game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Np5Aslv9jpJ9fKBHo3dHAiEPf84=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448765/hm_bumblebee_concept_updated.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1wPQlY"&gt;Niantic is expanding from cute critters to giant robots. Today, the game developer announced its next project: a location-based augmented reality game called &lt;em&gt;Transformers: Heavy Metal&lt;/em&gt;. The game is expected to launch globally this year, with a soft launch in select countries “soon.” Niantic says that it has partnered with Seattle-based studio Very Very Spaceship, which will be leading development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsnYit"&gt;You might be wondering just how towering transforming robots will translate to &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;-style gameplay. Here’s the basic description from Niantic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9kbMBM"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Transformers: Heavy Metal&lt;/em&gt;, players will join the Guardian Network, a group of humans who have banded together with the Autobots in a war against the Decepticons. As a Guardian, players will uncover hidden regions across Earth to find resources and battle Decepticons in turn-based battles, either solo or with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Transformers: Heavy Metal." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kt6P60FAKe-8ou3-OLLE8XfFwr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652460/hm_screenshot_map.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Transformers: Heavy Metal." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QAhnOt493SyWNNswtSnHw76nImI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652459/hm_screenshot_battle.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P81dnE"&gt;While Niantic is best-known for the ongoing success of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, the company has also expanded by attempting to bring other fictional realms to video games. The first was the Harry Potter universe, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18716146/harry-potter-wizards-unite-pokemon-go-review-ar-augmented-reality-game-foundable"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;Wizards Unite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345472/niantic-nintendo-pikmin-partnership-collaboration-ar-mobile-game"&gt;the developer announced a partnership with Nintendo that will include a &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Future Apple Watches could feature blood glucose and body temperature sensors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O11u__BAkZGSWvl4aWbYjdFqGL4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448696/vpavic_200929_4216_0121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 6, released last year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h8ahct"&gt;This year’s Apple Watch could feature an improved screen and updated ultra-wideband support, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, but more substantial improvements like temperature and blood glucose monitoring will not appear until later models. The company is also reportedly planning a successor to last year’s more affordable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a new extreme sports-focused model, due for release in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBxl32"&gt;The improvements coming to this year’s model, which will almost certainly be called the Series 7, appear to be small. Its display bezels are said to be thinner, and a new lamination  technique could reduce the distance between the display and the front cover. The watch’s ultra-wideband support could also be improved after getting its Apple wearable debut in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/15/21438497/apple-watch-series-6-u1-locator-ultra-wideband-location"&gt;last year’s Series 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NyDWvI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An extreme sports-focused model may not launch until next year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JTZ00W"&gt;But the years ahead could bring more substantial improvements for Apple’s wearable. Top of the list is a new blood glucose monitoring feature, which could automatically log blood-sugar levels for diabetics without them needing to prick a finger to draw blood. There’s also reportedly a new body temperature monitoring feature on the way, which has reportedly seen a surge in interest due to the pandemic. The temperature sensor could appear in the watch’s 2022 refresh, while blood glucose monitoring is several years away, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyFkFe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22351979/apple-watch-rugged-extreme-sports-rumor-bloomberg"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple was internally discussing releasing a rugged smartwatch aimed at extreme sports users. It now reports this model, internally referred to as an “explorer” or “adventure” edition, is unlikely to release this year, and could arrive in 2022. However &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;cautions that this, like all of Apple’s unannounced plans, are subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fm1j72"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s premium G1 OLED now comes with a 5-year warranty in the US and UK</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pU-sbNp7Kjiwl0jQpwSNgkvLaK4=/4x0:1597x1062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448531/large01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG is now offering a 5-year warranty for its G1 OLED.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bu8FhG"&gt;LG is offering an extended 5-year warranty on its 4K G1 OLED in the US, covering any problems that develop with its panel after the standard one-year warranty. In the UK &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fuk%2Foled-tvs%2F2021%2Foled-warranty&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F14%2F22532894%2Flg-5-year-warranty-g1-oled-z1-4k-8k-usa-panel-failure-burn-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company says&lt;/a&gt; the extended warranty also applies to its Z1 8K OLED. It’s unclear in how many other countries LG is offering the extended warranty, and the company did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6jAqo"&gt;The extended warranty appears to be an attempt to upsell customers from LG’s popular lower-end sets like the C1 to its more premium G1 model. But it should also allay any fears that the new brighter Evo OLED panel LG is using in the G1 won’t last as long as its previous OLED panels. Or, as LG said in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/lg-oled-tvs-now-come-with-a-five-year-warranty-but-not-all-of-them"&gt;given to &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “The warranty is designed to offer peace of mind to customers purchasing our flagship, more expensive OLED models.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6LwlxJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LG’s cheaper C1 OLED is not included&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="faT6Yg"&gt;Of course, the big question is whether the extended warranty covers permanent image retention, aka “burn-in,” where parts of an image can remain visible after being displayed for an extended period. In response to &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-extends-2021-g1-oled-warranty-five-years-175840084.html?src=rss_b2c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;’s question&lt;/a&gt; about this, LG gave this evasive response: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="T8dkWo"&gt;“LG’s five-year limited warranty program is in line with the company’s consistent communication regarding the low risk of image retention on LG OLED TVs, when used in normal viewing conditions… As with any self-emitting display, OLED TVs may experience temporary image retention under certain conditions, but permanent image retention, or burn-in, is rare under normal viewing conditions. Image retention is not a product defect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bLHUhU"&gt;The implication seems to be that temporary image retention is normal and is nothing to worry about, but all LG will say about permanent image retention is that it’s “rare.” Meanwhile, in a statement given &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b09oXig-4wk"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;HDTVTest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the company said the warranty covers “any image issues,” so long as the display is being used normally, and not in a commercial setting where static images might be left onscreen for far longer (the famous example of this is a &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/lg-switches-airport-oled-to-lcd-amid-burn-in-row/"&gt;South Korean airport&lt;/a&gt; which had to swap out the OLED TVs it was using to show departure times). We’ve contacted LG to try and get a simple yes or no answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik4d7v"&gt;Like other warranties, LG’s also comes with various exceptions, such as damage caused by power surges, acts of nature, or improper installation. But LG’s warranty should still provide some assurance that you’ll get a decent few years of use if you splash out on one of its more expensive TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ml1IBI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwFSZD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Workspace and Google Chat are officially available to everybody</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Spaces" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rtFVBU9LrXneTbHJCVe24eCBXmU=/120x0:3720x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448465/Spaces_static_image___Fam_Reunion.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n1st3n"&gt;Google is announcing some changes to its Workspace suite of apps and services today, including availability for anybody who has a Google account. Google says that there are over three billion users of its Workspace apps — though it’s probably a safe bet that Gmail accounts for a healthy chunk of that userbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oeUWT"&gt;A lot of people will soon have the option to switch over to Google’s more modern system for Gmail, Docs, and Chat. All of them can be integrated in a single tab more easily, for example with chats sliding over to the left to reveal a shared spreadsheet. It’s also related to the company’s new “smart canvas” push, which is also designed to interlink its various apps via “smart chips.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYHrm5"&gt;To get started, Google is now officially offering the setting to turn on Google Chat to all users. It’s a new &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/9341104"&gt;setting within Gmail&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9O0d1"&gt;With the switch, Google Chat messaging should be an option for all now, which can include direct messages and chat Rooms. But Google is also introducing a new terminology to go along with the announcement. It is announcing the “evolution of Rooms in Google Chat to Spaces.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aK5iBL"&gt;A Space is essentially the same thing as a chat Room, but Google wants to separate them out into their own top-level form of communication next to Gmail, Chat, and Meet. Google is layering on a few new features like improved message threading, more emoji reactions, user roles, moderation tools, and “discoverable” spaces. In that sense, it seems that Spaces wants to serve both as a Slack competitor and as a competitor for public Discord groups and, well, maybe as an optional replacement for email groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmv8yP"&gt;It’s a little confusing — but that’s par for the course for Google’s messaging strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Spaces" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/alXb9CFIhX8gZDgkgIR-zD0gkSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22656698/Spaces_static_image___Fam_Reunion.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Google Spaces&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hT9DIK"&gt;The key idea, according to Sanaz Ahari, senior director of product, is that users can more easily switch between “modalities” of communication. The intent is to “keep the context,” Ahari says. “If you start something with an email and then you want to upgrade it into more real-time interaction between a group — or even for a project — you’re able to do that and you can keep the context. Then you can all seamlessly upgrade into a meeting at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpDFhJ"&gt;Google is promising it will “launch a streamlined and flexible user interface” for Spaces this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbX1x9"&gt;Those aren’t the only announcements getting bundled into today’s Workspace news. The company is launching a new tier called “Google Workspace Individual” at $9.99 per month, which gives users more Workspace tools without requiring them to set up their own domain or custom email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82XYBg"&gt;When Workspace users say yes to a meeting, they will be able to indicate whether they’ll be attending remotely or in the reserved meeting room. Google also provided a date for the Companion Mode feature, which encourages people in the meeting room to also turn on their cameras so that remote workers don’t feel quite as left out — it should be coming in September to desktop and “soon” to mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ECXaW"&gt;Google also snuck in an announcement that it will &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; offer a progressive web app for Google Workspace in September. In theory, it could make it much easier for Gmail users to have their email and other Google apps feel more like actual desktop apps and not just tabs in the browser. That’s possible now via various Electron apps and Single Site Browser windows, but it requires more work than it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOgC9E"&gt;Finally, Google is adding enterprise options that are going to be necessary if it really wants to have a shot at going after larger companies. Corporations will be able to use their own client-side encryption for data, add more “trust rules” for various Drive files to simplify access and permissions, and label files based on their sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4R80y"&gt;Google Workspace has been rapidly updating and iterating over the past few months, a sign perhaps that the company really does intend to seriously compete with Microsoft. Google’s strategy goes beyond just improving its products — it’s more tightly integrating them together. Gmail users will soon find more prompts than ever to bring them into Google’s other Workspace products — and some no doubt will be looking for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21265533/google-meet-gmail-hide-video-call-email-shortcut"&gt;ways to avoid all that&lt;/a&gt;. Putting buttons for Chat, Meet, and Rooms (soon to be Spaces) at the bottom of the most popular email app in the world is sure to raise usage — and potentially some antitrust eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nNJa6"&gt;The biggest question mark is whether Google can coherently explain the switchover to Chat, why it’s worth it, and what this new Spaces thing really is. Now that Workspace is going to be available to over three billion regular people, the company is going to need to work hard to clearly communicate with all of them.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s game streaming service Luna is opening access to all Prime members June 21 and 22</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jqBmj6HQn-51xq9r_A8BWaQDca8=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448422/_DSC6805_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VpEjfk"&gt;Amazon is opening up access to its game streaming service Luna &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=23494951011"&gt;to all Amazon Prime members on June 21 and 22&lt;/a&gt; (Amazon Prime Day). Previously, to test out Luna you had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21451371/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-service-twitch-alexa-controller"&gt;request access or sign up&lt;/a&gt; from supported Fire TV devices. But for this limited-time only, any Prime subscribers in the mainland US will be able to start a 7-day trial of Luna right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWQTsE"&gt;Luna is available on Windows PC, Mac, Fire TV, and via the web on iPhone, iPad, and “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22177222/amazon-luna-android-cloud-gaming-google-pixel-samsung-oneplus"&gt;select Android phones&lt;/a&gt;.” Regular pricing is $5.99 a month for access to games including &lt;em&gt;Control, GRID&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;. Or, once you’ve got a Luna account, you can pay $14.99 a month for the Ubisoft Plus beta channel. This gets you access to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=21494096011"&gt;big range of Ubisoft games&lt;/a&gt;, including the latest titles from the &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed, FarCry, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Watch Dogs &lt;/em&gt;franchises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="d5l15l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hands-on with Amazon’s Luna game streaming service","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525339/amazon-luna-hands-on-cloud-gaming-streaming-early-access-price-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mmlwvU"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/14/amazon-luna-invite-free-prime-day/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon is also discounting its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Luna-Controller/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated Luna controller&lt;/a&gt; by 30 percent from June 14 to June 22, and knocking $40 off a bundle package including the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Bundle-including-Stick-Controller/dp/B095ZMSY1N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Luna controller and Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rICZw1"&gt;If you’re a Prime member and have been curious to see how Luna stacks up against Microsoft’s xCloud or Google Stadia, this is a good opportunity to check it out. Modify your expectations, though. In our early preview of Luna in October last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525339/amazon-luna-hands-on-cloud-gaming-streaming-early-access-price-games"&gt;we found that the service was very hit and miss&lt;/a&gt;: games load fast, but the library of available titles is small and internet speeds of at least 25Mbps are necessary for smooth play.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google to work with UK regulators on its big ad-tracking shakeup</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jzx9Qx"&gt;The UK’s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), will collaborate with Google as it attempts to rework online ad targeting, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-to-have-key-oversight-role-over-google-s-planned-removal-of-third-party-cookies"&gt;the regulator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/our-commitments-privacy-sandbox/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have announced. It comes as Google is attempting to phase out the use of third-party cookies for tracking and targeting users with ads and instead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;use a new set of technologies&lt;/a&gt; it’s calling Privacy Sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ch5sIJ"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/our-commitments-privacy-sandbox/"&gt;its announcement&lt;/a&gt;, Google said this is the first time regulators and technology companies have worked together on new technologies like this. As well as the CMA, the UK’s data protection regulator (the Information Commissioner’s Office, or ICO) will also be involved. “The CMA is taking a leading role in setting out how we can work with the most powerful tech firms to shape their behaviour and protect competition to the benefit of consumers,” the CMA’s chief executive Andrea Coscelli, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7lK3Ds"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The CMA is taking a leading role in setting out how we can work with the most powerful tech firms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MABbEV"&gt;The collaboration comes in response to the CMA’s &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-to-investigate-google-s-privacy-sandbox-browser-changes"&gt;announcement in January&lt;/a&gt; that it would be formally investigating Google’s proposals, which involve using AI to bundle users together into anonymised groups to target them with ads (you can read more about the proposals &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Google’s new approach is intended as a more privacy-orientated alternative to tracking cookies, which the company intends to phase out of its Chrome browser &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox"&gt;over the next year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZrPUQ"&gt;However, concerns have been raised that Google’s Privacy Sandbox could harm competition, and concentrate yet more power in the hands of the search giant. There have also been concerns raised about whether the proposals are compatible with Europe’s tough &lt;a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/platforms/google-will-not-run-floc-origin-tests-in-europe-due-to-gdpr-concerns/"&gt;GDPR data protection regulation&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the plans are also facing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333848/google-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-complaint-chrome-privacy"&gt;antitrust scrutiny in the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYD7Jx"&gt;Google has made a series of commitments to the UK regulator about how it will develop and implement the changes. It says it will develop the plans transparently, in a way that doesn’t give itself an unfair advantage, or discriminate against its rivals. It’s also making a commitment to not combine user data from Chrome browsing histories or Google Analytics with its ad products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGXePG"&gt;For its part, the CMA says these commitments address its concerns, but it’s opening up a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-proposed-commitments-in-respect-of-googles-privacy-sandbox-browser-changes"&gt;public consultation&lt;/a&gt; to help it decide whether to accept them. If accepted, the commitments would become legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung says it hasn’t decided whether to halt Galaxy S21 FE production</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UKx6rJfWPBvv-CF_SNEt38S-44U=/0x0:970x647/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448284/s21fe.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An alleged render of the Galaxy S21 FE. | OnLeaks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NIbrGO"&gt;Samsung has downplayed a report that claimed the company has suspended production of an upcoming phone called the Galaxy S21 FE. Korean publication &lt;em&gt;ETNews&lt;/em&gt; alleged over the weekend that production of the unannounced phone had stopped because of a shortage of semiconductors, and that Qualcomm processors had been reallocated to foldable devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyY0S7"&gt;The report has since been deleted, and Samsung now says it hasn’t made a decision on whether to halt production. In a statement texted &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/samsung-halts-production-of-new-phone-on-chip-shortage-et-says"&gt;to Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, the company says “While we cannot discuss details of the unreleased product, nothing has been determined regarding the alleged production suspension.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IrGspR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy S20 FE review: the right price for the right stuff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="d5ZIZ1"&gt;The Galaxy S21 FE — the FE stands for Fan Edition — was expected to be a cut-down, more affordable version of the regular S21. Last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;Dieter Bohn gave the Galaxy S20 FE a positive review&lt;/a&gt;, noting that it had “a few high-quality components that will delight while the cheaper parts don’t hurt the experience too much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9oMx4"&gt;The S21 FE hadn’t been formally announced, but Samsung did say at an event last year that it planned to release Fan Editions of flagship phones going forward. OnLeaks posted alleged renders of the S21 FE back in April, showing a similar design to the well-received Galaxy S21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzWE9d"&gt;While it’s noteworthy that Samsung didn’t deny &lt;em&gt;ETNews&lt;/em&gt;’ report outright, it may take some time before the truth emerges. The S20 FE wasn’t announced until September last year and got a release in October, so even if Samsung is experiencing supply chain issues with its successor right now, a launch wasn’t necessarily imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oa1-khhYmtqlpCAP5VnzRqPRboc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69386792/acastro_180604_1777_E3_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VC1JN5"&gt;E3 2021 is finally here. After being canceled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, E3 is back for 2021 in an all-digital format, and it kicked off on June 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZLqrf"&gt;There’s been a lot of great announcements so far, including a trailer and release date for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22307059/elden-ring-george-rr-martin-fromsoftware-e3-2021-trailer-gameplay"&gt;highly-anticipated &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22531110/ubisoft-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-game-trailer-e3-2021"&gt;a trailer for Ubisoft’s gorgeous &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;a release date for Microsoft and Bethesda’s &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22532295/final-fantasy-origins-square-enix-team-ninja-trailer-e3-2021"&gt;the reveal of a chaos-filled and action-heavy &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; spinoff&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>The six coolest games from the PC Gaming Show at E3 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jo5C1G05OzmIpbfIFgCGrG1eqDo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69447597/ss_744bc2c09d80209c4ebf8e6e51d2acbf39aff879.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;They Always Run.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6MbfUL"&gt;The second day of E3 2021 has been busy with Xbox and Bethesda’s joint conference followed by Square Enix’s showcase, but plenty more game announcements came from the PC Gaming Show. If you don’t have time to catch up on the whole 90 minutes, we’ve rounded up a few of our highlights of intriguing and upcoming games that you’ll want to wishlist on Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J5m6Yb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rawmen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="eCsYFN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NJe9JgVCxAM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pI3Znq"&gt;Basically &lt;em&gt;Splatoon &lt;/em&gt;but with food, &lt;em&gt;Rawmen&lt;/em&gt; is a third-person arena shooter where instead of guns, you fight with food against up to two to eight players. Sling soup at your opponents, become a human meatball by jumping into meat juice and rolling your way back home, or launch yourself in the air with doughnut bombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VwJ7gL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;They Always Run&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="bgj020"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V4DIqCzQOGs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aeKgWS"&gt;This space Western 2D action game sees you playing a three-armed mutant hunting dangerous bounties across the galaxy. From the visuals, the animation, the music, it’s just dripping with style, and plenty of ultra-violence as you hack and slash your way through each level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vRZvp9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Far: Changing Tides&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="xOBhi7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OU6PWXj-luQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xU9x6g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Far: Lone Sails&lt;/em&gt; was a minimal, lonely, but powerfully meditative experience as you charted journey across a post-apocalyptic environment with nothing but yourself and a unique hunk of a junk of a vehicle. So a sequel, &lt;em&gt;Far: Changing Tides&lt;/em&gt; comes as a lovely surprise. It looks even more beautiful, and this time you’re piloting a ship across a flooded world, while still trying to keep your machine moving forward by salvaging ship parts during your travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YHz40H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next Space Rebels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="jbxfSf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FU7wOA2iMs4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W3Llz6"&gt;A space rocket-building sim with a narrative, &lt;em&gt;Next Space Rebels&lt;/em&gt; has the feel of a DIY amateur’s &lt;em&gt;Kerbal Space Program&lt;/em&gt;, as you try to put together a rocket engine that can actually launch. Tied to this simulation however is a story conveyed through FMV cutscenes, as fictitious hacker group Next Space Rebels urge the global community to build and launch rockets themselves, and “democratize the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EIewkg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soulstice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="IULkvj"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k0Lqeig-BXY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mWbWJ0"&gt;The name may imply a shameless Souls clone, but Italian developer Reply Game Studios is also taking inspiration from Japanese character-action games like &lt;em&gt;Devil May Cry&lt;/em&gt;, as well as early ‘80s anime. Another influence may be PlatinumGames’ &lt;em&gt;Astral Chain&lt;/em&gt;, as you’re controlling two characters simultaneously; two sisters called Briar and Lute, one possessing superhuman strength, the other a ghost with mystical powers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rqunso"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lemnis Gate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="uYRqvc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7lbqqEBLpd0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5CUYdX"&gt;This turn-based time-looping first-person shooter tasks you to take control of each of your team members one at a time playing a round that lasts just 25 seconds. It was first announced last year but its release is just around the corner as the latest trailer has confirmed &lt;em&gt;Lemnis Gate&lt;/em&gt; is coming on August 3rd to PC, as well as PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One. An open beta is also coming in July, so players can get their heads around just how this time-bending gameplay works.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Panther is coming to Marvel’s Avengers this August</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cyt-rAq1UBUAcAlfMtd4JEeiRTU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69447115/MarvelsAvengers_E3SEP_BlackPanther.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bR50up"&gt;Previously announced for &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Avengers, &lt;/em&gt;today’s Square Enix E3 Showcase gave a first proper look at Black Panther who joins the superhero roster in a brand new expansion, &lt;em&gt;War For Wakanda&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNFJUw"&gt;A new cinematic trailer introduces the King of Wakanda himself — although his face is not shown clearly until he puts on his Black Panther mask. He will be defending Wakanda from Klaw, who has infiltrated Wakanda in order to steal Vibranium for his own plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cftuE5"&gt;The trailer page indicates that &lt;em&gt;War For Wakanda&lt;/em&gt; will release this August. The Black Panther expansion will be free to players who already own &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Avengers&lt;/em&gt; on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One. The expansion had supposedly been planned for release earlier but was delayed due to the sad and sudden passing of Chadwick Boseman, who played the superhero in the Marvel film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyfTAl"&gt;Elsewhere in Marvel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22519348/guardians-of-the-galaxy-game-square-enix-eidos-montreal-release-date"&gt;Square Enix also announced today that Eidos Montreal is making a &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;, slated to launch this October.&lt;/p&gt;
