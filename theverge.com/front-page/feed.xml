    <title>Twitter has lost legal immunity for users’ posts in India, government argues</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="crpKYy"&gt;Twitter is now legally liable for content posted by its users in India after failing to comply with the country’s new IT rules, the government said in a legal filing. As reported by both &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/twitter-loses-immunity-over-user-generated-content-india-2021-07-06/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/twitter-has-lost-liability-protection-in-india-government-says/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;India’s IT ministry argues in a filing with New Delhi’s High Court that the social media firm has lost its legal immunity after failing to comply with new requirements imposed in May. These include appointing a chief compliance officer, a grievance officer, and a contact person to respond to requests from law enforcement 24 hours a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r60baz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports that the court filing came in response to allegations from a Twitter user that they had been defamed by tweets posted on the platform, and that Twitter has not appointed the new executives required as part of the new regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="te7CPD"&gt;If the court sides with India’s government, it would mark a major shift in Twitter’s legal obligations in the country, with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; noting it could open the door for its executives to face criminal charges over objectionable content posted by its users. While social media platforms, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;including Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, often take down content in response to legal challenges, they’re generally not legally liable for the contents of their users’ posts. Although the Indian government has claimed Twitter has lost this legal protection, &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/limits-of-modis-power-to-control-twitter/"&gt;experts have said&lt;/a&gt; that the final decision ultimately rests with India’s courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dNErxn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Following months of escalating tensions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WIo8Up"&gt;In the US, social media companies are generally not held liable for their users’ posts thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act&lt;/a&gt;. But India’s IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has argued it’s wrong for companies to expect exactly the same protection under Indian law. “The issue is of misuse of social media,” &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports the minister said in a press conference last week. “Some of them say we are bound by American laws. You operate in India, make good money, but you will take the position that you’ll be governed by American laws. This is plainly not acceptable.” Prasad denied that the move was aimed at silencing criticism of the country’s government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqzK9c"&gt;A spokesperson from Twitter did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment, but the company declined to comment to both &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. Twitter has previously said it was making efforts to comply with India’s new Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code, which came into force in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0DYdo"&gt;Tensions have been rising between Twitter and the Indian government for several months. In May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;police in India raided Twitter’s offices&lt;/a&gt; as part of an investigation into why the company labeled tweets from government officials as “manipulated media.” Last month, the country’s technology minister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520330/india-warns-twitter-rules-social-media"&gt;warned Twitter of “unintended consequences”&lt;/a&gt; if the company did not comply with its new regulations, and gave it “one last notice to immediately comply.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRfooJ"&gt;Other big tech companies have also clashed with Indian authorities over its new regulations. In May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454381/whatsapp-indian-government-traceability-lawsuit-break-encryption-privacy"&gt;WhatsApp sued the Indian government&lt;/a&gt; over the new rules, claiming they are unconstitutional and will “severely undermine the privacy” of its users. WhatsApp’s concerns relate to a requirement that it track the origins of objectionable messages. The service argues that this would effectively force it to “trace” private messages sent on its platform, ultimately breaking the service’s end-to-end encryption. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned about Karateka’s 37-year-old easter egg</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="1984 Apple II game Karateka booted upside down" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yQmZzLbAz2Qq5p6UwebcL-wHWFA=/248x0:2615x1578/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69543439/Screen_Shot_2021_07_05_at_1.20.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Geek With Social Skills&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YguQH0"&gt;Karateka, an early martial arts side-scroller published in the US by Broderbund in 1984, was a little before my time. It was created by Jordan Mechner before he went on to make Prince of Persia&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— a game I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; remember thanks to the horror of sending that character to a bloody, pixelated death on a bed of spikes. Karateka however was an early hit, with later iterations making it to NES and Game Boy. And the original Apple II version included a delightful little easter egg from the early days of PC gaming — putting in the floppy disk upside down would boot up the game upside down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJHGjv"&gt;This isn’t new exactly — people have been trying this trick for more than 35 years — but it was new to me, and I got a quick refresher today thanks to the magic of YouTube. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC81jebcnijA535zPWGZn6qw"&gt;YouTuber Geek with Social Skills&lt;/a&gt; was demoing the game, and got a note that he should try inserting the game disk upside-down. You can see for yourself what happened when he gave it a try — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WNYrikbtcY&amp;amp;t=169s"&gt;the title screen, intro, and game all display upside down&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a delightfully simple joke, and it took a surprising amount of coding to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yc9HFI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/184477/this-is-the-greatest-easter-egg-of-all-time-only-on-the-apple-ii/"&gt;According to Mechner&lt;/a&gt;, the game’s developers hoped that a few people would discover it by accident, and think their game was defective. “When that person called tech support, that tech support rep would once in a blue moon have the sublime joy of saying, ‘Well sir, you put the disk in upside-down,’” Mechner was quoted as saying in a recent profile, “and that person would think for the rest of their life that’s how software works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeFwEw"&gt;Developers, we now know, have had a weird sense of humor forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ao5GTj"&gt;Mechner says that he &lt;a href="https://gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=19585"&gt;didn’t think Broderbund would sign off on it&lt;/a&gt; because it would require a change to the assembly line. But the company did, and a little hidden gem of gaming history was made because the president of a software company had a sense of humor, too. I, for one, am grateful for that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hong Kong’s new anti-doxxing proposal could put tech companies at risk, says new letter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A crowd of people wearing facemasks hold up signs in support of Hong Kong." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QNCyI4IsS-IfIkK7X3CsxmFKWMo=/7x0:4144x2758/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69543423/1233762251.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Supporters of democracy in Hong Kong protest outside the Chinese embassy in London on July 1st | Photo credit should read Wiktor Szymanowicz/Barcroft Media via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SwTQ7X"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22700279/Industry_Response_on_the_Proposed_Amendments_to_Hong_Kongs_Personal_Data_Privacy_Ordinance_and_Request_for_Virtual_Meeting.pdf"&gt;A new letter&lt;/a&gt; from a tech industry group is driving home the risks of Hong Kong’s proposed anti-doxxing rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vatIr"&gt;Sent to Hong Kong’s privacy commissioner for personal data by the Asia Internet Coalition (which counts Google, Apple and Facebook as members), the letter argues that the new measures will have an extreme impact on due process in Hong Kong, and could result in major US tech companies ceasing operations there. The letter was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-twitter-google-warn-planned-hong-kong-tech-law-could-drive-them-out-11625483036"&gt;first obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XKnFM3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The only way to avoid these sanctions for technology companies would be to refrain from... offering their services in Hong Kong.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O9N5jA"&gt;The letter comes in response to series of amendments to Hong Kong’s Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO), proposed by the privacy commissioner in response to concerns around online doxxing. Once in effect, the amendments would require swift compliance with any government takedown requests — and ambiguous wording in the text of the bill has spurred concerns that tech employees could be prosecuted as individuals if they do not comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEGRm8"&gt;“Introducing severe sanctions and especially personal liability in relation to assessing requests for taking down content has the consequence of encouraging online platforms to conduct little to no review of requests and over-block content,” the letter reads. “The only way to avoid these sanctions for technology companies would be to refrain from investing and offering their services in Hong Kong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1y54dm"&gt;The letter raises new questions about the future of US tech company employees in Hong Kong. The &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;estimates that Google, Facebook and Twitter alone keep hundreds of staff in Hong Kong, all of whom could be at risk under the new legislation. Amazon, Apple, Yahoo and Rakuten are also members of the Asia Internet Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfV6Es"&gt;The new amendments come after years of mounting pressure on civil liberties in Hong Kong, as the central Chinese government seeks to exert more influence over the city’s politics. Last year, the passage of a new security law caused Google, Facebook and Twitter to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21314900/google-facebook-twitter-hong-kong-government-data-china"&gt;halt all data production requests&lt;/a&gt; while the law could be reviewed. TikTok (which does not operate in China) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315637/tiktok-hong-kong-security-chinese-government-pompeo-us-ban"&gt;ceased its operations in the city entirely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q94NCx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kaseya ransomware attackers demand $70 million, claim they infected over a million devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Op7sxnIUyzj7Ay23WQUU0djZeY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69543356/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1GOXwe"&gt;Three days after ransomware attackers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22561252/revil-ransomware-attacks-systems-using-kaseyas-remote-it-management-software"&gt;started the holiday weekend by compromising Kaseya VSA&lt;/a&gt;, we have a clearer idea of how widespread the impact has been. In a new ransom demand, the attackers claim to have compromised more than 1 million computers, and demand $70 million to decrypt the affected devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjFjTf"&gt;Kaseya’s software is used by Managed Service Providers to perform IT tasks remotely, but on July 2nd, the Russia-linked REvil ransomware group deployed a malicious software update exposing providers who use the platform, and their clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6yZ05"&gt;The Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) &lt;a href="https://csirt.divd.nl/2021/07/03/Kaseya-Case-Update/"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that it appears the exploit used for the breach was same one they discovered and &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kaseya-was-fixing-zero-day-just-as-revil-ransomware-sprung-their-attack/"&gt;were in the process of addressing&lt;/a&gt; when the attackers struck. “We were already running a broad investigation into backup and system administration tooling and their vulnerabilities,” DIVD wrote. “One of the products we have been investigating is Kaseya VSA. We discovered severe vulnerabilities in Kaseya VSA and reported them to Kaseya, with whom we have been in regular contact since then.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UD0tom"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We expect the full scope of victim organizations to be higher than what’s being reported by any individual security company.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fnViwA"&gt;On Friday, Kaseya CEO Fred Vocolla said that “Only a very small percentage of our customers were affected – currently estimated at fewer than 40 worldwide.” Sophos VP Ross McKerchar said in a statement Sunday that “This is one of the farthest reaching criminal ransomware attacks that Sophos has ever seen. At this time, our evidence shows that more than 70 managed service providers were impacted, resulting in more than 350 further impacted organizations. We expect the full scope of victim organizations to be higher than what’s being reported by any individual security company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fsc44o"&gt;Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuberger followed up on earlier comments by President Biden, saying “The FBI and CISA will reach out to identified victims to provide assistance based upon an assessment of national risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0QmGR"&gt;Huntress Labs is participating in the response to the attack and has &lt;a href="https://www.huntress.com/blog/rapid-response-kaseya-vsa-mass-msp-ransomware-incident"&gt;cataloged most of the available information&lt;/a&gt;, saying the attack compromised over 1,000 businesses that it’s tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5MmO6y3xvrdunOgsQPSuQKjfbow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22700229/revil_blog.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sophos&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;REvil ransom demand&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0baZ3C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kaseya’s SaaS cloud servers remain offline&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7rHGJX"&gt;Sophos, Huntress and others pointed to this post (above) on REvil’s “Happy Blog,” claiming that more than a million devices have been infected and setting a ransom demand of $70 million in Bitcoin to unlock all of them. REvil has been linked to a slew of ransomware incidents, including one attack involving Kaseya in &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-gang-hacks-msps-to-deploy-ransomware-on-customer-systems/"&gt;June 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and a high-profile incident earlier this year targeting the meat supplier JBS. However, security researcher Marcus Hutchins &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1412139752434782209"&gt;expressed skepticism&lt;/a&gt; about the group’s claim, suggesting they’re overstating the impact in hopes of extracting a large payout from Kaseya or someone else&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HiljG"&gt;So far, once of the companies most noticeably impacted by the attack is Coop, a line of over 800 grocery stores in Sweden that closed Saturday as the attack shut down its cash registers. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.coop.se/Globala-sidor/stangda-butiker/"&gt;note on its website&lt;/a&gt;, stores where customers can shop using Coop’s Scan &amp;amp; Pay mobile app have reopened, while other locations remain closed. Experts have predicted that on Tuesday when workers return to offices in the US, there may be more victims discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QCMHig"&gt;Three days after the attack, Kaseya’s SaaS cloud servers remain offline. The &lt;a href="https://www.kaseya.com/potential-attack-on-kaseya-vsa/"&gt;company says&lt;/a&gt; it will provide an updated timeline for server restoration this evening, as well as more technical details of the attack to help recovery efforts by customers and security researchers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 9 is on sale — and it’s an even better deal at $649</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0XoJzbpw0mSnKeUGflvNB8t8miA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69543226/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0070_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 misses some of the high-end features on the more expensive Pro model, but it’s a better overall buy for most people.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u8wNGQ"&gt;The OnePlus’ latest flagship phones are marked down at several retailers, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/05/grab-a-oneplus-9-for-the-price-it-probably-shouldve-been-at-launch/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad-Wireless/dp/B08Y73NTXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;normally $729 OnePlus 9 down to $649&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad-Wireless/dp/B07XM7WVS8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro (usually $1069) to $969&lt;/a&gt;. We think that the more basic 9 is already the better buy than the 9 Pro for most people, and the extra $80 off the retail price makes it an even sweeter deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwH0B6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;The OnePlus 9 gives up surprisingly few features&lt;/a&gt; compared to its more expensive sibling — you still get a Snapdragon 888 processor, display with 120Hz refresh rate, and an excellent 50-megapixel ultrawide camera. You’ll have to make do with an unstabilized main camera, plastic rather than aluminum frame, and slower wireless charging. Considering that you save more than $300 off the price of the premium model, these downgrades feel like things most of us could live with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="f9yVX6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0zv63j"&gt;A word of caution if you’re ready to add the OnePlus 9 to your virtual cart: while it’s fully compatible with Verizon and T-Mobile 4G and 5G networks, it’s 4G only on AT&amp;amp;T. That’s not a big deal now (actually, you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277484/att-fake-5g-e-network-lte-study"&gt;probably better off sticking with its 4G&lt;/a&gt; at the moment). However, AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network should improve over the next couple of years as the company starts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;employing its new C-band frequencies&lt;/a&gt;, which the 9 and 9 Pro support. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rimac takes over Bugatti from VW in powerhouse electric supercar deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hJNC5Z3NQbk-K2G7x0KlxbuQXAU=/245x0:7571x4884/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69542819/Bugatti_Rimac_4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRkwgd"&gt;Croatian electric supercar startup Rimac &lt;a href="https://www.rimac-automobili.com/media/press-releases/rimac-and-bugatti-combine-forces-in-historic-new-venture/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was taking over Bugatti from Volkswagen to form a new company called Bugatti Rimac. The news was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/56be5f08-fe6e-481f-ba6d-71ef49d2cfc4"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk90BC"&gt;Bugatti Rimac will be led by Mate Rimac, who founded the company in 2009 in a garage as a one-man operation. Over that period, Rimac has become a highly desirable brand, with many legacy automakers calling upon the startup to help build their own electric supercars.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kR13b2"&gt;It’s not much of a question why that is. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463499/rimac-nevera-production-c-two-concept-hypercar"&gt;Rimac released the Nevera&lt;/a&gt;, a quad-motor, 1,914 horsepower demonstration of electric absurdity, with a top speed of 258mph and an ability to leap to zero to 60mph in less than 2 seconds. The Nevera is expected to be the fastest sports car ever made, a title previously held by the Bugatti Chiron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9KFswX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Under the deal, Rimac will own a controlling 55 percent stake in Bugatti&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yIVCx8"&gt;Under the deal, Rimac will own a controlling 55 percent stake in Bugatti, the 112-year-old French brand known for its aggressively priced supercars like the Chiron and Veyron. VW’s Porsche brand will own the remaining shares in Bugatti. (Even though Porsche owns some stock in Rimac, it’s total ownership will not give it a controlling interest in Bugatti, the companies told &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qp7FPN"&gt;Volkswagen has owned Bugatti since 1998, when it bought the sports car brand for $50 million after acquiring Rolls-Royce and Lamborghini. This was an all-stock deal, meaning no money changed hands, according to Porsche boss Oliver Blume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSlOar"&gt;Rimac Group will own both Bugatti Rimac and Rimac Technologies, an offshoot of the company focused on the development, production and supply of battery systems, drivetrains and other EV components. Over the years, Rimac has supplied automotive components to Porsche, Hyundai, and, yes, Bugatti. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tImhT"&gt;“Bugatti and Rimac will both continue as separate respective brands, retaining existing production facilities and distribution channels,” Rimac says. “Bugatti Rimac represents the company that will develop the future of both Bugatti and Rimac vehicles, by joining resources and expertise in research and development, production, and other areas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFK5ey"&gt;Both companies will retain their respective headquarters, but Rimac plans to eventually merge its workforce at the planned $200 million campus in Croatia, which is set to open in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpfS1O"&gt;“This is a truly exciting moment in the short, yet rapidly expanding history of Rimac Automobili,” Mate Rimac said in a statement. “We have gone through so much in such a short space of time, but this new venture takes things to a completely new level. Rimac and Bugatti are a perfect match in terms of what we each bring to the table. As a young, agile and fast-paced automotive and technology company, we have established ourselves as an industry pioneer in electric technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbNasi"&gt;Rimac said Bugatti would have an electric model this decade but would still produce hybrid models by the end of that period. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb has blocked tens of thousands of partiers in COVID crackdown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration, an Airbnb logo seen displayed on..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XOBiaMzQNTFXU0NFYSbiIvArdxg=/0x0:3888x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69542637/1231638711.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6q7aFD"&gt;Airbnb has blocked or redirected “potentially risky reservation attempts” from over 50,000 people across 15 US cities as part of a crackdown on parties in its properties during the pandemic. These include 7,000 in Dallas, 6,000 in San Diego, 5,100 in Charlotte, 3,500 in St. Louis, 3,000 in Columbus, and 2,700 in New Orleans, the company’s head of trust and safety communication Ben Breit tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFwQE4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/04/airbnb-blocks-young-adults-from-renting-denver-party-homes/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Denver Post&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that it’s blocked 5,000 people from making bookings in Phoenix, 4,500 in Las Vegas, 4,500 in Seattle, 2,600 in Denver, 2,600 in Portland, 1,800 in Salt Lake City, and 1,500 in Albuquerque. “In the past year, this technology has blocked or redirected potentially risky reservation attempts from more than 2,000 people in Cincinnati,” the &lt;a href="https://www.wlwt.com/article/airbnb-says-efforts-to-crack-down-on-parties-are-working-in-cincinnati/36869789"&gt;company told &lt;em&gt;WLWT5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while 3,800 were blocked in Austin, &lt;a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/party-crash-airbnb-blocked-3800-risky-reservations-in-austin-area-over-last-year/"&gt;according to KXAN&lt;/a&gt;. The total number of blocked bookings may be higher, Airbnb says, since each of these blocked individuals may have attempted to make more than one booking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpWmku"&gt;The numbers show the scale of Airbnb’s enforcement action, and follows a total global ban on parties &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-announces-global-party-ban/"&gt;introduced last year&lt;/a&gt; to prevent its rental properties becoming an alternative to local bars and clubs forced to close due to the pandemic. “Instituting a global ban on parties and events is in the best interest of public health,” the company said at the time. The ban was an expansion of existing rules prohibiting dedicated “party houses,” which &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1190675126594879489"&gt;came into force in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WkT9Iu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Instituting a global ban on parties and events is in the best interest of public health”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MIxYXH"&gt;Breit outlined to &lt;em&gt;The Denver Post&lt;/em&gt; which kinds of bookings its system has been automatically blocking in the US &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/strengthening-our-safety-commitment-to-u-s-hosts-and-communities/"&gt;since July last year&lt;/a&gt;. “If you are under the age of 25 and you don’t have a history of positive reviews, we will not allow you to book an entire home listing local to where you live,” Breit said. However, other bookings which make less sense for party locations would still be allowed. Trying to rent in a distant city is ok, for example, as is renting a smaller location more locally. Airbnb is now using this particular system across the US, Canada, the UK, France, and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASKpT5"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-launches-summer-of-responsible-travel/#:~:text=we%20believe%20it%20worked.%20those%20weekends%20were%20quiet%2C%20and%20these%20initiatives%20were%20well-received%20by%20our%20host%20community."&gt;believes its ban has worked&lt;/a&gt;, and said that major events like Halloween and New Year’s Eve were “quiet” as a result. In Denver specifically, &lt;em&gt;The Denver Post &lt;/em&gt;reports that complaints about short-term rental properties halved between January and May this year compared to the same period in 2020, though it’s unclear how much of this can be attributed to Airbnb’s policies versus a more general decline due to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNvlSx"&gt;Although vaccines are continuing to roll out across the world, Airbnb is showing no signs of relaxing its rules, and recently said it would be extending its ban on parties &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-announces-extension-of-party-ban-through-end-of-summer/"&gt;through to the end of summer 2021&lt;/a&gt;. It explained why as part of its “summer of responsible travel” &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-launches-summer-of-responsible-travel/"&gt;announcement in April&lt;/a&gt; when it cited warnings from public health experts about the continued risks of mass gatherings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLDs5n"&gt;The automatic blocking of suspected party bookings is just one part of the company’s crackdown. Other elements include providing discounted noise detection devices to hosts and a 24/7 neighborhood support line in the US, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCYjBV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction July 6th, 3:49AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Airbnb has clarified that the initial figures listed as bookings were actually the number of people who’ve been blocked from making bookings, where one person might make multiple booking attempts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mu9rtW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOR81x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk just now realizing that self-driving cars are a ‘hard problem’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Billionaire Elon Musk Receives Axel Springer Award" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/noSF6rr8lGHdXNfmjLhvXS_YBVY=/0x87:4000x2754/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69542574/1229901940.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iZNPnP"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk is finally admitting that he underestimated how difficult it is to develop a safe and reliable self-driving car. To which the entire engineering community rose up as one to say, “No duh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aX0R2K"&gt;Or at least that’s how it should have happened in a just world. Instead, all the Tesla sycophants and ass-kissers on Twitter told Musk to keep up the good work, that they believed in him, and encouraged him to hurry up and roll out the latest version of his “Full Self-Driving” software that, it’s worth pointing out, does not enable a Tesla vehicle to drive itself without input from the driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ey3ddg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk has a long history of over promising and under delivering&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N5rmDB"&gt;Musk has a long history of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424592/tesla-elon-musk-autopilot-dmv-fsd-exaggeration"&gt;over promising and under delivering&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to his company’s so-called “Full Self-Driving” software. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/11/17449076/tesla-autopilot-full-self-driving-elon-musk"&gt;He did it in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, when he promised that the “long awaited” V9 (Version 9) would begin rolling out in August. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18512580/elon-musk-tesla-driverless-cars-lidar-simulation-waymo"&gt;He did it again in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, proclaiming that “a year from now” there would be “over a million cars with full self-driving, software, everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyWRd9"&gt;He was back at it again this past weekend, promising that “FSD 9 beta is shipping soon,” with an added “I swear!” just in case you had any doubts about his solemnity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JB87Cs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Haha, FSD 9 beta is shipping soon, I swear!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Generalized self-driving is a hard problem, as it requires solving a large part of real-world AI. Didn’t expect it to be so hard, but the difficulty is obvious in retrospect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing has more degrees of freedom than reality.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1411280212470366213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OTkYsS"&gt;There’s no question that Tesla is more willing than its competitors to test beta versions of its Autopilot driver assist feature on its customers in the interest of gathering data and working out any bugs in the system. And Tesla customers are mostly fine with this, routinely flooding Musk’s mentions begging to be white-listed for the current version of Full Self-Driving. This has helped contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-tesla-model-3-survey/autopilot.html?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Tesla’s public reputation&lt;/a&gt; as a leader in autonomous driving, despite its vehicles continuously falling short of what most experts would agree defines a self-driving car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQKzE7"&gt;Tesla says Autopilot is safe — it releases quarterly reports with selectively reported data that it says proves this — but that it also requires constant input from the driver in order to work. Meanwhile, AV companies like Waymo have real driverless vehicles on public roads giving rides to passengers. Waymo, like practically every AV company, uses a combination of different sensors, like radar, lidar, and cameras, to ensure there are redundancies in case any system failures. Tesla recently switched to a camera-only sensing system. The contrast between Tesla and every other company pursuing self-driving technology couldn’t be more stark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1RKBgl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I, for one, am all for Musk taking as long as he wants&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nTXOkC"&gt;I, for one, am all for Musk taking as long as he wants with the release of V9. Let the cake bake for as long as it needs, in my opinion, especially after &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/4655186671568775?#&amp;amp;video"&gt;viewing videos like the one to just come out of China&lt;/a&gt; of a Tesla Model 3 in Autopilot utterly failing to take a sharp turn and crashing into a ditch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bboT68"&gt;An anonymous Twitter user who uses the handle @greentheonly to post “hacks” of Tesla’s Autopilot, recreated the scenario to demonstrate how the company’s driver assist feature struggles with these sharp turns. With an overlay of Tesla’s Autopilot display running in the corner of the screen, greentheonly shows how the vehicle “actually outputs various alerts before the eventual ‘take over we are giving up.’” Other times, the car actually slows down enough and manages to take the turn safely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0jaLkX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So in regards to the recent Chinese crash with video where AP exits roadway in sharp turns:&lt;br&gt; I long planned to do a demo of a similar condition but always forgot and I guess better late than never.&lt;br&gt;It's actually really easy to reproduce&lt;a href="https://t.co/B2Ip0G17Ur"&gt;https://t.co/B2Ip0G17Ur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— green (@greentheonly) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1411754065277636615?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WkXl45"&gt;A system that fails to take a sharp turn in “half the cases” should not inspire a great amount of confidence! Quite the opposite actually. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-crash/u-s-safety-agency-reviewing-23-tesla-crashes-three-from-recent-weeks-idUSKBN2BA2ML"&gt;The number of open investigations&lt;/a&gt; into vehicle crashes involving Tesla Autopilot seems to be growing in inverse relation to customer expectations about Musk’s ability to deliver on the promises he’s been making (and breaking) for years now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g38sAa"&gt;Musk isn’t alone in coming to the realization that self-driving cars are hard. Nearly the entire industry was predicting that by now ours roads would be swarmed with self-driving cars, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22423489/autonomous-vehicle-consolidation-acquisition-lyft-uber"&gt;only to later admit&lt;/a&gt; they underestimated how complicated it was to get cars to drive themselves safely and reliably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bStvYa"&gt;To which we can now say to Musk, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6wRZCV7naE"&gt;“Welcome to the party, pal.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why roads in the Pacific Northwest buckled under extreme heat </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wfj5yRWyxiqvAVmuyRywokOed9I=/0x84:2016x1428/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69542359/E4_yA3mVoAYgzsv.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A road that buckled in the recent heat.  | Washington State Department of Transportation North via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/wsdot_north/status/1409540967753936897" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6qGOXx"&gt;During last weekend’s &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/weather/2021/06/63-people-died-in-oregon-heat-wave-state-medical-examiner-says.html"&gt;deadly&lt;/a&gt; heat wave, some roads in the Pacific Northwest buckled. Workers ventured out in blistering conditions to put cracked concrete and asphalt byways back together. Steel drawbridges were &lt;a href="https://mynorthwest.com/2995816/seattle-bridges-cool-baths-heatwave/"&gt;doused with water&lt;/a&gt; to make sure they wouldn’t swell shut under the oppressive heat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asgJXs"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547454/2021-heat-wave-temperature-high-heat-dome"&gt;heat dome&lt;/a&gt; that sat over the region provided a brutal stress test of i&lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/local/likely-heat-caused-crack-closes-north-denver"&gt;ts roadways&lt;/a&gt;, some of which couldn’t withstand multiple days of record-breaking temperatures. It’s something that’s happened before, in &lt;a href="https://www.king5.com/article/traffic/when-roads-blow-up-how-heat-could-play-a-role-in-pavement-durability/281-e88b357d-dfe6-4592-93e8-62e0960b5944"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://wqow.com/2021/06/04/dot-watch-out-for-road-buckles-in-heat/"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://listen.sdpb.org/post/long-term-heat-wave-causing-pavement-damage"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt;, and anywhere else experiencing extreme heatwaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="moYwoG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's an example of how heat is causing some road pavement to buckle. Our crews are hard at work this morning fixing SR 544 in Whatcom County, trying to get it back open by afternoon. &lt;a href="https://t.co/53XoBDBOMZ"&gt;https://t.co/53XoBDBOMZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WSDOT Traffic (@wsdot_traffic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wsdot_traffic/status/1409543888403009539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HMCZ8r"&gt;“You can design something to work in a very hot temperature or not. That’s not the problem.” Steve Muench, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Washington says. The problem is that the current heat defies engineering expectations. Fixing that bigger problem will take engineering, planning, and a whole lot of public willpower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2YFtzc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why can’t these roads handle the heat? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mFw1TI"&gt;Different kinds of roads behave very differently under heat. In the US, roads are typically made of one of two materials — asphalt or concrete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63PS2k"&gt;Concrete roads, Muench says, are generally made of portland cement. To make something like a highway, it gets formed into big slabs, which can be about 15 feet long and four feet wide. As temperatures fluctuate, these big slabs of concrete expand and contract. (How much they expand or contract is usually determined by what kinds of crushed rocks make up the cement.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ACVuw"&gt;All that is normal. Usually, there’s just enough space in between the slabs so that the expansion (in hot weather) and contraction (in colder weather) passes completely unnoticed by the average driver. But when it gets unseasonably hot, some of those slabs of concrete start running out of elbow room, especially if bits of sand or other debris have gotten into the cracks between the slabs.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FdP9Cf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Heat = expansion. Here's a look at a concrete panel that popped up on NB I-5 at I-405 in Tukwila. Crews are removing the damaged panel and filling it back in. No estimated time for getting these lanes and ramp back open. Fortunately, not much of a backup at the moment. &lt;a href="https://t.co/OLd1Ewf6Kt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OLd1Ewf6Kt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WSDOT Traffic (@wsdot_traffic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wsdot_traffic/status/1409313718328954883?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uBqoKx"&gt;“When it gets really, really abnormally hot, like it hasn’t been that hot before in quite a long time, it expands so much that it runs into the adjacent slab. There’s no more room to expand, they just push up against each other and then they pop up” Muench says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sF8GbP"&gt;Asphalt is a different beast entirely. “Asphalt is a viscoelastic material, which is temperature-dependent. So, the hotter it is, the more fluid-like it is,” Muench says. If it gets hot enough, some asphalt roads can become soft or deform like Play-Doh, forming ruts when cars and trucks drive over them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWXI3N"&gt;Both asphalt and concrete roads &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;be designed to withstand heat. “We already know how to adjust materials to behave in hotter places,” Muench says. “That’s why Phoenix isn’t falling apart — it’s not Armageddon there because it’s hotter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UJdyT"&gt;The problem is that when some of these roads in Washington state were being designed, using those materials or design techniques would have been overkill — the area doesn’t normally get as hot as Phoenix, so there was no need to build with extreme heat in mind. Now, that calculus might be changing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BHCz3J"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparing for a future that looks nothing like the past&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JyuXma"&gt;When engineers design roads, they can look at the historical weather records for an area and figure out what’s normal. How much rain does this place get? What are the extremes of heat or cold? What are the chances that the nearby river will flood in the next 50 years? All that information can inform which materials and designs the engineers pick out. But it might not be enough anymore.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpO2F3"&gt;“With climate change, you’d have to think very carefully about that and go: ‘Should I really be designing something based on information in the past which may no longer be relevant? Or should I design it based on what we project for the future?’” Muench says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L83nnO"&gt;Roads last for a long time, so building for the future starts to make a lot of sense. Engineers can use climate models to predict how things might change over time and build for a future that’s hotter, or wetter, or drier than anything seen in the weather records of the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FenFWC"&gt;Even roads developed based on those models won’t be perfect. “You can’t design for everything. Some things just break your infrastructure,” Muench says. When a massive storm or an earthquake or any other disaster hits, some things will break, no matter how well-designed they are. At that point, Muench says, the question becomes how do you recover from that quickly. That requires different sets of resources and planning, like making sure materials are available and workforces are trained to respond immediately. Those contingency plans are vital during major disasters so that when the worst happens, a community is ready to face it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q11Pn8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can’t design for everything. Some things just break your infrastructure.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pfHn51"&gt;Building for the future and prepping for future emergencies are both possible. We have the information and the technology to make it happen. The bigger question, Muench says, is whether people are willing to put the money and resources into infrastructure that can withstand the coming storms, both literal and figurative. “I kind of hope that we’re kind of crossing that bridge —  no pun intended — to where we might be willing to spend a little effort, time and money on these kinds of things,” Muench says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgZctf"&gt;As it is, many transit departments across the country have dealt with shrinking budgets as they try to hold together aging infrastructure that was built for a different climate. Future planning is important but often takes a backseat to more immediate concerns, like tending to heat-stressed roads as they buckle. Crews go out, repair the concrete slabs or asphalt, and get traffic flowing again. It’s not a permanent fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkZC08"&gt;“It’s just sort of wait for something to break and then fix it when it breaks,” Muench says. “The bigger solution is trying to get ahead of the curve and think about what’s coming in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFigYV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZV2Pkm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Andy Jassy officially takes over as Amazon CEO from Jeff Bezos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Web Services Head Andrew Jassy Speaks At The AWS Summit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XfW9T69iC50fkbfvLLXu-qNn8xE=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69542025/670451728.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RhFUhy"&gt;Jeff Bezos, who has served as the CEO of Amazon since founding the company exactly 27 years ago on July 5th, 1994, has officially stepped down from the role. Andy Jassy is now listed as the company’s CEO on its &lt;a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/officers-and-directors/default.aspx"&gt;investor relations website&lt;/a&gt;, after previously having run Amazon Web Services since 2003, while Bezos is listed as Executive Chair. The July 5th handover date was previously announced in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455126/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-jeff-bezos-july-5-birthday"&gt;shareholder meeting in May&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ia2by"&gt;It’s an important moment for Amazon, which has had the same CEO for the entirety of its existence. Under Bezos’ leadership, the company survived the dot-com bubble bursting in the late 90s to become one of the world’s most prominent technology companies. Amazon currently dominates online commerce in the US and parts of Europe, and serves as a backbone to much of the modern web thanks to Amazon Web Services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AsHIdp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The end of a 27-year tenure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TkSxW4"&gt;Bezos’ successor, Andy Jassy, joined the company shortly after graduating from Harvard Business School in 1997, and has led AWS since the team was founded in 2003. He was officially named the division’s CEO in 2016. At the end of 2020, AWS controlled around a third of the total cloud computing market, &lt;a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/cloud-market-ends-2020-high-while-microsoft-continues-gain-ground-amazon"&gt;according to Synergy Research&lt;/a&gt;, which is about as much as its closest rivals Microsoft and Google, combined. Jassy’s route is similar to that of current Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who previously ran the company’s Azure cloud business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWVInG"&gt;While Amazon’s share price has seen remarkable success under Bezos’ leadership, its labor practices, not to mention the former CEO’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246203/data-visualization-billionaires-wealth-inequality-jeff-bezos-net-worth"&gt;extreme wealth&lt;/a&gt;, have been the focus of sustained criticism. Warehouse workers and delivery drivers have said the company’s high productivity targets take a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence"&gt;physical toll on employees&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; recently alleged that Bezos paid no federal income tax in 2007 or 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JV0zDq"&gt;Bezos is handing Jassy a company with ambitions extending far beyond electronic books. The e-commerce and cloud computing giant is also a company that’s willing to make big bets on new areas of business. Amazon is a sizable player in consumer tech thanks to its range of Kindle, Echo, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17059664/amazon-ring-acquisition-smart-home-security-cloud-cam"&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/11/18220960/amazon-eero-acquisition-announced"&gt;Eero&lt;/a&gt; devices, as well as general consumer goods under its Amazon Basics label. It has an expanding presence in physical retail after its acquisition of Whole Foods, and the launch of its own Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh stores. And when it comes to entertainment, it recently made its biggest acquisition ever with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond"&gt;purchase of film and TV company MGM for $8.45 billion&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also Amazon Music, and a video games division which Jassy has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265932/amazon-ceo-game-studios-andy-jassy-commitment-struggling-video-game-division"&gt;previously expressed his support for&lt;/a&gt; despite its &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-29/amazon-game-studios-struggles-to-find-a-hit?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;rocky history&lt;/a&gt;. And don’t forget those investments in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571091/amazon-pharmacy-store-launch-home-delivery-prescription-medication"&gt;healthcare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20683449/amazon-brands-clothing-fashion-trademarks"&gt;fashion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyOspY"&gt;Amazon’s size and practices have attracted scrutiny from antitrust regulators around the world. Bezos was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony"&gt;one of the Big Tech CEOs&lt;/a&gt; asked to testify in front of Congress as part of its antitrust investigation last year. Meanwhile, in Europe, Amazon was recently accused of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;misusing Marketplace data&lt;/a&gt; as the European Union announced a second antitrust investigation into the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRZVBi"&gt;As the world’s richest man, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Bezos won’t be fading into obscurity anytime soon. He’s staying on as Amazon’s executive chair, where he’s said he will “stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives,” and has also said he plans to dedicate more time and energy to other initiatives such as the Day One Fund and Bezos Earth Fund foundations, &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;newspaper, and his Blue Origin space company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="921lwL"&gt;In the immediate future, Bezos will fly to the edge of space onboard a rocket built by Blue Origin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522313/jeff-bezos-space-launch-brother-blue-origin-july-20"&gt;on July 20th&lt;/a&gt;. The now-former Amazon CEO will be joined by his brother, Mark Bezos, aboard the ship New Shepard’s first crewed mission. But Bezos is currently set to be beaten to space by rival entrepreneur and Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson, who’s due to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559964/richard-branson-space-before-jeff-bezos-virgin-galactic"&gt;onboard the VSS Unity spaceplane for a test flight on July 11th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
