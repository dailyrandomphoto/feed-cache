    <title>Facebook designates Myanmar a ‘temporary high-risk location’ after coup</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s2AHfA"&gt;Facebook has designated Myanmar a “temporary high-risk location” after a coup earlier this week, saying it will remove “any calls to bring armaments” and protect posts criticizing the country’s military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0iWbw6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tasneemnashrulla/facebook-takes-stand-myanmar-coup"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s Asia-Pacific policy director, Rafael Frankel, outlined its coup response in a message to employees. Frankel pledged to employ “a number of product interventions that were used in the past in Myanmar and during the US elections, to ensure the platform isn’t being used to spread misinformation, incite violence, or coordinate harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jpNnv"&gt;Facebook declined to comment on the leaked post to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but it confirmed that a number of the measures it mentions are being put in place. “We are closely monitoring political events in Myanmar as they unfold and are taking additional steps to stop misinformation and content that could incite further tensions at this time,” a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This includes removing misinformation that delegitimizes the outcome of November’s election,” alongside hate speech and other misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88x5K6"&gt;Facebook says it’s taking temporary measures to reduce the spread of content that praises or supports post-election violence, automatically demoting potentially rule-breaking content while moderators make a decision on its removal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IVJq4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; reports that Frankel said Facebook is securing the accounts of activists and journalists, as well as protecting “critical information about what’s happening on the ground.” While the military &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55889565"&gt;reportedly locked down overall internet access&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the coup, the disruption was apparently temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zng2if"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook removed a military TV network’s page&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj8pRJ"&gt;The post reportedly says Facebook is also attempting to track pages taken over by the military. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-myanmar-coup-facebook-bans-national-military-tv-networks-page-11612272870"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; wrote yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook had banned a page for a military television network, and Frankel said it was working to “stop misinformation and content that could incite further tensions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ka3O5k"&gt;In 2018, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17785522/facebook-myanmar-ethnic-violence-banned-accounts-military-genocide"&gt;purged many military accounts&lt;/a&gt; that helped incite genocidal violence against the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority after the United Nations &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-un/myanmar-generals-had-genocidal-intent-against-rohingya-must-face-justice-u-n-idUSKCN1LC0KN"&gt;issued a report&lt;/a&gt; condemning Facebook’s “slow and ineffective” response. However, Facebook’s semi-independent oversight board recently overturned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254155/facebook-oversight-board-first-rulings-coronavirus-misinformation-hate-speech"&gt;one ban of an anti-Muslim post&lt;/a&gt; in Myanmar, saying that it did not rise to the level of hate speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOhs6L"&gt;Facebook’s “temporary high-risk location” designation isn’t new. The label was applied to Washington, DC on January 6th after supporters of former President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-labeled-us-a-high-risk-location-amid-capitol-riot-report-says/"&gt;attempted to overturn the results&lt;/a&gt; of the US election. The decision was followed by Facebook banning Trump from Facebook and Instagram — another decision that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256821/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board-public-feedback"&gt;will soon be scrutinized&lt;/a&gt; by the oversight board.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok reduces India staff after long-standing countrywide ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TikTok Banned In India" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pcO9_NPjD5NuV6g52bSKM1wjps0=/0x104:5035x3461/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759734/1223851409.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KWGo7c"&gt;More than seven months after India issued a countrywide ban on TikTok, the app is significantly reducing its staffing in the country. On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/TikTok-gives-up-on-India-months-after-government-ban"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that TikTok was “essentially withdrawing” from India, citing sources familiar with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arbpl7"&gt;Reached for comment, a TikTok spokesperson confirmed that it was reducing its workforce in India but disputed the details of &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzDLQ6"&gt;In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge: “&lt;/em&gt;Given the lack of feedback from the government about how to resolve this issue in the subsequent seven months, it is with deep sadness that we have decided to reduce our workforce in India... [We] hope to get the chance to relaunch TikTok in India to support the hundreds of millions of users, artists, story-tellers, educators and performers there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVevEC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reported that “most” local employees were set to be laid off. The TikTok spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that “well more than 100” would remain with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahfgGs"&gt;India was previously a large market for TikTok, which is owned by the Beijing-based firm ByteDance: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307014/india-ban-tiktok-wechat-china-apps"&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of TikTok’s downloads came from India as of April 2020. As of June, the app had about 167 million users in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I21jbv"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “It is with deep sadness that we have decided to reduce our workforce in India”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eRDN0q"&gt;TikTok has been banned in India since June 29th. In its &lt;a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1635206#"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, the country’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology stated that the apps were “engaged in activities which is prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Htorks"&gt;ByteDance, at the time, did not indicate plans to pull out. Following the announcement, the head of TikTok India issued a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TikTok_IN/status/1277811841364668416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1277811841364668416%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F6%2F29%2F21307014%2Findia-ban-tiktok-wechat-china-apps"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; claiming that the company had not shared Indian users’ information with the Chinese government and that its practices were in compliance with India’s data privacy and security requirements. “We have been invited to meet with concerned government stakeholders for an opportunity to respond and submit clarifications,” the statement read. “We place the highest importance on user privacy and integrity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmDoKm"&gt;That wasn’t TikTok’s first quarrel with the Indian government. Indian lawmakers, including the information technology minister of Tamil Nadu, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/13/18223590/tiktok-india-ban-legislation-government-teens"&gt;called for the app to be banned&lt;/a&gt; in early 2019, citing concerns about the behavior of teens and young adults on the service. Apple and Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18411013/tiktok-india-google-play-block-apple-app-store-bytedance"&gt;pulled the app&lt;/a&gt; from their respective stores in India in mid-April, following a state court request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDDObX"&gt;That ban was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18515035/tiktok-is-no-longer-banned-in-india"&gt;lifted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18515035/tiktok-is-no-longer-banned-in-india"&gt;j&lt;/a&gt;ust over a week later, and didn’t impact folks who were already using TikTok; it merely prevented new downloads. Even so, TikTok claimed that it suffered up to $500,000 in losses each day the ban was in effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zsl3EM"&gt;“We are committed to continuously enhancing our safety features as a testament to our ongoing commitment to our users in India,” ByteDance said, following the lift of the ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YN5itf"&gt;Other countries have long-running security concerns with TikTok as well. The Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160239/tiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department"&gt;attempted&lt;/a&gt; to block transactions between ByteDance and US companies last year but was blocked from doing so by the courts. Several &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150667/tsa-tiktok-employee-ban-bytedance-chuck-schumer-homeland-security"&gt;US government agencies&lt;/a&gt; have banned the use of the app on government-issued devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1A01OJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 02/03/21 11:03AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added TikTok’s estimate of the number of local employees remaining with the company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s electric Rivian vans will start making deliveries in 16 cities this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tg0xW5jCDzN1vPBt6_bgG2C5ZjQ=/0x1:611x408/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68762710/Screen_Shot_2021_02_03_at_10.29.15_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FsTkmh"&gt;Amazon’s new electric delivery vans will hit the road in more than a dozen cities starting this year, the company announced Wednesday. The vans, which are being designed and built by buzzy EV startup Rivian, are already making deliveries to customers in Los Angeles. Amazon plans to expand its testing to 15 more cities this year, as it continues to build toward &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507495/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-date-specs"&gt;a fleet of 100,000 vehicles by 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The companies did not name which cities they would choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJZoCm"&gt;In a short video published today, Amazon touts the fact that the vans were designed, built, and are now being tested within a year. “We’re loving the enthusiasm from customers so far—from the photos we see online to the car fans who stop our drivers for a first-hand look at the vehicle,” said Ross Rachey, director of Amazon’s Global Fleet and Products, &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/amazons-custom-electric-delivery-vehicles-are-starting-to-hit-the-road"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “From what we’ve seen, this is one of the fastest modern commercial electrification programs, and we’re incredibly proud of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aHfZl7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIt-QcxhZDc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o2nVpP"&gt;Rivian is a relatively new name in the electric vehicle industry, having only debuted its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18111782/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-price-specs-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18113257/rivian-r1s-suv-electric-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;SUV&lt;/a&gt; at the end of November 2018 — despite operating in stealth since 2009. Originally founded to make something that competed with Tesla’s first car, the Roadster, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17380600/rivian-electric-truck-pickup-suv-interview-rj-scaringe"&gt;pivoted the company toward a more action-adventure customer segment&lt;/a&gt; of SUVs and pickup trucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTaBrp"&gt;Since coming out of stealth, Rivian has hauled in a series of enormous investments from several major players. Amazon led a $700 million round in February 2019, followed by $500 million from Ford in April 2019. Most recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238670/rivian-funding-amazon-electric-truck-suv"&gt;Rivian landed $2.65 billion&lt;/a&gt; from T. Rowe Price and Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund. (Jeff Bezos recently announced he would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;stepping down as CEO&lt;/a&gt; to devote more attention to the initiative.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bfQCc"&gt;Rivian has shown off two vehicles so far: the R1T pickup and the R1S SUV. Built on the same architecture as the delivery van, Rivian claims its vehicles — which will start at around $70,000 — will be able to travel up to around 400 miles on a single charge, hit 60 miles per hour in under three seconds, and eventually be able to drive themselves in some capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKm9js"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873947/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-jeff-bezos-order"&gt;originally announced the new delivery van&lt;/a&gt; as part of its climate pledge to become &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873834/amazon-sustainability-jeff-bezos-climate-change-pledge-emissions-paris-accord"&gt;a carbon-neutral company by 2040&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7FKBqu"&gt;It’s funny that Amazon’s Rachey mentions the photos of the delivery van posted online. Curious passers-by have also captured the shall-we-say unique external sound that emanates from the van while parked or traveling at low speeds. Electric vehicles can be notably silent when compared to their internal combustion engine-having counterparts, so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/16/20869035/electric-car-ev-fake-noise-nhtsa"&gt;regulators require them to produce an artificial sound&lt;/a&gt; when traveling at low speeds to alert pedestrians and other road users that may not otherwise hear the approaching vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8i5AOC"&gt;Based on the spacey, sci-fi-ish sound that has been selected, it would seem that Rivian was going for something that could best be described as “chill/lo-fi beats to relax/study to playlist.” &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/38717/listen-to-the-loud-irritating-noise-made-by-amazons-electric-rivian-delivery-vans"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; citing a post from &lt;em&gt;Drive Tesla Canada&lt;/em&gt;, the Rivian vans’ artificial sound is so loud, it can be heard from inside someone’s house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5K80pI"&gt;It’s not clear whether this will be the final sound used for all of Amazon’s delivery fleet. In other words, there’s still time to change it. Please change it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AiFMwI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MLB The Show is coming to both PlayStation and Xbox consoles on April 20th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SHv96JztiVSXXCYBNIsPT0y-FDo=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68751153/mt7n8pjsywpuomikztyd.10.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fkU00d"&gt;We already knew Sony’s beloved sports exclusive &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show &lt;/em&gt;would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21004103/sony-mlb-the-show-playstation-exclusivity-ending"&gt;release on “additional consoles”&lt;/a&gt; as early as 2021. Today, &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/02/01/introducing-our-mlb-the-show-21-cover-athlete-fernando-tatis-jr/"&gt;Sony announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show 21&lt;/em&gt; will release on April 20th on the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFZ7nS"&gt;This is the first entry in the &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show&lt;/em&gt; series that will release on Microsoft’s home consoles, but Sony isn’t just offering the game on the Xbox for the first time. &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show&lt;/em&gt; 21 will also support full cross-platform progression, cross-saves, and online multiplayer between PlayStation and Xbox consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P2qG8P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;MLB The Show launches day and date on PS4 and PS5 with cross-platform play on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Xbox&lt;/a&gt; One and Xbox Series X|S  &lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1356241272831438850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nOuUCx"&gt;Similar to other cross-gen titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403145/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-next-gen-price-playstation-xbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Madden NFL 21&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21311250/nba-2k21-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-versions-70-dollars-next-gen-price-increase-games#:~:text=Share%20All%20sharing%20options%20for,a%20next%2Dgen%20price%20jump&amp;amp;text=2K%20Games%20has%20announced%20that,PS4%20versions%20of%20the%20game."&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBA 2K21&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show 21&lt;/em&gt; will retail for different prices, depending on which version you buy. If you get the Standard Edition on PS4 or Xbox One, it will cost $60. On PS5 or Xbox Series X / S, it’ll cost $70, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M8WBYa"&gt;If you purchase the Standard Edition on last-gen (PS4 or Xbox One) and upgrade to a next-gen console, you won’t be able to upgrade your copy of the game to the PS5 or Xbox Series X / S version. However, &lt;a href="https://theshow.com/faq/"&gt;Sony’s FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; revealed that if you buy the Collector’s Edition of &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show 21&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;you’ll receive both the current and next-gen versions of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhlHFD"&gt;Sony also announced &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/02/03/jackie-robinson-graces-the-cover-of-mlb-the-show-21-collectors-editions/"&gt;three different Collector’s Editions&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show 21&lt;/em&gt;: the Jackie Robinson Edition ($85), Digital Deluxe Edition ($100), and the Jackie Robinson Deluxe Edition ($100). Each version includes both a current-gen copy of the game (on disc, for the physical editions) and a redeemable code for a digital next-gen copy of the game. More importantly, the Collector’s Editions will launch four days early on April 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChrHnF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MLB The Show&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;21 &lt;/em&gt;is a huge win for Xbox owners. In the past, if you wanted a good baseball game, you needed a PlayStation console to play one. In recent years, &lt;em&gt;RBI Baseball&lt;/em&gt; served as an alternative to Xbox players, but by splitting its focus between arcade and simulation styles, it's &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/4/17191164/rbi-baseball-18-review"&gt;never been a true contender&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BYzJhHkvXbhGS36G3yGj-x5_1bs=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68762416/VRG_ILLO_4364_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xcZSyZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gcqkd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracy* kept it together &lt;/strong&gt;when her mom died in mid-March in New York. She kept it together when she came back from the funeral on an Amtrak rather than an airplane because there were no flights operating to get her home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOqtRc"&gt;It wasn’t until she went back to her job as a flight attendant and saw out of the galley window row upon row of airplanes stacked &lt;a href="https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2020/03/31/pittsburgh-international-airport-parked-planes-coronavirus/"&gt;nose to tail&lt;/a&gt; with cloth covers over their engines and sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KFlkC"&gt;Tracy has been flying for over 16 years. She worked during the Great Recession, when &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/business/07outlook.html"&gt;passenger traffic fell by 10 percent&lt;/a&gt; and forced &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airline_bankruptcies_in_the_United_States#Chapter_11"&gt;several airlines to declare bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;. She worked during the years of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/business/us-issues-first-fine-for-tarmac-delays.html"&gt;nightmarish tarmac delays&lt;/a&gt; prior to 2010, when airlines weren’t required to taxi back to the gate to let passengers off even after delays of three or more hours. And she worked during the SARS epidemic in 2004, H1N1 in 2009, and the Ebola scare in 2014. But nothing in her training or her experience prepared her for the sight of so many airplanes from so many airlines with nowhere to go and no passengers to fly. For the first time in her entire career, she broke down and cried while on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhM19x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This has to be the beginning of the end&lt;/em&gt;, she thought. &lt;em&gt;How are we going to recover from this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AMr9RAmc24YaM3398cKUWMoVRoQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277439/4364_going_up_800.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="1UKmIC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two months earlier,&lt;/strong&gt; in January 2020, the outlook for the year was bright. Airlines had just posted their seventh consecutive year of &lt;a href="https://www.bts.gov/newsroom/2019-annual-and-4th-quarter-us-airline-financial-data"&gt;multibillion-dollar profits&lt;/a&gt; and were expected to continue doing &lt;a href="https://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Airline-News/IATA-forecasts-higher-airline-profits-in-2020"&gt;just as well&lt;/a&gt;. For an industry historically defined by cycles of boom and bust, there seemed to be no storm clouds on the horizon — the economy was good, gas prices were stable, and business travel was expected to grow to a record &lt;a href="https://www.travelpulse.com/news/business-travel/gbta-forecasts-global-business-travel-spend-to-reach-16-trillion-by-2020.html"&gt;$1.6 trillion&lt;/a&gt; for the full year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVf8aH"&gt;But then the bottom fell out of commercial aviation. On March 1st, nearly 2.3 million passengers took a flight somewhere in the United States. Just 30 days later, &lt;a href="https://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Airline-News/IATA-forecasts-higher-airline-profits-in-2020"&gt;that number was just over  136,000&lt;/a&gt;, a 94 percent drop against the previous year. And the number would keep falling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOf2UK"&gt;Airlines were pushed to the brink. Delta burned through &lt;a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/coronavirus-delta-air-lines-cash-burn-revenue"&gt;$60 million&lt;/a&gt; in cash a day; American Airlines, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Finvesting%2F2020%2F03%2F18%2Fcoronavirus-has-cash-rich-airlines-scrambling.aspx&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22258257%2Fflight-attendants-history-covid-pandemic-airline-industry-aviation#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$70 million&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/30/848704986/american-airlines-and-united-report-nearly-4-billion-in-combined-losses"&gt;United&lt;/a&gt;, $100 million. In April, Congress passed the CARES Act, which included $25 billion in loans and grants to keep payrolls full and airlines out of bankruptcy, but even that was only enough to keep the industry afloat for six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntmQK0"&gt;In October, with the COVID-19 pandemic showing no signs of abatement and Congress failing to pass an extension to the CARES Act, airline executives switched to plan B. They &lt;a href="https://airlinegeeks.com/2020/10/08/american-airlines-halts-routes-after-cares-expiration/"&gt;stopped service to smaller airports&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-havoc-forces-airlines-to-retire-iconic-planes-sooner-2020-3"&gt;retired entire fleets&lt;/a&gt; of aircraft. They took on a collective &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/01/us-airline-2-losses-expected-to-top-35-billion-in-dismal-2020-from-pandemic.html"&gt;$67 billion&lt;/a&gt; in new debt — including some creative new strategies, like mortgaging their &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/united-to-put-up-frequent-flier-program-for-5-billion-loan-11592227825"&gt;frequent flyer programs&lt;/a&gt;. But most of all, they tried to scratch what revenue they could out of the few people willing to travel. And there was no guarantee these drastic measures would work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUreki"&gt;“We’ve got 12 to 15 months of pain, sacrifice, and difficulty ahead,” said Scott Kirby, CEO of United Airlines, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/10/15/924225784/united-airlines-reports-1-8-billion-loss-but-looks-ahead-to-friendlier-skies"&gt;in mid-October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWGEk1"&gt;And the nation’s flight attendants would have to bear more pain, sacrifice, and difficulty than most. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bm5d6I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDz8cCwApaB7HP79jc1b4yvnPjM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277129/4364_mask_police.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="bBolUM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On March 17th,&lt;/strong&gt; the Department of Homeland Security designated airlines as “critical infrastructure” and &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA-Guidance-on-Essential-Critical-Infrastructure-Workers-1-20-508c.pdf"&gt;flight attendants as “essential workers.”&lt;/a&gt; This wasn’t an honorific: in the DHS’s own words, essential workers “have a special responsibility to maintain your work schedule” and ensure “continuity of functions.” And as flight attendants went back to work, they found that they were not returning to friendly skies. Just as the pandemic changed everything else about travel, it’s also turned their chief role — as the face of the airline from takeoff to landing — from a source of pride into a source of dread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgEsgO"&gt;Within weeks, &lt;a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/american-southwest-airlines-employees-test-positive-covid-19/287-f23b904a-60d0-49f5-8c45-30137c1e2891"&gt;several hundred flight attendants&lt;/a&gt; tested positive for COVID-19. By the end of April, it had claimed the lives of five. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JoEso"&gt;“Once it started going like wildfire, there was a lot of fear within the flight attendant community,” recalled Lori Lochelt, who flew for 22 years. “There was so much unknown about the virus. Could it live on metal surfaces, the seat back pockets, the tray tables?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jceThx"&gt;Despite this, most major airlines were rumored to &lt;a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/american-airlines-flight-attendants-risk-discipline-for-wearing-protective-face-masks/"&gt;actively prohibit&lt;/a&gt; flight attendants from wearing masks while on-duty, although only American Airlines went on record acknowledging such a policy. (At the time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that only people with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General/status/1244020292365815809"&gt;COVID symptoms&lt;/a&gt; wear a mask).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g1nP2j"&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="otIDF2"&gt;“This did not make sense to us,” said Paul Hartshorn, Jr., the head of communications for the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), which represents the 27,000 US-based flight attendants at American Airlines. “Our major fight was to move the airlines towards a policy of everyone wearing some face covering in the airplane cabin. It just had to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4hp166"&gt;By &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/23/business/united-airlines-coronavirus-masks-flight-attendants/index.html"&gt;April&lt;/a&gt;, airlines allowed their cabin crews to wear masks. And &lt;a href="https://hub.united.com/2020-06-15-united-airlines-strengthens-onboard-mask-policy-to-further-protect-passengers-and-employees-against-covid-19-spread-2646175010.html"&gt;a month&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://news.delta.com/facecoverings"&gt;later&lt;/a&gt;, they required passengers to mask up, too. Flight attendants became the mask police, which led to even more trouble — both on the ground and in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxjITP"&gt;“At least one passenger on every flight has a mask issue,” said Connor*, a flight attendant with two years of experience. “It gets a little bit tiring to have to remind people, and when you remind them they get a little upset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgvPrQ"&gt;Tracy agreed. “You always have a couple of jerky people. You can remove your mask when you’re eating or drinking, so you have the guy eating one sunflower seed at a time so he can keep the mask off the whole flight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YHjaKN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What a shitshow it was. I didn’t want to fly in this environment anymore.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="C6sBQI"&gt;Sometimes, passengers get outright belligerent. In late October, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMho5p3DMoE"&gt;a viral video&lt;/a&gt; showed someone slap a flight attendant in the face when she tried to enforce the mask policy during boarding. The offender was quickly de-boarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVe7if"&gt;Other passengers make it all the way to their seats before picking a fight over masks. And although flight attendants have the law on their side, quoting federal regulations at a disobedient passenger does little to get them to actually wear a mask if they don’t want to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiCq0K"&gt;Ben*, the lead attendant on a Boston-bound flight, found this out the hard way. After takeoff, one of his colleagues told him that there was a passenger on board who had taken off her mask and was refusing to wear it, despite pleas from every single one of the cabin crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvKTLx"&gt;“I’m a free American and you can’t make me,” she told them. “Stop infringing on my rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZtBqa"&gt;The best Ben could do was give the customer a so-called “yellow card,” a slip of paper first pioneered by &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/162805.stm"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; (hence the soccer reference) that warns passengers: follow crew member instructions or get banned from the airlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMLFuZ"&gt;She remained maskless for the rest of the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSYH3a"&gt;The pandemic has laid bare the many ways airlines tend to leave their flight attendants out on a metaphorical island, without the tools or support to deal with the difficult situations they might face in the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4eWPE"&gt;Of the 40 flight attendants who talked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, only one recalled an instance where a flight was diverted to deal with an especially unruly maskless passenger. The rest of the time, the cabin crew — and the passengers around the offender — just had to grit their teeth and endure the risks until they landed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E88gbq"&gt;“What a shitshow it was,” said Lochelt, who took early retirement in August because of the pandemic travel conditions. “I didn’t want to fly in this environment anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0Cl4m"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SidvNjYE4at1rBjVj18Put4s7wk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277084/4364_business_beer.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="EZmMd1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It might seem like the job&lt;/strong&gt; has gotten a lot worse from the so-called Golden Age of travel between 1960 and 1978. Dinah Barron-Hess, who flew during the ‘70s and wrote about her experiences in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fly-Life-Aloft-Dinah-Barron-Hess-ebook/dp/B072MHHNRZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fly By: A Life Aloft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, recalled an age of “caviar, prime rib carved in the aisle, an ice cream sundae cart and every top shelf wine, champagne, and liquor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcCiEQ"&gt;“First class was truly first class,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “There were fewer people, and I had more time to be a gracious hostess.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwmdpN"&gt;And more time to accrue some amazing stories. In February 1979, Barron-Hess was trying to prepare her first class section for landing when a drunken passenger blocked her way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yPsVy"&gt;“Do you need a ride into the city?” he said. “I have a limo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtSVDX"&gt;Behind her, someone spoke up. It was a voice that was unmistakable to everyone in the cabin — in fact, it would have been unmistakable to almost everyone in America at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkjDN7"&gt;“She has a ride to the city,” said the voice, “with &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0VSTKE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Flight attendant training is 95% emergency preparation training, and 5% service training”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9QxIW4"&gt;Dressed in a dark suit, a narrow black tie, and his trademark horn-rimmed glasses was legendary actor Cary Grant. He was in his 70s at the time — but, said Barron-Hess, still incredibly handsome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDZ8kc"&gt;Awestruck, her harasser backed off. Grant, true to his word, did indeed take her into the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v84vJG"&gt;Nowadays, the inflight service is not quite so glamorous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19tz7U"&gt;“Most people don’t really realize, flight attendant training is 95% emergency preparation training, and 5% service training,” said Joe Thomas, who hosts the &lt;a href="https://groundedwithflightattendantjoe.podbean.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grounded with Flight Attendant Joe&lt;/em&gt; podcast&lt;/a&gt;. “Which is weird, because when you get on the plane, it’s the complete opposite.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gySKQx"&gt;Still, although in-flight celebrity encounters are rare, normal passengers provide more than enough entertaining stories. Before a departure in Las Vegas, Thomas was surprised to see two passengers coming down the jetway with a third, completely limp, dangling between them with an arm around each of their shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6NUV7"&gt;“Hi guys,” he said, “is everything okay?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MkCwU"&gt;One of the men gestured to their unconscious friend. “Oh yeah,” he said. “Dan’s just a little tired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ey29C4"&gt;Thomas could smell the alcohol even from inside the airplane. Dan wasn’t just a little tired; he was flammable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wybr1x"&gt;“Sorry, fellas,” he said. “Dan isn’t going anywhere today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6iaf0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z5oYRMkQbTqeaAQWHxLyr_n1uXc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277196/7ca5c42acf5daf597b8d49fc5833fcce.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Southwest Airlines ad from the 1970s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="XpvWbD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If there’s one constant&lt;/strong&gt; between the age of COVID and the mythical Golden Age of flying, it’s that flight attendants have to deal with harassment on a daily basis. Nowadays, it’s much more overtly hostile. But even in the Golden Age, it was there: rampant sexism that often rose to the level of sexual assault. And in both cases, it was caused by the massive economic pressures that come with such a volatile industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uj5ssk"&gt;In the 1960s, the average flight was only &lt;a href="https://airlines.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1968.pdf"&gt;half full&lt;/a&gt;: all of that champagne and lobster might cause the well-heeled to flock to first class, but it didn’t fill the tens of millions of empty seats in the back of the airplane. So airlines sought a competitive edge that everyone could appreciate. And they found it in their cabin crews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PD2QiU"&gt;As long as there have been flight attendants, there have been overly friendly passengers, as one “air hostess” &lt;a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1936/04/12/85301712.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&amp;amp;ip=0"&gt;told&lt;em&gt; The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1936. “It’s usually at the end of the run when we’re off duty and the man is away from home and lonesome,” she said. “If we like him we sometimes go to dinner and a show — if we aren’t already going out with the pilot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfNF9l"&gt;But in the 1960s, airlines learned to weaponize this interest. They hired flight attendants with &lt;a href="https://clickamericana.com/topics/money-work/fly-girls-stewardess-job-requirements-of-the-50s-60s"&gt;a specific “look”&lt;/a&gt;: women no older than 27, weighing less than 135 pounds, between 5’2” and 5’7” in height, and “unencumbered” by a husband. And each airline hired for different personalities. Pan Am stewardesses were sophisticated and worldly. Braniff and Pacific Southwest, sexy and flirtatious. United wanted the “girl next door.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fZSOBw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Anyone who got engaged or pregnant could be fired on the spot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bjr3Lp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkFt5V09HzU"&gt;A TV commercial for Eastern Air Lines&lt;/a&gt; dramatized the process — but only slightly — by having a Woody Allen sound-alike dismiss a parade of young women who weren’t a fit: “She’s awkward.” “She’s married.” “She wears glasses. Honey, no.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGdxZr"&gt;Even with such strict guidelines, airlines had a wealth of applicants. In 1961, Pan Am placed a recruiting ad in a London newspaper for flight attendants. A thousand women responded: the airline hired just 17, including Betty Riegel, who flew for eight years and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Up-Air-Aboard-Glamorous-Airline/dp/147111225X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote a book&lt;/a&gt; about her experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmUZWr"&gt;She can still remember the airline’s grooming standards: hair above the collar, no necklaces or bracelets, eye shadow in regulation blue, and only one approved shade of lipstick — “Persian melon” by Revlon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUX7mx"&gt;“We were required to wear girdles,” she added. “Every month, the supervisor would get the scales out to check we hadn’t gone over our maximum weight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdB63g"&gt;Above all else, flight attendants must always remain young and unattached. Anyone who got engaged or pregnant could be fired on the spot. And no matter what, your career was over &lt;a href="https://theweek.com/articles/466935/10-shocking-secrets-flight-attendants"&gt;as soon as you turned 32&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="my422H"&gt;Yet, every new hire at every airline had one trait in common, as Barron-Hess found out from a drunk HR executive one evening: across the entire industry, he told her, recruiters primarily looked for “tens who think they are sixes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEee3e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ivZMZZ8zHSgnYxeCef5no5dJuE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277599/coffeeteaormeuni00bake_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cover of Coffee, Tea or Me? from 1967.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="mYg7Ho"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 1967, the airlines’&lt;/strong&gt; soft sell of their cabin crews turned harder. Two flight attendants named Trudy Baker and Rachel Jones &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/coffeeteaormeuni00bake/page/n3/mode/2up"&gt;published a book&lt;/a&gt; that purported to be “the uninhibited memoirs of two airline stewardesses.” But mainly, it was positioned as a step-by-step guide to picking up flight attendants, who, the book assured readers, were ready and willing targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5EKea"&gt;“Good or bad, meeting men is the name of the stewardess game,” wrote Baker and Jones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFxzwe"&gt;The book was a smash hit, selling &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/coffeeteaormegir00bake"&gt;3 million copies&lt;/a&gt; and spawning three sequels — except Trudy Baker and Rachel Jones didn’t exist. The book had actually been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/obituaries/donald-bain-dead-widely-read-author-but-not-by-that-name.html?searchResultPosition=5"&gt;written by an American Airlines publicist&lt;/a&gt; named Donald Bain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmDKsm"&gt;Truthful or not, &lt;em&gt;Coffee, Tea, or Me?&lt;/em&gt; planted the image of “stewardess sexpots” in the popular imagination, and airlines were quick to capitalize on it. &lt;a href="https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-ceo/2017/may/southwest-airlines-50-year-anniversary-love-field-dallas/"&gt;Miniskirts and go-go boots&lt;/a&gt; became part of the standard uniform at Southwest Airlines. Braniff featured &lt;a href="https://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/when-airline-fashion-was-flying-high/"&gt;designer catsuits&lt;/a&gt; in psychedelic patterns. And Trans World Airlines made its flight attendants don &lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_af6xrbETC0/WJJxfytHatI/AAAAAAAABAc/osJvlHaPfMoGb_BGcpTDpq7gUebnbexTwCLcB/s1600/Taste%2Bof%2BEurope.jpg"&gt;disposable paper outfits&lt;/a&gt; in styles like “British wench,” “Roman toga,” or “Manhattan penthouse” just before meal service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E4wyLu"&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pjh8HS"&gt;No one was more on the nose than National Airlines and its 1971 “Fly Me” campaign. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFjJXFmuEqM"&gt;In one commercial&lt;/a&gt;, a bikini-clad flight attendant named Judy runs down the beach while she says in voice over, “Fly me to Houston. Or fly me to New Orleans. You can fly me morning, noon, and night. Just say when!” The campaign drove a &lt;a href="https://style.time.com/2012/08/07/virgin-americas-new-uniforms-a-75-year-history-of-fashion-in-flight/slide/national-airlines-1971/"&gt;23 percent increase in passenger bookings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMQUpd"&gt;More than a few passengers took that image a little too seriously. In her 1974 memoir &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sex_Objects_in_the_Sky/i8UgAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sex Objects in the Sky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, American Airlines flight attendant Paula Kane talked about the barrage of harassment that she had to endure in the wake of &lt;em&gt;Coffee, Tea, or Me?&lt;/em&gt; — everything from “patting and pinching” to full-on sexual assault. One elderly passenger asked a colleague of Kane’s to retrieve his coat from the overhead compartment for him. When she did, he shoved his hand up her skirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58jL10"&gt;When asked what the airline was doing to stop such handsy behavior, one supervisor &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sex+objects+in+the+sky+patting&amp;amp;tbm=bks&amp;amp;ei=rUpVX7K9KormsAWvl62oAw&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyx4OWs9XrAhUKM6wKHa9LCzUQsJ4FCAM"&gt;replied&lt;/a&gt;, “They might get a pat, but the girls are moving so fast they scarcely have time to get pinched.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xas367"&gt;Forty years later, the problem persists. A &lt;a href="https://www.afacwa.org/metoo#a6"&gt;2018 survey&lt;/a&gt; by the Association of Flight Attendants found that 68 percent of flight attendants have experienced sexual harassment at some point during their careers, and 1 in 5 have been physically assaulted on an airplane in the prior year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5reObg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re at 36,000 feet with nowhere to go.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="d6bhWe"&gt;One passenger &lt;a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/flight-attendants-share-their-own-sexual-harassment-stories-both-as-victims-and-offenders/"&gt;pulled a female flight attendant&lt;/a&gt; down into his lap and asked if she wanted to join the mile-high club. Another &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-travel-fly-guy-sexual-harassment-flight-attendants-20190506-story.html"&gt;slapped a flight attendant&lt;/a&gt; on the buttocks as she bent over to get a can of pop out of the drinks cart for him. Others ask flight attendants where their “&lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/10/news/airline-attendant-sexual-harassment-survey/index.html"&gt;hottest layover&lt;/a&gt;” was or whether they “&lt;a href="https://www.cbs8.com/article/news/local/flight-attendants-allege-american-airlines-ignored-complaints-about-pilot/509-b77f1f4f-a47d-4504-b2a8-47f02a691d69"&gt;wanna come to my room and tie me up?&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUTuUE"&gt;For their part, flight attendants try to brush it off as just part of the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dt3wD"&gt;“You can tell that type of person,” said Tracy. “The kind of guy that would want to hit on a flight attendant is the same guy who would hit on the bartender, the waitress, anyone in that serving role. Depending on the person, they can take it too far.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ox5V8u"&gt;But flight attendants who are the victims of sexual harassment &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3234856"&gt;also experience&lt;/a&gt; higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0r9tDu"&gt;“We’re at 36,000 feet with nowhere to go,” a flight attendant named Teri &lt;a href="https://www.nprillinois.org/post/flight-attendants-say-they-havent-been-trained-how-deal-sexual-harassment#stream/0"&gt;told NPR in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. “So if something happens in the air, you’re forced to deal with that until you’re on the ground.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ei9f2Q"&gt;If it happens at all. This past March, the &lt;a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2020-03/Task%20Force%20Report.pdf"&gt;Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; released a study on in-flight sexual assault, which found that “airlines generally do not contact law enforcement every time that they learn of an in-flight sexual misconduct incident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpmMip"&gt;In that same report, the DOT asked the 12 largest US-based air carriers if they would be willing to revise their process for reporting in-flight harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cX3xS6"&gt;“Most of them responded that they would not,” it concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJlHCM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I became a flight attendant because&lt;/strong&gt; I wanted to travel,” said Joe Thomas. “A lot of people say, &lt;em&gt;oh, it’s because I want to give good customer service&lt;/em&gt;. But I don’t really believe that. I believe you become a flight attendant because you want to see the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcCSeK"&gt;The job itself pays a wage that is &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000"&gt;right at the national median&lt;/a&gt;. But you get free flights in your off-time and discounted hotels, cruises, rental cars, and pretty much everything else related to hospitality. On the job, you have a flexible work schedule and freedom from much direct supervision. And you get to visit a different city every day just by going to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyjskC"&gt;Betty Riegel, who worked Pan Am’s Pacific routes out of San Francisco in the 1960s, would often spend days-long layovers in places like Tahiti, Sydney, Manila, and even the occasional war zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYbuGm"&gt;“We flew Vietnam out of San Francisco,” she recalled, “and so we were landing in Saigon with the snipers’ bullets flying all around us. And staying at altitude until the last minute, and coming down almost vertically.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OW2Cba"&gt;The flip side of it is missed holidays, family gatherings, and an unpredictable early career. It’s not until flight attendants accrue seniority, which can take a year at a small airline, and five or more at the legacies, that they have control over when they work and where they go. And that still doesn’t mean you’re working on the same schedule as the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EljyKY"&gt;“It’s not your usual 9 to 5. It is completely a lifestyle you have to adapt to,” said Tracy. “You really have to alter your entire existence, and if you hang on, the rewards on the tail end are worth it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSoYoI"&gt;That lifestyle is also a big reason why so many gay men turn to flying. In 2015, a &lt;a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2016/01/18/there-may-be-some-truth-to-the-gay-jobs-stereotype/"&gt;London School of Economics&lt;/a&gt; study found that, proportionally speaking, there are more gay men working as flight attendants than there are working as hair stylists or nurses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IhieDo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Becoming a flight attendant didn’t just change my life, it &lt;em&gt;saved&lt;/em&gt; my life”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Cdpswo"&gt;Flying first became a refuge for gay men in the 1950s, according to &lt;a href="https://www.k-state.edu/history/faculty-staff/tiemeyer.html"&gt;Phil Tiemeyer&lt;/a&gt;, a historian of gender and sexuality at Kansas State University. For the entire decade, federal and state governments barred gay men and women from an increasing number of careers: &lt;a href="https://www.navalhistory.org/2018/03/26/key-dates-in-u-s-military-lgbt-policy"&gt;the military&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_10450"&gt;civil service&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/lgbtqheritage/upload/lgbtqtheme-law.pdf"&gt;many professional jobs&lt;/a&gt; — teachers, doctors, lawyers, even bartenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHludd"&gt;Airlines only hired a few hundred men as cabin crew in the 1950s (and &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/gendersarchive1998-2013/2007/06/01/male-stewardesses-male-flight-attendants-queer-miscarriage-justice"&gt;virtually&lt;/a&gt; none between 1960 and 1971). But a &lt;a href="https://slate.com/culture/2013/07/gay-male-flight-attendants-in-im-so-excited-the-history-of-the-gay-steward-stereotype.html"&gt;huge proportion&lt;/a&gt; were gay — up to 90 percent, according to some former stewards. And they found, ironically, that the very policies that forced women out of the profession allowed gay men to stay in it. Male stewards didn’t have to retire upon turning 32. Marriage restrictions didn’t apply to male stewards at the time, and they obviously didn’t get pregnant, either. So while female flight attendants stayed on the job for an average of &lt;a href="https://unitedafa.org/afa/about/milestones/"&gt;18 months&lt;/a&gt;, male flight attendants accrued experience and seniority that the constant influx of female new hires couldn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EdIKfF"&gt;So airlines tolerated gay men in the cabin, if only to keep their most senior stewards in place. And as airlines consolidated around major hubs — San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York — the pull toward aviation became even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vPkpsX"&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fQiwhg"&gt;As Tiemeyer described it: “You can make decent money, you can work with other gay men, you don’t have to worry about job security because the unions protect you and the companies decide to tolerate you, and you can go to all these exciting gay cities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FT3mWT"&gt;It’s a legacy that endures to this day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEtdbE"&gt;“I’m from a small town and always knew I wanted to get out and see the world,” said Rich, a flight attendant who blogs as one half of &lt;a href="http://www.twoguysonaplane.com/"&gt;twoguysonaplane.com&lt;/a&gt;. But it never seemed like he would get there. He was on food stamps, struggling to pay his rent every month. “A friend saw an ad for a flight attendant open house. They thought it would be the perfect summer job for me so I decided, why not?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Um39r6"&gt;It’s been seven years since he took a chance on air travel. In that time, he met his husband, who’s also a flight attendant, on a flight. Three years later, the two of them were married in an airplane hangar. They launched their travel blog together in Since 2017, they’ve blogged together at &lt;a href="http://www.twoguysonaplane.com/"&gt;twoguysonaplane.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIOHke"&gt;“As gay men, we often struggle while growing up with being labeled and feeling trapped,” he said. “Flying allows for a great deal of freedom to be exactly who you are, an opportunity which we don’t always receive as members of the LGBTQ+ community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uF9oAM"&gt;“Becoming a flight attendant didn’t just change my life, it &lt;em&gt;saved&lt;/em&gt; my life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQ4BjF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UHhRQ3t-QLNIstMjyaw6iWPnBCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277442/4364_going_down_800.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="6xOqQM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In times of crisis, though,&lt;/strong&gt; the lifestyle can keep flight attendants chained to a job whose other benefits are disappearing before their very eyes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5bBzD"&gt;In 1978, President Carter signed the &lt;a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/america-by-air/online/jetage/jetage08.cfm"&gt;Airline Deregulation Act&lt;/a&gt;, which dissolved commercial aviation’s regulated cartel and opened the industry to real competition for the first time in forty years. For consumers, this meant more flights and lower fares. By 1980, 134 new airlines were launched. Five years later, domestic capacity had increased by 50%, while the median ticket price had fallen by almost 25%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wF8xV"&gt;But it was a classic &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/260/250422.pdf"&gt;race to the bottom&lt;/a&gt;. That kind of lost revenue was unsustainable in an industry where profit margins rarely made it to double digits. By 1988, over 100 airlines had gone out of business. Even the legacy carriers that defined the Golden Age started to disappear: Braniff and National in 1982, Pan Am and Eastern in 1991. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DsXJba"&gt;To survive, airlines cut costs to the bone. In 1980, a mid-career flight attendant working a normal schedule made about $4,200 in today’s dollars. By 1995, a flight attendant with the same seniority and same hours would earn only $2,550 — a &lt;a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~card/papers/airline%20labor%20earnings.pdf"&gt;40% decrease&lt;/a&gt; in pay for the same work. And all but two airlines terminated their pension plans, refusing to pay out more than &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/260/250422.pdf"&gt;$12 billion in retirement benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="33Ncr3"&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PXUsjC"&gt;Wages and benefits weren’t the only things that airlines did away with post-deregulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39ucFi"&gt;“When airlines took away things that passengers took for granted — meals, blankets, pillows — it was always the flight attendants who were left to deliver the bad news,” said aviation historian and former flight attendant Gailen David, who flew between 1988 and 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCQlcD"&gt;The clientele changed, too. With the rise of the &lt;a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/evolution-frequent-flyer-programs/"&gt;modern frequent flyer program&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s, a new generation of passengers — largely business travelers who had previously flown economy — now found their way into first class. It was a good way to reward flyers whose steady demand has always kept airlines afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4sMK6"&gt;But some of them had trouble acclimating to the new amenities, as Cecilia*, a flight attendant who worked first class in the 1980s, recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8sfzP"&gt;“Sir, may I offer you some hors d’oeuvres?” she asked one particular passenger at the start of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lxstdo"&gt;He looked confused and pointed to the food cart. “What’s that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EL0RzW"&gt;“Sir, we have goose liver paté, smoked salmon, shrimp cocktail, and caviar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pae6NL"&gt;“Caviar?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mtzPn"&gt;“Uh, it’s roe,” she said. Then, she clarified: “fish eggs, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR93fi"&gt;He lit up. “Okay,” he said, “give me two. Make ‘em fried!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaawDe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IDXL6SFkcX7Plo8UDdBekBqlWlk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277381/4364_covid_640.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="W9wRq1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;None of aviation’s past crises,&lt;/strong&gt; however, compare to COVID-19. Not deregulation, not the 1973 oil crisis, not even September 11. To try and survive, airlines have cut schedules, &lt;a href="https://samchui.com/2020/05/10/covid-19-a-list-of-retired-aircraft/#.X4s1wdBKiUk"&gt;retired older airplanes&lt;/a&gt;, and borrowed over &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/airlines-plan-for-prolonged-coronavirus-travel-drought-11602848431"&gt;$100 billion&lt;/a&gt; in loans and Federal aid. They’ve invested in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/travel/coronavirus-airplane-cleaning.html"&gt;electrostatic sprayers and medical-grade disinfectant&lt;/a&gt;, in a bid to make people comfortable with flying again. And they’ve deployed their flight attendants not only to enforce their patchwork mask rules, but also to try and recreate some semblance of the way things used to be, even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_49kZe6VmUM"&gt;behind layers of personal protective equipment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5ZzOQ"&gt;But most of all, they’ve looked to reduce the largest line-item on every airline’s balance sheets: wages and benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTRW3m"&gt;“The potential for layoffs in the US aviation industry is staggering,” said AFPA’s Paul Hartshorn, Jr. “It’s like nothing we’ve ever seen before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6B40k"&gt;According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/transportation-and-material-moving/flight-attendants.htm"&gt;121,900&lt;/a&gt; flight attendants employed at the end of 2019. With the end of the &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/23/airlines-support-clean-payroll-support-extension-assuming-no-additional-strings-380180"&gt;Payroll Support Program&lt;/a&gt; in October, airlines furloughed more than &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/23/coronavirus-stimulus-gives-airlines-15-billion-to-call-back-furloughed-workers.html"&gt;1 in 4&lt;/a&gt; of them — 32,000 people over the course of three months. And there might have been even more furloughs if &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-airline-layoffs-industry-10-million-americans/"&gt;thousands more flight attendants&lt;/a&gt;, like Lori Lochelt and Joe Thomas, hadn’t taken early retirement or unpaid leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIOJzG"&gt;For Rich, the bad news arrived in mid-September. Over email, his airline informed him and hundreds of his colleagues that they would be furloughed. After he read it, he sat down on his staircase and cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RROvpR"&gt;Two days before Christmas, Congress passed a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-is-in-the-900-billion-covid-19-aid-bill-11608557531"&gt;$900 billion stimulus package&lt;/a&gt; that included $15 billion for airlines. They have already started to recall furloughed flight attendants, which is a condition of the stimulus package, but the process is slow. Rich has yet to receive his recall notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uczc27"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The potential for layoffs in the US aviation industry is staggering”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zUnGQt"&gt;Still, if his career has taught him anything, it’s to adjust to the circumstances, no matter what they might be. He plans to come back to flying when the jobs come back. Besides, he can’t imagine going back into the “real world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NA4sgr"&gt;Even so, a recall won’t be permanent. Federal payroll aid is scheduled to last for four months, and most airlines have characterized the recalls as &lt;a href="https://www.flyingmag.com/story/careers/covid-relief-bill-airlines-roll-back-layoff-notices/"&gt;“temporary employment” only&lt;/a&gt;. Come April, those 32,000 might find themselves out of work once again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1c8WBJ"&gt;And the rollout of vaccinations worldwide won’t restore air travel by then. Although airline executives like to claim that they’re seeing a “&lt;a href="https://news.delta.com/delta-air-lines-announces-september-quarter-financial-results"&gt;slow and steady build in demand&lt;/a&gt;” or that they’re positioned to “&lt;a href="https://hub.united.com/2020-10-14-as-q3-ends-united-airlines-shifts-from-surviving-the-covid-19-crisis-to-positioning-to-lead-the-rebound-2648210545.html"&gt;lead the rebound&lt;/a&gt;,” the reality is that airline revenues are down between 70% and 80% compared to 2019, and may not reach pre-pandemic levels for two or more years. That’s just not fast enough to guarantee jobs for every flight attendant once the stimulus package expires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIKFC3"&gt;So more than a few of them are looking toward a future that may not involve flying any more. Jennifer “Jaki” Johnson, who’s been flying for six years, sees long-term changes coming to commercial aviation, even after the pandemic subsides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXuSl0"&gt;“All of these different options to have virtual conferences and meetings [will] change the face of business travel, which a lot of airlines depend on,” she said. “Airlines will have to become leaner, smaller. Travel might look so different in the future that we don’t need as many flight attendants as before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mg9Enu"&gt;She hasn’t flown since March, and now focuses on her own wellness product line, &lt;a href="https://www.jetsetterchic.com/"&gt;Jetsetter Chic&lt;/a&gt;, which just launched pandemic amenity kits — complete with hand sanitizer and masks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BuH9hg"&gt;Her advice to other flight attendants is blunt, but hopeful. “Rethink a career in aviation. Look at what else you can do, because there are so many new paths going to open with technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iThNov"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jF0HF6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Name has been changed to protect the identity of those involved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DJP1rL"&gt;You have another chance today to pick up Vizio’s 55-inch OLED TV at a discount. Normally $1,300 for this size, it’s down to &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731260082412707165" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,000 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The best price from late 2020 was $100 cheaper than today’s deal, but if you’re scrambling for a decent price cut in time for the Super Bowl on Sunday, February 7th, your search might end here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6z5BDu"&gt;This model is Vizio’s debut OLED television, launching alongside a larger 65-inch version that currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731260096336715183" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $1,500&lt;/a&gt; (down from $2,000) at Best Buy. Other than having excellent picture quality and contrast, thanks to its OLED screen tech, it’s going to be a good choice for people with either a fast gaming PC with a recent Nvidia graphics card, a PS5, an Xbox Series X, or all of the above. That’s because it has HDMI 2.1 ports that can display 4K resolution at up to 120 frames per second, which will allow your machines to churn out high-end visuals at a fast frame rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ibEfH3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733767"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="utlphW"&gt;If you want a larger 65-inch Vizio TV with similar gaming chops, but you don’t need it to be an OLED panel, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731260223954464612" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vizio’s 65-inch P-Series Quantum QLED TV is $920&lt;/a&gt;, or $900 if you sign in with your Best Buy account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LwiDvf"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live wireless earbuds have been succeeded, in a way, by the Galaxy Buds Pro, and we’re now seeing their price plummet. If you’re willing to give a refurbished set a try, Best Buy is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731260495850956119" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling the black colorway for just $60&lt;/a&gt; (down from around $139 in new condition). These are cleaned and inspected, and Best Buy assures that all original accessories are included with each set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="bJSDOk"&gt;Apple’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;iPad mini&lt;/a&gt; tablet that launched in 2019 has hit its lowest price yet. The 64GB Wi-Fi version is $335 at Amazon (down from $399). It didn’t take long after launch before we saw $50 price cuts on this particular model, so this isn’t a huge departure from what we’ve seen before. But if you’re browsing for a small 7.9-inch iPad, this is the one to get. It features Apple’s A12 Bionic processor, and it has a Touch ID fingerprint sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood celebrates amateur investors in awkwardly timed Super Bowl ad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G3vH_fU9xafVBdR0i8f0lmsn98Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68762124/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FPPPKG"&gt;Robinhood is running its first Super Bowl ad, just as the company faces a growing brand crisis. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/robinhood-will-run-super-bowl-ad-as-brand-crisis-mounts.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the commercial marks Robinhood’s biggest brand campaign, and it focuses on the idea that anyone can be an investor. That’s been at the center of Robinhood’s message since it was founded seven years ago, but recent stock restrictions have undermined Robinhood’s entire brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ee6o6Q"&gt;Robinhood temporarily banned small investors from buying stock in companies like GameStop last week, before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys"&gt;placing restrictions on stocks&lt;/a&gt; associated with r/WallStreetBets — including GameStop, AMC, and Nokia. The move angered thousands of Robinhood customers trying to buy stocks, and the company’s app got review-bombed on the Google Play Store. While Google initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;tried to salvage&lt;/a&gt; the app’s rating, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261178/robinhood-google-play-store-app-rating-one-star-reviews-stocks-gamestop-reddit"&gt;plummeted back down&lt;/a&gt; to just one star yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxDYOH"&gt;Robinhood is also facing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22254656/robinhood-gamestop-stonks-trade-freeze-class-action-lawsuits"&gt;dozens of lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; over the GameStop stock freeze, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;called on Congress to investigate&lt;/a&gt; the Robinhood app. &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week"&gt;Robinhood claims&lt;/a&gt; the restrictions were put in place due to clearinghouses suddenly requiring much higher deposits, but the company hasn’t specifically explained the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255955/robinhood-cryptocurrency-restrictions-dogecoin-wallstreetbets"&gt;cryptocurrency restrictions&lt;/a&gt; it also put in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xhofl"&gt;This new Super Bowl commercial doesn’t address any of the controversy around Robinhood right now, making it rather awkwardly timed. CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports that Robinhood’s chief marketing officer, Christina Smedley, says the ad is designed to let people know more about the app. “It felt like this was a great stage for us to remind people about what we stand for and remind people about why the company was put into existence in the first place,” says Smedley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkzTQK"&gt;Robinhood has disabled comments on the YouTube version of the commercial, but a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp/status/1356950742112768002"&gt;version on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; is already seeing negative responses to this new Super Bowl ad.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OneDrive for Android now supports Samsung Motion Photos and 8K video playback</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7SQxUfRO3NOpoqtWderua_Ucd5c=/75x0:885x540/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761927/Microsoft_OneDrive.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CYR4zb"&gt;Microsoft is updating its OneDrive app for Android this week with a new home screen, Samsung Motion Photos support, and the ability to play 8K videos. The new home screen includes quick access to recent files, offline files, and the “On This Day” feature of OneDrive that reminds you of your old photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rNacd"&gt;Samsung Motion Photos support is also included in this update, allowing owners of Samsung phones to play back photos captured with motion in the OneDrive app or online. These photos work like Apple’s Live Photos and capture a still image alongside several seconds of video and sound before the capture. Microsoft says Samsung Motion Photos playback is &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/onedrive-for-android-updates/ba-p/1953515"&gt;rolling out worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and will require Android version 6 or above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZEDf_ZxRAXXb4kBANmkaypzuB-I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278175/onedriveandroid.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OneDrive’s new home screen on Android.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ryix81"&gt;The final addition is 8K video playback for compatible Samsung phones like the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt; or last year’s S20. While you’ve always been able to store 8K videos on OneDrive, the service now supports playback on compatible screens and devices. This could tempt more to store 8K video on Microsoft’s cloud storage service, particularly when OneDrive now supports &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231123/microsoft-file-upload-limit-250gb-onedrive-teams-sharepoint"&gt;up to 250GB files&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEepet"&gt;This latest Android update for OneDrive focuses a lot on Samsung’s phones and is an example of the ongoing partnership between Microsoft Samsung. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134167/microsoft-samsung-xbox-partnership-xcloud-cloud-game-streaming"&gt;Both companies&lt;/a&gt; are working on a variety of ways to integrate Microsoft’s software and services into Samsung Android phones, and there’s even a partnership for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134167/microsoft-samsung-xbox-partnership-xcloud-cloud-game-streaming"&gt;cloud gaming through xCloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Budden is bringing his podcast to Patreon </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="REVOLT X AT&amp;amp;amp;T Host REVOLT 3-Day Summit In Los Angeles - Day 1" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RLF8vAy9-qnbUkaN8C3DZY5DHjw=/0x0:4824x3216/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761788/1183514261.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Phillip Faraone / Getty Images for Revolt&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7FjAY0"&gt;Four months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403282/joe-budden-spotify-exclusive-leaving-host-podcast"&gt;ending his exclusive Spotify deal&lt;/a&gt;, Joe Budden is bringing his podcast &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/joebudden"&gt;to Patreon&lt;/a&gt; and has been made an adviser to the company, taking on the title head of creator equity. Like many other podcasters on Patreon, his show will be available freely on most podcasting platforms — with the notable exception of Spotify — and paying supporters will have access to additional perks. Both his show, &lt;em&gt;The Joe Budden Podcast&lt;/em&gt;, and his network, The Joe Budden Network, will be supported through the same Patreon page with the same subscription cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEcL3X"&gt;Subscribers can pay between $5 and $25 a month for bonus content, a private Discord, and exclusive tour deals. Budden tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he and his team will also gate new shows as exclusives for Patreon subscribers, with them possibly being released more widely after a certain amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmmhPA"&gt;The message from this move is clear: although many podcasters are committing to exclusive deals, Budden doesn’t see them as the future of podcasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4y7a4J"&gt;“That is so prehistoric,” he says, explaining that when he signed his Spotify deal three years ago, he and Spotify both wanted to see if exclusive deals could work. He says he proved the model, along with the potential of his audience, but didn’t want Spotify to use his fans and reach to prove the platform’s own worth and make money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K8a6EO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Subscription tiers range from $5 to $25 per month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iS3H5A"&gt;“For many years, the record labels and the system that I come from tricked us into thinking they were doing us a favor by capitalizing off our talent and basically loaning us money, and that’s been the standard the entire time,” Budden says, adding that he already knows how that system worked out for creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3ugww"&gt;When Budden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403282/joe-budden-spotify-exclusive-leaving-host-podcast"&gt;announced his split&lt;/a&gt; from the tech company, he said Spotify was “pillaging” his audience and only cared about how his show contributed to Spotify overall, not about his actual podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlSV21"&gt;Jack Conte, the CEO of Patreon, says Budden is on a standard Patreon plan, where the company takes a cut of his subscription revenue, but having him as an adviser sets him apart from other creators and emphasizes the company’s interest in hearing from him directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBb08l"&gt;“This is about tech companies paying creators the minimum amount that they can get away with instead of paying creators what they’re actually worth,” Conte says. “Creators are uploading gold to these platforms — billions of hours of energy, and enthusiasm, and passion, and creativity, and storytelling, and excitement — all the stuff that we love to read, and listen to, and watch, and see and hear, and creators are getting paid fractions of what they’re actually worth. And not only that, they’re disconnected from their audiences. They don’t own the relationship with their audience. They don’t get data. They don’t get to run their own business. They get locked out of their business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hd5oLL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Budden is being made the head of creator equity at Patreon as part of the deal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3NMRFv"&gt;Budden’s not the only one to have spoken out about how Spotify treats creators. The hosts of &lt;em&gt;The Nod,&lt;/em&gt; which became a Spotify-owned show after the company acquired Gimlet Media, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308074/the-nod-spotify-rss-feed-another-round-buzzfeed-podcast-ownership"&gt;spoke out&lt;/a&gt; in June about their issues with show ownership. The hosts, Brittany Luse and Eric Eddings, say they built their show and audience but owned none of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMPg3i"&gt;“At the end of the day, investing in someone’s talent isn’t the same as having the talent yourself,” Luse told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s very strange that [Spotify and Gimlet] are the only people who can claim ownership over [&lt;em&gt;The Nod&lt;/em&gt; and its segments].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0S7Ot"&gt;Still, Spotify has continued to sign deals with big-name talent, including Michelle Obama, Kim Kardashian West, Meghan Markle, and Prince Harry. It’s also continued to encourage small creators to try podcasting through its creation software, Anchor. Patreon is setting itself up as the antithesis to exclusives — a place where podcasters can reward their most loyal fans while also benefiting from the freedom to do whatever they want with their show.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok will now warn you about videos with questionable information</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mOdqMYYpzMY2NH_nJv8cFLCPOB0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761761/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xHW5sb"&gt;TikTok will start displaying warnings on videos that contain questionable information that couldn’t be verified by fact-checkers, and it’ll begin warning users when they go to re-share those videos that the information hasn’t been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1yeuL"&gt;The app will now display a warning label on these videos that reads, “Caution: Video flagged for unverified content.” This means a fact-checker looked at the content but wasn’t able to certify that it was right or wrong. TikTok has already been reducing the spread of some unverified videos, but they weren’t publicly flagged before today. Creators will now get a message when a warning label is added to their video, and those videos will all have their distribution reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v0MoqtsXkRLKRLgz3R5uT1y7aQQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277165/New_prompts_to_consider_before_sharing.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Qv2zdj"&gt;Viewers will also be warned when they go to re-share a video that has a warning label on it. After clicking the share button, which lets you post a video outside the app, a pop-up will ask if you’re “sure you want to share this video?” You can still share the video if you want to, but the prompt seems to be designed to dissuade some people from following through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RefQqK"&gt;TikTok didn’t say how many videos it looks at each day for fact-checking or how it chooses which videos to review. A spokesperson said that fact-checking is often focused on topics like elections, vaccines, and climate change and that a video doesn’t have to reach a certain popularity to qualify for review. Videos that violate TikTok’s misinformation policy will be removed outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RY0oo"&gt;Other social apps have tried similar warnings over the past year to limit the spread of misinformation. Facebook warns you before you share &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365305/facebook-covid-19-warning-notification-post-misinformation"&gt;stories about COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304173/facebook-old-news-articles-warning-notification-time"&gt;articles that may be out of date&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter will warn you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611927/twitter-show-warning-like-labeled-tweet"&gt;before retweeting potential misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, and on a much funnier note, will also suggest that you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455635/twitter-read-before-you-tweet-article-prompt-rolling-out-globally-soon"&gt;open and read through a news story&lt;/a&gt; before you repost it.&lt;/p&gt;
