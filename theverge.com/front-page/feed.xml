    <title>FTC bans spyware app SpyFone, orders it to delete illegally harvested data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9xeRhYSV6GvSCjh_KN_vbeCpTCs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69808228/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The FTC has voted to ban SpyFone | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y46sHr"&gt;On Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/ftc-bans-spyfone-and-ceo-from-surveillance-business"&gt;announced it had banned&lt;/a&gt; spyware maker SpyFone and its CEO Scott Zuckerman from the surveillance business. The commission called SpyFone a “stalkerware app company” that allegedly harvested and shared data about people’s movements, phone use, and online activity via a hidden device hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWB70J"&gt;“The company’s apps sold real-time access to their secret surveillance, allowing stalkers and domestic abusers to stealthily track the potential targets of their violence,” the FTC said in a statement. “SpyFone’s lack of basic security also exposed device owners to hackers, identity thieves, and other cyber threats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxsbVg"&gt;In addition to the ban, the FTC ordered SpyFone to delete illegally harvested data and notify device owners when the app had been installed without their knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qiiTm"&gt;“We must be clear eyed about the variety of threats that surveillance businesses pose,” FTC chair Lina Khan &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/linakhanFTC/status/1433435163707547649?s=20"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a statement. “The FTC will be vigilant in its data security and privacy enforcement and will seek to vigorously protect the public from these dangers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5GMRm"&gt;Stalkwerware apps, which are banned by app stores, can be used to track a user’s movements and online activities without their knowledge, sometimes marketed as ways to for “catching a cheating spouse” or, more subtly, to keep tabs on employees or children, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/coalition-against-stalkerware-expands-membership#breadcrumb:~:text=Stalkerware%20is%20the%20class%20of%20apps,that%20they%20are%20not%20being%20monitored."&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (EFF). Such apps can be used to perpetuate harassment and abuse, according to the &lt;a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/"&gt;Coalition Against Stalkerware&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WL1Lcr"&gt;SpyFone ran at a phone’s root level for several of its functions, the FTC said, including monitoring email and video chats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Incoq8"&gt;The app and its CEO are banned from “offering, promoting, selling, or advertising any surveillance app, service, or business,” according to the FTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YzVren"&gt;The EFF praised the FTC’s order. “With the FTC now turning its focus to this industry, victims of stalkerware can begin to find solace in the fact that regulators are beginning to take their concerns seriously,” the foundation’s leadership wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/victory-federal-trade-commission-bans-stalkerware-company-conducting-business"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqUnYT"&gt;The FTC board voted 5-0 to accept the consent order with the company. SpyFone, which is now doing business as Support King, did not admit or deny the FTC’s allegations, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/192_3003_spyfone_agreement_and_order_without_signatures_0.pdf"&gt;consent order agreement &lt;/a&gt;(pdf). Commissioner Rohit Chopra issued a separate &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/2021/09/statement-commissioner-rohit-chopra-matter-spyfone"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, saying the proposed order “in no way releases or absolves” the company or the CEO from potential criminal liability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rn6E2f"&gt;“While this action was worthwhile, I am concerned that the FTC will be unable to meaningfully crack down on the underworld of stalking apps using our civil enforcement authorities,” Chopra wrote. “I hope that federal and state enforcers examine the applicability of criminal laws, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Wiretap Act, and other criminal laws, to combat illegal surveillance, including the use of stalkerware.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DswrE4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Red Notice’s first trailer is full of explosions, car chases, art heists, and Ryan Reynolds quips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6kcRfqafcnQjZC_GkJr4IMR7LEc=/326x51:1294x696/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69808080/RN_FirstLook_V220210707_4521_1pex5jr.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Frank Masi/NETFLIX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ToBATd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6l3mM7AWew"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Netflix’s next big action movie swing, has gotten its first trailer, showing off the fast (and dare I say, &lt;em&gt;furious&lt;/em&gt;) antics of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. He plays the FBI’s top profiler as he hunts down the world’s two most wanted criminals — played by Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XBIRa"&gt;Based on the trailer, it seems Johnson’s Agent John Hartley actually catches Reynolds’ character, Nolan Booth — dubbed “the world’s greatest art thief” — fairly early on, forcing the two to partner up in order to catch Gadot’s character, “The Bishop.” She’s described as “the world’s most wanted art thief,” which is apparently a different thing than being the world’s greatest art thief. This is also, broadly, the plot of &lt;em&gt;Hobbs &amp;amp; Shaw,&lt;/em&gt; a movie that Johnson and Reynolds both were actually in. Gadot is also a &lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt; franchise alum, which seems fitting. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nvOaiJO8s1lmT_t7P8Jt447yvbI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822434/unnamed.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j8OsEo"&gt;The film is named after &lt;a href="https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Notices/Red-Notices"&gt;Interpol’s actually real Red Notices&lt;/a&gt;, which are slightly less interesting international wanted notices that — in what I assume are almost all cases — do not actually allow for The Rock to relentlessly chase you around the globe in daring action sequences. The second does seem like a more entertaining concept for a movie, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2P9mfj"&gt;As one might expect from a big-budget heist film, &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; will also feature considerable amounts of globe-trotting action, black tie dinner parties, rooftop chases, car chases, and endless amounts of lighthearted quipping (particularly where Reynolds is concerned). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOgzkK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; is also part of Netflix’s push toward building out its original blockbuster-level films (and maybe franchises). And by putting Johnson, Gadot, and Reynolds — three of Hollywood’s biggest stars — into a single action movie, there’s a good chance that it might be Netflix’s next big hit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYE3lu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; will stream on Netflix on November 12th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s new Big Brain Academy is like Mario Party with brainteasers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pj48Y0XPB7VtH4I0jzNqSaSsZrM=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69808019/bigbrain.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XCFFjJ"&gt;Nintendo sneakily announced &lt;em&gt;Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain&lt;/em&gt;, a new educational puzzle game for the Switch that sees the revival of a franchise that previously appeared on the DS handheld (and later ported to &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/big-brain-academy-wii-u/"&gt;Wii U’s Virtual Console&lt;/a&gt;). It’ll release on December 3rd, 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/big-brain-academy-brain-vs-brain-switch/"&gt;for $29.99&lt;/a&gt;, and in it you’ll race through puzzle mini games and challenges to flex your smarts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MtB9qI"&gt;In addition to single player modes, the game will support couch multiplayer and online play. Nintendo is even implementing a ghost data system, so you can test your skills against people who have gotten higher scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BjsY20"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BigBrainAcademy?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#BigBrainAcademy&lt;/a&gt;: Brain vs. Brain is coming to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NintendoSwitch&lt;/a&gt; on 12/03! Flex your brainpower or engage in a battle of brains with your family and friends!   &lt;a href="https://t.co/lVavwzxbzd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/lVavwzxbzd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1433414764219207683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QMB00v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Brain Academy&lt;/em&gt; actually looks like a fun game to play with family, as it lets each player experience the game at their preferred difficulty level. Really, it’s just nice to see these kinds of casual games continue to release on the Switch. Along with titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/29/18522564/picross-s3-review-puzzle-games-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Picross&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280837/nintendo-switch-clubhouse-games-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clubhouse Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917908/nintendo-switch-ring-fit-adventure-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292655/nintendo-jump-rope-challenge-free-exercise-game-no-equipment-switch-eshop"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jump Rope Challenge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and others, Nintendo keeps proving that the Switch is a console fit for unique experiences, too, not just core games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fujifilm just announced its cheapest medium format camera yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IkPlWpojhBtkgP5MoEK_jp1fn2s=/0x101:2407x1706/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807968/fujifuji.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Fujifilm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Jzkho"&gt;Today is Fujifilm’s September X Summit event, and the company has announced a slew of new hardware including several cameras and lenses for both the GFX and X systems. Leading the way is the new GFX 50S II, the company’s latest medium format camera. More importantly, at $3,999 body-only, it’s Fujifilm’s cheapest way into the GFX system yet. For comparison, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251933/fujifilm-gfx-100s-102-megapixel-medium-format-price-specs-date"&gt;the GFX 100S&lt;/a&gt; costs $5,999 and the GFX 50S still goes for $5,499. So dropping under $4,000 could mean big things for the lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNKTG8"&gt;The GFX 50S II has a 51.4-megapixel sensor that’s 1.7x larger than what you’d get in a full-frame camera, 5-axis in-body image stabilization good for 6.5 stops, improved autofocus (compared to the 50S), and a body that’s the same size as the GFX 100S. At 1.98 pounds, that’s rather compact for all the advanced photography power it wields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AF0jV"&gt;With the inclusion of IBIS, Fujifilm says the GFX 50S II “presents new opportunities in the way conventional medium format digital cameras are used” since you’ve got more leeway to shoot with it handheld instead of mostly keeping it mounted to a tripod. However, one tradeoff with this sensor is that it depends on contrast-detection autofocus instead of the more capable phase-detect approach on the GFX 100S and many other Fujifilm cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bL-63r3i3H_iDXGCwkKhMamuUJU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822258/600022316_PT13_Image_GFX50S_II_top_GF35_70.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fujifilm&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The GFX 50S II body is largely identical to the GFX 100S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="niwH5a"&gt;Since the body style closely matches the GFX 100S, the same is true of the camera’s dials and controls, which are basically identical between the two. Carried over is the DSLR-style PASM dial, as well as a 1.8-inch monochrome display on the top plate that can be used for other settings and to display your chosen parameters. The main 3.2-inch LCD tilts in three directions for high- and low-angle shooting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwWmmp"&gt;The GFX 50S II offers 19 of Fujifilm’s film simulations, including the “nostalgic neg” that debuted on the GFX 100S, and a “Pixel Shift Multi Shot” mode that combines 16 RAW images into an ultra-high-res 200MP DNG file. Fujifilm will also sell the camera as a kit with the GF 35-70mm f/4.5-5.6 WR lens for $4,499. It’s expected to be available in late October.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T87ybg3oYi0uYIDEO2L9U4Qfh_Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822256/16759615_PT10_Image_X_T30ii_left_diagonal_15_45_black.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fujifilm&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X-T30 II is an extremely similar camera to its predecessor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KaqMi8"&gt;Fujifilm is also introducing the new X-T30 II, which is a very modest update over the original that mostly brings the benefit of updated firmware and software features. It also gains additional memory (for improved performance) and a higher-resolution 1.68-million-dot LCD compared to the 1.04M-dot X-T30. It still uses the same 26.4-megapixel X-Trans CMOS sensor — and no, it doesn’t toss in IBIS or anything unexpected. Again, the most important upgrade is that the X-T30 II will be brought up to speed on firmware and film simulations. Fujifilm didn’t even bother issuing a standalone press release for this camera. The X-T30 II will be sold sans battery charger for $899 body-only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGWKhz"&gt;As for the company’s latest glass, the new lenses include the aforementioned GF 35-70mm f/4.5-5.6 WR, which Fujifilm describes as “the perfect gateway” into the detail, depth of field, and other benefits of its medium format cameras. It’s coming in November for $999.95. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ToJjVmoK7ff9qq3hsdy8kUR1Z1g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822274/16719201_PT11_Image_XF33mmF1.4_left_diagonal_X_T4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Fujinon XF33mm f/1.4 lens shown on an X-T4 body.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6S6ZwF"&gt;But the X Series also has some exciting lens additions: Fujifilm has announced two new f/1.4 primes. The XF33mm R LM WR has a weather-resistant build, and the company says it “ushers in a new era of optical brilliance and performance for X Series cameras and lenses.” Since it’s equivalent to 50mm in the 35mm film format, Fujifilm thinks this is a perfect all-around lens. The 15-element lens measures 2.89 inches and weighs 13 ounches. It’s coming in October for $799.95. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8Un2D"&gt;Not to be left out is the XF23mm R LM WR: this weather-resistant lens is being positioned as “suited to discerning street, wedding, editorial, and documentary photographers.” It has now has a closer minimum focus distance of 19 centimeters, as well. Curiously, Fujifilm says this one is “designed to support anticipated future camera sensors that offer further enhanced resolution.” Specifically, it can resolve sensors up to 40 megapixels. It’ll be available in November for $899.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp fined $267 million for breaching EU privacy law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pM8MD0DIYB8vNYDereRZpI7NiDE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807796/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rbTyQB"&gt;Facebook-owned WhatsApp has been fined €225 million ($267 million) for breaking the European Union’s data privacy rules. &lt;a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/data-protection-commission-announces-decision-whatsapp-inquiry"&gt;Ireland’s Data Protection Commission&lt;/a&gt; (DPC) announced the decision in an &lt;a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/edpb_bindingdecision_202101_ie_sa_whatsapp_redacted_en.pdf"&gt;89-page summary&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), noting that WhatsApp did not properly inform EU citizens how it handles their personal data, including how it shares that information with its parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJynjX"&gt;WhatsApp has been ordered to make updates to its already lengthy &lt;a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en"&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; and change how it notifies users about sharing their data. This will bring it into compliance with Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which governs how tech companies gather and use data in the EU. GDPR came into effect in May of 2018, and WhatsApp was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/25/17393766/facebook-google-gdpr-lawsuit-max-schrems-europe"&gt;one of the first companies&lt;/a&gt; to be hit with privacy lawsuits under the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6MQpq5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Everything you need to know about GDPR","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xcxVR7"&gt;A WhatsApp spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company will appeal the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNlSjN"&gt;“WhatsApp is committed to providing a secure and private service. We have worked to ensure the information we provide is transparent and comprehensive and will continue to do so,” the spokesperson said. “We disagree with the decision today regarding the transparency we provided to people in 2018 and the penalties are entirely disproportionate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qfi9Wd"&gt;The decision by the DPC began with an investigation in 2018 and is the second-largest fine levied under GDPR regulations. In July this year, Amazon was fined a record $887 million for breaching the EU privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best budget laptop of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Cheap Laptop 2021: HP Envy x360 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VrLlEr12ymqvrvZXaKwFhmZDmjk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807794/mchin_200705_4086_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve got the best cheap laptop for you, no matter your budget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best cheap laptops for video editing, gaming, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="3v5Ons"&gt;If you’re shopping for the best cheap laptop of 2021, the question to ask is: what’s most important, and what are you willing to sacrifice? Even the best cheap laptops aren’t perfect in every area — they have some strengths but cut corners to achieve their price tags. You can almost certainly find a budget laptop with a touchscreen, a premium-looking chassis, an HDMI port, a backlit keyboard, or stylus support, but you may need to consider which of those features you want the most, and which you can go without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqLems"&gt;Our pick for the best cheap laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. We feel that the Envy has build quality, performance, and battery life that surpass those of many premium laptops. But we’ve tested dozens of systems in the sub-$800 range, and we’ve got a number of additional models on this list from Lenovo, Acer, Samsung, HP, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVG16P"&gt;Our other picks for the best cheap laptop of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these laptops also appear on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptop&lt;/a&gt; lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPoJxi"&gt;Many of our picks for the best cheap laptop of 2021 are currently Chromebooks. We believe that Chromebooks are, in many cases, the best-value option for shoppers seeking a laptop under $500 and tend to offer better specs, features, and build quality than most Windows laptops at that price point. We hope to add more Windows laptops under $500 to this page in the future and are keeping a close eye on those releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best cheap laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="r62WQ4"&gt;HP’s Envy x360 13, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeBestCheapLaptop090121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2FConfigureView%3FurlLangId%3D%26catalogId%3D10051%26langId%3D-1%26storeId%3D10151%26catEntryId%3D3074457345619562324%26quantity%3D1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $699&lt;/a&gt;, is the best budget laptop you can buy under $800. With a high-quality and sturdy convertible build, it looks like a device that should cost twice its price. It has plenty of other great features as well, including a really excellent keyboard and a bright, colorful screen. It’s also exceptional on the inside. Thanks to its AMD Ryzen processor, the system delivers all-day battery life and very smooth performance — it can even handle some light gaming. (Intel options are available as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ox216u"&gt;We have some minor complaints about the Envy, of course. The screen is 16:9, which is a cramped aspect ratio for multitasking. Our test unit had a somewhat limited port selection (notably, missing Thunderbolt and HDMI support) and came with some bloatware preinstalled. But none of these are deal-breakers at the Envy’s price point. Overall, budget shoppers will want for very little with this machine. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Chromebook Duet is one of the best Chromebooks you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O7mXrt"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best laptop under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hyeIry"&gt;If you’re looking for an absurdly cheap Chromebook that absolutely gets the job done, you should definitely be looking at the $219 Lenovo Chromebook Duet. The Duet is a 10-inch aluminum alloy Chrome OS tablet that comes with a kickstand and keyboard cover. It looks sturdy and classy, and it can easily function as either a tablet or a PC. But you’re not compromising &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;much on performance for this device’s tiny size; as long as you’re not running dozens of tabs and apps, you should be fine. And we got over 11 hours of battery life in our testing, making it one of the longest-lasting Chromebooks we’ve seen in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHlVCe"&gt;The main thing to know about the Chromebook Duet is that the screen is quite small — just 10.1 inches. That’s a fine size for a young student (especially with the touch capability) and for an adult’s secondary device for note-taking, Netflixing, and the like, but it’s not an ideal size for a primary work device unless you’re fine with quite a bit of squinting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aB9GyO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730298"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the clamshell Chromebook to buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop with Chrome OS &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="N34v09"&gt;If you’d prefer a more traditional Chromebook with a clamshell form factor, the $699 Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is an affordable option that’s all-around excellent. It has a gorgeous 3:2 display that delivers a sharp picture and bright, vibrant colors with plenty of vertical space. The screen alone would make the Chromebook Spin 713 a standout, but it has a number of other strengths as well, including a great keyboard, all-day battery life, and a comprehensive port selection, including an HDMI, in addition to USB-C, USB-A, and a microSD slot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N5isRn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730313"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 is the best cheap laptop with a built-in stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SSaLnR"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best cheap laptop with a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iQA7Ph"&gt;If you like the Duet’s size and detachable form factor but are willing to spend on something a bit more upscale, you may find the Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 to be a better choice. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, kickstand, and detachable screen. But the CM3’s kickstand folds multiple ways: you can crease it lengthwise to stand the tablet up like a laptop or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. Plus, it comes with a built-in USI stylus and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. Battery life was also quite impressive: we averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUYikQ"&gt;Where the CM3 lags a bit behind the Duet (and other cheap laptops you may try) is the power. Its MediaTek processor can be a bit sluggish compared to more pricier offerings. But the CM3 still offers a surprising number of perks for its sub-$400 price and makes a great student driver or secondary device. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a 13-inch powerhouse that weighs almost nothing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best thin-and-light laptop under $1000&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="o8zBHM"&gt;If you’re looking for a budget Windows laptop that’s thinner and lighter than the Envy x360 while delivering similar category-topping performance, the $669 HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a good choice for you. It has a powerful eight-core Ryzen processor, which is one of the fastest processors for thin and light laptops that you can get. Not only does it perform well, but it’s also unbelievably light at just 2.1 pounds, and it comes with a blindingly bright 16:10 screen. It’s a standout in battery life, too — I averaged almost 11 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOWROI"&gt;HP did have to cut a few corners to achieve those benefits at this price point. The audio on our model wasn’t great, and the device shipped with some cheap bloatware installed. But the Pavilion Aero 13 is excellent in almost every other way, and it won’t disappoint if you’re looking for a functional, cheap Windows PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;An affordable laptop with a bold look&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pT23AG"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable Chromebook that stands out from the crowd, the $549 Galaxy Chromebook 2 should be on your list. It comes in a bold “fiesta red” color (as well as a regular gray, if you prefer to blend in). It’s a touchscreen convertible with stylus support (though the stylus isn’t included). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QIDME"&gt;On top of the design, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 includes an excellent QLED panel, which is one of the best displays we’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. You also get a solid keyboard, decent battery life (we averaged 7 hours and 21 minutes of continuous work), and a port selection that includes two USB-C ports, a microSD slot, and a headphone jack. It’s easily one of the best Chromebooks you can buy and one of the best cheap laptops as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best cheap laptop for Surface fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9t4Ji3"&gt;The $399 Surface Go 2 is a 10.5-inch tablet that’s about the size of a regular iPad. You’ll have to buy the keyboard cover separately, but the overall package is still quite affordable if you’re buying a lower-priced model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hPLGr"&gt;You can configure the Surface Go 2 with a Pentium Gold or Core m3 processor. Those aren’t the fanciest or most powerful processors, but the system should still be adequate for your streaming and browsing needs, especially if you only need it to do one task at a time. It can run any Windows app, it’s easy to carry around, and it makes a solid secondary computer. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Swift 3 is one of the best college laptops you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best budget laptop for students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DeUYiZ"&gt;Many of the best cheap laptops might be good choices for high school and college students, but the Acer Swift 3’s exceptionally durable build makes it an excellent choice for backpack-battering and dining hall spills. Its 14-inch screen also gives you more room for homework multitasking than some of the 13-inch machines here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVxnSd"&gt;But the highlight of the Swift 3 is its Ryzen 4000 processors. We tested a model with a Ryzen 7 4700U, which did an excellent job handling our daily multitasking workload, and delivered seven-hour battery life as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWSkuR"&gt;On the outside, the Swift 3 isn’t the thinnest or most beautiful laptop you can buy, but it’s a solid performer in most areas. It has all kinds of ports, including USB-C, USB-A, and an HDMI. The backlit keyboard has a nice click to it and has a reliable integrated fingerprint reader as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m9IrEq"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174917/lenovo-yoga-c740-review-laptop-specs-features-price-2-in-1-convertible"&gt;Lenovo Yoga C740&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;A cheap laptop with standout build&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HqEdaD"&gt;The Yoga C740 is as straightforward as a laptop can get. It has a sturdy aluminum build and perfectly fine 10th Gen Intel processors. We were pleasantly surprised by the device’s audio — the upward-firing speakers on the sides of the keyboard deliver a nice surround-sound experience. The keyboard and touchpad are both quite comfortable to use. There’s not much to complain about and not much to enthusiastically praise — if you’re looking for a sub-$800 Windows laptop with a well-made aluminum chassis and a sturdy frame, you’re looking for the Yoga. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGHm6c"&gt;The C740 is a year old now, but that means you can get it at very affordable prices. We’re looking forward to reviewing its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373719/lenovo-yoga-7i-6-convertible-laptops-intel-amd-processors-windows"&gt;Yoga 7i&lt;/a&gt;, shortly in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SRGhSB"&gt;Apple’s notoriously expensive AirPods Max headphones are, in some ways, more of a luxury purchase — but today you can live it up for just a little less thanks to the Woot’s &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13527013?sid=VergeDailyDeals080221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Fplus%2Fsounds-of-summer-the-sequel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ongoing “Sounds of Summer” sale&lt;/a&gt;. Well, if you’re an Amazon Prime member that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0pq3w"&gt;Now through the end of the month (or while supplies last), &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836602-13527013?sid=VergeDailyDeals090221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airpods-max-headphones-1%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Prime members can save $80&lt;/a&gt; on a pair of the AirPods Max, regardless of color. Woot’s current deal includes a one-year limited warranty from Apple and brings the price down to a cool $470, one of the lowest prices we’ve seen on Apple’s excellent noise-canceling headphones in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugKTpB"&gt;Despite their price, the AirPods Max are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now. The Max can easily block out distractions thanks to their active noise cancellation, and Apple’s spatial audio features — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631444/netflix-spatial-audio-support-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;Netflix recently rolled out&lt;/a&gt; to the iPhone and iPad — can help you better immerse yourself in a movie or while listening to music. The AirPods Max also boast excellent sound quality, and feature a breathable knit mesh canopy that makes them comfortable to wear over extended periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nqI4t"&gt;You can certainly buy a similar high-quality headset like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; for about $200 less, however, this is a solid deal if you’re deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem, especially since the AirPods Max also pair seamlessly with other Apple devices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w9pVdR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BaHwWv"&gt;Want the best drone you can buy for under $500, but forking out $450 for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21243887/dji-mavic-air-2-2020-drone-flight-photography-video-review-price-specs-features"&gt;latest DJI Mavic Mini&lt;/a&gt; is out of your budget? Well, today you can buy its 2019 predecessor with some added perks — including three sets of spare propellers, a carrying case, a pair of extra control sticks, and a battery charging hub — at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RKPP1YL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s for $100 off&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsN1zZ"&gt;At less than 0.55 pounds, the DJI Mavic Mini drone is small and light enough that Americans and Canadians don’t need to register it with their governments. Yet, despite the size, it still offers 30 minutes of flight time per battery. The drone also boasts many of the same features found in DJI’s more pricey drones at a more affordable price, like the ability to automatically return to the takeoff spot, making the deal even more attractive at $350. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938530/dji-mavic-mini-price-specs-faa-ultra-light-combo-pack"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Z4YB8m"&gt;Apple lovers, today’s your lucky day: we’ve got a second deal for you. If you’re on the hunt for a tablet that’s the best of its kind, but — well — doesn’t quite cost the typical tablet price, Best Buy’s current deal on the fifth-generation iPad Mini has got you covered. Right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750770278492463362#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can pick up 64GB, Wi-F-enabled model&lt;/a&gt; for $300 instead of $400 in the color of your choice, saving you $100 on what is considered to be the best small tablet on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzcJqj"&gt;What’s more, the Best Buy deal comes with a few added perks, including a free six-month subscription to Apple News Plus (the digital version) and Apple Music. You can also enjoy discounts on select mice and keyboards, Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft 365 subscriptions, and more when you purchase the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgbQ1F"&gt;The iPad Mini itself is fast and boasts an A12 processor, the same kind of chip powering the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17871816/apple-iphone-xs-max-review-camera-processor-battery-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone XS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18011306/apple-iphone-xr-review-camera-screen-battery-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;XR&lt;/a&gt;. While it features a range of features, like a 7-megapixel front-facing camera with an f/2.2 lens, it also comes with old-school favorites like a headphone jack and a Touch ID fingerprint sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6p1iSF"&gt;Note, however, &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/ipad-mini-6-release-date-price-specs-and-rumors" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;there are rumors&lt;/a&gt; that Apple may be releasing a new iPad Mini soon, so this may not be the latest model for very long. This also means there could be some steep discounts just on the horizon. However, if you want a relatively affordable iPad right now, this is a good deal to grab.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cz7WYS"&gt;The Apple-centric mouse features Logitech’s new MagSpeed magnetic scroll wheel, which the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fmice%2Fmx-master-3-mac-wireless-mouse.910-005693.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F2%2F22652060%2Fapple-airpods-max-dji-mavic-mini-ipad-mini-logitech-mouse-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company claims&lt;/a&gt; make it possible to scroll 1,000 lines in a second. The mouse also aims to help improve productivity with a set of customizable buttons and support for Logitech Flow, a feature that lets you quickly share files and move between computers (or an iPad) by simply dragging your cursor to the edge of the screen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a la Apple’s Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;. You can expect up to a little over two months of power on a full charge, too, and, unlike the last-gen model, the MX Master 3 supports USB-C. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/4/20848369/logitech-mx-master-3-keys-best-mouse-even-better-magnetic-scroll-wheel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What losing Paradise tells us about today’s blazes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Town Of Paradise Wiped Out By The Camp Wildfire Continues Long Struggle To Rebuild" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cz7Q3X_tMqEXSQghvXbFq2fk2UU=/21x0:4770x3166/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807720/1129061457.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EaSZSC"&gt;Thousands of Californians have fled their homes this week, as the Caldor, Dixie and other fires &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/"&gt;continue to blaze&lt;/a&gt; across the state. Despite the best efforts of firefighting teams, the Dixie Fire already torched the small mountain town of Greenville in early August, robbing many residents of a home to which to return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRtPXd"&gt;The exodus sparked by each blaze has become an eerily familiar scene as fire seasons in the Western US grow more intense with climate change. Each community that loses part, or all of itself brings to mind the carnage left behind by the Camp Fire in 2018. That’s when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21300937/coronavirus-pandemic-california-wildfires-high-school-paradise-climate-change-graduation"&gt;Paradise, California&lt;/a&gt; was nearly wiped off the map, and surrounding communities suffered similar losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PR4VUz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Paradise is worth being remembered”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DI4NQM"&gt;Journalist Lizzie Johnson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lizziejohnsonnn/status/1428456891756257283"&gt;chronicled&lt;/a&gt; much of the damage for the &lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;and just wrote a powerful book about Paradise and the people who made a home there. &lt;em&gt;The Verge s&lt;/em&gt;poke with Johnson about her new book, &lt;a href="https://www.lizziejohnson.net/book"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paradise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and what lessons it might offer as fire season rages again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Tby3u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before writing this book, you covered Paradise extensively as a reporter. What do you hope people learn about Paradise that they haven’t heard in the news?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58OLXR"&gt;That fire just changed a lot of things in the state of California and across the West. All of a sudden, we really saw what’s going to be lost, and it was just too big for a newspaper article alone. That was the point when I realized this was something that was really worthy of a book, because Paradise is worth being remembered. It’s worth understanding what happened to that town as we’re facing more and more fires like it in the future, and in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWtkUh"&gt;My focus has always been on understanding what climate change feels like and what the human experience is when your community is totally changed from one of these disasters. What I’m hoping people get from this book is just a sense of what the town was, so it’s not just another abstract disaster. That they really understood its traditions and its culture, and the people that live there and their daily routines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzhkGI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I really appreciated that you included a story from the Konkow tribe about a wildfire that grew out of control generations ago. Why did you weave that through your narrative, and what does it tell us? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38bJ9S"&gt;I heard the Konkow legend when I was on a tour with the Butte County Fire Safe Council, a few months after the Camp Fire. And we were standing on this plateau overlooking the community of Concow and everything was still burnt to a crisp. All the trees were blackened matchsticks, and there was ash all over the ground. This couple shared this legend about a fire that was really similar to what we had just seen with the Camp Fire. I think, for a lot of people in that group, it was their first time hearing it. It’s that sort of prehistory that doesn’t get included in lesson plans in school so often, and I just was really struck by it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="mVy2Un"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s this whole body of knowledge that was lost”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nJXu1V"&gt;There’s this whole body of knowledge that was lost when white settlers came over and stomped fire out of the landscape.  I think that a lot of people sort of forgot that fire is a very natural part. There’s a lot we can learn from Indigenous groups. So I really wanted to make sure they were represented in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PLJa8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turning to the Camp Fire, can you walk me through what you have learned about what went wrong that led to so much devastation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkDQzD"&gt;People always want to know the one thing that you can point your finger at. The issue with that is that it’s very, very complicated. It’s a bunch of factors playing at once, which is why it’s hard to find solutions. But basically, the combination of an electrical grid that hasn’t been hardened, that grid is on really flammable land, a lot of forests that are diseased and overgrown and dying that haven’t been managed properly. And then you have these communities like Paradise that are tucked really deep in the forest on fire-prone land, and the houses weren’t built to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzvGNZ"&gt;People use that phrase, perfect storm, but it really was. It was really dry that day, the rains hadn’t come. There was this town in the forest that probably shouldn’t have been there. So when the fire ignited, I mean, it was gone in a matter of hours. It was just insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXUkgw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is difficult to find solutions, but what for you are the key takeaways when it comes to how to prevent something like this from happening again, as the climate crisis makes fire seasons more intense? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NImrB"&gt;The point that I keep coming back to is we need to make sure that we’re having the same conversation, where it’s not just arguing about whether climate change is real or not, but understanding that it is here. And it is changing the landscape in ways that are pretty unfathomable compared to what we knew a few decades ago. You can’t start having solutions unless you’re actually having a conversation about the actual problems, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjjUZj"&gt;The other thing, too, I think, is just realizing that personal preparedness is a really big piece of it. A lot of people see firefighters as these heroes that will come in and rescue them. And when disasters like this happen, at a certain point, they can’t help you. Acknowledging the risk, again, being on the same page, having the same conversation, and realizing that a fire will likely happen if you live in a fire-prone place, and you need to know how to get out and have your go bag. That’s the kind of thing that might save your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JAtmzX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s the kind of thing that might save your life.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fXgZuv"&gt;My role as a journalist is to just hold a mirror up to the problem. I wish I had more solutions. But all I can really say is, I think that we need to start being more proactive instead of reactive in terms of preparing for these fires and communities understanding their risk. Even reading about Paradise and understanding what happens there better will help places have conversations about what they can do to improve. You can’t just sit back and think that it won’t happen to our town or that things will get better, because that’s just not the trajectory that we’re on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYiO4Y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how are the people you wrote about doing now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYk8fm"&gt;You know, it’s hard. I think that a lot of people assume that recovery is this linear thing. And it’s not. There are a lot of people that aren’t that much better off than they were in the year after the fire, particularly now because there’s smoke in the sky. And, you know, the Dixie fire is burning and the Caldor fire is burning, and it’s really really triggering to see other places burn down. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-FIRE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c-BXkZI6X7Ybs-5JMuWQH8XxT9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22821364/1234965845.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Residents evacuate as the Caldor fire approaches in South Lake Tahoe, California on Monday, August 30, 2021&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j9YMs2"&gt;Jamie and Erin in the book with their daughters just finished rebuilding their home. But even they have talked about how the sky is smoky, and they’re just used to breathing smoke now and how hard that is. Rachelle lost her husband to cancer. So she’s a single mom raising their little baby now. Kevin is student teaching. So again, it’s progress. But it’s not as cheery and linear as you think it would be almost three years after this fire.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHcOW1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it like for you now seeing things unfold in Northern California this fire season?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dq7X9A"&gt;It makes me feel really sick to my stomach, to be honest. I was watching videos of the evacuation from South Lake Tahoe yesterday. And again, it just looks so much like what we saw in Paradise and in Butte County during the Camp Fire. There’s this sense that when really, really bad things happen, that you want to feel like there is something to be learned from it, and that it won’t happen again. Even if you intellectually know at some point, another town is going to burn down, it doesn’t make it any easier when it does, having seen up close what that is like and how people struggle afterwards. There’s another town that just joined the ranks of destroyed places and where is going to burn down next? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5lpuh"&gt;That scene seems to repeat itself summer after summer, right? You see the town and then the next time you see it, everything is in ruins. It’s smoking and people are digging through the ashes looking for their china or their wedding rings. And it’s like, how many times can you see people go through that before something changes in a big way?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Music startup Roli has filed for administration and is reforming as beginner-focused Luminary</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OGifix"&gt;UK music startup Roli, best known for its squishy keyboards like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/23/9372961/roli-seaboard-rise-grand-hands-on"&gt;the Seaboard Rise&lt;/a&gt;, has filed for administration and is reforming as Luminary. The new company will focus on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572899/roli-lumi-review-features-specs-price"&gt;the Lumi keyboard and app&lt;/a&gt;, which are designed to teach beginners to play the piano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lcf7bH"&gt;The news was &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/roli-administration-luminary-hoxton-seaboard-lumi-music-2021-9"&gt;reported by&lt;em&gt; Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which notes that Roli has struggled with generating revenue and growth. The company reported pre-tax losses of £34.1 million ($47 million) from income of £11.4 million ($16 million) in the 18 months leading up to the end of June 2019. The company’s CEO and founder Roland Lamb told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that a limited market for its products had combined with pandemic difficulties to force the closure of Roli. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYvgrI"&gt;“Ultimately what happened was the pro-focused products we initially developed, although successful within their marketplace, the marketplace wasn’t big enough given our venture trajectory,” Lamb told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. “We had our eyes set on hypergrowth and that proved to be difficult.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4nPB8GhBY2W6WUYKXbMknLJWz-A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22049948/JN_200917_ROLI_6919.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The light-up keys on the $299 Lumi keyboard help guide beginner pianists. A $79 annual subscription buys access to more songs and lessons. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vfOP8F"&gt;Instead of focusing on selling hardware only, Luminary, née Roli, wants to combine hardware with software subscriptions via its Lumi products. The Lumi keyboard, which uses light-up keys to guide beginners, costs $299, but users can pay an additional $79 for a yearly subscription that gets them access to extra lessons and songs to play along with. It seems, though, that Luminary isn’t completely abandoning the company’s other hardware, and &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; reports that Luminary will also “reintroduce the Seaboard” at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43RetW"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572899/roli-lumi-review-features-specs-price"&gt;our review of the Lumi last year&lt;/a&gt;, we thought the keyboard and app offered some engaging and inventive ways to tutor new musicians. At a time when the pandemic has made in-person lessons difficult, having a digital tutor could be very beneficial. But not everyone will enjoy Lumi’s hardware, or the price of access.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkEzTg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;notes that Roli’s roughly 70 employees will all be moving to the new business.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What If...?’s art style aims to keep characters ‘feeling monumental and powerful’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mlXfIKrK4wfVcowsbeUmqWMqjUY=/0x0:2622x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807664/102_BEC1120_comp_v001.1033.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRzk4q"&gt;Ryan Meinerding has spent much of the last 15 years bringing some of the world’s most iconic superheroes to life. After starting as an illustrator on the original &lt;em&gt;Iron Man&lt;/em&gt;, he worked his way up to head of visual development at Marvel Studios and has spent more than a decade figuring out how to bring comic book characters into live-action films. So it was a nice change of pace when he learned about &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;, an animated anthology that takes those very same characters but remixes them in new, and often strange, situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GGRyg"&gt;“I don’t think anyone could have come up with an animated project that I would’ve been more interested in working on,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The endless possibilities that are created by having the multiverse, by being able to ask questions like what if, really means that the creativity is just incredible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="z88swX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What If...? is a playful expansion of Marvel’s multiverse","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22617245/what-if-marvel-disney-plus-streaming-interview-multiverse"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sIErt1cw_Y41Ts7mObWclPDPLXg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819907/101_ALA0340_comp_v903_20201218_r709.00001793.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DnOsa4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22617245/what-if-marvel-disney-plus-streaming-interview-multiverse"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; is currently streaming on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and the premise is right there in the name: each episode imagines a different “what if” scenario in which a small moment changes the trajectory of an iconic character. What if an assassin started killing off the Avengers? What if T’Challa became Star-Lord instead of Peter Quill? The most recent episode questions what would happen if Doctor Strange didn’t lose his hands, but instead lost the love of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NvnIO7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What is the version that hasn’t been seen before?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4MZdgq"&gt;Visually, all of the characters are recognizable from their live-action appearances, but with a decidedly stylized look. Meinerding says the art style was strongly inspired by famed illustrator &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._Leyendecker"&gt;JC Leyendecker&lt;/a&gt;, aiming for a look that was both realistic and exaggerated. “The fun of the show is taking something that’s based in reality — in a live-action context — and keeping the animated style relatively realistic,” Meinerding explains. “That’s what Leyendecker did. He stylized and he idealized, but they were always meant to be more real than not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grc5Eb"&gt;Meinerding says the team didn’t explore many different styles; from his earliest days working on &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;, Leyendecker was the goal. “I think we were homing in on Leyendecker because of his ability to stylize, to make characters feel monumental,” he says. “If you’re looking at translating a cinematic universe of superheroes into an animated form, there have been a lot of superhero projects that have been done before… What is the version that hasn’t been seen before, but also keeps them kind of realistic, keeps them feeling monumental and powerful?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9dfBZyzkwmV3NdeayR_GKz7XuE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819908/104_EGA0160_comp_v003.1057.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G0zoLd"&gt;It was also a chance to have some fun. While the characters in &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; are mostly recognizable, they’ve also been remixed in interesting ways. Steve Rogers remains a skinny kid, and now he pilots a 1940s take on the Iron Man suit. (In the first episode, Peggy Carter receives the supersoldier serum meant for Steve.) T’Challa doesn’t just don Star-Lord’s leather jacket and mask; he changes those around him, turning the Ravagers from a shady criminal syndicate into a Robin Hood-like organization trying to do good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yJkJu4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We really were just doing our best to keep up”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g13cPG"&gt;In the fourth episode, viewers get to see two sides of Doctor Strange, one warped from absorbing powerful creatures. “So much about designing for animation is about silhouette, simplifying, and making characters very readable,” Meinerding explains. “The idea of being able to push Doctor Strange’s collar just &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;much farther, so he could feel a little more evil… and also just a little more animated. Each character has a version of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fqzc5V"&gt;According to Meinerding, the biggest challenge wasn’t coming up with new ideas — it was keeping pace with the show’s writers. “There is a definite opportunity to push things,” he says. “But in a lot of ways, they were pushing things with the story so much, with how far they were deviating from the MCU timeline, that we really were just doing our best to keep up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3y2Cke"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDfz1v"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
