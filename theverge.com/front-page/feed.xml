    <title>Google’s next Nest Hub could use radar to track your sleep, and I have questions  </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C3dtmd"&gt;Earlier this week, we reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213539/google-nest-hub-update-fcc-filing-soli-motion-sense-gestures"&gt;Google could be working on an updated Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt; that had Soli technology, and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/07/nest-hub-soli-sleep/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now suggests that it could be for something unexpected: sleep tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8AUsp"&gt;If you aren’t familiar, Soli is Google’s radar technology used to detect gestures and human presence. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20908083/google-pixel-4-project-soli-radar-motion-sense-explainer"&gt;first introduced in the Pixel 4&lt;/a&gt; (which was discontinued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356745/google-pixel-4-xl-discontinued-out-of-stock"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt;), and while it isn’t in any of Google’s current Pixel devices, it’s now showing up in smart home devices, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"&gt;like the Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jyILr"&gt;So there is precedent for Google including the tech in its smart home devices. And the Nest Hub already looks a bit like an alarm clock, and because it doesn’t have a camera built-in, it may be more accepted into the bedroom for sleep tracking. But I still have a couple of questions about how it might work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BzpDML"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are a lot of ways having motion controls in an alarm clock makes sense.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CFhuUt"&gt;As almost every sleep aid commercial points out, we all sleep differently. So far, Soli has been pretty short range, so what happens if you roll over to the other side of the bed? Is it going to lose track of you? What if you have a pet who likes to come and lay by (or on) your head? Will it start tracking their movement instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrisBH"&gt;There’s also the problem of nightstands. Those who do own nightstands may have them in totally different places in relation to where they sleep, and some may not have them at all. So far, Soli has only been used directionally, so it’s unclear how Google would handle having to deal with detecting movement and presence at a variety of angles and distances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWiQh3"&gt;Perhaps Google will surprise us and have this all figured out when they announce the product, or maybe sleep tracking will only work under certain circumstances. Despite my questions, though, I think there are a lot of other ways in which having motion controls in an alarm clock makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYAkfa"&gt;I’m not necessarily able to coherently speak when I first wake up, so being able to, as my coworker suggested, wildly wave my hand at the Nest Hub to turn off an alarm would be a neat trick. People who wake up to music could also wave to skip a song if the one that comes on isn’t how they want to start their day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqPxjk"&gt;If all this sounds intriguing to you, the &lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;report says that the Soli-enabled Nest Hub should come at some point this year. The FCC filings that hit this week could also indicate that the product may be coming soon. While they don’t always guarantee that a product will be released, we do sometimes see them before official product announcements.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC chairman Ajit Pai gave up on his legally dicey attempt to ‘clarify’ internet law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="FCC Chair Ajit Pai Testifies Before Senate On Agency’s Oversight" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/htTsnxvwBaOv77TyT1bDL8aANlI=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68635745/1251845368.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rkAMIQ"&gt;On October 15th, FCC chairman Ajit Pai &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21518097/fcc-social-media-censorship-moderation-ajit-pai-section-230-nypost-biden"&gt;promised that the FCC would “move forward with a rulemaking”&lt;/a&gt; to clarify the “meaning” of Section 230, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;the all-important internet law&lt;/a&gt; that protects free speech online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUkYGV"&gt;Apparently, Pai never got around to that — and less than three months later, he no longer plans to, either, explaining he’s short on time. “[T]here’s simply not sufficient time to complete the administrative steps necessary in order to resolve the rule-making. Given that reality, I do not believe it’s appropriate to move forward,” &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/ajit-pai-distancing-trump"&gt;he tells &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYZPQz"&gt;The reason he’s short on time is pretty simple: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726572/ajit-pai-fcc-step-down-date-trump-telecom-net-neutrality"&gt;he’s stepping down on January 20th&lt;/a&gt;, when Joe Biden becomes President of the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79gM2W"&gt;But he might also be giving up because the idea that the FCC had the power to do such a thing was laughable. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/21519337/section-230-trump-fcc-twitter-facebook-social-media-ajit-pai"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; explains in depth&lt;/a&gt;, the FCC’s justification was effectively that it has the power to make whatever rules it needs to make — which flies in the face of the logic Pai’s own FCC used to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776154/fcc-net-neutrality-vote-results-rules-repealed"&gt;kill net neutrality&lt;/a&gt;. But that didn’t stop Pai from claiming the FCC did have the authority to do it, a political tactic that’s become so common in the Trump administration that my colleague Russell Brandom &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/russellbrandom/status/1346858060929785856"&gt;coined a phrase for it&lt;/a&gt;: “stunt legalism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ez2Btg"&gt;Never mind that Section 230 isn’t actually that difficult to understand — though that admittedly &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210104/01172345990/60-minutes-episode-is-pure-misleading-moral-panic-about-section-230-blames-unrelated-issues-it.shtml"&gt;didn’t keep &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; from falling on its face&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;Here’s our explainer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HcgbIW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Everything you need to know about Section 230","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ixRVol"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok will remove videos of Trump inciting supporters to storm the Capitol</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eR0u1wlxMI_S0sfFMKd1ZLf3dgk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68635555/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qRk7zR"&gt;TikTok will remove videos of President Trump’s speech inciting supporters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;to mob the US Capitol&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, saying they violate the company’s misinformation policy. TikTok will still let people post “counter speech” videos that dispute incorrect claims, however, and will let videos remain on the platform if they condemn violence or if they’re posted by news organizations. &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/tiktok-bans-videos-of-trump-inciting-mob-blocks-stormthecapital-and-other-hashtags/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"&gt;the first to report the news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgW8gL"&gt;“Hateful behavior and violence have no place on TikTok,” the company said in a statement. “Content or accounts that seek to incite, glorify, or promote violence violate our Community Guidelines and will be removed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfnPDT"&gt;TikTok is also blocking certain hashtags related to the riots, such as #stormthecapitol and #patriotparty, like it did with other hashtags that represented election-related conspiracy theories &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551717/facebook-tiktok-block-election-conspiracy-theory-hashtags-twitter-monitoring"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;. If you try to search for one of these blocked hashtags, you’ll see a page that says the hashtag “may be associated with behavior or content that violates our guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Eh4wBvXBkcQF5qrluizrIZx16c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22221052/IMG_0144.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="709u3a"&gt;TikTok joins other social media platforms in restricting some content about Wednesday’s riots. Facebook committed to removing content supporting the storming of the Capitol or encouraged Wednesday’s events, among other measures in a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/responding-to-the-violence-in-washington-dc/"&gt;blog that it posted Wednesday evening&lt;/a&gt;. The company went a step further by banning Trump’s account “indefinitely” on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Thursday morning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6noS7X"&gt;Twitter said it was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1346926979505737729"&gt;taking action&lt;/a&gt; against tweets that violated its rules and that it was “significantly restricting engagement with Tweets labeled under our Civic Integrity Policy due to the risk of violence.” The company placed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;temporary lock&lt;/a&gt; on Trump’s account on Wednesday evening and has threatened a permanent suspension if he violates its rules again. Trump returned to Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218794/trump-twitter-ban-lifted-unbanned-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Thursday evening&lt;/a&gt;, promising a smooth transition of power to the Biden administration. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump returns to Twitter and promises a smooth transition of power</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRutCc"&gt;Twitter has lifted its ban on President Donald Trump, and his latest tweet is very different than the ones we’ve seen for many months. Though he does not say he lost, his latest video feels like a concession speech. “Now that Congress has certified the results, a new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th,” he says. “My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power.” Trump had issued a similar statement about “an orderly transition” this morning &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/1347103015493361664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1347103015493361664%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2021%2F01%2F07%2Ftrump-says-there-will-be-an-orderly-transition-of-power.html"&gt;through a surrogate account&lt;/a&gt; — that of White House social media director Dan Scavino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZ5NaA"&gt;The president’s own account was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;locked on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; after a mob of his supporters broke into the US Capitol, and Twitter said it would stay that way until he deleted several tweets and then waited 12 hours. A Twitter spokesperson confirmed Thursday morning that the tweets in question had been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pgnNgK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/csX07ZVWGe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/csX07ZVWGe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1347334804052844550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xI8MDi"&gt;Trump returns to Twitter in a more tenuous position than ever before. The company said he’s now at risk of a permanent ban if he continues to violate Twitter rules around misinformation and incitement of violence. Once Trump leaves the White House on January 20th, he’ll also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21552606/trump-twitter-world-leader-public-interest-exception-ends-january-loss"&gt;lose special “public interest” protections&lt;/a&gt; that applied to his account while he was in office, which could make it easier for the company to enforce its rules over Trump tweets that cross the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMVCua"&gt;Twitter banned Trump on Wednesday over a series of tweets spreading lies about the election outcome and a video the company said posed a “risk of violence.” In that video, Trump reiterated his false claims that the election was stolen, praised the mob that broke into the US Capitol, and told them it was time to “go home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cG88Ns"&gt;Facebook and YouTube removed the same video from Trump. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook later “indefinitely” banned Trump&lt;/a&gt; due to his use of the platform to “incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government,” saying the risks are “are simply too great” of allowing him to remain. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the ban would remain in place at least through Inauguration Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IbUNaU"&gt;Trump’s new video still includes misinformation, specifically a lie that he “immediately” deployed the National Guard to the Capitol. However, Twitter says that it won’t be placing a label on the tweet due to that, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1347339743940419584"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;’ Ryan Mac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XeTwZ"&gt;Five people died during the Capitol riot, according to reports.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel launches RealSense ID, facial recognition tech that uses the company’s depth-sensing cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VPH8gx9cUApisoFJwtbcLxri3IM=/54x0:636x388/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68635336/Intel_RealSense_ID_2_690x388.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eCYa2C"&gt;Intel launched &lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/introducing-intel-realsense-id-facial-authentication/#gs.px9cc8"&gt;RealSense ID&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, a facial recognition solution that relies on its RealSense depth-sensing technology (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/intel-pivots-its-realsense-cameras-into-facial-recognit-1845995990"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). RealSense started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/11/4719380/asus-dell-hp-and-lenovo-will-embed-motion-tracking-cameras-into"&gt;as a Kinect-style camera&lt;/a&gt; for touch-free interaction, but RealSense ID seems like Intel’s attempt to reposition its camera business towards secure, on-device facial recognition first, while also potentially putting the company in the crossfire of controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtUkIk"&gt;RealSense ID builds on Intel’s depth-sensing technology with a neural network for identifying faces, a dedicated system-on-a-chip, and a secure element that encrypts and processes user data. The device should learn and adapt to a face over time, working around facial hair, a variety of different skin tones, and face masks, &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; writes. The tech is available on a module that can be integrated into other products or as a standalone peripheral that can be plugged into a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CsTHRk2QnrXm8ZBUlwZdN9df8RQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22218622/Intel_RealSense_ID_1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel’s RealSense ID.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aX52mu"&gt;Intel’s RealSense tech has been knocking around for several years, popping up in odd, tech demo use cases like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10724248/fallout-4-mod-uraniom-face-intel-realsense-ces-2016"&gt;inserting your face into Fallout 4&lt;/a&gt;, and more useful ones like unlocking a laptop with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8231993/windows-hello-windows-10-biometric-authentication"&gt;Windows Hello&lt;/a&gt;. Intel suggests this new application of RealSense could be used in a variety of settings, like ATMs, registers, and smart locks. What the company doesn’t mention is the other popular use of facial recognition: governments and law enforcement agencies tracking and profiling people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iv1GOF"&gt;Just in the last year, facial recognition software created by Huawei was used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163499/huawei-uighur-surveillance-facial-recognition-megvii-uyghur"&gt;to track the persecuted Uighur minority in China&lt;/a&gt;. And in the US this past summer, facial recognition tech was used by the New York City Police Department to track a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373316/nypd-facial-recognition-black-lives-matter-activist-derrick-ingram"&gt;Black Lives Matter activist accused of assault&lt;/a&gt;. Intel says it processes facial recognition on-device, but it’s not clear how that would work to give you access to a bank’s ATMs or at cash registers. Beyond the potential for abuse, facial recognition software has been found to be biased for both race and gender, opening up the possibility for false positives. For example, a version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197137/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-bias-race-gender"&gt;Amazon’s facial recognition software Rekognition&lt;/a&gt;, had a harder time identifying people if they were female or dark-skinned than if they were white men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jpS0mh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reduced racial bias, perhaps?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pjARNB"&gt;Intel has taken steps to address the potential for bias in RealSense ID by building out a more diverse sample of faces to train RealSense on. “We’ve done extensive data collection of all ethnicities from Asia, Europe, Middle East Africa,” Intel &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/06/intel-launches-realsense-id-for-on-device-facial-recognition/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at a press briefing for the new device. Intel says RealSense ID has one-in-a-million chance of falsely identifying someone, but we’ll have to wait and see if outside researchers find flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ylo9id"&gt;Facial recognition isn’t the only future Intel imagines for RealSense. For this year’s digital CES, the company announced &lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/turn-touch-interface-touchless-intel-realsense-tcs/#gs.q0dzl7"&gt;RealSense Touchless Control Software (TCS)&lt;/a&gt;, which uses Intel’s RealSense Depth Camera to allow you to interact with a touchscreen by hovering your finger over it, rather than touching it. Like facial recognition, the new application makes a lot of sense for a world still dealing with a pandemic, and shows there’s still some room for RealSense’s motion controller past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjWQ9B"&gt;Intel’s RealSense ID peripheral is available for pre-order now for $99, and the RealSense ID Module is available in a pack of 10 for $750. Intel plans to start shipping both in March.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Monster Hunter Rise looks like a strong Switch successor to World</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wc4vMYPbodb2LAwqWFvlPFUkaKg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68635082/ErIsE26UcAExvdL.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zrRZLq"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter World&lt;/em&gt; was a huge success, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682599/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-preview-kaname-fujioka-interview-e3-2019"&gt;becoming one of Capcom’s bestselling games in history&lt;/a&gt; and exposing far more people to a series that had only ever been truly popular in Japan, it came at a cost. The move to modern console hardware meant &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; looked and played better than ever before, but it also meant leaving the series’s portable roots behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUgyrd"&gt;Even in Japan, &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; only really took off when it came to the PSP, with people gathering in person to take down monsters together. It may not look like it, given its long, drawn-out combat system, but &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; is a perfect portable game. You can do simple grinding on a quick commute while listening to podcasts, then tackle the major challenges when you’re with friends or have the ability to devote your attention to a high-ranked online quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZvj3x"&gt;If that’s sparking an inevitable “this-should-be-on-the-Switch” response, well, here’s &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt;. This is an all-new entry in the series that takes much of what made &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt; more accessible but puts it on even more flexible hardware. And very soon, you can check it out for yourself with a demo that should be going live on Nintendo’s eShop at some point today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5tIWEQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Monster Hunter World makes huge changes but keeps the series’s soul","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16591486/monster-hunter-world-preview-hands-on-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pdzRu6"&gt;Capcom provided me with an early version of the demo, and I’m pretty impressed so far. The demo includes two quests and a couple of training stages, which isn’t nearly enough to get a sense of the game’s scope or progression, but the fundamentals look to be very solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wBBU8"&gt;The biggest question I had was how much of a technical compromise &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; would be over &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;, considering the Switch’s hardware limitations when compared to the PS4 and Xbox One. Of course, I expected &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; to fall somewhere between &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Generations Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/28/17790402/monster-hunter-generations-ultimate-nintendo-switch"&gt;a Switch version of a 3DS game&lt;/a&gt;. And from what I’ve seen from the demo, the visuals are much closer to &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;, while the level complexity is more like the older games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDVTfj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; lifts &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;’s UI and art direction wholesale, with characters and monsters looking reasonably comparable in quality, at least on my Switch Lite’s screen. The resolution is crisp, and the frame rate holds up well enough. But the environment in the demo is much simpler and less visually impressive than anything in &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;, even though it’s still a lot better-looking than &lt;em&gt;Generations Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;. There are also no loading screens between the numbered sub-areas, which makes for a big upgrade on pre-&lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt; entries in the &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter &lt;/em&gt;series.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LLyzp8Pv9pKNedVramhzfC1__lg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219655/Eo_n51WXIAAwdyT.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oOIAbQ"&gt;Otherwise, &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; appears to play pretty much like &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;, with the requisite new features that accompany every &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; release. There’s a new tool called the Wirebug that’s like a more advanced version of the “clutch claw” grappling hook from &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;’s Iceborne expansion. You can ride a dog companion across the levels or even commandeer unwitting monsters that wander into your arena, setting them against your ultimate target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJ7rlu"&gt;I’m looking forward to reviewing &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; in full ahead of its release on March 26th because the early signs are promising. The Switch is the ideal platform for &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; in many ways, and Capcom seems to be going all-out in making &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; a first-class title in its own right rather than a compromised port. For anyone who’s been waiting for a new handheld &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt;, the news is looking good.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to set up two-factor authentication on your online accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vLYLBlBpiHxeKVyBro78kS2OuZY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68635030/akrales_170614_1776_0058.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amelia Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="96nXbn"&gt;Just about any account you own on the internet is prone to being hacked. After numerous widespread breaches through the past few years, tech companies have been working together to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18249895/web-authentication-webauthn-world-wide-web-consortium-w3c-standard-browsers"&gt;develop a standard&lt;/a&gt; that would make passwords a thing of the past, replacing them with more secure methods like biometric or PIN-based logins that do not require transferring data over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzdYrE"&gt;But while those standards are still being adopted, the next best way to secure your accounts is two-factor authentication, or 2FA. This a process that gives web services secondary access to the account owner (you) in order to verify a login attempt. Typically, this involves a phone number and / or email address. This is how it works: when you log in to a service, you use your mobile phone to verify your identity by either clicking on a texted / emailed link or typing in a number sent by an authenticator app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Go1Z1k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:6019722"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LzRe1A"&gt;What are authenticator apps?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MtJf72"&gt;Authenticator apps are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/16/18098286/vovox-security-breach-two-factor-authentication-2fa-codes-exposed"&gt;considered more secure than texting&lt;/a&gt;. They also offer flexibility when you are traveling to a place without cellular service. Popular options include &lt;a href="https://authy.com/"&gt;Authy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en"&gt;Google Authenticator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Faccount%2Fauthenticator" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Authenticator&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fhde-otp-generator%2Fid571240327%3Fmt%3D8%26ign-mpt%3Duo%253D8%26at%3D10l7an&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22215571%2Ffactor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hennge OTP&lt;/a&gt; (iOS only). These apps mostly follow the same procedure when adding a new account: you scan a QR code associated with your account, and it is saved in the app. The next time you log in to your service or app, it will ask for a numerical code; just open up the authenticator app to find the randomly generated code required to get past security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarOxI"&gt;While 2FA — via text, email, or an authenticator app — does not completely cloak you from potential hackers, it is an important step in preventing your account from being accessed by unauthorized users. Here’s how to enable 2FA on your accounts across the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rzz8Rl"&gt;Apple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="11gB7w"&gt;Two-factor authentication is currently offered to Apple users on iOS 9 and later or macOS X El Capitan and later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyVQno"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKeB69"&gt;The steps are slightly different depending on how updated your iOS software is. For those using iOS 10.3 or later, you can enable 2FA on your Apple ID by going to Settings &amp;gt; [Your Name] &amp;gt; Password &amp;amp; Security. Turn on 2FA to receive a text message with a code each time you log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYrr8t"&gt;For those using iOS 10.2 or earlier, the settings are under iCloud &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; Password &amp;amp; Security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKUQDC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;macOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="td54Cr"&gt;Again, steps are slightly different depending on your version of macOS. If you’re using Catalina, click the Apple icon on the upper-left corner of your screen, then click System Preferences &amp;gt; Apple ID. Click on Password &amp;amp; Security under your name, and then select “Turn On Two-Factor Authentication.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtKOiS"&gt;For Mojave and earlier, after you click the Apple icon, click System Preferences &amp;gt; iCloud &amp;gt; Account Details. (You can shorten this step a bit by typing in “iCloud” using Spotlight.) Click on Security, and you’ll see the option to turn 2FA on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5jvEv"&gt;The remainder of the steps, from either iOS or Mac, are the same. You can opt for Apple to send you a six-digit verification code by text message or a phone call. You can also set up a physical security key here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r40w1c"&gt;Instagram&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7W3jFx"&gt;Instagram added 2FA to its mobile app in 2017, but now you can also activate it through the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMJiDL"&gt;To activate 2FA on your mobile app, head over to your profile and click the hamburger menu on the upper-right corner. Look for “Settings” &amp;gt; “Security,” where you’ll find a menu item for Two-Factor Authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVIq21"&gt;Here, you can choose between text message-based verification or a code sent to your authentication app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qKSxexIkcqXfqkNlQViNqjyTZO0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8700877/VRG02AK_1776_HOW_TO_2FA_02.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Amelia Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U3yEg4"&gt;To turn on 2FA using the web, log in and head to your profile. Next to your profile name and the Edit Profile button, there is a gear icon. Clicking this will pop open a settings menu, where you can find the same Privacy and Security section as on the app. From here, you can turn on 2FA and, just as in the app, choose your method for verification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Clicking on the gear icon will pop open a settings menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kg0a6CXU1-0YVbY54FFtA2UjQno=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219580/Screen_Shot_2021_01_07_at_9.26.45_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clicking on the gear icon will pop open a settings menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eYbxgD"&gt;Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aOzHeQ"&gt;The way to access Facebook’s 2FA settings is a bit different on the app and the web (and Facebook tends to update both layouts often). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWtSB4"&gt;You can access your privacy settings on the mobile app on both iOS and Android by clicking the hamburger icon on the upper-right corner and scrolling down to the bottom to find the “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy” menu. Tap “Settings” &amp;gt; “Security and Login” and scroll down to “Use two-factor authentication.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqC8Js"&gt;Like Instagram (they are part of the same company, after all), you can opt for a text message or an authentication app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G48ylI"&gt;On the web, click the down arrow in the upper-right corner, and select “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy” &amp;gt; “Privacy Shortcuts.” Look for the “Account Security” heading and click on “Use two-factor authentication.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook lets you authenticate via text message or authentication app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xacohqvYZKiCrsOC_dzza74CT78=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219584/Screen_Shot_2021_01_07_at_9.31.18_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook lets you authenticate via text message or authentication app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7Cvcij"&gt;Additionally, for apps that don’t support 2FA when logging in with a Facebook account (such as Xbox and Spotify), you can generate a unique password specifically associated with that account. From the original down arrow, select “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy” &amp;gt; “Settings” and then, from the menu on the left, “Security &amp;amp; Login” &amp;gt; “App passwords” (under the “Two-Factor Authorization” subhead). After resubmitting your Facebook password, you’ll be able to name the app, click generate, and save that password for the next time you have to log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PZ2iUM"&gt;Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFo0DY"&gt;On the Twitter mobile app, tap the three-line “hamburger” icon at the top left of the screen and find the “Settings and privacy” selection. Go to “Account” &amp;gt; “Security.”  Click on “Two-factor authentication” and follow the directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaAdva"&gt;On the web, click on “More” in the left-hand menu and find “Settings and privacy.” Click on “Security and account access” (or you can just follow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/security_and_account_access"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;). Select “Security” &amp;gt; “Two-factor authorization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjA6YE"&gt;Once you’re all set up, Twitter will either ask for verification through an authentication app, or you will text a code number to your phone number when you want to log in. Twitter has also added security key support. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twitter 2FA" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xO3a1YjV128HBni2tNODpVkCoE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19931118/Screen_Shot_2020_04_28_at_3.18.14_PM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nyZxI8"&gt;As with other services mentioned above, you can generate a backup code to use when you’re traveling and will be without internet or cell service. You may also see an option to create a temporary app password that you can use to log in from other devices. This can be used to log in to third-party apps if you have them linked to your Twitter account. Note that the temporary password expires one hour after being generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4WMChB"&gt;Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3S9Sst"&gt;Go to the Amazon homepage and log in. Hover over “Accounts &amp;amp; Lists” and click on “Account.” A box labeled “Login &amp;amp; security” will be at the top of the page; click on that and then click the Edit button on “Two-Step Verification (2SV) Settings.” (You may be asked to reenter your password first.) You can also navigate directly to that page by &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/a/settings/approval?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;following this link&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQNtT3"&gt;Click Get Started, and Amazon will walk you through the process of registering your phone number, or you can opt to use your preferred authenticator app by syncing it through a QR code. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yvWGuauq7CG1F_uL2kEbcCNxcZM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8673411/amazon_2fa.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6Uk3JE"&gt;You can activate 2FA on both the Android and iOS Amazon app by tapping the hamburger menu on the left side and finding “Your Account” &amp;gt; “Login &amp;amp; security.” The same “Two-Step Verification (2SV) Settings” selection should be available for you to edit and toggle on 2FA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BTE03PyTqVvvIvwx7jinYhHNNcY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19931158/Screenshot_20200428_152732__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DcGvg7BZRru-imNviPqD8VxOJWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19931160/Screenshot_20200428_152813.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6fi3Cs"&gt;Once your phone number or authenticator app has been verified, you can select trusted devices to bypass 2FA or generate a code to log in via a mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8Mo4Dv"&gt;Google&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sgClWT"&gt;The easiest way to turn 2FA on across your Google accounts (i.e., Gmail, YouTube, or Google Maps) is by heading over to the main &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/"&gt;2FA landing page&lt;/a&gt; and clicking “Get Started.” You’ll be asked to log in then select your mobile device from a list. (If you have an iPhone, you may have to download a separate app.) Google will try to send a message to that phone; if it succeeds, you will be asked to enter a phone number; you can then choose whether you want to receive verification codes by text message or phone call. Again, Google will try out your chosen method. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmqXTo"&gt;After that, Google will first send prompts that allow you to simply click “Yes” or “No” when a login attempt occurs. If that doesn’t work, it will send the text message or phone call.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/meCsWyG9ni-b3aVP0_CwixSZ6tw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19931218/Screen_Shot_2020_04_28_at_3.48.11_PM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5dPy5v"&gt;You can also generate backup codes for offline access. Google generates 10 at a time and they’re designed to be single-use, so once you’ve successfully used one, cross it out (assuming you’ve printed them out) as it will no longer work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pKB4ac"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ls9eeF"&gt;From the app’s main camera screen, tap your profile icon and find the gear icon to access your settings. Select “Two-Factor Authentication” and choose whether to receive a text message verification or hook it up to your authenticator app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U18RpL"&gt;Once 2FA has been enabled on your Snapchat account, you can add trusted devices or request a recovery code for when you’re planning to be somewhere without cellular service. Snapchat does not seem to currently support security key logins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wjkK5G"&gt;Slack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wqXOXa"&gt;To enable 2FA, you’ll first need to find the Account Settings page. There are two ways to access this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OMqM43"&gt;Click on your username on the upper-right corner of the Slack app to open a drop-down menu and select “View profile.” Your account information will now display on the right side of the chat window. Under your avatar and next to the “Edit Profile” button, click the three-dotted icons for additional actions, and find “Account settings.” You can also head straight to &lt;a href="http://my.slack.com/account/settings"&gt;my.slack.com/account/settings&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SuDMWN"&gt;You should immediately see the selection for “Two-Factor Authentication.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lvEr4D"&gt;If you do not see the option for 2FA, check whether your Slack account is for work. Some employers may use single sign-on services that bypass the need for 2FA, which eliminates this from Slack’s Account Settings page.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Like most other apps, Slack lets you use either SMS or an authentication app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dkPknlWqR0oYvH3aW9DkZZClRSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8674071/slack_2fa.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like most other apps, Slack lets you use either SMS or an authentication app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="95lwat"&gt;If this is a personal Slack, however, then click “Expand” on “Two-Factor Authentication” to verify your information by an SMS or authenticator app. If you have multiple email addresses, you may need to select a default one before you can decide on your preferred 2FA method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LH5W9F"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="y7VGEa"&gt;Log in to your Microsoft account and find the “&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.microsoft.com%2Ffwlink%2Fp%2F%3FLinkId%3D529561" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Security settings&lt;/a&gt;” menu (there are several ways to get there; click on the link for the easiest). Look for the “Two-step verification” section and click on the setup link. You’ll be walked through the steps needed to use either the Microsoft Authenticator app or use a different authentication app. You’ll also be able to create passwords for apps that don’t accept 2FA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pOena7"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SUjv2h"&gt;From your Dropbox homepage on the web, click your profile avatar and find Settings; then go to the Security tab. Find Two-Step Verification; it will tell you the status of your 2FA. Toggle to turn the feature on and choose to receive 2FA through a text or your authenticator app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BnMf_xf_gWHbAYow1HIjw-lI8jg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15980136/Screen_Shot_2019_03_22_at_1.37.09_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7G6Osl"&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AGdipv"&gt;Open up WhatsApp, and find the Settings menu under the upper-right hamburger icon. Look under “Account” &amp;gt; “Two-step verification” &amp;gt; “Enable.” The app will ask you to enter a six-digit PIN to use as verification and optionally add an email address in case you forget your PIN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHDrKE"&gt;Having an associated email with your WhatsApp account is important since the service won’t let you reverify yourself if you’ve used WhatsApp within the last seven days and have forgotten your PIN. So if you can’t wait a week to reverify for whatever reason, it’s helpful to have entered an email address so you can log yourself in or disable 2FA. In the same vein: be cautious of emails encouraging you to turn off 2FA if you didn’t request it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fJBuLy"&gt;PayPal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="swH76g"&gt;On the main Summary page, click the gear icon and find the Security tab. Look for the section called “2-step verification” and click on the Set Up link. You’ll get a choice to have a code texted to you or use an authenticator app. (PayPal also offers to find you an authenticator app if you want one.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5VpUYQov6WZAdVtKQRhQavw2BI8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19932894/Screen_Shot_2020_04_29_at_11.18.22_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VvQbdI"&gt;If you lose your phone, change numbers, or decide to revoke authorization rights, come back to this menu to make adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7Ywec"&gt;Note that the interface is different if you use PayPal as a business account. From the main Summary page, click the gear icon to be taken to the Settings page. Under Login and Security, look for the Security Key option to add your phone number or a security key as your 2FA method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="izBJXc"&gt;Nest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9DSl8"&gt;Smart home products like Nest are not exempt from getting hacked — in fact, Nest now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133264/google-nest-2fa-force-two-factor-authentication"&gt;strongly encourages its users to enroll in 2FA&lt;/a&gt;. For Nest, make sure your app is up to date on all of your devices. Then, on the home screen, go to Settings &amp;gt; Account &amp;gt; Manage account &amp;gt; Account security, and select two-step verification. Toggle the switch to on. A series of prompts will ask for your password, phone number, and the verification code that will be sent to your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dVQRg"&gt;Keep in mind that all of your devices will be automatically signed out, so you’ll have to sign in again using the two-step verification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVOKMf"&gt;If all your family members don’t have their own logins and have been using yours, it’s a good idea to set them up with separate logins using Family Accounts. Otherwise, when they try to log on using two-step verification, the necessary code will be sent to your phone, not theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eb6xru"&gt;Ring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RwA4Jd"&gt;Like with Nest, make sure your Ring app is up to date. Swipe over from the left, then go to “Account” &amp;gt; “Two-Factor Authentication” (you’ll find it under “Enhanced Security”). Tap the big “Turn on two-factor” button. A series of prompts will ask for your password, phone number, and the verification code that will be sent to your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jxBIA"&gt;From then on, you’ll need both your password and an SMS verification code whenever you want to log in to Ring from a new device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3wZlHD"&gt;Signal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gifHsA"&gt;Rather than traditional 2FA, Signal uses a PIN. Click your profile icon on the upper-left side and find “Privacy.” Look for “Registration Lock” to require your PIN (which you were asked for when you originally registered) to be entered each time you re-register your phone number. Signal requires your PIN to be at least four digits long, and up to a maximum of 20 digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qH37IU"&gt;When you first enable Registration Lock, Signal will ask you to type in your PIN in the first six and 12 hours after being enabled. The company says this is designed to help you to remember it through random repetition. So after the first day, it will ask you to enter it in the next day, then in three days, and finally one last time after a full week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkUwwu"&gt;If you happen to forget your PIN and can’t log in to Signal, you will have to wait seven days of inactivity for your registration lock to expire, after which you can log in to your app again to set up a new PIN. Those who are already actively using Signal won’t have to worry about the Registration Lock resetting, as that clock only starts when the app isn’t open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u4ZojK"&gt;Did we miss your favorite apps?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wxgHe3"&gt;For services not listed on this guide, check out &lt;a href="http://TwoFactorAuth.org"&gt;TwoFactorAuth.org&lt;/a&gt; to find the app or service in question. This helpful site links to every official guide for companies that support 2FA, and gives you the option to message the company on Twitter, Facebook, or email to add 2FA if it currently does not have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4X9gF"&gt;On a final note: while adding 2FA is great for an extra layer of security on all your accounts, remember that you should be changing and updating your passwords regularly even with 2FA enabled, just to stay in tip-top shape. If that’s not your style, you can also use a password manager to automatically take care of it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9p5hbc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 7th, 2021: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on June 19th, 2017, and has been checked and updated several times so that the instructions for adding 2FA to these apps remain current. This is the latest update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Federal courts go low-tech for sensitive documents following SolarWinds hack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HeFc4IQCkRpieWe5zDaQ3IoFlgI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68635017/acastro_170621_1777_0006_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wh3gyL"&gt;The list of companies and agencies discovering that they’ve been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210667/solarwinds-hack-worse-government-microsoft-cybersecurity"&gt;affected by the SolarWinds hack&lt;/a&gt; is still growing, and they’re working with a big unknown: how far the hackers got into their systems. The federal judiciary system is likely now one of them (&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-judiciarys-systems-likely-breached-in-solarwinds-hack-11610040175"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and it isn’t taking any chances. It’s worried enough that court workers will now have to physically deliver sensitive documents, despite the ongoing pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkDym4"&gt;The judiciary’s &lt;a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/news/2021/01/06/judiciary-addresses-cybersecurity-breach-extra-safeguards-protect-sensitive-court"&gt;new procedures&lt;/a&gt; sound rather intense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="1k1shJ"&gt;Under the new procedures announced today, highly sensitive court documents (HSDs) filed with federal courts will be accepted for filing in paper form or via a secure electronic device, such as a thumb drive, and stored in a secure stand-alone computer system. These sealed HSDs will not be uploaded to CM/ECF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VxDyaS"&gt;The message here is clear: the judiciary does not want its most sensitive documents on the system until it figures out what the hackers have done to it, and it’s willing to add quite a bit of friction to the process of filing the documents. They can no longer just send them through the internet; they’ll have to hand-deliver actual paper or USB sticks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="wHxejE"&gt;We fully appreciate the practical implications of taking these steps and the administrative burden they will place on courts, yet any such burdens are outweighed by the need to preserve the confidentiality of sealed filings that are at risk of compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WdcV1s"&gt;The documents in question are not necessarily the regular sealed records of everyday court proceedings. &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; article points out that the HSDs could contain detailed explanations of how investigators work a case, as well as information on people who could currently be under surveillance. Knowing this information could help someone avoid detection or investigation, which is why it’s so important to keep it secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6y3rwt"&gt;While the measures show that the judiciary feels it can’t trust its existing networks, the public’s access to court records won’t be changing. Any records that would’ve been publicly available will still be uploaded to the Case Management and Electronic Case Files system. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Online researchers scramble to identify Capitol raid participants</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pro-Trump protesters trying to enter Capitol building." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/StgMXekQdYzvuVQVzFi8Ehe5Fiw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68634879/1230465097.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Lev Radin / Pacific Press / LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3rOPcb"&gt;For years, police have been warning about the dangers of crowdsourced detective work — but on Thursday morning, the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) of Washington, DC decided to do just that. In the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217601/congress-capitol-building-takeover-coup-photos-pro-trump-mob"&gt;an unprecedented mob attack on the Capitol building&lt;/a&gt;, the MPD has released an open call for help identifying subjects. The department has circulated &lt;a href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/mpdc/publication/attachments/POIs%20of%20Interest_1.7.21.pdf"&gt;a digital booklet&lt;/a&gt; featuring 26 pages of faces from the attack, with a hotline number for anyone who can help identify them. The FBI has &lt;a href="https://tips.fbi.gov/digitalmedia/aad18481a3e8f02"&gt;made a similar request&lt;/a&gt;, although neither agency has produced any arrests as a result of the photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhuaYd"&gt;The alarming nature of the attack, combined with the failure of Capitol Police to detain or process the intruders, has led to a nationwide digital manhunt. The event was captured in hundreds of photos, videos, and live streams, revealing the faces of dozens of perpetrators. Now, researchers are rushing to identify and prosecute those faces as a way to reassert control, drawing a wealth of tweets, live streams, and Instagram posts into an open-source almanac of everyone who can be reliably tied to the attack. It’s a more reliable version of the internet detective work that crashed and burned in earlier online communities — but this time, the footage is spread across hundreds of different sources, and the police are in on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YvJEGW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We aim to collect enough information to understand what happened.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2ypm5a"&gt;There’s so much available footage of the rally that simply collecting it has proven to be a challenge. Since the attack began, the open-source intelligence outlet Bellingcat has been collecting first-hand media from the attack, a process they opened up to volunteers &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YdYWj-LQ5mAg3je0bogfrm5IjXjviyiX0yUu4M7ZSD8/edit#gid=560421713"&gt;as a Google sheet&lt;/a&gt; when the severe scale of the attack became clear. There are now more than 100 videos and a dozen full-length live streams in the spreadsheet, all ruthlessly monitored for duplicates and any identifiable faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYotV6"&gt;“We aim to collect enough information to understand what happened,” says Bellingcat researcher Nick Waters, who is running the project. “A major part of that will be to examine who led this attack against the Capitol. We’ve already seen multiple notable members of the far-right who were part of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3V9ni"&gt;A parallel project has formed &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/krx449/megathread_archiving_the_capitol_hill_riots/"&gt;on Reddit’s Data Hoarders forum&lt;/a&gt;, where a volunteer effort has begun scraping and archiving content at a massive scale. Launched last night, a thread shows 100 tweets and more than 12GB of data added to a collectively managed torrent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5Pa0r2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are basically doing their job.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tHUqE0"&gt;When one commenter offered a link to the FBI’s tips page, another shot back that there was no point. “Dude, the FBI has been all over this thread for hours,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/krx449/megathread_archiving_the_capitol_hill_riots/gif2rhq/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “We are basically doing their job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="quzemZ"&gt;It’s a new look for Reddit, which once represented the irresponsible side of online detective work. In 2013, the platform was at the center of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/18/4238768/online-witch-hunt-for-boston-bomber-leads-to-ny-post-cover-photo-mess"&gt;a chaotic search&lt;/a&gt; for the perpetrator of the Boston Marathon bombing. Poring through publicly available footage of the moments leading up to the explosion, volunteer investigators ended up identifying two innocent men as perpetrators of the crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kl2zjD"&gt;This time, the work seems to be proceeding more carefully and successfully. In fact, many of the people in the MPD’s digital lineup have already been identified through this kind of open-source detective work. One of the most prominent figures in the Senate chamber — seen both roaming the halls and posing on the Senate dais — was identified early by journalist Will Sommer, who &lt;a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2021/01/07/face-painted-man-horned-fur-cap-capitol-riot-supports-trump-and-qanon-not-antifa/6578929002/"&gt;recognized him as QAnon promoter Jake Angeli&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/07/capitol-riots-indiana-connections-chaos-washington-d-c/6579234002/"&gt;Others like Jason Tankersley&lt;/a&gt; (a member of the Maryland Skinheads) were identified by anti-fascist activists who recognized the man from previous white supremacist rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nh7JQ"&gt;In each case, the identification was important not just as a potential lead for police but for establishing a clear record of the attack. Already, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2021/01/07/conservative-media-capitol-breach-reaction-tucker-carlson-sean-hannity/"&gt;right-wing pundits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218601/matt-gaetz-antifa-capitol-hill-riot-xrvision-facial-recognition-washington-times-story-false"&gt;sitting members of Congress&lt;/a&gt; have suggested the attack was an antifa false flag, disregarding the widespread Trump paraphernalia and clear connection to the Trump rally earlier that day. But the identifications so far show how hollow that claim really is, with most identified participants having clear ties to either QAnon or white supremacist groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oYr0T"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TreWardWBAL/status/1347226070085480448"&gt;Several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/followgoosehead/status/1347195897650819072"&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; have publicly cut ties with employees spotted at the raid, but they are careful to avoid naming the employee in public statements, mindful of doxxing concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkO10h"&gt;In other cases, the identifications have been more chaotic. On Instagram, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/homegrownterrorists/"&gt;accounts like Homegrown Terrorists&lt;/a&gt; have dedicated themselves entirely to soliciting tips and identifying participants— in some cases &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CJuuMQfng9K/c/17894290423817490/r/17880492959040249/"&gt;matching incorrect names to photos&lt;/a&gt;. In theory, Instagram has a policy against any content that “threatens to release an individual’s private phone number, residential address, or email address” — but enforcement is spotty in practice, and the account has remained up, growing to 60,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otqsFp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217421/capitol-building-trump-mob-protest-live-stream-youtube-twitch-facebook"&gt;Facebook has pledged&lt;/a&gt; to actively remove video taken by raid participants, seeing it as an incitement of violence. But those platform policies have meant that much of the content used to identify the crowd is already disappearing, despite the best efforts of the Reddit archivists — sometimes from Facebook and Twitter moderation and other times from mob participants catching on to the growing dragnet. Waters says he’s already seen videos disappear from prominent streamers, and “I have zero doubt others will too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGAVCP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="vkaTaE"&gt;Online-only bank Simple is shutting down, its parent company announced in an email to customers Thursday. BBVA USA, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/20/5429916/bbva-acquires-simple-117-million-cash"&gt;acquired Simple in 2014&lt;/a&gt; for $117 million, said it would be transitioning Simple customers to BBVA accounts but did not provide details about when the change would occur. BBVA USA was &lt;a href="https://pnc.mediaroom.com/2020-11-16-PNC-Announces-Agreement-To-Buy-BBVA-USA-Bancshares-Inc"&gt;acquired by Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank&lt;/a&gt; in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZ8boF"&gt;In the email to users, which many shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, BBVA said the decision to close Simple was a strategic one and said customers did not need to take any immediate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="J2YLLq"&gt;There is no immediate impact to your accounts at Simple and nothing you need to do at this time. Since your deposits are already housed at BBVA USA, they will remain in FDIC insured accounts there, up to the applicable limits. In the future, your Simple account will become exclusively services by BBVA USA, but until then you can continue to access your account and your money through the Simple app or online at Simple.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="43ooDO"&gt;Stimulus payments and other direct deposits won’t be affected, according to the note to customers. “We will provide ongoing transparent and open communication, so you know what to expect each step of the way,” the company wrote. More details will be coming in the future, according to the emails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QP3nKr"&gt;At the time of the BBVA acquisition, Simple had about 100,000 users. When it launched in 2010, Simple quickly amassed a waiting list of 125,000 people attracted to the online-only, streamlined experience Simple promised. When Google Wallet shut down in 2016, Google &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/google-ending-support-for-wallet-cards/"&gt;recommended Simple&lt;/a&gt; as a possible replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zB2Uvn"&gt;BBVA said in a &lt;a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/bbva-usa-shuts-down-neobank-simple"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that it was closing Simple as part of the PNC acquisition, as it was “accelerating some changes and stopping work on others.” Once that acquisition closes, the former Simple customers will become PNC customers, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
