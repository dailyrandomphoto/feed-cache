    <title>Apple’s MagSafe wallet now has competition that’s cheaper and packs more features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of an iPhone 12 Pro with the MOFT wallet" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krrV0MtswKY7cqpe-ssIASsuOF8=/0x181:1869x1427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489392/MOFT_X_MagSafe_Compatible_Blue_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: MOFT&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v1Y4s6"&gt;MOFT is a company that’s made iPhone accessories in the past, and it’s now releasing a competitor to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHLT3ZM%2FA%2Fiphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-saddle-brown%3Ffnode%3Dcd4158bd6fb3c664a3d8c1e0372c57a949246fc0923dca31434702ad4183a1e0fe0eb444a601d27d893d29cc7564166f1632fb24dc980401eba03a25a98db09f6a089fa7d1b8f04bbb039db4cade0792b2fdbe5776534ccb497cd035f2f4033c58f07f88108ecfffcc7f6dbe55c727d5%26fs%3Df%253Dwallet%2526fh%253D12b2bf%25252B4667&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22151212%2Fmagsafe-wallet-iphone-accessory-moft#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s $50 MagSafe wallet&lt;/a&gt;. MOFT’s version, &lt;a href="https://www.moft.us/pages/moft-snap-on-phone-stand-wallet-magsafe-compatible"&gt;which goes on sale today&lt;/a&gt;, costs only $30 and holds three cards like Apple’s, but it also has a built-in kickstand. The stand lets users keep their phone upright in portrait, landscape, or what the company is calling “float mode”, which you can see in the image below. It’s made of vegan leather, as opposed to Apple’s “European leather”, which makes it an option for people who don’t want to use animal-based products. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of a phone attached to the case in landscape, portrait, and float mode. Float mode involves the case sitting vertically with the phone being held horizontally." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jyNwAg1chRL9BTWyq8Izxx3r8SA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22146306/Image_from_iOS.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: MOFT&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using magnets instead of adhesive makes the float mode possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gznwcB"&gt;This new accessory seems to be a tweaked version of &lt;a href="https://www.moft.us/products/moft-x"&gt;MOFT’s existing X Phone stand&lt;/a&gt;, except now it’s using the iPhone 12’s MagSafe system to attach to the phone instead of adhesive. This means you’ll be able to take it on and off whenever you want, without having to worry about wearing out glue. The company even touts that you can make a wallet-MagSafe charger-iPhone sandwich to prop up your phone while charging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Video of attaching the wallet to the back of a MagSafe charging puck and using it as a stand" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/92XDK8R473UcUz_C4w5myxvCvls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142683/GIF5.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: MOFT&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use the wallet as a stand while charging your phone with the MagSafe charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="syeAg9"&gt;It also has magnets on both sides, meaning that you could also stick it to any magnetic metal surface (though if you want to stick it to a non-magnetic surface, MOFT will happily sell you their &lt;a href="https://www.moft.us/products/moft-magnetic-sticky-pads"&gt;magnetic sticky pads&lt;/a&gt; for $10, or include one with the case for an extra $5). This is something I’ve already found myself doing. For example, I’ve stuck my phone to the fridge while trying to talk to someone and cook at the same time (though I’d hope the MOFT case would stick better, as my phone slowly drops the longer I leave it on there).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technically this is something you can do with Apple’s MagSafe case, but it’s a bit perilous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FVO9oQ"&gt;The combo wallet/stand is one of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fall-accessories%2Fmagsafe%3Fpage%3D1%26f%3Dwallet%26fh%3D12b2bf%252B4667&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22151212%2Fmagsafe-wallet-iphone-accessory-moft#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the few MagSafe-compatible accessories&lt;/a&gt; that have hit the market since&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21508028/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-homepod-mini-event-recap-biggest-announcements"&gt; Apple announced the iPhone 12 in mid-October&lt;/a&gt;, which seems curious as these products should be reasonably easy to make: you take your product and add magnets (oh, and probably some shielding if it’s a wallet). As the owner of a MagSafe-compatible phone, though, this isn’t the wallet for me. I’m just not able to squeeze down to only three cards. You may also want to check out &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/MOFT-Ultra-Light-Invisible-Foldaway-Stand-Starry/dp/B07Z4QM4RD/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=moft&amp;amp;qid=1607023665&amp;amp;sr=8-8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Amazon reviews of MOFT’s existing case&lt;/a&gt; to see if the number of users reporting build-quality issues concerns you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LN3JXg"&gt;If you’re looking for something that does even more than the Moft accessory, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/19/21522620/peak-design-mobile-phone-case-bike-car-mount-tripod-hands-on-kickstarter"&gt;Peak Design case/accessory system that’s currently being crowdfunded&lt;/a&gt; may be worth a &lt;s&gt;peak&lt;/s&gt; look (though it’s a much higher buy-in price than the MOFT). Whether you decide to wait for that, go with MOFT’s or Apple’s offerings, or do something else entirely, we probably agree that the introduction of magnets has made the future of the accessories for iPhones pretty interesting (as long as companies continue to come out with products).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy S21 will reportedly launch on January 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KcJq-ueBQpDzH1NwS1u3tptlBFA=/52x0:616x376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489320/samsung_galaxy_s21_668_leak.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teaser videos of the upcoming phones recently leaked online.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/08/exclusive-here-are-the-official-galaxy-s21-s21-and-s21-ultra-teasers/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SBin3R"&gt;Samsung’s next flagship smartphone lineup, the Galaxy S21 series, will launch globally on January 14th, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-launch-date-india-availability-1184543/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority &lt;/em&gt;is reporting&lt;/a&gt;. The date was revealed by Samsung’s largest mobile experience store in India, and &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-surprise-preorders-launch-date-confirmed-india"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile &lt;/em&gt;subsequently confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the date with a company official at Samsung’s local offices. Although &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; reports this as the global launch date, Samsung HQ has yet to confirm it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MZSEn"&gt;Although a January launch is earlier than the February Unpacked events we’ve become accustomed to in recent years, this isn’t the first time this date has been rumored. Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/08/exclusive-here-are-the-official-galaxy-s21-s21-and-s21-ultra-teasers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a January 14th launch based on its own sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VWujP"&gt;The phones will reportedly go on sale on January 29th in India, according to employees at Samsung’s Opera House outlet in Bengaluru, &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; reports. The store is taking preorders for three upcoming handsets, the Galaxy S21, the S21 Plus, and the S21 Ultra, with a Rs 2,000 (around $27) deposit. Full pricing for the lineup is yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0zZc6u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sales will reportedly start later that month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G4nOBU"&gt;Along with confirming the launch plans, the new report from &lt;em&gt;Android Authority &lt;/em&gt;has also revealed some of the upcoming handsets’ specs. They’ll apparently be powered by Samsung’s Exynos 2100 processor in India, and the three models will be available in the following colors: gray, pink, purple, and white for the S21; pink, purple, silver and black for the S21 Plus; and black and silver for the S21 Ultra. &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; says the S21 Ultra will have a 108-megapixel main sensor, alongside two additional 10-megapixel sensors, one of which will have a 10x optical zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umdeJt"&gt;The latest report adds to a host of leaked details about the new handsets. Earlier this week we got an early look at the phones through a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;series of leaked teaser trailers&lt;/a&gt;, which show off their redesigned camera bumps. The trailers appear to confirm that the S21 Ultra will have a total of five cameras, compared to three on the S21 and S21 Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="na3432"&gt;The trailers &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;followed a report in November&lt;/a&gt; which said that each of the phones will come with 120Hz displays, and will have screens ranging from 6.2 to 6.8-inches in size. Internally, they’ll reportedly have batteries ranging in size from 4,000 mAh to 5,000 mAh, and will be powered by Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 processor in regions that don’t use Samsung’s own processors. The S21 Ultra is also expected to be compatible with Samsung’s S-Pen, which is important considering the rumors that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754983/samsung-galaxy-note-21-2021-smartphone-discontinued-stylus-s21-foldable-rumor"&gt;stylus-equipped Note lineup is being discontinued&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google search panels launch to counter vaccine misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pCsxAc19TGeWimPdOvhGKXjk4jA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489210/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1iJAwm"&gt;Google is launching new vaccine information panels in its search results to counter misinformation and educate people about what’s available in their location, the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/accurate-timely-information-covid-19-vaccines/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The panels are rolling out starting in the United Kingdom, where the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/dec/02/pfizer-biontech-covid-vaccine-wins-licence-for-use-in-the-uk"&gt;is approved&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/08/coventry-woman-90-first-patient-to-receive-covid-vaccine-in-nhs-campaign"&gt;is being administered&lt;/a&gt;, and will be introduced in more countries as local health authorities begin authorizing vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCcju9"&gt;The panels include information on each individual vaccine, and aim to address vaccine misinformation, and give guidance about how, when, and where people can receive the shots. Google has used similar information panels to share information &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/21/21189051/google-coronavirus-website-launches-covid19-trump-enhanced-search-results"&gt;about COVID-19 generally&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225828/google-showing-covid-19-testing-centers-search-results"&gt;locations of testing centers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5vZ-etZIft1tCHxdkHwA6oiEImw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159531/ezgif_4_aa8213208664.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The information panels will provide information about approved vaccines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ix05wW"&gt;In addition to search results, Google says it is sharing similar vaccine information via its COVID-19 panels on YouTube. These were first launched in March to share information about the pandemic, and Google says they’ve been viewed over 400 billion times since. Google has also been cracking down on anti-vax content on YouTube, and announced in October that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515796/youtube-covid-vaccine-misniformation-policy"&gt;remove videos containing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. It now says it’s removed over 700,000 videos “related to dangerous or misleading COVID-19 medical information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXu8c2"&gt;Finally, Google has announced it’s providing more funds to help health authorities and the media provide useful information about vaccines and debunk misinformation. The company is providing an additional $15 million in ad grants to the World Health Organization to help it promote health initiatives, and it’s spending $1.5 million to support fact-checking research and fund a COVID-19 Vaccine Media Hub, which is intended to be a resource for journalists to help give them access to scientific expertise and research updates. It’s also funding research into how to counteract vaccine misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SSURA"&gt;In total, Google says it has launched over 200 products, features, and initiatives in response to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0IvF3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VABMHF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former employees say Apple stood by while suppliers violated Chinese labor laws</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Factory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NZCyaMV3D9dfqcO6GRC5a2fbvMI=/18x0:693x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68488393/apple-factory.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Factory&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YdEiwP"&gt;Apple has been complicit in its suppliers’ violations of Chinese labor laws, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-turned-blind-eye-to-supplier-breaches-of-chinese-labor-laws?utm_campaign=%5Brtsu%5D+Automated+RTS&amp;amp;utm_content=1002702&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=cio&amp;amp;utm_term=1000266"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Suppliers have periodically filled their factories with temporary workers or “dispatch labor,” violating a Chinese labor law requiring no more than 10 percent of a factory’s workers be temporary employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rILLI"&gt;Much like in the US, temporary employees in China receive lower pay and fewer benefits, and they’ve become increasingly common as interest in factory jobs has shrunk according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s sources. The law limiting the use of dispatch labor came into effect in 2014, and that year Apple conducted a survey of its suppliers in China to determine how many already complied. The company found that among 362 factories, “nearly half were over the quota for temporary workers,” according to a presentation &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e75UuW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple took no major action against its suppliers for violating temp-worker labor laws&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lihBd2"&gt;Despite that figure, not much had changed by 2016 and the end of a grace period for complying. Three former members of Apple’s “supplier responsibility team” said that the company “took no major action against its suppliers for violating the temp-worker labor law out of concerns it would create costs, drain resources and delay product launches.” If the claims are true, it’s notable because Apple says it applies its supplier code of conduct policies equally across its supply chain, which should prevent these kinds of violations from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lAzcM"&gt;New data Apple collected in 2018 shows the problem continued. &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;says that a Quanta factory manufacturing Apple Watches hired 5,000 temporary workers to bring its workforce to 18,000. That’s around 27 percent temporary workers, above the 10 percent limit set by the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odzpaM"&gt;This isn’t the first time labor laws have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2012/2/8/2785448/foxconn-factory-working-conditions-company-responses"&gt;violated on Apple’s watch&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, Apple actually admitted to at least a portion of this dispatch labor problem in its &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-apple-foxconn-temporary-workers-china.html"&gt;dealings with Foxconn&lt;/a&gt;. Foxconn had exceeded the 10 percent limit, despite previously agreeing multiple times to stop. And just last month another supplier, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556154/apple-supplier-pegatron-student-labor-violation"&gt;Pegatron, violated student labor laws&lt;/a&gt; and falsified its records to cover it up. Apple’s reported response was to put the company on “probation,” preventing it from conducting any new business with Apple until the problem was resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcEzRK"&gt;Despite the Pegatron example, punishments have still not been broadly applied.  Limits on temporary labor are an issue that all large tech companies manufacturing in China have likely been dealing with, but it’s Apple’s desire to “surprise and delight,” along with maintaining aggressive production quotas, that have potentially worsened the problem. In a quote from the report, an unnamed Apple executive admits as much: “We are making it difficult for our suppliers to comply with this law as 10% dispatch is simply not enough to cope with the spikes in labor demand.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tK8zhr"&gt;Apple is aware this is an issue, but until it’s willing to step in and take bolder action, suppliers will take shortcuts to keep Apple’s business.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces massive 110-inch 4K TV with next-gen MicroLED picture quality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eng9ersKU7LfcTruv9O_VcZlzIA=/0x11:2296x1542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68488273/Screen_Shot_2020_12_09_at_8.06.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ocbCn9"&gt;Over the last couple years, Samsung has showed off (and sold to a very rich few) its &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/business/products/displays/direct-view-led/the-wall/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;futuristic, modular TV dubbed The Wall&lt;/a&gt; that uses MicroLED technology. MicroLED shares many of OLED’s best traits — without most of the associated drawbacks — and is widely viewed as the next big upgrade leap for the displays in our lives. Now, Samsung is taking MicroLED and putting it into a more traditional TV form factor. Today the company announced the 110-inch MicroLED TV, which goes up for presale today in Korea and will launch globally in the first quarter of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COmqhL"&gt;As for the first question that probably comes to mind, no, Samsung isn't yet revealing a price for this enormous TV using the latest picture technology. But you can expect it’ll cost far more than any of the company’s other 4K (or even 8K) sets on account of the self-emitting MicroLED magic. You won’t really notice any bezels or borders in these images; this TV has a 99.99 percent screen-to-body ratio, but Samsung still managed to build in “an embedded Majestic Sound System” that it claims “delivers breathtaking 5.1 channel sound with no external speaker.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rfYmIA-hUErdic24l8PLKMDtCF8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158887/MicroLED.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jo0lei"&gt;Here’s what Samsung says about picture quality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Fg5d5E"&gt;The 110-inch MicroLED uses micrometer-sized LED lights to eliminate the backlight and color filters utilized in conventional displays. Instead, it is self-illuminating — producing light and color from its own pixel structures. It expresses 100 percent of the DCI and Adobe RGB color gamut, and accurately delivers wide color gamut images taken with high-end DSLR cameras. This results in stunning, lifelike colors, and accurate brightness from the display’s 4K resolution and 8 million pixels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="w0wVbA"&gt;Since all those LEDs are self-illuminating, you get the perfect blacks and fantastic contrast that have come to define OLED. But crucially, MicroLED is inorganic and thus should have better long-term durability. There shouldn’t be any threat of burn in, which is already getting rarer on modern OLED TVs. Samsung estimates a lifespan of around 100,000 hours — or “up to a decade.” In the case of The Wall, those MicroLEDs are put into modular panels that can be combined to create a TV of pretty much any size — if you’ve got the scratch to pay for it. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcasjyW_OYE"&gt;Here’s one example of The Wall&lt;/a&gt; that was installed in a luxury London home. But the 110-inch TV is a more traditional form factor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e56H1M"&gt;As for whether the 110-inch MicroLED includes HDMI 2.1 and supports all the things that it makes possible (like 120Hz 4K gaming), I’ve asked Samsung. but an answer wasn't available at press time. One neat software trick is the ability to simultaneously watch up to four sources of content (even from different HDMI inputs) with the TV’s Multi View feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htMK0A"&gt;Samsung says that manufacturing a 110-inch MicroLED TV wasn't possible until recent innovations, and the company credits “a new production process derived from its semiconductor business” as helping to make it possible. Smaller MicroLED TVs are already on the roadmap, so while this thing is sure to have a price that’s out of reach for many people, someday there will be models that won’t be as cost-prohibitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sIGdQe"&gt;That’s still a ways out, though, and Samsung is expected to have a fresh lineup of more mainstream (and still great looking) consumer QLED 4K and 8K TVs next month during a virtual CES 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is buying anime streaming service Crunchyroll from AT&amp;T for $1.175 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rF4efHRCnG5wPHovm_wc_gwL3xs=/22x0:933x607/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68488042/crunchyroll_logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l4Peux"&gt;Sony will be buying anime streaming service Crunchyroll from AT&amp;amp;T for $1.175 billion, Sony and AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2020/1209/atttosellcrunchyrolltosonysfunimationglobalgroup"&gt;announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, Crunchyroll will become part of Sony’s Funimation, which already licenses many popular shows such as &lt;em&gt;Attack on Titan&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;One Piece.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vHXOS"&gt;Now that Sony owns both Crunchyroll and Funimation, the company has &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/9/21547657/sonys-funimation-acquires-crunchyroll-deal-price-watching-anime"&gt;tremendous power over&lt;/a&gt; anime in the US at a time when many other media companies are trying to figure out their anime content. Netflix has &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/theres-something-super-weird-about-netflix-anime/"&gt;also invested heavily&lt;/a&gt; in both licensing and producing its own anime content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zvR6Mw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are excited to embark on this new journey”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cwJtag"&gt;“We are excited to embark on this new journey,” said Joanne Waage, general manager of Crunchyroll, in a statement. “Crunchyroll has built a world-class brand with a passionate fan-base of over 3 million subscribers, 50 million social followers and 90 million registered users. These amazing fans have helped to propel anime into a global phenomenon. Combining the strength of the Crunchyroll brand and the expertise of our global team with Funimation is an exciting prospect and a win for the incredible art form of anime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfZYHc"&gt;“The union of Funimation and Crunchyroll is a win for anime fans around the world that will elevate the art and culture of this medium for decades to come,” Colin Decker, CEO of Funimation Global Group, said &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.funimation.com%2Fblog%2F2020%2F12%2F09%2Ffunimation-to-acquire-crunchyroll-fans-win%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dorg-social%26utm_campaign%3Drelease%26utm_content%3Dcr-fun%26sf134076722%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F9%2F22166585%2Fsony-buy-anime-streaming-service-crunchyroll-at-t-funimation#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Combining these two great companies will be a win for fans, and enable us to compete at a truly global scale. I am honored to welcome the wonderful Crunchyroll team to a shared mission—to help everyone belong to the extraordinary world of anime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKIce3"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has been shopping around Crunchyroll for some time, and AT&amp;amp;T and Sony have apparently been in talks for months about the deal. In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/at-t-wants-1-5-billion-in-crunchyroll-sale-to-sony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that AT&amp;amp;T wanted Sony to pay $1.5 billion for Crunchyroll, and the two sides were reportedly close to a nearly $1 billion deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541734/crunchyroll-sony-acquisition-talks-near-end-1-billion-nikkei"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpgNdp"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T purchased Crunchyroll as part of Otter Media in 2018 from the Chernin Group for a reported sum of more than $1 billion, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/business/media/otter-media-chernin-group-att.html"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The sale gave AT&amp;amp;T ownership over a number of digital properties. John Stankey, current CEO of AT&amp;amp;T but then head of WarnerMedia, said the company would use the Otter Media acquisition to “harness Otter’s expertise” while strengthening its own digital assets. Under Stankey’s leadership, AT&amp;amp;T and WarnerMedia are now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;focused on building up HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, the crown jewel of the company’s streaming offerings. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Florida’s justification for raiding COVID data whistleblower Rebekah Jones is looking a little shaky</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FE2cK9HKOihMIRe4DBVD7FdN8ak=/31x0:369x225/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487687/emfGgCL9.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Io8uS"&gt;On Tuesday, Florida state police entered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160181/rebekah-jones-raid-seizure-search-warrant-covid-19-whistleblower-florida"&gt;the home of Rebekah Jones with guns drawn&lt;/a&gt;, seizing her computer and phone, in an attempt to prove that she’d sent an unauthorized “group text” through “a Department of Health messaging system” that is “to be used for emergencies only,” according to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56danA"&gt;There are now two reasons why that’s significant. First, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160181/rebekah-jones-raid-seizure-search-warrant-covid-19-whistleblower-florida"&gt;as we reported at the time&lt;/a&gt;, Jones isn’t just any former Florida Department of Health employee: she’s the whistleblower who built Florida’s once-celebrated COVID-19 tracking dashboard, then accused her bosses &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/29/884551391/florida-scientist-says-she-was-fired-for-not-manipulating-covid-19-data"&gt;of ordering her to manipulate Florida’s data&lt;/a&gt; to justify reopening the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6sKQUA"&gt;Second, it’s now come to our attention that the supposedly private messaging system that Jones might have accessed might have effectively just been an email address — an email address that the Florida Department of Health may have inadvertently published &lt;em&gt;for anyone to see&lt;/em&gt; on the open web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDfZdG"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/florida-posted-the-password-to-a-key-disaster-system-on-its-website/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, Redditors discovered that not only does the Florida Department of Health have a &lt;em&gt;single &lt;/em&gt;shared username and password, but that username and password is also freely accessible on the web. Here’s a redacted screenshot that Ars captured of &lt;em&gt;just one&lt;/em&gt; of at least seven PDFs that contain the information, PDFs that I also easily found with a Google search. All of them are still online at the time I type these words:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TzJL1qpK6DDyrbrNFX5OODbm0ls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158498/FLORIDA__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/florida-posted-the-password-to-a-key-disaster-system-on-its-website/" target="_blank"&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qq8AHB"&gt;But it’s not just the username and password that are listed: these pages also have the email address of the exact group Florida’s Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) claimed was hacked: “StateESF8.Planning.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v7b0yS"&gt;In the FDLE’s affidavit — which is how it got a search warrant for Jones’ home — the department characterizes StateESF8.Planning as a “multi-user account group” and talks about how Florida uses it to “coordinate the state’s health and medical resources, capabilities, and capacities.” That all sounds very official and important:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U9sdmvWdxaQlhUGiIgheUjIj36k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158531/Clipboard01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A small portion of the affadavit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0CuEXd"&gt;However, the publicly available usernames, passwords, and email addresses suggest it might have just been a&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;bog-standard mailing list with an awful lot of users, not something particularly private or secure. The email address still appears to be valid, though the Florida webmail application no longer seems to be online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wrJ6s"&gt;None of this necessarily means that Jones didn’t send the message (though she &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/07/us/florida-search-warrant-raid-rebekah-jones-invs/index.html"&gt;vehemently denies she did&lt;/a&gt;). An FDLE agent under oath says the “group text” was specifically sent from a Comcast ID associated with her home address, and that’s why her home was raided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqY9v6"&gt;But if Jones did happen to send an email to a giant mailing list she used to be part of, one listed on the open web, would that be much of a crime? (I am not a lawyer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPbWgi"&gt;I asked the FDLE to explain how it could have been accessed illegally — if the email address might have required someone to use private credentials somehow — but it declined, citing the active investigation. A spokesperson simply stated that my suggestions were “not accurate,” and that “this was not simply an email.” The Florida Department of Health didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhibof"&gt;On Wednesday, a Republican attorney appointed by Florida governor Ron DeSantis to nominate judges &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RonGOPVet4Biden/status/1336339189374152704"&gt;resigned in protest&lt;/a&gt; over the raid on Jones’ house, calling it “unconscionable.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Facebook calls antitrust lawsuits ‘revisionist history’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SLMvzV5m91Jp6dMakv-4w_xbZfo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487638/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bjt85p"&gt;On Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Trade Commission and a coalition of 48 state attorneys general &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;filed broad antitrust charges against Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, seeking a reversal of its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram. Now, Facebook has responded to those charges in an extensive post titled &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/lawsuits-filed-by-the-ftc-and-state-attorneys-general-are-revisionist-history/"&gt;“Lawsuits Filed by the FTC and the State Attorneys General Are Revisionist History,”&lt;/a&gt; written by general counsel Jennifer Newstead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxvNUX"&gt;Newstead’s primary defense is that both acquisitions resulted in better products for consumers — an implicit reference to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21524886/google-market-power-justice-department-antitrust-lawsuit-consumer-harm"&gt;the “consumer harm” standard&lt;/a&gt; that has also been central to the Department of Justice’s case against Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fCzTtt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Regulators correctly allowed these deals to move forward”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gCDTzT"&gt;“These transactions were intended to provide better products for the people who use them, and they unquestionably did,” Facebook argues. “The FTC and states stood by for years while Facebook invested billions of dollars and millions of hours to make Instagram and WhatsApp into the apps that users enjoy today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCHvmU"&gt;Facebook also takes issue with the retroactive nature of the breakup. Both acquisitions are more than five years old, and were approved by regulatory agencies at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wlnq8U"&gt;“Regulators correctly allowed these deals to move forward because they did not threaten competition,” the post reads, detailing the FTC and European Commission reviews of the deals. “This lawsuit risks sowing doubt and uncertainty about the US government’s own merger review process and whether acquiring businesses can actually rely on the outcomes of the legal process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0TF6o"&gt;The question of retroactive review is an open topic in legal circles, but &lt;a href="https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/Menesh%20Patel.pdf"&gt;some scholars&lt;/a&gt; have argued it is beneficial for regulators to revisit previously cleared transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mynQrw"&gt;The post also directly addresses one if the central allegations of both lawsuits — that Facebook locks out potentially competitive products from its platform, starving competitors of a much-needed user base. This behavior was particularly stark in the case of Vine, which was locked out of Facebook’s social API functions as soon as it was acquired by Twitter, reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127202/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vine-friends-api-block-parliament-documents"&gt;at the direction of Mark Zuckerberg himself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lF4RDA"&gt;In the post, Newstead claims this kind of API restriction is standard practice for platforms. “Where platforms give access to other developers — and many do not provide access at all — they usually prohibit duplication of core functions,” the post reads. “LinkedIn, The New York Times, Pinterest and Uber, to name a few, all have similar policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDJU1B"&gt;“Overall, we disagree with the government’s allegations and we plan to fight this in court,” Zuckerberg said in a post to employees shared by &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; tech reporter Mike Isaac &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1336825630034337792"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “The reality is that we compete with many other services in everything we do, and we compete fairly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I75NPx"&gt;You can read more of Zuckerberg’s message to Facebook staffers in Isaac’s tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uzykDo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;

    <title>SpaceX flies Starship prototype rocket to highest altitude yet — but doesn’t stick the landing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X-vtNxB2PzPrRUaWSt4PVtIlYmY=/0x21:1716x1165/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487628/starship.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ecJeDn"&gt;During a test flight on Wednesday, SpaceX flew a prototype of its next generation Starship rocket to its highest height yet in the skies above Texas — but failed to stick the landing, with the vehicle exploding when it hit the ground. Propelled by three main engines, the vehicle launched to an altitude of nearly 8 miles, or 12.5 kilometers, before crash landing into the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9Ef04"&gt;The nearly seven-minute test flight took off at around 5:45PM ET from SpaceX’s facility at Boca Chica, Texas. The prototype climbed to its target altitude, but during the flight, two of its three main engines seemingly shut down while it ascended. Eventually all three engines cut off, and SpaceX attempted to perform a “bell flop” maneuver, with the vehicle falling horizontally on the way down to Earth. Just before reaching the ground, the prototype reignited its engines — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1336809767574982658?s=20"&gt;but the vehicle came in way too fast&lt;/a&gt; and blew apart when it hit the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P6UDVz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The flight was the most ambitious test yet of SpaceX’s Starship&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5zxMK"&gt;The flight was the most ambitious test yet of SpaceX’s Starship, meant to test out the launch and landing capabilities of the future rocket. Made out of a steel alloy, the silo-shaped rocket is supposed to act as a spaceship, a rocket, and a lander all in one, carrying people and cargo to deep-space destinations. SpaceX plans to launch the vehicle to orbit on another massive rocket called the Super Heavy. Once in space, Starship is supposed to use its main engines to land upright on other worlds — such as the Moon or Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cu3jD5"&gt;Despite the explosive landing, SpaceX still considered the test a win. On its livestream of the event, the company included a banner that read: “Awesome test. Congrats Starship team!” SpaceX CEO Elon Musk also expressed enthusiasm for the flight on Twitter, noting that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1336808486022258688?s=20"&gt;the test succeeded in a number of its objectives&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier, Musk only gave the flight a one-third chance of success, noting that a “lot of things need to go right.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MDuwR"&gt;Even before the flight occurred, SpaceX had noted on its website that completing a perfect flight wasn’t the marker for success. “With a test such as this, success is not measured by completion of specific objectives but rather how much we can learn, which will inform and improve the probability of success in the future as SpaceX rapidly advances development of Starship,” &lt;a href="https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/index.html"&gt;the company wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lk-RFQJKPR5MgSdcUZJ150aT8RQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158572/starship_10.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="StPAs4"&gt;SpaceX has been cranking out Starship prototypes over the last few years at the company’s test facility in Boca Chica, performing incremental tests and flights on the vehicles in preparation for sending one to orbit. The one that flew today is the eighth major prototype the company has crafted. SpaceX has flown a few Starship prototypes before, but only to just under 500 feet, or 150 meters, in the air. Those prototypes were also smaller in size than the final Starship design, and didn’t sport the nosecone at the top of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zsl7D4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Lot of things need to go right, so maybe 1/3 chance&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1331388984023461888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 25, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kPuDy6"&gt;The prototype that flew today bore a much stronger resemblance to the finalized Starship, including the nosecone, as well as flaps on the side of the vehicle meant to help with steering during landing. The vehicle was also equipped with three Raptors, giant engines that SpaceX has developed just for Starship. The final Starship will supposedly be equipped with six main Raptor engines — three optimized to be used at sea level and three optimized for use in the vacuum of space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m6XTVNRip7mTj-5gPDCUrk9XCiQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158548/starship2.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TRVzCv"&gt;SpaceX already has two other prototypes built, similar in size and shape to today’s prototype — dubbed SN9 and SN10. It’s possible those vehicles will see some upcoming flights, as well, especially now that the eighth prototype is no longer in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLUfCd"&gt;SpaceX has a lot riding on these tests, as the company hopes to use Starship to fulfill Musk’s ambitions of starting a settlement on Mars. NASA is also considering using Starship as a lunar lander for its Artemis program. It’s possible NASA astronauts could take SpaceX’s Starship down to the surface of the Moon as a part of the agency’s Artemis program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BaY05x"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ap-BkkrRg-o?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xVNeIc"&gt;Meanwhile, SpaceX has started construction on another important piece of the Starship system: the Super Heavy booster that will loft Starship into orbit. It’s unclear when the vehicle will take its first flight. In September of 2019, Musk predicted that SpaceX would send a Starship into orbit within six months. More than a year later, the timeline for the first orbital flight is murky — but today’s flight puts SpaceX closer to that important launch&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A secretive treasure hunter is unmasked by a court case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7m_a5O9X__j1LeYkxOF1Gg5VbLY=/0x63:479x382/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487620/fenn002_enl_2fbdab7583766a0b345136cc8b5528ba8302dd79_s1400.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0i0YTO"&gt;Finding a long-hidden treasure in the woods of Wyoming seems like a tall tale that would be told around a campfire, but it happens to be reality for Jack Stuef. As with many treasure hunting stories, though, the intrigue isn’t over just because the prize has been found. Stuef had been trying to stay anonymous and had done so until this week, but now he says he’s been forced to reveal his identity &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-treasure-chest-rocky-mountains-forrest-fenn-20200608-xltbeao5zvbkjiby732x73fhxe-story.html"&gt;after a lawsuit was filed&lt;/a&gt; alleging that he obtained the treasure through hacking and stalking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfKhyu"&gt;The chest in question, &lt;a href="https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/forrest-fenn-confirms-his-treasure-has-been-found/article_37006cfe-a8d7-11ea-8653-873ca96e31ef.html"&gt;filled with 22 pounds&lt;/a&gt; of treasure-y things like gold coins and jewelry, was hidden by Forrest Fenn, a Santa Fe art dealer, and has been the object of a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/forrest-fenn-treasure-chest-pictures-trnd/index.html"&gt;widely publicized hunt&lt;/a&gt; that’s been going on since 2010. Stuef’s desire for his identity to remain hidden is understandable, as some treasure hunters have gone as far as to &lt;a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/1233629/pennsylvania-man-arrested-at-forrest-fenns-house.html"&gt;break into Fenn’s house&lt;/a&gt; and file lawsuits against him after he announced the hunt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUziT3"&gt;Stuef now has to deal with a lawsuit of his own, which was filed against him (as “Unknown Defendant”) and Fenn by Barbara Anderson, another treasure hunter who says she’s spent a considerable amount of time and money on the search. She filed it in an attempt to find the identity of the finder and alleges that the treasure’s finder followed her and hacked into her computer and email to steal the information and clues she had gathered. Anderson had been searching in and around Santa Fe, though the treasure ended up &lt;a href="https://dalneitzel.com/2020/08/27/18/"&gt;being found in Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;. She claims that she had found the final clue that led to the treasure’s actual location but that Stuef followed her to it and was able to beat her to the treasure’s location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIvSeI"&gt;Stuef denies that any of this happened, but he says developments in the case will soon lead to his identity becoming a matter of public record, so he wanted to beat it to the punch and reveal himself on his own terms. “The U.S. District Court for New Mexico has ruled that Forrest’s estate must provide some of my personal information to a woman I do not know and with whom I have never communicated,” he says &lt;a href="https://thefinder.medium.com/a-statement-on-the-disclosure-of-my-identity-602d95f04b9f"&gt;in his Medium post revealing his identity&lt;/a&gt;, before calling the lawsuit “meritless.” He says that he “found the treasure as [Fenn] designed it to be found.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1tiAr"&gt;Alongside the Medium post, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2419429/forrest-fenn-treasure-jack-stuef"&gt;a story in &lt;em&gt;Outside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that has more details about Stuef’s two-year search — except for the one many treasure hunters were hoping to learn: where he found it. Stuef says that he’s keeping that secret to honor what he believes would’ve been Fenn’s wishes. (Fenn &lt;a href="https://thefinder.medium.com/a-remembrance-of-forrest-fenn-1be2a8646ff2"&gt;died in September&lt;/a&gt;.) He doesn’t want the location to “become a tourist attraction” for treasure hunters. For now, he still has the treasure chest hidden away in a vault somewhere (as all treasures should be), but he hopes to sell it to someone who will let other treasure hunters see it (though exactly where that is, he’s keeping a secret for now). &lt;/p&gt;
