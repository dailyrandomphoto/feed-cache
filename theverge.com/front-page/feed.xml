    <title>New lawsuit accuses Amazon of e-book price fixing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wRHmBiLdB1w69YJz1w2nldtLGAo=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68681089/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HtU0h9"&gt;Amazon is facing a new lawsuit alleging that a deal between the company and five book publishers has created higher prices on e-books, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-a-longtime-e-book-discounter-is-accused-of-driving-up-the-price-of-e-books-11610748615?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4CMeo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/sites/default/files/case-downloads/amazon-ebooks-price-fixing/01.14.21-complaint.pdf"&gt;The lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed by law firm Hagens Berman in a federal district court in New York, alleges that the publishers pay high commissions and other costs to Amazon, which in turn increases the retail price of e-books sold on the platform. Due to the deal between Amazon and the publishers— HarperCollins Publishers, Hachette Book Group, Penguin Random House, Simon &amp;amp; Schuster, and Macmillan &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; the Amazon price is the price the publishers charge other retailers as well, preventing other sellers from offering the e-books at lower prices, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XvWIs"&gt;The lawsuit claims the five publishers account for 80 percent of books sold in the US, and calls the arrangement  a “conspiracy to fix the retail price of e-books,”  which it argues is a violation of antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfQXHY"&gt;In another e-book lawsuit back in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/11/2941053/inside-the-dojs-ebook-price-fixing-case-against-apple-an-analysis"&gt;2012, the Justice Department accused Apple&lt;/a&gt; of conspiring with major book publishers in an attempt to compete with Amazon, by inflating e-book prices above the $9.99 price that Amazon preferred. &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160620005051/en/Hagens-Berman-Payday-Millions-e-Book-Purchasers-400"&gt;Hagens Berman was lead counsel&lt;/a&gt; in the Apple case as well.  The publishers settled, but Apple went to court and lost, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/7/11172318/apple-supreme-court-price-fixing-appeal"&gt;eventually agreeing to a $450 million settlement&lt;/a&gt;, with $400 million issued as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/21/11991526/apple-ebook-price-fixing-refunds-begin-for-consumers"&gt;refunds to consumers&lt;/a&gt;. Apple denied any wrongdoing in regard to e-book pricing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7YnY2"&gt;Amazon and the publishers named in the new lawsuit did not immediately respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ej3A7M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Orbit set to try and send satellites to space for the first time </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3_jlhdjIT6xgoQagmIzdn8u2fs4=/251x0:2816x1710/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68681015/Virgin_Orbit_87.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virgin Orbit’s airborne rocket-launching system during a previous test.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Virgin Orbit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c9HVGW"&gt;Virgin Orbit — the sister company of billionaire Richard Branson’s space tourism outfit Virgin Galactic — will try a second test of its small satellite-launching rocket later today, months after it failed to reach orbit during a first attempt. It will also be the first time that the company tries to launch working satellites into space on behalf of NASA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2r69S"&gt;Sometime after 1PM ET, Virgin Orbit’s customized Boeing 747 will take off from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21035125/virgin-galactic-spaceport-america-truth-or-consequences-new-mexico"&gt;Virgin Galactic’s spaceport in the Mojave desert&lt;/a&gt; and ascend to 35,000 feet with the satellite-launching rocket attached to its wing. Once it reaches a predetermined location, the rocket is supposed to drop and ignite, taking the small satellites on board the rest of the way into orbit around the Earth. Virgin Orbit says the window for launch will last until 5PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfUnKC"&gt;There is no live stream of the test, though the company plans to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_Orbit"&gt;tweet updates&lt;/a&gt; throughout the flight. It will make photos and video available sometime after the test is completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iR3DqF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Virgin Orbit has been working on its airborne rocket-launching system for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqBZLu"&gt;Virgin Orbit has spent years developing this method of airborne rocket-launching, and it has performed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20687873/virgin-orbit-launcherone-rocket-drop-test-cosmic-girl-747-california"&gt;increasingly complex&lt;/a&gt; flight tests &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18102556/virgin-orbit-launcherone-cosmic-girl-captive-carry-test-flight"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt;. But the first full test of the company’s rocket-launching capabilities in May of last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/25/21265057/virgin-orbit-launcherone-rocket-test-launch-747-airplane-cosmic-girl"&gt;did not go completely as planned&lt;/a&gt;. The plane ascended correctly, the rocket dropped, and the main engine ignited. But a problem in the liquid oxygen fuel line prevented the rocket from reaching orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiSZhY"&gt;Dan Hart, Virgin Orbit’s CEO, said during a conference call earlier this month that the company has made changes to those propellant lines and done an “enormous amount of testing” since May, despite the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wlgvXv"&gt;“Watching [Virgin Orbit] rise to the occasion and dive into the details and drive the maturation of the system, and doing it in a pandemic environment, is really amazing to watch,” Hart said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTNrbq"&gt;Technical fixes aside, another difference between the previous test and this one is that Virgin Orbit will be attempting to deliver real commercial payloads for a customer for the first time: NASA. The space agency has tasked Virgin Orbit with carrying 10 different small satellites for various universities. Each will perform a variety of missions, from cleaning up space debris, to practicing inspection and maintenance of other spacecraft, to making weather observations. A &lt;a href="https://virginorbit.com/the-latest/announcing-the-window-for-launch-demo-2/"&gt;full list is available on Virgin Orbit’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0xash"&gt;This mission was supposed to take place back in December, but was delayed because some members of Virgin Orbit’s launch team had to quarantine. Hart said Virgin Orbit has “done a huge amount to ensure the safety of the team” ahead of today’s launch. A big part of that is having people work remotely, but for those who have to be on site,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Hart said Virgin Orbit is enforcing social distancing, making employees use PPE, disinfecting spaces, and installing&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;air purifiers. “Every single tool that you can imagine that is out there in industry, we have applied, but we have a team that’s eager, that’s focused,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3ISwL"&gt;The launch attempt was rescheduled to earlier this month, though that has slipped a few times now to today’s window. The company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/virgin_orbit/status/1350519343147204609?s=21"&gt;tweeted on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that the hardware is “in great shape” and that the weather looks favorable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Tk0tVC"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="On board Virgin Orbit’s flying launchpad|63519" data-volume-uuid="d897fadf8" data-volume-id="63519" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-712" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WtHlgR"&gt;Virgin Orbit’s approach to launching satellites is quite different from that of SpaceX or the other major launch providers that NASA and others typically use. But it’s one that the company believes will help take a bite out of the burgeoning small satellite market. By launching from a plane in the air, Virgin Orbit’s system doesn’t need as big a rocket, or as much fuel, which helps keep costs down. The company argues that this is a potentially more flexible system, since it makes satellite launches theoretically possible from anywhere a 747 can take off and land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQzGUM"&gt;(Those reasons may be why Virgin Orbit has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16648336/virgin-orbit-launcherone-defense-department-cosmic-girl"&gt;inked a contract with the Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;. Virgin Orbit wants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906657/virgin-orbit-mars-vehicle-deep-space-satellite-missions-launcherone-satrevolution"&gt;to launch missions to Mars, too&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myTb7I"&gt;But first Virgin Orbit must prove that the system works, and that the company can be profitable. Backers like Branson and Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, have sustained it through development so far. The company is now seeking &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/richard-bransons-virgin-orbit-seeks-1-billion-valuation-in-fundraising-11602403201"&gt;up to $200 million in new funding&lt;/a&gt; after spending hundreds of millions of dollars developing the airborne launch system it will test again today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="aR6nFH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The goal is to become a dedicated launcher for the budding small satellite market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tBhNec"&gt;Hart stressed on the call that this is a test flight, and that the company will be “thrilled to get the data” that’s generated along the way so it can continue developing and refining the launch system. He also said the Virgin Orbit team is “mindful that there’s risk on whether we will get to the final orbit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQciFc"&gt;But Hart said Virgin Orbit has been “working vigorously and looking at all the details and making sure that we have the best shot possible to get to orbit” considering there are real satellites on board this time. That work has included help from an investigation team made up of people from launch partner NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Air Force, and industry professionals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sG29gH"&gt;“We really immersed our engineering team with a fresh set of eyes to make sure that basically that we weren’t drinking our own bathwater,” Hart said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal is back after an outage that lasted more than 24 hours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Signal logo seen in the background of a silhouette hand holding a mobile phone. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Q6fKwgcOaTtGETVezT5N5uw358=/0x1:5000x3334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68680864/1230608869.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u6LQB5"&gt;After experiencing technical difficulties Friday, the Signal messaging app appears to be back up and running. The company tweeted Saturday night that it was “back,” although added that some users may still see error messages in their chats. The company didn’t explain what caused the outage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6DV26M"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Signal is back! Like an underdog going through a training montage, we’ve learned a lot since yesterday — and we did it together. Thanks to the millions of new Signal users around the world for your patience. Your capacity for understanding inspired us while we expanded capacity. &lt;a href="https://t.co/cRNV8kVtdF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cRNV8kVtdF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Signal (@signalapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1350595202872823809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uSBuCZ"&gt;For users still be seeing error messages in their chats — which the company said was a “side effect” of the outage that began around 11:30AM ET Friday—  Signal tweeted that those messages do not affect security, rather that you may have missed a message from another user. This will be fixed in the next app updates, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1csvT"&gt;It offered two fixes if users want to clear the error messages manually: On Android, tap the menu in the top-right corner and choose “reset secure session.” For iOS users of Signal tap the “reset session” button located below “received message was out of sync.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GUa7sA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On Android if you see "Bad encrypted message," tap the menu in the top-right &amp;amp; tap "Reset secure session." On iOS tap the "Reset Session" button below "Received message was out of sync." The errors do not affect chat security &amp;amp; will be automatically fixed in the next app update. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dgLGLZS3zB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dgLGLZS3zB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Signal (@signalapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1350631024351346689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTatZu"&gt;Signal allows secure and encrypted video, voice, and text communication, and in the past weeks has seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk"&gt;a surge of new users&lt;/a&gt; to its app, after CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk"&gt;tweeted his recommendation&lt;/a&gt;, and as rival service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;WhatsApp unveiled a confusing new privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, which it’s now pushed back several months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1W9TY"&gt;During the outage, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1350248817304588289?s=20"&gt;Signal  tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that it was “working as quickly as possible to bring additional capacity online to handle peak traffic levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDgR52"&gt;The company did not immediately reply to an request from&lt;em&gt; The Verge &lt;/em&gt;for further comment on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Critical NASA rocket test ends early with a shutdown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ME0ou86oxttViKL5KzCvSSBcLFc=/210x0:2460x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68679496/Screen_Shot_2021_01_16_at_5.27.47_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gXyk5Y"&gt;A critical NASA rocket test ended with a shutdown on Saturday, a little over a minute into what was planned to be an eight-minute test. This trial run was a vital checkpoint for NASA’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173176/nasa-space-launch-system-inspector-general-audit-over-budget-schedule"&gt;much-delayed Space Launch System&lt;/a&gt;. The SLS is set to play a key role in the agency’s Artemis program which aims to return astronauts to the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lz89gK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/16/22232498/sls-nasa-space-launch-system-green-run-hot-fire"&gt;During today’s Green Run test&lt;/a&gt;, the four rocket engines in the SLS core fired for a little over a minute while anchored in NASA’s rocket test stand. The team had planned to have the engines fire for approximately eight minutes, or about the same amount of time it will take to launch future missions to the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pbFMpQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Watch all four &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASA_SLS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NASA_SLS&lt;/a&gt; core stage engines roar to life and shake the ground in Mississippi. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teams are assessing the data on early engine shutdown. &lt;a href="https://t.co/U5bNqqbdZd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/U5bNqqbdZd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA (@NASA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1350573543730372615?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aNvm2D"&gt;Instead, around a minute into the NASA broadcast of the test, a voice is heard saying “we did get a MCF [major component failure] on engine 4.” At around the same time, engineers spotted a flash near engine four, said John Honeycutt, NASA’s SLS program manager in a press conference. They think that the flash occurred somewhere near a thermal protection blanket around that engine. The exact cause of the shutdown is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvVz07"&gt;A blog post from NASA said that the flight software ended the test. “At this point, the test was fully automated. During the firing, the onboard software acted appropriately and initiated a safe shutdown of the engines,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2021/01/16/green-run-update-hot-fire-conducted-on-jan-16/"&gt;the statement from NASA says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEZbr1"&gt;The engineering team had hoped to get at least 250 seconds of the hot fire test, John Shannon the SLS program manager at Boeing, said a press conference earlier this week.  “[If] we had an early shutdown, for whatever reason, we get all of the engineering data we need to have high confidence in the vehicle at about 250 seconds” said Shannon. During that time they planned to have the engines move through a series of maneuvers designed to test the responsiveness of the engines while they were lit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UPzIk"&gt;It appears that they got far less than the 250 seconds of data that they hoped for. The data that they did manage to get was gathered by about 1,400 sensors during the test. Among other things, the sensors monitored the core for vibration, temperature, acoustics, and stress. Even though the test was cut short, those sensors did gather a lot of data that may eventually help NASA determine the path forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYsyZ7"&gt;“Not everything went according to script today, but we got a lot of great data,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said at a press conference after the event. “I have absolutely total confidence in the team to figure out what what the anomaly was figure out how to fix it, and then get after it again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I91rDX"&gt;The SLS has been in development for years, and was originally scheduled to make its flight debut in 2017. Instead, it has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173176/nasa-space-launch-system-inspector-general-audit-over-budget-schedule"&gt;plagued by delays and is massively over budget&lt;/a&gt;. NASA had previously pushed back the rocket’s debut to November 2021, and was still hoping to make that launch date, &lt;a href="https://spacepolicyonline.com/news/sls-green-run-tests-slip-but-november-2021-remains-artemis-i-target/"&gt;even after a December 2020 delay in their testing schedule&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FX8izB"&gt;The rocket being tested today was slated to be part of that first launch out of Cape Canaveral — an &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/around-the-moon-with-nasa-s-first-launch-of-sls-with-orion"&gt;uncrewed mission called Artemis I&lt;/a&gt; that would send NASA’s Orion spacecraft around the moon. It’s still unclear what exactly triggered the shutdown, and how the results of today’s test might affect the timeline for Artemis I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhUXDv"&gt;“It depends what the anomaly was and how challenging it’s going to be to fix it. And we’ve got a lot to learn to figure that out.” Bridenstine said. ”I think it very well could be that it’s something that’s easily fixable and we can feel confident going down to the Cape and staying on schedule. It’s also true that we could find a challenge that’s going to take more time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OT7lyC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 9:00PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This story has been updated with information from a NASA press conference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook suspends ads for weapon accessories until at least January 22nd</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8lsV24"&gt;Facebook has updated its Inauguration Day preparations to include a temporary ban on ads that promote weapon accessories and protective equipment at least through January 22nd “out of an abundance of caution,”  &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/preparing-for-inauguration-day/"&gt;the company said in a new blog post Saturday&lt;/a&gt;. “We already prohibit ads for weapons, ammunition and weapon enhancements like silencers. But we will now also prohibit ads for accessories such as gun safes, vests and gun holsters in the US,” the statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wj1uNN"&gt;The ban comes after Facebook was criticized for &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/13/facebook-role-in-capitol-protest/"&gt;allowing posts across its platforms&lt;/a&gt; that promoted and organized the deadly January 6th attack on the Capitol building. The ads for military gear such as body armor and gun holsters ran next to Facebook and Instagram posts about the insurrection at the Capitol that included calls for violence, as first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-pauses-ads-for-gun-accessories-and-military-gear"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhPq2D"&gt;A group of &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/lawmakers-attorneys-general-facebook-weapon-ads"&gt;US senators wrote a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, urging the company to “develop and execute a Facebook policy permanently prohibiting advertisements of products... primarily designed for use in lethal tactical operations and armed combat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXevSu"&gt;Facebook has tightened its policies amid concerns that there may be more violence in the nation’s capital ahead of the January 20th inauguration.  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233871/facebook-blocking-events-white-house-us-state-capitols-inauguration-day"&gt;The company says it won’t allow&lt;/a&gt; users to create events taking place “in close proximity” to the White House, the Capitol, or state capital buildings through Inauguration Day.  Facebook also said it was doing a “secondary review” of any inauguration-related events created on its platform and will remove any that violate its rules. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford reportedly delays some deliveries of its Mustang Mach-E</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GVvd9EpMAG6FhCvaip91s56MF3w=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68678686/ahawkins_201212_4339_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KwEYHT"&gt;Ford will delay deliveries for hundreds of its Mustang Mach-E vehicles to perform quality checks, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/01/15/ford-delays-hundreds-mustang-mach-e-deliveries-additional-quality-checks/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The automaker began delivering the Mach-E SUV in December, but some buyers reported that their upcoming delivery dates had been pushed back, by as long as a month in some cases, according to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M64zPh"&gt;The Mustang Mach-E SUV is Ford’s first update to the iconic Mustang brand ever, and the company’s biggest foray into the EV marketplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4S4l1p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Driving the Mustang Mach-E, Ford’s first real electric car","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175017/ford-mustang-mach-e-electric-suv-first-drive-specs-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KU4Spg"&gt;Ford didn’t immediately return a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday, but a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt; it was doing “additional quality checks on several hundred” of the SUVs that were built before dealer shipments began in December, “to ensure they meet the quality our customers expect and deserve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2Dcw4"&gt;Ford did not say what specifically prompted the new quality checks, but the company told the &lt;a href="https://fordauthority.com/2021/01/ford-issues-mustang-mach-e-stop-ship-to-address-quality-related-issue/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ford Authority&lt;/em&gt; blog&lt;/a&gt; that it was working to expedite deliveries of the Mustang Mach-E, “and we hope that customers receive them ahead of targeted dates, providing there are no COVID-19-related transportation delays.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some Twitter employees have reportedly locked their accounts fearing reprisal from Trump supporters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ib0MjiKPoYs9OMkbbLwKSE-x-K4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68678391/acastro_201106_1777_vote_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QnXLve"&gt;Some Twitter employees have set their accounts to private and scrubbed their online biographies over concerns they may be targeted by supporters of President Trump, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/technology/inside-twitter-decision-trump.html"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt; In addition, some Twitter executives have been assigned personal security as the company reckons with its decision to bar one of its loudest voices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toSQFU"&gt;Trump’s @realDonaldTrump account was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;permanently suspended from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; January 8th, “due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” Twitter said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528?s=20"&gt;in its statement&lt;/a&gt;. The president &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/us/trump-speech-riot.html"&gt;told supporters at a rally&lt;/a&gt; just before an attack on the Capitol January 6th they would “have to show strength,” and “fight much harder,” encouraging them to walk down to the Capitol. &lt;a href="https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/realDonaldTrump"&gt;Trump tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that Vice President Mike Pence “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done,” and later — while the attack was still ongoing— tweeted “we love you” to his supporters. The House of Representatives &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/us/politics/trump-impeached.html"&gt;impeached Trump&lt;/a&gt; a second time on January 13th for “incitement of insurrection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHnHFW"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Times,&lt;/em&gt; Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who was working remotely from a private island the day the riot occurred, was not totally convinced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;a temporary ban on the president&lt;/a&gt; that day was the right decision. Twitter executives told Dorsey that the response to Trump’s tweets in the day after the riot suggested there was great potential for more real-world violence, ultimately leading to the permanent suspension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtS36p"&gt;More than 300 Twitter employees had signed an internal petition calling for a permanent Trump suspension, but according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, the company had already decided at that point to ban the president. After Twitter announced its ban, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22230001/snapchat-trump-ban-permanently-account-january-20th-innaguration-snap"&gt;Snapchat issued its own permanent ban&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219144/twitch-trump-ban-indefinitely-capitol-attack"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook put indefinite bans&lt;/a&gt; on President Trump’s accounts. Facebook said in a statement explaining its decision, “The risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service... are simply too great.” In addition, Shopify took down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218776/shopify-trump-store-disable-campaign-ecommerce-sites-capitol"&gt;Trump’s campaign store&lt;/a&gt;, a main source of sales of Make America Great Again hats and other merch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFNWNn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510777254756352"&gt;In a tweet thread Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, Dorsey said that banning Trump’s account was the right call. “Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all,” he wrote, adding that Twitter should “look critically at inconsistencies of our policy and enforcement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCWrB7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge Awards at CES 2021: can’t touch this</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/td7JOUzsXukYEWSKUEYSEV5aC8E=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68678256/VRG_ILLO_4375_TheVergeAwards_CES_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Rating the all-digital Consumer Electronics Show &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cGmKBk"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21058850/ces-2020-verge-awards-best-laptop-tv-tech-pc-concept-gadget"&gt;we opened&lt;/a&gt; our awards for the annual Consumer Electronics Show by saying “oh, what a difference 12 months makes.” One year later we can confidently say again: oh, what a difference 12 months makes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfqJN6"&gt;It’s been a challenging year, and we weren’t sure what to expect coming into this CES. As the COVID-19 pandemic began to shut the world down early last year, events started to be canceled in a trickle — and then in waves. Scientists and experts told us the world wasn’t going back to normal for possibly years, so there was no way CES 2021 was going to happen as usual. The Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which runs CES, is optimistic the show will be back in 2022 — but that’s a big “we’ll see.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofGspv"&gt;But even without a global pandemic, CES was always going to change. As big tech companies have seized their own airtime during the last decade, the power of CES’s main stage has waned. And yet the show has hung on admirably — even if it doesn’t have the most important product announcements for stuff you can go buy right now, it still manages to give us some good hints at what the most important tech trends will be for the next year or two. That’s why, each year, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;returns to that show to see every hope, dream, and excess of the technology industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Rc8HJ"&gt;This year’s awards are bestowed on a beleaguered, but not beaten, CES. We honestly strained to even find enough to fill our typical amount of categories. But all of the exhibitors did their best in a difficult time, and that’s all we can ask for. Traditions are important in difficult times, and, for whatever it’s worth, CES is one of ours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLdnLo"&gt;Last year we said CES was “a lot of show with not much very substance,” and that’s on our mind again this year in a world where we couldn’t safely assemble for hands-on demonstrations. But distance makes the heart grow fonder, and we’re hopeful that we’ll see you all again next year in the desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="6rXec9"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: AMD&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xwbcwB"&gt;“Best” in Show:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="9qIvG0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;AMD Ryzen 5000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="y46fY2"&gt;This might be our least-flashy pick yet for “best” in show at the CES, but this is no ordinary year. Somehow, this little chip from AMD managed to be the heart and soul of this year’s show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQHgOP"&gt;At AMD’s highly-anticipated keynote on Tuesday morning, CEO Lisa Su unveiled the Ryzen 5000 series: a line of 7nm chips mostly built on the company’s new “Zen 3” architecture, which has already made impressive strides in the desktop form factor. (If you don’t believe it was “highly anticipated”, just go back and look at the YouTube comments for &lt;em&gt;other &lt;/em&gt;keynotes, where everyone kept asking “when is AMD?”) There are eight “H-series” processors for high-end gaming laptops and five “U-series” processors for thinner and lighter notebooks. The headliner, the Ryzen 9 5980HX, has eight cores, 16 threads, and high hopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loN7mU"&gt;Su made some big claims. She said that AMD’s chips will beat Intel’s top end in both single- and multi-threaded performance. She claimed that they’ll deliver excellent battery life as well. And she promised that Ryzen 5000 will power the best gaming laptops of 2021. Essentially, she said that she was unveiling the best mobile processors in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sR916h"&gt;This award comes with some caveats. Obviously, we haven’t gotten our hands on a Ryzen 5000 system yet, so we can’t guarantee that these chips will deliver the performance gains AMD is claiming. The company has also faced some driver issues on the GPU side (which have improved), and it struggled to meet demand for its hardware last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVrtGB"&gt;But if there’s one reason to be optimistic about these new chips, it’s that manufacturers clearly believe they’re the real deal. Immediately following AMD’s keynote a barrage of OEMs announced AMD models, while some (namely Asus and Lenovo) basically indicated that they’re all-in on the chips. From heavy dual-screen gaming rigs to budget laptops for students, AMD is going to be everywhere in 2021. But most importantly, it’s going to be paired with Nvidia’s top GPUs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZGt22"&gt;That’s a milestone for AMD, and it’s what makes Ryzen 5000 the most important announcement of this year’s CES. Where AMD has played second fiddle to Intel in the high-end mobile gaming sphere for many years, the winds are shifting now. And in the middle of a trade show famous for its abundance of flashy vaporware and lofty promises with no hope of coming true, AMD has released a product that’s not only very real, but also continues the transformation of the laptop market, and redefining of what gaming laptops can do, that began with Ryzen 4000 last year. It’s a tiny chip, but we’ll see its impact for years to come. &lt;em&gt;—Monica Chin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CmXgbf"&gt;Best Laptop:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="NMs0pU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227383/asus-zephyrus-g14-g15-gaming-laptops-ryzen-price-specs-ces-2021"&gt;Asus Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="N7LwlF"&gt;Last year, we gave the best laptop award to the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. We were right to do so. Armed with AMD’s Ryzen 9 4900HS, the G14 shattered expectations for what 14-inch laptops could do. I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;in my review&lt;/a&gt; that I didn’t see a reason to buy any other ultraportable gaming laptop when the G14 was running around — with nine hours of battery life, incredible frame rates, excellent cooling, a phenomenal keyboard and touchpad, and a starting price of just $1,049, it was the thin-and-light rig that gamers had been dreaming of for years. It was also one of the first signs that Intel was in trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8sEIy"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G15 wasn’t Asus’s headline CES announcement; the company didn’t spend much time talking about it at all. And it doesn’t look like anything new or groundbreaking; there are no foldable screens or RGB lights. It just looks like a slightly bigger version of the G14 and, like the G14, it will contain the latest chips from AMD and Nvidia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zd4ADV"&gt;But I agree with Asus here. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. And if Asus is able to replicate the massive success it saw with the G14 in a 15-inch form factor, I have no doubt it will be one of the best gaming laptops of the year — if not the best one. &lt;em&gt;—Monica Chin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x3v5BHowtInc4_VzC5X3Gf5eZ6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226965/LG_OLED_TV_Lineup.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EiUIji"&gt;Best TV:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xC6wV1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224271/lg-2021-tvs-oled-qned-g1-c1-a1-announced-specs-ces"&gt;LG G1 Series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="hnuImu"&gt;TVs face some of the fiercest competition at CES, which means that the “best” television in show usually blends a useful vision for the future with the expectation that people will actually be able to buy it at some point. Meeting that standard this year is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224271/lg-2021-tvs-oled-qned-g1-c1-a1-announced-specs-ces"&gt;the LG G1&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the successor to LG’s ultra-premium GX series, but this year it’s got a OLED Evo panel, which the company says is the next generation of its screen technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qm1jIQ"&gt;With Evo, LG is hoping to close the brightness gap between OLED and LED. The G1 also utilizes LG’s gallery design, which allows it to sit flush against the wall (which is good, because it won’t come with a stand.) It should also be pleasing to gamers, with four HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K at 120Hz, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224359/google-stadia-nvidia-geforce-now-lg-tv-2021"&gt;Google Stadia and GeForce Now built in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DhSIq"&gt;None of this is to say that we expect most people to buy this TV — LG’s GX series is pretty expensive— but the real excitement is for when the OLED Evo panels start showing up in other places. Not only does LG have its own C and B series televisions (though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224271/lg-2021-tvs-oled-qned-g1-c1-a1-announced-specs-ces"&gt;these were just updated&lt;/a&gt;, so we likely won’t see Evo in them for at least a year), but it also supplies most of the panels found in other brands’ OLED TVs. And given that OLED is starting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215172/samsung-neo-qled-4k-8k-tv-announced-specs-ces-2021"&gt;face some competition from Mini and MicroLED&lt;/a&gt;, it’s about time it started evolving. &lt;em&gt;—Mitchell Clark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZYNwMS"&gt;Best Monitor / Display:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="fRwAjy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224922/lg-ultrafine-oled-pro-4k-monitor-ces-2021"&gt;LG UltraFine OLED Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="B3u1Ir"&gt;This year’s CES has finally made gaming monitors whole — with Asus, Acer and LG adding the HDMI 2.1 ports they’d been missing to properly support butter-smooth variable framerates and 4K resolution with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles. And yet, the monitor that captured our imaginations isn’t a gaming monitor at all. It’s an LG OLED computer screen that’s likely to have mind-blowing image quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1LPR4"&gt;To say OLED monitors have been few and far between is a bit of an understatement; for the past few years, the only OLEDs marketed as monitors have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/19/20811828/dell-alienware-55-oled-gaming-monitor-release-date-pricing"&gt;basically been gigantic 55-inch TVs&lt;/a&gt; housed in monitor-esque frames, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1486434-REG%2Fasus_21_6_proart_pq22uc_4k.html%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F16%2F22231489%2Fces-2021-verge-awards-best-laptop-tv-tech-pc-concept-gadget#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a small portable display&lt;/a&gt; for colorist work. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20909422/dell-xps-15-7590-2019-review-oled-core-i9-specs-features-price"&gt;15-inch OLED laptops&lt;/a&gt; were also sometimes a thing... if you were willing to sacrifice battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAuvGG"&gt;But now, we can look forward to a full-sized 31.5-inch 4K OLED desktop display that boasts 99 percent DCI-P3 and 99 percent Adobe RGB coverage, one that’ll charge up your laptop with 90 watts of USB-C PD power at the same time, plus two DisplayPorts and HDMI. It’s got three USB ports you can use to share a keyboard and mouse with a couple PCs at the same time and — yes — a headphone jack. A 60Hz screen with no adaptive sync whatsoever probably means gamers should look elsewhere, but the 1ms response time might make games worth it for a few. With LG Display &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224137/lg-display-42-inch-oled-tv-panel-announced"&gt;also promising&lt;/a&gt; a 42-inch OLED panel this year, it feels like OLED might finally be coming to a desktop near you. &lt;em&gt;—Sean Hollister&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="XJCIzN"&gt;CES is always full of wild concepts that are unconnected from reality, but this year we have to give it up for something that’s a literal sign of the times: Razer’s Project Hazel face mask. Let’s be clear: at this point it’s as good as vaporware in the fight against COVID-19, and we’re not expecting this (likely very expensive) gadget to be a real factor in fighting the pandemic. But seems to solve some real problems folks have with masks while managing to look awesome, so we’re awarding some points to Razer for trying something other than making sick gaming mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czfZKc"&gt;Razer still needs to prove that its disposable, rechargeable ventilators can keep you and others safe, and we’re quite skeptical: the mask doesn’t yet have authorization or certification from the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. But the Project Hazel mask is an undeniably appealing concept. It’s transparent, with auto-activating lights to illuminate your lips when it’s dark outside. Plus, it uses microphones and amplifiers to boost your voice, so you don’t sound muffled. For anyone who works in-person with others, it seems like a useful device to make communicating through a mask seem more natural. And while it’s upsetting to think about, it can’t hurt to be more prepared for the next pandemic. &lt;em&gt;—Cameron Faulkner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="W3KkJQ"&gt;I argued unsuccessfully to make this friendly robot our “best” in show pick, and I probably would have gotten away with it if not for the fact that Samsung churns out unattainable robot concepts almost every year at CES. Still, plenty of us at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;made the most noise this year while cooing at the Handy bot, who just wants your dishes to be clean and your meat-based body to be well-hydrated. Samsung is getting better and better at making robots look friendly, even now, when they’re sporting &lt;s&gt;killer robot appendages&lt;/s&gt; dexterous digits. It was a hard year, and I welcome the idea of a new friend who’s unaffected by human frailties. &lt;em&gt;—TC Sottek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="us24bN"&gt;A great pod is two things: mildly convenient, and ludicrously unnecessary. This year, the runaway winner for Most Unnecessary Use of Pods went to ColdSnap, which makes a large countertop appliance that turns the contents of tall aluminum cans into soft serve ice cream. They’re among the largest pods we’ve ever seen, and their innovation — on-demand ice cream at home — is something we’ve all been enjoying since the invention of home freezers. &lt;em&gt;—Jake Kastrenakes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="4AqK54"&gt;For this year’s “all-digital CES,” some official exhibitors were limited to 30-minute presentations. And I have to say: this is one of the best innovations we’ve ever seen at CES. While this kind of time limit may have prevented us from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3850056/qualcomms-insane-ces-2013-keynote-pictures-tweets"&gt;experiencing the greatest technology keynote of all time&lt;/a&gt;, that’s a small price to pay for constraining the snoozeworthy excesses of corporate suits who could not deliver a joke properly even if given thousands of hours of training in a virtual joke simulation machine. All keynotes from tech companies should now have a 30-minute limit unless they receive the express written consent of the National Keynote League. &lt;em&gt;—TC Sottek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Xq7A6y"&gt;A good bath sounds really nice right now.

With just your voice, you can turn on the water, set the temperature, change the colors of the lights around the tub, and even activate fog and aromatherapy. Sadly, I don’t have an extra $16,000 lying around to buy Kohler’s new tub, but I’m sure it will be coming soon to the feed of an Instagram influencer near you. &lt;em&gt;—Jay Peters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="UHEdhm"&gt;We weren’t able to touch much of anything for CES this year, but we can almost feel this laptop from MSI just by looking at it. The MSI GE76 Raider Dragon Edition Tiamat (yes that’s the real name) features an engraved, stone-like design on its lid, with a dragon and circular patterns that might not be accurate to Mesopotamian stonework, but are certainly cool if you’re in the mood. Sure, the device features Nvidia’s new GeForce RTX 3000 graphics cards, and high-end 10th gen Intel processors, but props to MSI for looking back to 3100 BC for laptop names. The company says it chose the name for the “supreme power” that Tiamat the goddess and Tiamat the laptop represent, and it’s hard not to agree with the decision. &lt;em&gt;—Ian Carlos Campbell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Unlike Airbnb, VRBO reportedly won’t cancel reservations in DC during inauguration week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rrhBGumhfZKm56bYYtL8W1zbZec=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68678199/Vrbo_logo_dark.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;vrbo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wtLSps"&gt;Short-term rental site VRBO does not plan to cancel reservations in the DC area during the inauguration next week, even though competitor Airbnb has already done so. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/vrbo-wont-cancel-inauguration-rentals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, VRBO said in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vrbo.com%2Fvacation-ideas%2Fexplore-vrbo%2Ftravel-trends%2Fa-place-for-everyone-leaves-no-room-for-hate%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F16%2F22234501%2Fvrbo-cancel-reservations-washington-dc-inauguration-airbnb-capitol#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; Friday afternoon that it was “encouraging hosts to cancel bookings during this time,” if they believed a guest was violating its policies, but stopped short of a blanket cancellation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMarHa"&gt;Following the January 6th attack on the Capitol that left six people dead, &lt;a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2021/january/headline-891291-en.html"&gt;DC-area officials said in a joint statement&lt;/a&gt; that they were “encouraging Americans not to come to Washington, D.C. and to instead participate virtually” in the inauguration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRIYRM"&gt;VRBO acknowledges in its blog post that officials were “reporting the potential for violence and armed protests” in DC and state capitals in the coming weeks. “The safety of our guests and hosts is of the utmost importance to us,” the blog post states. “If you plan to travel during this time, please follow local governmental regulations and check the latest news for updates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6qbaF"&gt;Airbnb is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228798/airbnb-washington-dc-inauguration-reservations-blocked-cancelled"&gt;blocking all reservations&lt;/a&gt; in the Washington, DC metro area during inauguration week. Airbnb said it was aware of reports “regarding armed militias and known hate groups” that planned to come to DC to try to disrupt the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL2QhN"&gt;Existing Airbnb reservations were canceled, providing full refunds to guests, and Airbnb said it would compensate hosts — the rental property owners— the amount they would have made for the canceled bookings. Airbnb had said earlier it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227028/airbnb-block-capitol-attackers-returning-dc-gofundme"&gt;working to ban members of the mob&lt;/a&gt; that attacked the Capitol from its platform, and had banned some people who were either part of the mob or connected to hate groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arRs5F"&gt;VRBO did not immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. However, VRBO parent company Expedia emailed a statement saying it is “committed to partnering with government officials, law enforcement, and community leaders as they work to secure the nation’s capital leading up to the presidential inauguration.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iJal1"&gt;The company has “activated crisis response teams throughout Expedia Group and launched extraordinary emergency procedures, including the holistic, manual review of all Washington, D.C.-area bookings across all lines of business” which includes VRBO, the statement from Expedia reads. The company is evaluating new bookings through January 24th to assess risk, and “if necessary, we will take appropriate action in coordination with law enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15tX0m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: January 16th 5:07PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from VRBO parent company Expedia Group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yWfJ5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The B-2 Test Stand at NASA’s Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. | NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eHD4WI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;﻿Update 6:05PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: A little over a minute after the Green Run hot fire test began, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/16/22234891/nasa-sls-green-run-test-hot-fire-shutdown"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the engines shut down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgMFYu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 3:10PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: NASA has moved up the time for the Green Run hot fire test. The NASA broadcast will now start at 3:20PM ET, and the test window opens at 4PM ET. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoGNcM"&gt;Four huge rocket engines will roar to life on Saturday, in a crucial test for NASA’s powerful next-generation rocket. This long-awaited trial run won’t leave the ground, but it will be so powerful that officials have warned that it may be heard &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAStennis/status/1349702841867395072"&gt;up to 60 miles away&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRbgHQ"&gt;Saturday’s test is the last step in &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/multimedia/artemis-testing-sls-green-run-checklist-cropped.html"&gt;series of tests that NASA calls a Green Run&lt;/a&gt; for the Space Launch System (SLS), a powerful rocket designed to launch missions to the Moon and deep space. It will test the 212 foot tall core of the SLS, which consists of four engines, liquid fuel tanks, and the computer and technical systems that &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-tv-to-air-hot-fire-test-of-rocket-core-stage-for-artemis-moon-missions"&gt;NASA calls the “brains” of the rocket. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EoZtuu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it will be so powerful that officials have warned that it may be heard up to 60 miles away&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2ji30g"&gt;The rocket was originally intended to debut in 2017, but it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18691230/nasa-space-launch-system-orion-artemis-moon-human-exploration"&gt;consistently been over budget&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18691230/nasa-space-launch-system-orion-artemis-moon-human-exploration"&gt;behind schedule&lt;/a&gt;. Now, NASA will finally have a chance to see how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21057391/nasa-sls-rocket-core-stage-roll-out-michoud-stennis"&gt;rocket’s systems work while the four engines&lt;/a&gt; are firing ahead of the SLS’ first launch later this year. Engineers and technicians have already tested the core’s backup systems, run through dress rehearsals to double check-timing, and loaded and unloaded hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel ahead of the big event. Now they just need to put it all together for the first time to really mimic a launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f0D3PT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Om6zyUS1330?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H2DRdD"&gt;“To be able to run a test like this, it takes not only a village, but small city,” said Ryan McKibben, the Green Run test conductor at Stennis Space Center, in a press conference. It will take six barges to haul more than 700,000 gallons of super cold propellent needed for this test — roughly 200,000 gallons of liquid oxygen, and 500,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7WiEs"&gt;The four engines themselves were originally built for NASA’s Space Shuttle program, which ended in 2011. They’ve been updated with upgrades including new engine controllers to get them ready to become part of the SLS. When the engines are fired, they will produce 1.6 million pounds of thrust — more than enough to send the core soaring. “When we ignite the engines, the stage actually will think it is flying. That’s what it’s built to do,” McKibbin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="nxUnYt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When we ignite the engines, the stage actually will think it is flying. That’s what it’s built to do.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5apIwT"&gt;While the core of the SLS is built to fly, the massive test stand is designed to keep it firmly grounded. The huge structure is anchored into the ground with over &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/b-2_test_stand_v2.pdf"&gt;144 feet of concrete and steel&lt;/a&gt; that will absorb and redirect the thrust from the engines, McKibbin said. The engines will burn for about eight minutes — approximately the same amount of time that it will take to launch the rocket to the Moon on future missions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGNVV5"&gt;This is the last big rehearsal for the rocket before it heads to space, which means it’s also one of the last chances for NASA to get data on how the rocket might perform. The team plans to run the engines through the same thrust changes that they will eventually endure when they fly through the Earth’s atmosphere. The core stage is packed with over 1,400 sensors to help document all aspects of the test and gather data that NASA will analyze intensely over the next several days after the test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EbC6Y"&gt;“The reason we test is to uncover issues on the ground and not in space,” said Julie Bassler, SLS stages manager, at a NASA press conference this week. “We are doing everything we can to ensure that we get the most out of this hot fire test and we are ready to launch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uxgQfK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are doing everything we can to ensure that we get the most out of this hot fire test and we are ready to launch.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZF98RV"&gt;If the test is successful, the core stage will be inspected and shipped to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, where it will be joined to other parts of the rocket and the Orion crew capsule. Sometime after that, the SLS will make its launch debut on the uncrewed mission called Artemis 1. That mission doesn’t have a firm date yet, but NASA is aiming for that launch to happen in &lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11643"&gt;November 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7s9tyT"&gt;Even as the SLS heads for space, it’s worth noting that it is not the only deep space rocket on the horizon. SpaceX is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22030125/spacex-starship-prototype-flight-test-12-5-kilometer-launch"&gt;rapidly prototyping its Starship system&lt;/a&gt; in Texas, and the Starship design is being considered as a &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-selects-blue-origin-dynetics-spacex-for-artemis-human-landers"&gt;candidate lunar lander for future NASA missions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3M650j"&gt;The window for the SLS hot fire test opens at 4:00PM ET, and coverage on NASA TV will start at 3:20PM ET. NASA’s livestream coverage can be found &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive"&gt;on the agency’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
