    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Gifts for the aspiring and established content creators&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="c4X606"&gt;From YouTube to Twitch to TikTok, or everyday photography, videography, and podcasting. To some degree, everyone is a content creator, whether it is a pursuit of a personal passion or for the consumption and streaming by a huge audience. Consequently, the most dedicated creators can also be the most difficult to shop for. What do you get for someone who is just starting out that will be most helpful? Or what about someone that’s a bit further along and more established?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Amzgyl"&gt;If you find yourself shopping for someone in your life that is looking to start something fresh or take their craft to the next level, we have a few gift ideas for you to check out. Like the Sony A6600 ($1,600), some are no small investment but are favored by YouTubers far and wide. Others, like Shure’s MV7 mic ($250), could jumpstart a serious podcast project or be used by a professional. And fun ideas like the IKEA Lanespelare ($25) and Philips Hue Lightstrip kit ($80) could be a great choice for anyone who wants to freshen up the decor in a studio or streaming space, as they look great on-camera.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney partners with TikTok for official text-to-speech voices from Stitch, Chewbacca, Rocket Raccoon, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gEdMDnRtQNr-2va3DEXGZIluUnE=/0x129:1102x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70132532/Screen_Shot_2021_11_12_at_9.28.44_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KmlF9T"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1459151492586299401"&gt;Disney is teaming up with TikTok&lt;/a&gt; to add official character voices to the popular social media app’s text-to-speech feature, allowing you to have your captions read by &lt;em&gt;Lilo and Stitch&lt;/em&gt;’s Stitch, C-3PO, Chewbacca, a Stormtrooper from &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, and Rocket Raccoon from &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy. &lt;/em&gt;The new character voices are rolling out in the app today as part of the &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2Fsubscribe-now%3Fcid%3DDSS-Search-Google-71700000058993695-%26irclickid%3DRgfSZFzslxyIRHnyqjWYSydRUkGxmxXflxjQxI0%26irgwc%3D1%26cid%3DDSS-Affiliate-Impact-Content-Vox%2520Media-564546%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiAsqOMBhDFARIsAFBTN3dBoDWJXrDVwzeR5APtVTarczQ4WhI6tkPIVtKwBlFRLhxMopaTyLMaAlj9EALw_wcB&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDisneyPlusDayTikTok111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus Day&lt;/a&gt; promotional holiday celebrating the two-year anniversary of the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wp8vXx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Disney is partnering with TikTok for new themed character test-to-speech voices, a feature that will surely be used only in a mature and appropriate fashion. &lt;a href="https://t.co/3Hz2NPZFor"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3Hz2NPZFor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chaim Gartenberg (@cgartenberg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cgartenberg/status/1459166147325173765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cRzovU"&gt;Using the voices works similarly to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22594929/tiktok-text-to-speech-how-to"&gt;regular text-to-speech voices&lt;/a&gt; on TikTok; after recording a video, tap the text button on the screen, and type whatever you’d like the text-to-speech voice to read. Then, tap the text-to-speech button (it looks like a head with sound waves coming out of it) to select a voice. But instead of just seeing the usual milquetoast Siri-like presets that TikTok usually offers (the company has five different ones now, after a lawsuit over the original text-to-speech voice earlier this year), you’ll see — at least in theory — the new Disney voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1i5GJ"&gt;I say in theory because as part of the promotion, you’ll have to unlock the new Disney voices first by using specific keywords. When I tried it out, I only had the Rocket voice unlocked, but presumably intrepid Disney fans on the internet will figure out how to unlock the other voices quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jAPLlI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;*yells in Chewbacca*    New Text-to-Speech voices ft. some of your favorite characters are available now on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tiktok?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TikTok&lt;/a&gt;! To unlock them, discover the mystery keywords. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyPlusDay?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DisneyPlusDay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/mRwzLsmod3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mRwzLsmod3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Disney+ (@disneyplus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1459151492586299401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="cTOnCo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use TikTok’s Text-to-Speech feature","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22594929/tiktok-text-to-speech-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ByIQUI"&gt;The Disney collaboration isn’t the first time that TikTok has offered promotional text-to-speech voices: the app &lt;a href="https://collider.com/scream-ghostface-tiktok-text-to-speech/"&gt;previously teamed up with Paramount&lt;/a&gt; to add a &lt;em&gt;Scream-&lt;/em&gt;themed voice that sounded like the villainous Ghostface to coincide with the trailer for the upcoming horror film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6grAE"&gt;Disney and TikTok haven’t said how long the new character text-to-speech voices will be available. Fortunately, though, there is literally no way that giving TikTok creators the power to make C-3PO say &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; will backfire in any way as the new text-to-speech voices get used solely in a mature and appropriate fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvxPgF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhdzDy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Nintendo Switch is back on top in the US after OLED launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P_u2JmVqzVnMz56CWPxsMiOTtw0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70132329/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p9XWUj"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732577/ps5-nintendo-switch-npd-us-sales"&gt;the PS5 ended the Nintendo Switch’s nearly three-year-long reign as the best-selling console in the US&lt;/a&gt;. That proved to be short-lived, however. In October, thanks in large part to the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;the new OLED model of the Switch&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo is back on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32BL3z"&gt;According to Nintendo, the Switch sold 711,000 units overall in the US during October, and 314,000 of those were the OLED version. The NPD Group says that these numbers made the Switch the US’s best-selling console that month “in both units and dollars.” (The analyst firm also says that the PS5 remains the top seller in 2021 in terms of dollars, while the Switch is on top when it comes to units sold.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJSFLC"&gt;“We see this as a strong start for the Nintendo Switch OLED model and a very strong indicator of the performance we can expect as we go into the holiday season,” Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OdMnf7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you see it, buy it”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oyNE5Q"&gt;Bowser notes that those October sales numbers are 3 percent lower compared to the same time last year. Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22762933/nintendo-earnings-q2-2021-switch-sales-forecast"&gt;Nintendo cut its overall sales forecast&lt;/a&gt; — it now expects to sell 24 million units globally between April 2021 and March 2022, 1.5 million less than previously forecasted — due to the global chip shortage. And Bowser says that he doesn’t predict those supply issues changing any time soon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DTNFwi"&gt;These challenges have been facing many industries, and they’ve been going on for quite some time. But we’re working to meet demand for our holiday products, including Nintendo Switch OLED model. I will say things are constantly changing, but we’ve been working across the supply chain — from production to overseas transport to local distribution channels — to make sure we have a steady flow of hardware and games through the holiday cycle. Now, despite all of our efforts, I’d say there’s still a high level of uncertainty. I’d certainly recommend if you see it, buy it this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJiiQI"&gt;As you know, in our last earnings report, we did reflect a reduction in our overall number for this year; we took it down about 1.5 million units to 24 million units globally. And that does reflect the outlook and the visibility that we have into the rest of the fiscal year. I will say, the semiconductor components are in short supply, and the future is uncertain. There are no major improvements that we’ve seen on the horizon. So I think the challenges will continue into 2022. We’re going to continue to do our best working with our suppliers to make sure we have the best supply possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7gUiF1"&gt;Outside of hardware, Nintendo noted that &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;which launched alongside the OLED Switch on October 8th&lt;/a&gt; — sold 854,000 units in the US, making it “the best start for any Metroid game ever,” according to Bowser. Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; received “a significant spike in people buying the game” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765536/animal-crossing-new-horizons-2-0-update"&gt;after its final major update&lt;/a&gt;, according to Nintendo, though the company hasn’t released specific numbers on this. &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; is currently the second best-selling Switch game with nearly 35 million units sold globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWAGh0"&gt;Bowser also touched on a few other recent and ongoing Nintendo storylines, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6FOP0a"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746897/nintendo-switch-online-n64-emulation-quality-bad"&gt;Fan complaints of poor emulation for Nintendo 64 games on Switch Online&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="03Gypl"&gt;We’re constantly looking for ways to make our online features and those games better and continuing to add value through more services and more games as we go forward. We take the feedback very seriously, and we’re continuing to look at ways to improve the overall performance. For us, it’s about quality and great content at a great value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Dkp37L"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715467/nintendo-joy-con-drift-never-fixed-switch-oled"&gt;The years-long battle against Joy-Con drift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="7sxizI"&gt;As we’ve gone through the first five and a half years of the Nintendo Switch, we’ve observed gameplay, we’ve observed as people have returned units how they’ve worn, and we’ve been making continuous improvements overall to the Joy-Con, including the analog stick. This latest version, Nintendo Switch OLED, has the same updated analog stick that’s now available in the original Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="d7wnyH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="mSvyl7"&gt;If you’ve been holding off to catch &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2Fsubscribe-now%3Fcid%3DDSS-Search-Google-71700000058993695-%26irclickid%3DRgfSZFzslxyIRHnyqjWYSydRUkGxmxXflxjQxI0%26irgwc%3D1%26cid%3DDSS-Affiliate-Impact-Content-Vox%2520Media-564546%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiAsqOMBhDFARIsAFBTN3dBoDWJXrDVwzeR5APtVTarczQ4WhI6tkPIVtKwBlFRLhxMopaTyLMaAlj9EALw_wcB&amp;amp;subid1=VergeNewDisneyPlusTitles111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus,&lt;/a&gt; today’s the day. More than a dozen films and series are arriving on the service today as part of the service’s Disney Plus Day celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjQKVO"&gt;The event kicks off at 6 AM PT/9 AM ET and will give viewers access to exclusive looks, teasers, trailers, and more. These will be unveiled throughout the morning, and fans will be able to follow along from Disney Plus’s official Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram accounts. In addition, Disney Plus is dumping a veritable truckload of content onto its streaming service today, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xEbRo3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LrYuGn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="rO6pWb"&gt;

&lt;li id="2k1ecF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under The Helmet: The Legacy Of Boba Fett &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ByW9yV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Simpsons In Plusaversary &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fZOuc3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entrelazados&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qVEF31"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Making of Happier than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kgWjLR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel Assembled: The Making of Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AsfBls"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel Studios Legends: Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="F0Ue8h"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enchanted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xdwRhp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fSOOBT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fancy Nancy Season 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="q2tiGm"&gt;Disney Plus Day kicked off with killer promotions for fans of its family of franchises, including Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and more. New or returning subscribers, for example, can swipe a subscription for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22766153/disney-plus-day-2-subscription-amc-theaters"&gt;just $2 for a month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVjven"&gt;Disney is also partnering with brands like WizKids and Funko for special deals on Disney merch, and the company is unveiling an “ultra-rare” NFT today as well. Throughout the weekend, fans can also catch &lt;a href="https://www.amctheatres.com/disney-plus-day-surprise-screenings-weekend"&gt;surprise screenings&lt;/a&gt; of popular films for $5 a pop at more than 200 AMC theaters nationwide. (You won’t know what you’re watching until the movie starts.) A full rundown of its Disney Plus Day promotions can be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22766153/disney-plus-day-2-subscription-amc-theaters"&gt;found right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnTeWk"&gt;Lastly, Disney partnered with IMAX to upgrade a collection of Marvel movies to IMAX’s expanded aspect ratio format on Disney Plus, which will give viewers up to 26 percent more picture during certain scenes. Thirteen Marvel films will get the upgrade, including &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; and other recent MCU titles like &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plW9yh"&gt;In addition to all of the promotions, Disney also used the faux-holiday as a chance to tease some of its upcoming streaming series, including the likes of &lt;em&gt;Baymax &lt;/em&gt;and a first look image of &lt;em&gt;Hocus Pocus 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest Nest Learning Thermostat is $70 off for Verge readers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NPsMvsf_hPsvNIG0tXW7aBeOPtA=/202x0:1272x713/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70132180/nestlearningthermo_screenshot.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iuw3pA"&gt;It’s Friday once again, and two more Fridays from now will be the big one: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;. I bet you’re also thinking to yourselves, “Just where has the time gone?” Well, it’s flying by for all of us, and while our excellent (if I say so myself) &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; team has been hard at work on our beautiful &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;Holiday Gift Guide&lt;/a&gt; for you to peruse and adding a bunch of hot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; to shop, we even have some exceptional deals for you today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUJw51"&gt;First up, we have an exclusive deal on the Google Nest Learning Thermostat (third generation) for &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers. You can &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Dlearning%2Dthermostat%2D3rd%2Dgeneration&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeDailyDeal111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $70 on the Nest Learning Thermostat at Wellbots&lt;/a&gt;. Use the coupon code &lt;strong&gt;THEVERGENEST &lt;/strong&gt;through December 1st to bring the price of the stainless steel, white, or polished steel finishes all the way down to $179.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaMVAD"&gt;This is one of the few smart thermostats that lets you set it and forget it, if you choose to. Many other models can allow you to control your home heating and cooling remotely, with extra features like geofencing and optional remote temperature sensors, but few learn from your habits and preferences like this Nest unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ENuTYR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google shares its commitment to Matter, promises future interoperability between smart home platforms  ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738584/google-smart-home-developer-summit-2021-matter-thread"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="jZErbh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736404"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XuRPpI"&gt;If you’re shopping for a set of true wireless earbuds for an Android phone, it can feel a bit like the Wild West. Samsung’s offerings are frequently discounted, but they might not be everyone’s style. The OnePlus Buds Pro, though, feature a subdued design, solid noise cancellation, and good audio quality at an affordable price. They’re also lightweight — weighing in at just 4.35 ounces per earbud — and they come with a charging case that is actually pocketable, unlike some competing models, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/3/18292853/beats-powerbeats-pro-true-wireless-earbuds-announced-airpods"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKB0l7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/482924/916678/12532?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fproduct%2Foneplus-buds-pro&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailyroundup111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus itself is offering these earbuds for $50 off&lt;/a&gt;, for a best-yet price of $100. That’s a great deal for these earbuds considering that they just came out in September. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637548/oneplus-buds-pro-review-specs-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="k2ESIN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="LUmkIr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860138"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hdol61"&gt;Sticking with deals in the realm of audio, but shifting gears just a bit to the world of gaming, the wired Xbox Stereo Headset offers a very budget-friendly option of quality audio for Xbox and PC gamers (or anything else that has a 3.5mm input). It looks a lot like the more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;expensive Wireless Stereo Headset&lt;/a&gt;, but it is nearly half the price and you never have to worry about charging it. Normally $60, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09C2JSK2X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon currently has it for just $50&lt;/a&gt; — a discount of 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwAoYq"&gt;If you’re looking for something higher end, then we have you covered in our roundup of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;the best wired and wireless gaming headsets&lt;/a&gt;, but at this price it’s hard to deny the appeal of a simple product at a great price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WfulKn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860198"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irF2iz"&gt;I already mentioned that we were shifting gears to the world of gaming, but now we’re shifting actual gears on real (virtual) cars thanks to this great deal on &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5. &lt;/em&gt;The latest iteration in the open-world driving series landed this week, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22762183/forza-horizon-5-perfect-portable-xbox-game-series-x-s-pc-steam"&gt;has a lot to offer on Xbox Series X / S consoles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 &lt;/em&gt;is available on Xbox and PC on Xbox Game Pass, but if you prefer physical copies of games, then Walmart and Amazon are helping you out with an early deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npx3Nf"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FForza-Horizon-5-Microsoft-Xbox-One-Xbox-Series-X-Physical%2F694914231&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailyroundup111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Forza-Horizon-Standard-Xbox-One-X/dp/B097MGZ7MY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are offering &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 &lt;/em&gt;for Xbox Series X / S and Xbox One consoles at $51, saving you 15 percent just shortly after the launch of one of Xbox’s hottest new games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jl4sIM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847621"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xhh6HA"&gt;Over at Amazon’s early Black Friday deals, there are some &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/4998f143?showVariations=true&amp;amp;ref=dlx_early_gd_dcl_img_8_4998f143_dt_sl5_f1"&gt;excellent savings on a variety of Shure microphones&lt;/a&gt;. These include some of the heavy-hitters of the podcast world, like the broadcast-quality SM7B and its newer offspring: the MV7 and MV7X. You probably know the sound of a Shure SM7B even if you’re not an audiophile, as it’s one of the most popular podcast mics in the industry. People often choose it for the darker tones it offers, giving that NPR-like warmth to even nasally voices. Of course, a good EQ and pre-amp can be just as important as the mic itself for high-end productions, especially for the SM7B which is very quiet without a quality interface or in-line boost for added gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="I3uY3c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860971"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3yiT1i"&gt;The Shure SM7B, MV7, and MV7X are all dynamic microphones, so while that means you are best served by talking directly into them — up-close and right into the mic — it also means your voice is isolated, and the background noises or reflections bouncing off of hard surfaces in your room are reduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoPx4i"&gt;All three mics are discounted at Amazon and other retailers like B&amp;amp;H, Adorama, and Best Buy. The Shure SM7B is $359 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM7B-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B0002E4Z8M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F225820-REG%2FShure_SM7B_SM7B_Cardioid_Dynamic.html%3Fsts%3Dpi%26pim%3DY&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F12%2F22776977%2Fgoogle-nest-learning-thermostat-oneplus-buds-pro-xbox-headset-mic-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fshsm7b.html&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailyroundup111221"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; — discounted $40 off its normal price of $399. The MV7, which is newer and simplest to use thanks to its option of direct USB connection, is on sale for $219 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B08G7RG9ML?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1593379-REG%2Fshure_mv7_k_mv7_mic.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F12%2F22776977%2Fgoogle-nest-learning-thermostat-oneplus-buds-pro-xbox-headset-mic-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fshmv7k.html&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailyroundup111221"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfY84jNrp1T" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; — $30 off its standard price of $249. Lastly, the newest spinoff of the SM7B, the MV7X, comes in at a savings of $30 for the lowest price of $149 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B09BZZCGC8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1658148-REG%2Fshure_mv7x_podcast_xlr_microphone.html%3Fsts%3Dpi%26pim%3DY&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F12%2F22776977%2Fgoogle-nest-learning-thermostat-oneplus-buds-pro-xbox-headset-mic-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fshmv7x.html%3Forigterm%3Dmv7x%26searchredirect%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailyroundup111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfY843TkGNP" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a lot of mic for the value, though keep in mind that when opting for the high-end SM7B or entry-level MV7X, you need an audio interface for their XLR-only connections.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>World’s first USB-C iPhone sells on eBay for $86,001</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OMn_XL__RTecS6p-9n3QoN3_Ueg=/0x0:768x512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70131929/msedge_8C53o6F5aS.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OXksGg"&gt;A modified iPhone X that has a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F165161363347&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F12%2F22777988%2Fusb-c-iphone-x-lightning-ebay-auction-86001" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sold on eBay&lt;/a&gt; for the princely sum of $86,001. The phone, which is the work of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722123/first-iphone-usb-c-port-robotics-engineering-student-custom"&gt;robotics engineering student Kenn Pillonel&lt;/a&gt;, can use the physical connector for both charging and transferring data. But Pillonel warns that the buyer &lt;a href="http://vi.vipr.ebaydesc.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItemDescV4&amp;amp;item=165161363347&amp;amp;t=0&amp;amp;category=9355&amp;amp;seller=geeken&amp;amp;excSoj=1&amp;amp;excTrk=1&amp;amp;lsite=0&amp;amp;ittenable=false&amp;amp;domain=ebay.com&amp;amp;descgauge=1&amp;amp;cspheader=1&amp;amp;oneClk=2&amp;amp;secureDesc=0&amp;amp;oversion=f3d3fc33"&gt;shouldn’t use the groundbreaking device as a regular phone&lt;/a&gt;, take it apart, or update the OS — any of which could risk breaking it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2qoMU"&gt;The fact that the mod has sold for over eighty times its original sale price shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Although Pillonel has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759704/usb-c-iphone-hack-mod-open-source-github-repo-ken-pillonel-design-video"&gt;open-sourced his work on the project&lt;/a&gt; in a Github repository containing technical details, CNC instructions, and information on the custom PCB the design uses, actually replicating the modification is no mean feat. Especially since it involves installing extra circuitry into the phone’s chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MvNfAL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVEQJNRmfDQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dWWc7L"&gt;The auction started at just $1, but bidding had reached over $3,000 by the end of its first day, before quickly climbing into the tens of thousands. There were also a couple of much higher bids of around $100,000 that were retracted before the auction came to an end. It attracted a total of 116 bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXaW8w"&gt;Although the prototype has now been sold, Pillonel has previously said he intends to continue working to improve elements like the USB-C iPhones’ fast-charging, waterproofing, and adding support for USB-C accessories. With the design open-sourced, and the prototype released into the world, it’s a project that’ll hopefully become a team effort.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus Chromebook Flip CX5 review: the 15-inch Chromebook to beat</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A pricey but delightful surprise&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WpeH2c"&gt;It wasn’t too long ago that the idea of paying $800 for a Chromebook would get you laughed out of a room. In some circles, it still will. I myself have criticized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;all kinds of Chrome OS devices&lt;/a&gt; for being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22424783/lenovo-thinkpad-c13-yoga-review-price-specs-features-amd"&gt;too expensive&lt;/a&gt; for what they offer, and I maintain that the $259.99 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Flaptops%2Flenovo%2Flenovo-edu-chromebooks%2Flenovo-chromebook-duet-10%2Fzziczctct1x%3ForgRef%3Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.google.com%25252F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22776850%2Fasus-chromebook-flip-cx5-review-the-15-inch-chromebook-to-beat" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best bargains in today’s laptop market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tALnVg"&gt;So I opened up my review unit of &lt;a href="https://www.cdw.com/product/asus-chromebook-flip-cx5-cx5500fea-yz568t-15.6-core-i5-1135g7-16-gb/6611413?pfm=srh"&gt;Asus’ $828 Chromebook CX5&lt;/a&gt; prepared to complain. While that would be a midrange price for a Windows laptop, it’s high for a Chromebook (&lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-Chromebook-Flip-CX5-in-review-1-200-Euros-for-a-Chromebook.559418.0.html"&gt;and most&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reviewed.com/laptops/content/asus-chromebook-flip-cx5500fae-review"&gt;other reviewers have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/laptop-reviews/asus-chromebook-flip-cx5-review/"&gt;panned the thing for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/asus-chromebook-flip-cx5-review/"&gt;its price&lt;/a&gt;). But the CX5 has done a great job of convincing me that my knee-jerk was misplaced — there’s almost nothing, apart from the operating system, separating this laptop from an excellent midrange Windows notebook. Chromebooks have grown up, and so have their prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RX22Yo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10859786"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="n9MlCD"&gt;The most unique feature of the CX5, even among recent Windows laptops, is its finish. The chassis is covered in what Asus calls “electro-deposition coating.” I have no idea what that means specifically, but I know I love touching it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5eT1h2"&gt;Both the keyboard deck and the lid are almost disconcertingly smooth. “Velvety” is the best descriptor I can come up with. Aside from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; (with its somewhat controversial woven-glass texture), there’s not a laptop I’ve reviewed that feels this nice. That smoothness extends to the touchpad as well, which is roomy and does a great job with palm rejection, though it is somewhat stiff such that I sometimes needed two hands to operate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook Flip CX5 in tent mode, seen from the left side on a black table with a gray fabric bench in the background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qCqkZMeiygCM_yaqaQz0F6ak2yA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959808/akrales_211012_4763_0076.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was ready to hate this, but I’m actually very pleased.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook Flip CX5 half open, seen from the back, angled to the left, with a white textured wall in the background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xMCKW7HqDLAswxA9brnlqlKLtc4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959807/akrales_211012_4763_0060.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus calls the coating “an elegant, ceramic-like texture.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W9CLhj"&gt;Similarly, the build quality is as nice as any Chromebook I’ve used this year and rivals many of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt; at this price point. It’s quite sturdy, with no flex in the screen and virtually none in the keyboard deck. The chassis barely picks up any fingerprints, and it came out of being battered around in my backpack without a scratch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulnP1J"&gt;The port selection is reasonable as well, including two USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports, an HDMI 2.0, a USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, an audio combo jack, and a microSD slot (no Thunderbolt support, though). The CX5 supports dual-band Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0, and it includes various technologies that are supposed to help stabilize connectivity including a “metamaterial filter” that’s meant to “isolate electromagnetic noise.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook Flip CX5 laid out flat on a gray fabric bench. The screen displays The Verge homepage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7QiI78UTHspeaAkITaBVVc5Vakk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959798/akrales_211012_4763_0107.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s an 81 percent screen-to-body ratio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="tbpupF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10859827"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LsbilV"&gt;I only have two real complaints about the chassis. The first is the power button — it’s located on the left edge, and I accidentally pressed it several times when holding the device as a tablet. The second, speaking of tablet mode, is the weight. At 4.17 pounds, the CX5 is heavy for a 15-inch Chromebook — it’s very close in weight to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt; gaming laptop, for context, and over a pound heavier than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419899/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-15-inch-review"&gt;Samsung’s 15-inch Galaxy Book Pro 360&lt;/a&gt;. I’d pick something else if I were looking for a device I could comfortably carry around as a tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook CX5’s keyboard angled to the right, seen from above on a black table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vIsQ3An5HFlHe-uedCS47lWWXbM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959809/akrales_211012_4763_0030.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speakers are driven by a “smart amplifier” to prevent long-term damage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook Flip CX5 in tent mode, angled to the left on a black table. The screen displays The Verge homepage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7qVpJ_EofzZF49vWtTX9exOttos=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959801/akrales_211012_4763_0139.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The CX5 has Asus’ ErgoLift hinge, which tilts the keyboard up by three degrees in clamshell mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Asus Chromebook Flip CD5." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UnNgq8z1LITdSYR5AS3IIpu5rkM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959804/akrales_211012_4763_0098.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s the power button there, with the little LED.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JTrMBl"&gt;Elsewhere, the CX5 works quite well as an entertainment and productivity device. The downward-firing speakers, which are Harmon Kardon certified, have decent percussion and excellent volume, though I did hear a tiny bit of distortion at the top end. The keyboard is fairly comfortable with decent travel and click; it’s also a bit loud, and the numpad is cramped even for my small fingers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruzpdX"&gt;The 1920 x 1080 touchscreen is vivid and kicked back little glare (and the 16:9 aspect ratio, while not ideal, is less of a crime on a 15-inch screen than it would be on a smaller device). The bezels are chunky enough to look a bit old-fashioned, but these are more reasonable to have on a 2-in-1 that you may need to hold from the sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook Flip CX5 webcam." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EPIpJwaxvcp5wy_Am69vpi9Of3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959802/akrales_211012_4763_0157.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh look, an HD camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="L57lyL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10859803"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="LxzY22"&gt;And then there’s the performance. My test unit has a Core i5-1135G7 and 16GB of LPDDR4X SDRAM, which are hefty specs for a consumer Chromebook. It blew through whatever I needed it to, and I was often working in over a dozen Chrome tabs alongside a few Android apps, with occasionally a Zoom call or a YouTube video over top. I never felt any heat or noise from the fan inside. I had one issue where running Spotify for long periods of time occasionally made the computer crash, but I’m not sure whether that’s on Spotify or Asus; I’ve asked the latter and will report back if they figure anything out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cr3wTt"&gt;Battery life is also reasonable, given the power of the chips inside. I averaged eight hours and 31 minutes of continuous use with the CX5’s screen at medium brightness, and easily broke nine hours on some trials. While that’s not an exceptional result by any stretch, it will allow you to go a full day of use without a charger if your workload is similar to mine. The device also charged quickly enough for a Chromebook, juicing up to 60 percent in 57 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqmyBf"&gt;The CX5 is also available in 14-inch models. You can get a 14-incher with a Core i3 (currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Chromebook-Touchscreen-i3-1110G4-CX5400FMA-DN388T-S/dp/B09C16QC1P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$724.99 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;) and a Core i7 (&lt;a href="https://shop.asus.com/us/90nx03p1-m00980-asus-chromebook-flip-cx5-cx5400.html"&gt;currently $1,049.99&lt;/a&gt; from Asus). Given how effortlessly the i5 is performing in my testing, I’d be hard-pressed to recommend the latter model to anyone with a Chrome-heavy workload. People who need that kind of power likely know who they are. The i3, on the other hand, may be a decent option for folks who are balking at my test unit’s price and are okay with a smaller screen. An i3 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598860/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-review"&gt;generally been&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;powerful enough&lt;/a&gt; to fly through Chrome OS tasks in my testing. (That unit also has 8GB of RAM, which is still uncommon in lower-tier Chromebooks.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook Flip CX5 open on a black table, angled to the left, with a gray fabric bench and white textured wall in the background. The screen displays The Verge homepage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TgVfiYkB2hLL3rB_3QWbb95_ZHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959806/akrales_211012_4763_0048.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The smaller i3 model may be a better value for many people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="JNndAm"&gt;All of this is to say that the CX5 rivals many Windows laptops at its price point in the areas that matter — it’s not sluggish, flimsy, or cheaply built the way Chromebooks stereotypically have been in years past. The main consideration, if you’re considering the CX5 as a primary driver, is whether Chrome OS will work for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SWNIP"&gt;I’ve been reviewing Chromebooks for almost two years, and I’ve watched Chrome OS mature before my eyes in that time. It’s grown from an operating system full of glitches and holes to one that doesn’t feel much different from Windows most of the time (especially since the latter just moved its icons to the center of its taskbar). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haUfps"&gt;But there are still a few things that get you — even if you’re someone like me, who works almost entirely in Chrome. Some apps still take a while to resize. Slack is no longer available in app form, so it’s one more thing I have to keep in my bottomless heap of Chrome tabs. Messenger still bombards me every morning with notifications for every message I received over the previous night. While it’s nice that many Android apps have gotten more usable on Chrome OS over the years, there still aren’t too many that I find more useful than their browser counterparts — most of the ones I use are equivalent at best. (And, of course, you can forget about all kinds of desktop apps to which Windows gives you access.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fb464"&gt;But for some shoppers, the simplicity and other benefits of Chrome OS outweigh those drawbacks. If that’s you, more power to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus logo on the bottom bezel of the Asus Chromebook Flip CX5." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e2IxqSxFYz3GXk00gY6mvOtIjRU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959811/akrales_211012_4763_0037.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome OS provides automatic updates and built-in security — both big selling points for many folks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qYdULV"&gt;The elephant in the room to all of this is the CX5’s price: $828.99 is well outside of what most might consider to be Chromebook territory. But that projection is often, in part, based on the assumption that Chromebooks are cheap hardware, and I’d remind people that this price isn’t egregious when it comes to &lt;em&gt;well-built &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — and I do think this one is well built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xs5eQW"&gt;Consider the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;. A Pixelbook Go with identical specs to my test unit &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixelbook_go?hl=en-US"&gt;is $999&lt;/a&gt;. Google’s device is thinner and lighter than the CX5, but it also has a smaller screen, fewer ports, and an older processor, and it doesn’t flip around. It’s not clearly a better purchase for everyone — it’s certainly not $170 better for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2AFmtw"&gt;I think if you’re someone who prefers Chrome OS to Windows, and you know that the former will suit your needs, the CX5 isn’t egregiously priced. It’s a solid performer with a unique design — there are legitimate reasons to prefer it over a midrange Windows laptop, regardless of the operating system it’s running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="XhEq59"&gt;Most importantly, it loudly and clearly sends the message that various laptop manufacturers have been trying to push over the years: Premium Chromebooks are a thing now. They’re not just a novelty that Google shows off every so often — they’re on shelves, they’re practical, and they’re targeting everyday laptop buyers. Just get ready to pay a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Design Lab controllers have rubberized grips and metallic finishes again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ubJ2ScXTNPrxAqKFpPsSUdVqB0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70131675/XBOX_DESIGN_LAB_HORIZ_JPG.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9C22gj"&gt;Microsoft is bringing back options for rubberized grips and metallic finishes on Xbox Design Lab controllers. The Xbox maker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451767/xbox-design-lab-temporarily-shutting-down-october-14-microsoft"&gt;originally paused&lt;/a&gt; its Design Lab program ahead of the Xbox Series X launch last year, before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22531865/microsoft-xbox-design-lab-series-x-colors"&gt;bringing it back&lt;/a&gt; in June without the rubberized grips and metallic finishes options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ks2P8j"&gt;These two original customization options are &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/11/11/xbox-design-lab-rubberized-grips-metallic-finishes-and-more/"&gt;available again&lt;/a&gt;, alongside some new additions. The black rubberized grips are now available on both the back case and side grips, and there are three new color options for the controller parts. Microsoft is also adding 19 new metallic finish colors, including a variety of blue, green, and pink options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JCAHnKDXzvV7j_IiA0Jt7VPFv9c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23008260/rubberizedgripsxboxdesignlabs.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated rubberized grips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2wApbp"&gt;Xbox Design Lab allows Xbox owners to create personalized Xbox controllers in the US, Canada, and most European countries, priced at $69.99. There are millions of color combinations, and you can customize colors in most parts of a controller, including bumpers, thumb sticks, the D-pad, and options for buttons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsfLKX"&gt;The rubberized and metallic finishes are available right now, and Microsoft says each custom controller will be delivered 3-4 weeks after placing an order.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="5YaeKx"&gt;Instagram is offering massive sums of money to creators to post videos on its TikTok competitor Reels, as highlighted in a pair of reports from &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9hcHAuYXNhbmEuY29tLw&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGwCkZOtldkfhaQtFvM0D9KiRGhkkWt1tpAXXPXhy6O9udCHIGiX6nVrq3YzsGebDvve05FBYhXTQq09s8AFM1z2skyCbvz9MvG791dBKa4fz1mi3EPAWt6PqF-3hD7-f9hSX_aPMwlqkKgu2_oCi1CpAu1pO45WKuwdKEv5iRr-"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-instagram-facebook-is-paying-influencers-reels-bonuses-2021-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Instagram announced its &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/183392733628561"&gt;bonus program for Reels&lt;/a&gt; in July when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would be paying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577242/facebook-1-billion-payments-creators-2022"&gt;$1 billion to creators through 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnOGVt"&gt;These reports shed new light on exactly how much individual creators are being offered for their Reels, and how many views they need to get in order to receive the maximum bonus payout. On the high end, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; points to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/qigb8i/reels_bonus_feature_error/"&gt;one Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; where someone has been offered as much as $35,000 if their Reels get 58.31 million views in a month. That’s in line with what &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; reports was offered to Sam and Cori Werrell make Reels content for their 283,000 Instagram followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kzdPzc1ilSsxClg1cw4rMWdyKxI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23008243/Image_from_iOS__2_.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users are shown a screen outlining the bonus scheme.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9nD2Ym"&gt;Meanwhile, smaller creators have reportedly been offered much more modest sums. Maddy Corbin, a creator with around 52,000 Instagram followers, was reportedly offered up to $1,000, but says that she knows of others being offered $600 or $800. &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports that these bonuses appear to be increasing over time — another creator with 24,000 Instagram followers was recently offered $8,500 for 9.28 million views. The same payout was offered to a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff member with 15,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuyZk7"&gt;There don’t seem to be any firm rules about how payment amounts correspond to follower counts. Instagram tells &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;that the program is in its early stages, and that it’s still experimenting with the format. “We’re continuing to test payments as we roll out to more creators, and expect them to fluctuate while we’re still getting started,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HcQFk"&gt;YouTube and Snapchat are offering their own incentives to creators. In August, YouTube announced it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606291/youtube-shorts-fund-launches-100-million"&gt;pay up to $10,000 a month&lt;/a&gt; for popular videos. Meanwhile, last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711632/snapchat-spotlight-challenges-announced-cash-prizes-tiktok"&gt;Snapchat announced Spotlight Challenges&lt;/a&gt;, which offers various rewards to incentivise making videos. Snapchat says its prize pools typically range from $1,000 to $25,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGHBoq"&gt;There are two possible interpretations of these platforms’ bonus schemes. The generous version is that Meta-owned Instagram wants to share the wealth with the creators at the foundation of its platform. But it’s no secret that Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat are warily eying up TikTok’s explosion in popularity, and it doesn’t seem like a coincidence that many of the bonus schemes are focussed around short-form video services that each bear an uncanny resemblance to TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeUjwv"&gt;For its part, TikTok appears to be unfazed by the amount of money being thrown around by its competitors. In late September it announced it had passed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696281/tiktok-1-billion-users"&gt;1 billion monthly active users mark&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Product Red edition of the Series 6 has often recieved the biggest discounts.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;order one of the new Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. The latest version of the Apple wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Thankfully, each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen its fair share of discounts over the last year — and we’re bound to see far more as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday approach&lt;/a&gt;. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The highest-end is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399. If either of those models is a little too rich for your blood, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44jktU"&gt;Finally, there’s the four-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8 and the current update process for the Series 3 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"&gt;become a bit of a pain point&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Yen8lP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a good entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwEyX"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is discounting the 38mm, GPS-enabled Series 3 by $30, bringing the price down to $169. If you prefer the bigger, 42mm configuration with GPS, it’s on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $199 instead of $229. Like the 38mm model, it’s also available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYU8dEI5wH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-3-gps-42mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-sport-band-black%2F-%2FA-54101062" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, though, not at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N8sVLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="title"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped version with a silver aluminum case and an abyss blue sport band for $270 instead of $279 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F305879066&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Other configurations — as well as the larger, 44mm model with GPS — are currently only available at full price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k7Seuv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716438/apple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s no longer officially a part of Apple’s wearable lineup&lt;/a&gt;, you can still buy the Apple Watch Series 6 at several retailers. The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. If you don’t mind a bit of vibrancy on your wrist, however, the 40mm, GPS-enabled red configuration usually sees the biggest discounts with the most frequency. Right now, for instance, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5RBMRN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red variant &lt;/a&gt;at Amazon right now for $349, one of the better prices we’ve seen on the Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8KuZ3"&gt;If the larger, 44mm model with GPS is your fancy, it’s available in white, navy, and red at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $379, slightly more than its best-ever price. The red configuration is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5P53JK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for the same price, as is the black model at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-6-gps-44mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-black-sport-band%2F-%2FA-80606297" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rn8JJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10598305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hZHCRf"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iK520N"&gt;With a slightly altered design and larger display, the new Series 7 comes in either a 41mm configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm configuration starting at $429. There are very few deals to speak of right now, however, you can pick up the 41mm, GPS-equipped model with a green Sport Band and green aluminum casing for $390 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a $10 discount. The 45mm model with GPS is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HFGSRJ7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in red for $420.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vE4BzP"&gt;Although both deals are slight, it is possible that we’ll see bigger discounts as we approach Black Friday and Cyber Monday, especially given Amazon has taken between $30 and $40 off a number of different sizes and configurations of the Series 7 in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4m59DD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="rwvKCC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2hTVr"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models, where the deals are often to be had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hjNY0P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
