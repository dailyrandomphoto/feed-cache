    <title>Fortnite’s latest virtual event is a simple — yet important — art gallery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k090pn-DuuFm718qRbwRf7lZVh8=/330x0:3290x1973/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408920/Fortnite_20220118172851.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1RRaaD"&gt;Yesterday on my lunch break, I spent about 15 minutes wandering the halls of the Serpentine gallery, looking at the “New Fiction” exhibition from pop artist Brian Donnelly, better known by his alias Kaws. There were all kinds of statues of his iconic “Companion” character — you may recognize its Mickey Mouse-like visage from copious vinyl figures or as an awards statue for the MTV VMAs — along with some huge, colorful paintings. It was a pleasant way to soak in some culture — and it all took place inside &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ei8ePZ"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; exhibition was essentially a virtual recreation of an IRL display at the real Serpentine in London, which is currently underway. Compared to other, similar virtual events, it’s pretty simple. It doesn’t have the surreal interactivity of “Your Progress Will Be Saved,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21308391/fortnite-creative-manchester-international-festival-art-exhibition-laturbo-avedon"&gt;a virtual &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; installation from 2020&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22788135/radiohead-kid-a-mnesia-exhibition-review"&gt;the Kid A Mnesia exhibition&lt;/a&gt; that was created as a collaboration between Radiohead and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic Games. Instead, it’s a fairly straightforward recreation of the gallery, where you can wander around and take in the exhibits at your own pace; aside from the building, there’s a big outdoor garden with some towering Kaws statues. (If you attend the show in-person, there’s also an AR element &lt;a href="https://acuteart.com/artist/kaws-new-fiction/"&gt;through the Acute mobile app&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MM4Jl3kbW7mzTkhaoVpNiacBgEM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23179273/Fortnite_20220118173010.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6XGcQQ"&gt;The most interesting thing about the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; version of the show is how it’s being presented. It’s not tucked away in its own section of the Creative mode, where most players will probably miss it. Instead, for the next week, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the main hub. So if you want to hop in to see what the latest popular Creative mode games are, you’ll be dropped into the garden outside of the gallery. From there, you can wander around and pick games and experiences to try, but you also might be tempted by the giant red Companion statue lingering in the background, luring you to see what this “New Fiction” exhibit is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sIMI9S"&gt;It’s basically a Trojan horse for pop art. Whatever you think of Kaws’ work, making it prominently available inside one of the most popular video games on the planet is a big deal. And it’s all part of an ongoing process of Epic sneaking culture into what is ostensibly a multiplayer shooter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D3nolbk5saRCb_UV-e7SvbcGNR0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23179507/Fortnite_20220118172805.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NHtQBO"&gt;There are high-profile examples, of course, like the massive musical events from the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208223/fortnite-epic-games-marshmello-concert-exciting-bizarre-future-music"&gt;Marshmello&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt;. There have also been smaller-scale — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550240/fortnite-easy-life-concert-o2-arena"&gt;and much stranger&lt;/a&gt; — virtual performances, along with music everywhere from the dance club on the Party Royale island to radio stations while players drive around in battle royale. Meanwhile, prominent artists like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cjwardart/status/1437347950343118852"&gt;Christian Ward&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1425862696059158528"&gt;Yuko Shimizu&lt;/a&gt; have created loading screens and other in-game art, and last Halloween, players could buy a Kaws-designed in-game character. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is a big, messy mashup of pop culture, and increasingly that includes more than just big brands like Marvel and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4BShY"&gt;In an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/18/kaws-fortnite-serpentine-street-art-augmented-reality"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Donnelly described these kinds of projects as a way “to throw bridges to a new generation.” It doesn’t replace the experience of attending a real gallery. But it is a way to get this work in front of people who would otherwise probably never see it. Love it or hate it, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; commands a lot of attention — and it’s nice to see that being used to highlight something other than the latest blockbuster movie.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM announces plans to make mobile power generators using hydrogen fuel cells</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6_0II64Ot3jG_DKxEgZjV1O_w5w=/381x0:2715x1556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408877/EMPOWER_rapid_charger.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;GM’s EMPOWER rapid charger can help retail fuel stations add more affordable DC fast-charging capabilities  | GM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KSLxE1"&gt;General Motors announced plans to manufacture mobile power generators using its Hydrotec-branded hydrogen fuel cells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQc1QD"&gt;The aim is to replace polluting gas- and diesel-powered generators with zero-emission hydrogen-powered ones. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, so its appeal to an industry that’s trying to pivot away from dirty internal combustion engines is obvious. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/13/15257576/hydrogen-fuel-cell-honda-clarity-self-driving-ny-auto-show-2017"&gt;Some automakers are developing hydrogen-powered cars&lt;/a&gt; as a possible alternative to EVs that use lithium-ion batteries. With today’s announcement, GM is staking out a position that looks beyond the car and power generation. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OZSbmeERvsN33xYeXetgVCk-g9s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23179673/GM_MPG.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GM&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GM’s Mobile Power Generator can fast-charge EVs without having to expand the grid or install permanent charge points in places where there is only a temporary need for power&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ci946t"&gt;Hydrogen fuel cells — which use compressed hydrogen as their fuel and release only water vapor — have been in development for decades. GM has condensed its Hydrotec system into a “power cube” encompassing 300 individual hydrogen fuel cells. The cubes can then be deployed in a variety of applications, including mobile generators and temporary EV chargers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTbnKG"&gt;The hydrogen-powered generators will only be sold to commercial and military customers to start out, but the automaker said it plans on offering versions for residential use in the future. GM said the ideal application would be at an outdoor concert venue, thanks to the hydrogen generator’s much lower noise profile as compared to gas-powered power sources. Another use case would involve temporary electric vehicle chargers installed at locations where demand for charging hasn’t yet resulted in a permanent charging station. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXN9JMTI6XdoXo2i2w1YWOITcMI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23179678/Palletized_MPG.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GM&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;GM’s prototype palletized Mobile Power Generator converts offboard, bulk-stored hydrogen to electricity to quietly and efficiently power military camps and installations with no emissions in operation.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EBQkhb"&gt;“Hydrotec power generators can quickly be deployed for disaster relief,” said Charlie Freese, executive director of GM’s Hydrotec division, in a call with reporters, “or it can provide backup for the electrical grid in areas that are experiencing rolling blackouts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u08u64"&gt;GM is planning on offering these generators in multiple sizes for a variety of uses. Each unit will put out power ranging from 60kW to 600kW, depending on size and use case. They also will use a different number of Hydrotec power cubes. The company’s Mobile Power Generator, for example, relies on one power cube, while the Empower rapid chargers will use eight cubes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFzXuR"&gt;One of the biggest challenges, though, is the dearth of hydrogen charging and refueling infrastructure. Despite the technology having been in development for decades, there are only a little more than two dozen fueling stations in California, &lt;a href="http://cafcp.org/stationmap"&gt;mostly clustered&lt;/a&gt; around Los Angeles and the Bay Area. The East Coast is trying to get in on the action. A &lt;a href="http://chfcc.org/existing-and-planned-hydrogen-fueling-stations-northeast-us/"&gt;handful of stations&lt;/a&gt; are up and running, and more are in the works in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d9iT9i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One of the biggest challenges, though, is the dearth of hydrogen charging and refueling infrastructure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gEncfQ"&gt;Hydrogen’s energy content by volume is low, which makes storing hydrogen a challenge because it requires high pressures, low temperatures, or chemical processes to be stored compactly. Overcoming this challenge is important for light-duty vehicles because they often have limited size and weight capacity for fuel storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCnJef"&gt;However, Freese said he was confident that the infrastructure would improve as demand for hydrogen rises. “Hydrogen infrastructure is something that’s building out now,” he said. “There’s a lot of investment going on there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yApDqr"&gt;In addition to producing hydrogen for mobile power generation, GM is also working on applying the technology to trucking, rail transportation, and even aerospace. The automaker is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251582/gm-hydrogen-truck-navistar-oneh2-range-date"&gt;working with trucking firm Navistar and OneH2&lt;/a&gt;, a North Carolina-based hydrogen fuel cell company, to put more hydrogen-powered long-haul trucks on the road. It also has a deal with Liebherr-Aerospace to develop a hydrogen fuel cell power-generation demonstrator system for aircraft. And it’s working on fuel cell systems for Wabtec locomotives. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gzsikH"&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emirates.com%2Fus%2Fenglish%2Fhelp%2Ftravel-updates%2F%234842&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22890080%2F5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Emirates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/airindiain/status/1483509249376329731"&gt;Air India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ana.co.jp%2Ffs%2Fint%2Fen%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22890080%2F5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ANA&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jal.co.jp%2Fjp%2Fen%2Finfo%2F2022%2Finter%2F20220118%2F%3Fm%3Dimportant_notice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22890080%2F5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Japan Airlines&lt;/a&gt; all announced that they were canceling some flights to the US due to this week’s rollout of C-band 5G over concerns it could potentially interfere with some instruments, particularly on Boeing 777 aircraft. This comes as cell carriers, federal agencies, airlines, and airplane manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;struggle to reach an agreement&lt;/a&gt; on policies regarding how the rollout should be handled. The situation has continued to evolve as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891286/att-5g-rollout-select-metro-areas-faa-delay"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891284/verizon-c-band-5g-ultra-wideband-now-available"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; switch on their c-band, but it’s only gotten messier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFj9dm"&gt;ANA cites specific guidance from Boeing, saying that “Boeing has announced flight restrictions on all airlines operating the Boeing 777 aircraft.” Japan Airlines also cites a notification from Boeing, saying that it was told that “5G signals for U.S. mobile phones, which will begin operating in the U.S. on January 19, 2022, may interfere with the radio wave altimeter installed on the Boeing 777.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGaPah"&gt;However, Japan Airlines changed its guidance on Wednesday, saying it “received confirmation from the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) that there is no longer a problem with the operation of the Boeing 777 and we will resume service to the U.S. mainland with Boeing 777 from January 20.” ANA has updated its advisory with similar language, saying that it’s returning to “the normal schedule based on FAA notification that there is no safety issue with the operation of Boeing 777 aircraft to the U.S. airports that we serve.” However, Emirates and Air India haven’t changed their guidance, and the FAA hasn’t publicly released an updated statement. The 777 isn’t currently on the regulator’s list of cleared aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vRHiFa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Emirates says it’s “working closely with aircraft manufacturers and the relevant authorities”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MlWmTF"&gt;Emirates’ announcement clearly outlines what’s being canceled. The airline, described as the world’s largest operator of the Boeing 777 &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airlines-scramble-rejig-schedules-amid-us-5g-rollout-concerns-2022-01-18/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, says that it’s “suspending flights to the following US destinations from 19 January 2022 until further notice,” listing Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Miami, Newark, Orlando, San Francisco, and Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="837OGu"&gt;The airline will continue to fly to New York JFK, Los Angeles (LAX), and Washington, DC (IAD). Emirates says it’s “working closely with aircraft manufacturers and the relevant authorities to alleviate operational concerns” and that it hopes to start flying to the US again as soon as it’s able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbuBmU"&gt;More airlines were affected as Tuesday progressed. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airlines-scramble-rejig-schedules-amid-us-5g-rollout-concerns-2022-01-18/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Taiwan’s China Airlines will reschedule some flights, while South Korea’s Korean Air Lines switched away from Boeing’s 777 and 747-8 aircraft on six flights to the US, and Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific says it’s prepared to use different planes if necessary. Lufthansa had canceled at least one US flight and was switching from the Boeing 747-8 to the 747-400 aircraft on some US routes. Air India, Singapore Airlines, and Austrian Airlines were also switching out 777 aircraft for US flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSGmYn"&gt;Airline operators in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;warned earlier on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that the 5G rollout could cause “catastrophic disruption” to their flight schedules. &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/5g"&gt;According to the FAA&lt;/a&gt;, the concern is that the C-band 5G signals could interfere with the radar altimeters used in some planes, creating a safety issue.

&lt;aside id="H1s6Mx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are feuding with the US government over a last-minute delay to 5G","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pBBjYr"&gt;Boeing didn’t respond immediately to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request to confirm that it had sent out an advisory. Its competitor, Airbus, said that it will be working “as part of a wider industry coalition” to “study the issue further and work toward solutions.” For information on aircraft limitations, it referred to &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-5g"&gt;the FAA’s statements on 5G page&lt;/a&gt;, where a statement from January 16th lists the airplane models that have been approved to land at some airports under low-visibility conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3837yY"&gt;On Tuesday morning, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon announced&lt;/a&gt; that they would voluntarily delay 5G antenna upgrades near certain airports. The chairwoman for the Federal Communications Commission issued a statement saying it’s “essential that the FAA now complete” the process of assessing altimeter performance and the effect C-band 5G communication can have on it with “both care and speed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cm6hVP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, January 19th 1:10PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Japan Airlines saying it’ll be allowed to fly 777s per the FAA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9vwZG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, January 19th, 5:27AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information on additional airlines that have been affected with emphasis on Boeing 777 aircraft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7NzFjZ"&gt;Yesterday morning, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;announced plans to acquire&lt;/a&gt; Activision Blizzard, publisher of games ranging from the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; series to &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush Saga&lt;/em&gt;, for $68.7 billion. Microsoft says the move would make it the third-largest gaming company by revenue, following Tencent and Sony. The company, already a giant in the market, would gain even more leverage over how games are made and distributed. That’s assuming regulators approve it — something that’s not guaranteed amid a new push for scrutiny of potential tech monopolies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQmt5C"&gt;After a damaging antitrust case in the 1990s, Microsoft has mostly escaped the more recent antitrust criticism directed at tech companies like Apple, Meta, and Amazon. But the company has been steadily building its power in the games world for the past few years. In 2021, it closed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;an acquisition of ZeniMax Media&lt;/a&gt;, giving it ownership of subsidiaries like &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; maker Bethesda Softworks for a total of 23 first-party game studios. Meanwhile, Microsoft has built its Xbox brand into a gaming service that spans both consoles and PCs. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22406059/xbox-game-pass-subscribers-25-million-microsoft-activision"&gt;The company recently revealed&lt;/a&gt; that its Xbox Game Pass subscription service had grown to 25 million subscribers after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/24/15684972/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-subscription-launch-date"&gt;launching in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. With the Activision Blizzard acquisition, it would integrate a massive game publisher into that system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ob8dYn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft has budgeted time for heavy scrutiny&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ov4d1c"&gt;That new market power could raise eyebrows at the US Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, which will have to approve the merger. While neither agency has commented on the recent announcement, they’ve committed to more carefully examining tech industry consolidation — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889579/ftc-justice-department-lina-khan-kanter-google-facebook-amazon-antitrust"&gt;launching a joint process yesterday&lt;/a&gt; to start overhauling the approval process. Expecting resistance, Microsoft has budgeted an extended timeline for the process, planning for it to close by the fiscal year of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lJZ7Z"&gt;Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard fits the form of a vertical merger: where two companies that offer complementary services combine forces, like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17152518/att-time-warner-merger-trial-justice-department"&gt;major telecommunications company buying a media production company&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, it’s a major game studio joining a major game storefront and console company. (Since Microsoft already owns several first-party game studios, there’s also a level of horizontal merger, where directly competing companies combine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LOSYr"&gt;The new generation of antitrust activists has recently taken particular aim at vertical mergers. In September of last year, the FTC &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-moves-toward-stricter-antitrust-scrutiny-of-vertical-mergers-11631741589"&gt;withdrew Trump administration-era guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that agency chair Lina Khan said wrongly attributed helpful effects like increased efficiency to them — calling claims that they provided consumer benefits “misguided.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUqgoy"&gt;A video game industry merger might not seem as immediately dangerous as something like a sprawling Amazon retail monopoly or a locked-up mobile app store. But Microsoft’s growing power in games could reduce its incentive to work fairly with third-party developers who rely on products like the Xbox and Game Pass to reach players. It could also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22890553/microsoft-activision-xbox-game-pass-competition-subscription"&gt;increase the dominance of Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; and its leverage to raise prices on subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMwICJ"&gt;“It’s all about the Game Pass subscription model,” explains Matt Stoller of the American Economic Liberties Project. “Everyone who doesn’t own massive distribution is going to have an increasingly difficult time producing games and getting them distributed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQm2uG"&gt;Stoller believes there’s a precedent for blocking Microsoft’s merger as anti-competitive. He cites &lt;em&gt;United States v. Paramount Pictures&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-day-the-supreme-court-killed-hollywoods-studio-system"&gt;a landmark 1948 Supreme Court decision&lt;/a&gt; that took aim at Hollywood studios’ control over the distribution of movies &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;the theaters where they were shown. The resulting consent decree barred studios from also owning theaters and imposed other restrictions like an end to “block booking,” which forced theaters to book slates of films in advance. (The decree was &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/judge-agrees-end-paramount-consent-decrees-1306387/"&gt;officially terminated in 2020&lt;/a&gt; after a judge determined it was “unlikely” the studios would wield the same monopoly power today.) The &lt;em&gt;Paramount&lt;/em&gt; decision “created an open market for creative content,” says Stoller — it’s credited with helping fuel the rise of television and freeing actors from restrictive contracts by reducing studios’ power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="veUfF9"&gt;Stoller sees Paramount-like consolidation today in games. “What you’re finding here is that it was an open market for gaming content, but it’s increasingly being closed off into walled gardens,” he says — although he acknowledges that companies like Nintendo have long maintained closed ecosystems. The recent rise of game streaming, a system where companies can exercise even more control over how content is distributed and played, could further consolidate the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOXmtr"&gt;“Game streaming giants will make it much harder for independent game producers to get into the market,” warns Stoller. And Microsoft is one of the biggest players in that space thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787396/xbox-cloud-gaming-consoles-series-x-s-one"&gt;cross-platform Xbox Cloud Gaming&lt;/a&gt; (formerly xCloud) service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rd1INw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One lawmaker has cited “encouraging” signs from Microsoft&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fbDheC"&gt;This doesn’t necessarily mean that regulators — or lawmakers who have expressed a broad interest in tightening the rules for mergers — will be hostile to Microsoft’s merger. The company’s acquisition of ZeniMax didn’t meet substantial resistance in either Europe or the US — although the latter was then still operating under Trump’s administration, which put less weight on antitrust. Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22561157/ken-buck-antitrust-apple-amazon-facebook-google-cicilline-jim-jordan"&gt;prominent Republican supporter&lt;/a&gt; of antitrust reform, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1483564026919596032"&gt;tweeted yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that he’d received “encouraging” assurances from Microsoft that the deal wouldn’t decrease competition. “They’ve suggested that they’re going to emphasize access to titles and competition in the marketplace as well as the individual gaming experience,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1483564029293600776"&gt;Buck said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rx3TY7"&gt;Buck’s comment hits on one of the key splits in recent antitrust debates: whether anti-monopoly efforts should focus narrowly on the direct effects on consumers or the market as a whole. As Khan has noted, combining two complementary services &lt;em&gt;doesn’t &lt;/em&gt;necessarily grant benefits to end users. But even if it does, it could have ripple effects that change the way games are made and played, putting more pressure on developers to play by Microsoft’s rules. And in an era of renewed suspicion of monopolies, that might raise more red flags than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon’s faster C-band 5G is live and off to a promising start</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/klCou6FBnhd32v1B4r5jzh36x3U=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408396/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vXuyvi"&gt;Amid an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;ongoing tussle with the FAA&lt;/a&gt; and airline industry, Verizon today flipped the switch on its mid-band 5G deployment, which uses spectrum that the company spent tens of billions of dollars to acquire in the C-band auction. The new, faster level of 5G connectivity will significantly augment Verizon’s “5G Ultra Wideband” network, which, until now, has relied solely on extremely-fast-but-very-hard-to-find millimeter wave spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZWFbT"&gt;Mid-band 5G overcomes many of the hurdles that have made mmW the brunt of jokes from competitors like T-Mobile: it’s actually available indoors, and coverage doesn’t vary as unpredictably from one street to the next. Customers with compatible phones should experience noticeably faster data speeds compared to Verizon’s “5G Nationwide” network that offers widespread signal but with download and upload performance that in many cases isn’t much better than LTE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KqM4F"&gt;In short, 5G is about to feel a lot more real for Verizon customers than it ever has before. Mid-band is a crucial element of Verizon’s long-term 5G ambitions and bridges the gap between the slow 5G Nationwide and barely existent, ultra-fast millimeter wave 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SYFfnVodaBvNx-MyvG_yE1lnq38=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23179494/Screen_Shot_2022_01_19_at_10.56.22_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7rmd2/cband_live_in_claremont_iphone_12_pro_max_and/" target="_blank"&gt;r/Verizon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;In many cases, C-band speeds are a substantial upgrade from Verizon’s slower “5G Nationwide” and a true leap over 4G LTE.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MpCLCi"&gt;Even on day one, the improvements are promising. Customers were quick to take to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon"&gt;the Verizon subreddit&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday to post a slew of Ookla Speedtest screenshots, with download rates regularly topping 500Mbps and even 800Mbps in some cases. Many are seeing an average downlink between 200 and 400Mbps, far exceeding the performance of 5G Nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5dJeat"&gt;Which devices support Verizon’s new, faster C-band 5G?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiwHtD"&gt;At launch, the list of supported phones and tablets is fairly short. These are the devices that can already connect to Verizon’s C-band 5G:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nyTl9H"&gt;Apple iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tgp345"&gt;Apple iPad Pro 12.9-inch (5th generation), iPad Pro 11-inch (3rd generation), or iPad mini (6th generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dUkQZr"&gt;Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro &lt;em&gt;(coming soon)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j7667Y"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, S21 Ultra, Z Fold 3, Z Flip 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lGwK67"&gt;Verizon has said that all phones it releases as of now will support C-band 5G, and the carrier expects to offer over 20 compatible phones by the end of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J0MtGT"&gt;Where can I get Verizon’s C-band 5G?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eUWKR5"&gt;Verizon has said it will provide a C-band coverage map at launch, but so far, no such map is available on the carrier’s website — perhaps a consequence of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;eleventh-hour concessions to the FAA&lt;/a&gt;. You can expect just about every major metro market to have some degree of C-band coverage in January: the company has promised to reach “more than 100 million people in 1,700-plus cities around the nation” with the faster flavor of 5G this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cv5XUO"&gt;But it’s a rolling process and won’t be instantly available everywhere. I’m located in downtown Brooklyn and am still riding on the slower 5G Nationwide network as of mid-day Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uMjii0"&gt;How do I know if I’m on Verizon’s C-band 5G?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3cv4p"&gt;Verizon’s C-band 5G shares the same “5G Ultra Wideband” indicator in your phone’s status bar as millimeter wave 5G. That makes things a little confusing, but if you’re suddenly (and consistently) seeing “5G UW” appear in places where you never had it previously, that’s the best evidence that your device is taking advantage of the faster 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Cb94xu"&gt;How fast is it really?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Cj8mhW"&gt;Based on many early tests, pretty fast — and on a different level altogether than 5G Nationwide. Upload speeds aren’t anything spectacular, but many Verizon customers on C-band are getting download rates that range &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7pjbf/lake_county_il_north_of_chicago_is_live/"&gt;anywhere from 200&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7p997/indiana_cband_result/"&gt;500Mbps&lt;/a&gt; and, in the very best cases, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7qe1h/cband_live_in_downtown_la/"&gt;over 800Mbps&lt;/a&gt;. And these are in regions where cellular data had previously often topped out around 60 or 80Mbps, so the upgrade is substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y1txFg"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2022-01-19T16:01:56.193427+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7os2i/cband_in_rochester_ny_is_live/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;C-Band in Rochester NY is live&lt;/a&gt; from

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UTc47i"&gt;Do I need to change my plan to get C-band 5G on Verizon?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HkNPVt"&gt;Not necessarily. According to Verizon, its Do More, Play More, and Get More Unlimited plans have access today, as well as the slightly tweaked and rebranded 5G Do More, 5G Play More, and 5G Get More plans that the carrier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867007/verizon-t-mobile-att-unlimited-plan-5g"&gt;announced in early January&lt;/a&gt;. Verizon’s previous Above and Beyond Unlimited plans also have 5G Ultra Wideband / C-band access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQO4A5"&gt;Verizon’s entry-level Start Unlimited plan does not include 5G Ultra Wideband whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0ztXEU"&gt;What about the whole airplane safety thing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YhstDY"&gt;Don’t expect to get C-band speeds at your local airport for some time. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have begrudgingly agreed to delay activating C-band 5G around many airports and are creating exclusion zones to address airplane-related safety concerns that continue to be raised by the FAA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G05uF5"&gt;Both carriers have strongly criticized the FAA for being unprepared for this moment. “The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and our nation’s airlines have not been able to fully resolve navigating 5G around airports, despite it being safe and fully operational in more than 40 other countries,” Verizon said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fESPh"&gt;If you’re a Verizon customer and are already using the faster mid-band 5G, feel free to share some of your impressions in the comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egfQPF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 19th, 1:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon has clarified to &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; that the Pixel 6 series is not yet fully certified for C-band access. Details around supported plans have also been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T begins 5G C-band rollout in limited number of metro areas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="5G Wireless Service To Launch In U.S. Despite Aviation Industry Concerns" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MM_JlKgcNCV4bS6JDyGdiFhbYIs=/53x0:2369x1544/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408374/1365480215.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VvG9W7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.att.com/innovationblog/2022/connectivity.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is lighting up its expanded 5G service&lt;/a&gt; in just eight metro areas in the US on Wednesday, including Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Chicago, Detroit, Jacksonville, Orlando, and South Florida (&lt;a href="https://about.att.com/ecms//dam/snrdocs/pdf/metro-areas-with-c-band.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). This comes after both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;voluntarily limited the activation of C-band spectrum around airports&lt;/a&gt; after facing mounting pressure from airlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRI818"&gt;“Today’s introduction begins in limited parts of 8 metro areas across the U.S. It will expand rapidly as our thoughtful and efficient deployment ramps up throughout the year,” Chris Sambar, AT&amp;amp;T’s executive vice president of technology operations, explains in the post announcing the expansion. “With 17 C-Band-capable devices already available online and in our stores, you can start seeing those speeds today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="89AWZE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Meanwhile, Verizon plans on activating towers in 1,700 cities this month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ih1vQ0"&gt;Just one day before Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s scheduled 5G rollout on January 19th, major airlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;warned against activating 5G towers for fear of “catastrophic disruption”&lt;/a&gt; to flights operating across the country. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890080/5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan"&gt;Air India, Emirates, Japan Airlines, and ANA&lt;/a&gt; canceled some of their flights in advance over concerns that the 5G expansion could &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/5g"&gt;interfere with radar altimeters&lt;/a&gt; that aircraft use to make low-visibility landings. Ahead of the rollout, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reached an agreement with both carriers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/8/22873765/faa-verizon-att-airport-5g-carriers-buffer-zone"&gt;create 50 buffer zones where AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will shut off transmitters for six months near airports&lt;/a&gt; with high traffic volume and frequent low-visibility conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wY1Hnk"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T expressed frustration at the FAA’s failure to “utilize the two years they’ve had to responsibly plan for this deployment,” as well as its “inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services.” AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon’s activation of the C-band spectrum has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;faced pushback by the FAA&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in two delays. And while AT&amp;amp;T is taking a more cautious approach to its rollout, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/get-most-out-of-verizon-5g-ultra-wideband-network" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon plans on activating its network in 1,700 cities&lt;/a&gt; — covering 100 million more people — this month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD hides, then restores claim that 4GB of VRAM is ‘not enough’ just as it launches a 4GB GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CmObtW8HrpAm-rZVynFdGYp24-Q=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407618/amd4gbofvramoops.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0qPZ1h"&gt;AMD claimed back in 2020 that 4GB of VRAM was “insufficient” for modern PC games and could result in error messages, warning limits, lower framerates, and even gameplay stutter or pop-in issues. Today, AMD is launching the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865817/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-rdna-2-price-release-date"&gt;$199 RX 6500 XT&lt;/a&gt; with... 4GB of VRAM, and the blog post featuring AMD’s original claims has mysteriously disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tNhpf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/amd-hides-2020-blogpost-claiming-4gb-vram-is-not-enough-for-todays-games/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KitGuru &lt;/em&gt;reports that&lt;/a&gt; AMD has hidden the blog post today, as it was previously accessible yesterday, and a &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:SFDks_9NnscJ:https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/game-beyond-4gb/ba-p/414776"&gt;Google cached view version&lt;/a&gt; from January 16th has the post in full. “AMD is leading the industry at providing gamers with high VRAM graphics solutions across the entire product offering,” said Adit Bhutani, a Radeon marketing specialist for AMD, in the blog post from 2020. “Competitive products at a similar entry level price-point are offering up to a maximum of 4GB of VRAM, which is evidently not enough for todays games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAjj6s"&gt;After this article was published, the blog post suddenly reappeared. AMD has not responded to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3ZyT5"&gt;At the time, AMD was promoting its own GPUs for 1080p gaming that included 6GB or 8GB of VRAM. The company performed a series of tests showing how much better an 8GB model of its RX 5500 XT was compared to a measly 4GB model. It looks like this blog post magically disappeared just as AMD is about to launch a new 4GB GPU today. &lt;em&gt;Mysterious&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xWbvQ9tNarmmy_ZEhVAVkx36HdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23178953/amdoops.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: AMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMD’s 2020 blog post included performance graphs highlighting 4GB GPUs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="35S32j"&gt;The new entry-level RX 6500 XT is supposedly priced at $199 and is available to purchase today (if you’re lucky). AMD’s marketing for this new GPU included a media roundtable earlier this month, where &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563016/why-less-could-mean-more-in-amd-and-nvidias-new-budget-gpu-battle.html"&gt;Radeon vice president Laura Smith claimed&lt;/a&gt; “even with the four gigs of frame buffer, that’s a really nice frame buffer size for the majority of triple-A games.” &lt;em&gt;Awkward&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3cKf9"&gt;Now, this could all be a totally innocent mistake or the most coincidental technical glitch we’ve ever seen, so we reached out to AMD to comment on the missing blog post. The company hasn’t responded, but it is back on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="clct6d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 19th, 12:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect that the missing forum post has been conveniently restored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia added a buggy Android 11 update to its Shield TV lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nvidia’s Shield TV, the best streaming player for home theater experts and gamers, pictured on a table." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uRP34JSek3DYCgw5nVJ-rtIHIJ8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408367/DSCF4370.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sMubHJ"&gt;When Nvidia announced the rollout of the Shield Experience 9.0 (Android 11) update for its Android TV devices, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880057/nvidia-shield-android-11-update-set-top-box-streaming"&gt;we were impressed&lt;/a&gt; by the simple fact that it would include Shield TV models dating back to 2015 — but the buzz was short-lived as many owners are reporting major bugs on even the latest models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaY5me"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/17/shield-tv-android-11-plex-app-issues/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, people that ran the update on their Shield TVs lost access to their Plex media servers — a popular use case for the devices thanks to their powerful processor and a USB port that supports storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MemTJC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Well upgraded my shield to 9.0 wish I hadn't now  not very happy!!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/WejE0v1ebk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WejE0v1ebk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Justin Greatrix (@Hotwire147) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hotwire147/status/1482138909161267201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dubqrh"&gt;Nvidia is taking action on the matter: it posted a &lt;a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5303/kw/permission"&gt;support page&lt;/a&gt; explaining how to give apps (like Plex) permission to use storage devices in Android 11, and at least one Reddit user wrote that it fixed their Plex server. The company also opened a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fforums%2Fshield-tv%2F9%2F481674%2Fandroid-11-application-issues%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F19%2F22891143%2Fnvidia-shield-tv-android-11-update-bugs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;support forum&lt;/a&gt; to collect bug reports on its Android 11 products directly from users and developed a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fforums%2Fshield-tv%2F9%2F481782%2Fshield-experience-upgrade-90-known-issues%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F19%2F22891143%2Fnvidia-shield-tv-android-11-update-bugs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of about 27 known and reported bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxyoUv"&gt;Another popular use case for the Shield TV is running Kodi for live TV and other media — but there are reports it also shows performance issues, stuttering, and outputting blank screens. Even popular streaming apps like YouTube and Hulu have exhibited everything from delayed loading to blank screens, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ShieldAndroidTV/comments/s3jg2b/android_11_application_issues/"&gt;posts on the Shield subreddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LvCNbq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Great update guys &lt;a href="https://t.co/kMPcJQ2Wwf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kMPcJQ2Wwf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— IncredibleJohn (@IncredibleJohnY) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IncredibleJohnY/status/1481319924878434307?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nWMrDL"&gt;Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fforums%2Fshield-tv%2F9%2F481434%2Fshield-experience-upgrade-90-hotfix-image%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F19%2F22891143%2Fnvidia-shield-tv-android-11-update-bugs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HotFix program is available&lt;/a&gt; for testing bug fixes as they come out, but bear in mind that these are untested releases that break some DRM-d services like Disney Plus and don’t include an option to roll back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House says 400 million free N95 masks will be available at US pharmacies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="First Responders Prepare Coronavirus Safety Kits For Field Officers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5VYPCvmg_w8LSAKK1w1UV4EFk4k=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408165/1206664154.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;N95 face masks offer better protection against COVID than cloth ones, the CDC says | Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9utJ5v"&gt;The US government will make 400 million N95 face masks available for free at pharmacies and health centers, sourcing them from the Strategic National Stockpile, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1483831305448173578?s=20"&gt;White House tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3z5O8"&gt;The announcement comes not long after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that the cloth masks worn by most people don’t provide as much prevention of coronavirus transmission as N95 masks or KN95 masks, the international equivalent. Some health experts have argued that the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/24/health/cloth-mask-omicron-variant-wellness/index.html"&gt;cloth masks are particularly ineffective&lt;/a&gt; against the highly contagious omicron variant of COVID-19 that has pushed infection rates higher in recent weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WV1jVQ"&gt;N95 masks are made with several layers of material that have better filtration than cloth masks and fit more snugly than other nonsurgical masks or face coverings, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H6WDda"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our Administration is making 400 million N95 masks from the Strategic National Stockpile available for free to Americans.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;N95 masks will be available for the public to pick up at tens of thousands of local pharmacies and health centers.&lt;/p&gt;— The White House (@WhiteHouse) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1483831305448173578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 19, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIbq6N"&gt;The messaging from US health officials around N95 masks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206728/cloth-face-masks-white-house-coronavirus-covid-cdc-messaging"&gt;has been confusing&lt;/a&gt;, to say the least. When the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206044/masks-cloth-coronavirus-cdc-recommendation-guidelines-wear-spread-prevent-covid-19"&gt;released guidelines in April 2020&lt;/a&gt; recommending people in the US wear “simple cloth coverings” on their faces to prevent transmission of the coronavirus, it was a reversal from its earlier stance that masks weren’t necessary at all, except for healthcare providers and people who were acutely ill. As part of that April 2020 guidance, the CDC stressed that the general public shouldn’t use surgical and N95 masks in order to reserve them for healthcare workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3ZuL6"&gt;The White House didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday, but the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/free-n95-masks-to-be-made-available-at-pharmacies-white-house-says-11642586403"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; the free masks will be available at pharmacies and community health centers beginning next week, and the program should be in full swing by early February, with three masks available per person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPYpur"&gt;And the website that the Biden administration promised would be available for Americans to order free coronavirus tests to be delivered by mail is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889571/free-covid-19-tests-usps-website"&gt;now up and running&lt;/a&gt;, although some users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890031/white-house-rapid-covid-tests-apartment-bug-usps"&gt;reported problems trying to order tests&lt;/a&gt; to be delivered to apartment buildings or multiple-family residences. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Horizon Forbidden West’s new story trailer brings back Aloy’s old friends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/APyLNayutg2BbS_2YTA6yeFwfaw=/188x0:2213x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408107/horizon_forbidden_west_screenshot_12_disclaimer_en_27may21.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aOcH2I"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21285673/horizon-forbidden-west-2-ps5-trailer-teaser-zero-dawn-sequel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is almost here, and to celebrate, PlayStation released a new trailer. In the new story trailer, we get a better idea of the threats Aloy will face going into the west. The land is dying, affected by some kind of ruinous blight that only Aloy armed with her Focus has the power to stop. To do so, she’ll mount her trusty strider and head west, exploring the beautiful ruins of famous landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mi65FV"&gt;Aloy won’t be alone on her trip. Her old friends Erend and Varl will accompany her on her journey. Another old “friend,” Sylens, has also reappeared in the west and seems to be working for the Regalla, a tribe dedicated to war and conquest, giving them the means to command and control the machines.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VY6o6y"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;, Aloy will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455008/horizon-forbidden-west-gameplay-ps5-sony-state-of-play"&gt;ride, hang glide, and scuba dive&lt;/a&gt; through gorgeous new locales, searching for the secrets of the new plague and the means to destroy it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYLUTK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; launches on PlayStation on February 18th.&lt;/p&gt;
