    <title>Social media and telco companies urged to preserve evidence from Capitol attack</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7aoZXg"&gt;Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), incoming chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is asking mobile carriers and social media platforms to preserve “content and associated metadata” that may be  connected to the attack on the US Capitol. Warner said in a statement Saturday that he contacted the CEOs of AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Apple, Facebook, Gab, Google, Parler, Signal, Telegram, and Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4VTOB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“The United States Capitol is now a crime scene,” Warner &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22224462/capitol_attack_twitter.pdf"&gt;wrote in his letters&lt;/a&gt;. “The FBI and other law enforcement agencies are currently investigating the events of that day, and trying to piece together what happened and the perpetrators involved. The prospect of litigation on behalf of the victims of the mayhem also is highly likely. Messaging data to and from your subscribers that may have participated in, or assisted, those engaged in this insurrection – and associated subscriber information – are critical evidence in helping to bring these rioters to justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yemBp"&gt;Warner noted that many of those participating in the January 6th attack that left five people dead posted images to social media, or shared them via text and mobile messaging platforms while the riot was underway and afterward, “to celebrate their disdain for our democratic process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTUI64"&gt;All the named companies routinely comply with &lt;a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/digitaldiscovery/library/preservation/preservationanalysis.html"&gt;court-issued preservation orders&lt;/a&gt;, issued during criminal investigations. But Warner’s letter is an informal request, without the legal force of a criminal preservation order, and it is unclear how the companies will respond. Court-issued preservation orders are often issued under seal so it is also possible that one of the many agencies investigating the Capitol raid has already issued such an order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVn9sb"&gt;We’ve reached out to the companies to ask how and if they plan to comply with Warner’s request and will update if we hear back from them. A Facebook spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company was “continuing our ongoing, proactive outreach to law enforcement and have worked to quickly provide responses to valid legal requests. We are removing content, disabling accounts, and working with law enforcement to protect against direct threats to public safety.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8fHkL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/08/capitol-riot-democrats-social-media-456325"&gt;Warner told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that following Wednesday’s attack, Congress would “come back with a vengeance” against social media platforms that were unable to rein in violent content and threats on their platforms. “This is going to come back and bite ‘em,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJb7nH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 9th 1:15PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use your Oculus Quest 2 to play any PC VR game wirelessly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q8Sb_6aZYKAVgUN-Mu726FoGJrQ=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68643020/hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh hey, it’s all of my PC games available to play on the Quest 2, wire-free, from within a virtual room. This is getting weird.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vDDDh3"&gt;One of the best features of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt; is it can be manually linked via USB to your gaming PC to play more demanding VR games you couldn’t otherwise run natively on the headset. That’s great if you want a way to play games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; but the obvious downside is that you’re now physically tethered to a PC — so much for the wireless freedom that the Quest 2 advertises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTupji"&gt;Thankfully, developers have already figured out the seemingly impossible: how to run system-intensive titles on your PC and stream the visual feed to your VR device while syncing all of your movements over Wi-Fi. It gives you the best of both worlds: letting you play the games you want without being attached by a cable to your computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3KFeB"&gt;Doing this isn’t as simple as installing an app through the Oculus store; there are several steps involved. I’m going to walk you through the steps required to make this happen on your Quest 2 virtual reality headset. The same steps likely work on the first Quest iteration, but I only have the latest model here to test.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o_t-Z4D9QRYXg53gktfDSroykrk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21869420/akrales_200904_4160_0158.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="y6XT1Z"&gt;Get a link cable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mkk0sS"&gt;Even though this is a how-to on experiencing VR without wires, you’ll need a wire to get started. Oculus sells an expensive 16-foot cable &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Faccessories%2Foculus-link%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22218827%2Foculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for around $80&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s made for people who really want to use the Quest 2 in wired mode. There are other, less costly alternatives, like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Powerline-Pull-up-Resistor-MacBook/dp/B01MZIPYPY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s 10-foot USB-C to USB Type-A 3.0 cable&lt;/a&gt;, which costs about $20 and gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSGod0"&gt;Many USB cables that come with modern Android phones will likely work, too. And the cable doesn’t have to be long — we’re just doing some simple data transfer here. Unfortunately, the USB-C cable that Oculus includes with each Quest 2 didn’t work for this process when I tried it. It’s simply for charging the headset.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus Link cable" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d2-t2ZH4DcN5xNKEuiIxv-hPNeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220848/link.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the official Oculus Link cable. It costs $80 and is difficult to find in stock. You don’t need this specific model to get through this how-to!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HLFOrZ"&gt;Enable developer settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ENBD4r"&gt;If you want to load files onto your Quest 2, you’ll need a developer account. Fortunately, it’s easy to do, but it’s a strange process that’s meant to be used by actual developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="M5h2bP"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://developer.oculus.com/sign-up/"&gt;Go to this page&lt;/a&gt; and sign in to your Facebook account in your browser of choice. Just make sure you sign in to the same Facebook account that you signed in to on your Quest 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iETLPN"&gt;The next part of the process is to name your “organization.” You can name it whatever you’d like. You can find a direct link to this page &lt;a href="https://developer.oculus.com/manage/organizations/create/"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt; in case you get lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JviHwY"&gt;With those two steps out of the way, open up your Oculus mobile app (iOS or Android) and sign in with the same Facebook account. Then navigate to the “Settings” pane by clicking it at the bottom-right corner of the app window. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f28QYc"&gt;On the next page, click “Oculus Quest 2” right beneath your name, and a few more options will expand from within it. Click “More Settings”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LjFHiH"&gt;Once you’re there, tap “Developer Mode” and switch it on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uk0AYEdZujV8vYa_mbrXnBAMaQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220802/oculussettings.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click here to see more options, including “More Settings” that contains the Developer Mode toggle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AQD0Fp"&gt;Install the Quest 2 driver for your PC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FedPeY"&gt;The next couple of steps pave the way for you to sideload software onto the Quest 2 headset, which is a feature usually reserved for developers. If you’re using a Windows PC, you will need to install ADB drivers to let your PC write to the headset; according to the Oculus site, macOS and Linux systems don’t need a driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="IfSXDw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-adb-drivers/"&gt;Download the software linked here&lt;/a&gt;, hosted by Oculus. (Just check the box saying you agree to the terms of the license — you can read it if you want — and click on “Download.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Tc4ftm"&gt;Once it’s downloaded, extract the contents of the folder. Then right click the item called “android_winusb.inf” and select “Install.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus ADB driver" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yjLNsBnRKNtXnQL2frnTJKssLSM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220830/androidinstall.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Install this driver to get this process started.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="E0oS4h"&gt;Buy the Virtual Desktop app for Quest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qYkSF8"&gt;The Virtual Desktop app lets you access your PC through the lens of a VR headset. You can use it for games, like we’ll be doing, but you can also watch movies you have stored on your PC in a variety of different virtual environments. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2017050365004772%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22218827%2Foculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;There’s a Quest-specific version of the app that you can purchase here for $20&lt;/a&gt;. (Make sure it says that it’s compatible with Quest underneath the purchase button.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsBT4k"&gt;After you purchase it, install it on the headset. We’ll be returning to this app in just a bit, but for now, a few other steps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iVvcJViGCifzUvXoqbandzJ1-6Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220864/vd.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virtual Desktop running on the Quest 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="moyHQc"&gt;Connect the Quest 2 to your PC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1c0QG0"&gt;Connect your Quest 2 via its side-mounted USB-C port to your PC’s fastest available USB port. If you’ve done everything correctly up to this point, you’ll see a message displayed in the headset asking if you want to allow USB debugging. Allow it to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2olhKD"&gt;Download and install SideQuest on your PC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3PXijo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://sidequestvr.com/"&gt;SideQuest&lt;/a&gt; is a free app and storefront for experiences that can be sideloaded onto your headset. For the purposes of this how-to, you’re just going to use it to apply a necessary patch to the Virtual Desktop app that I just suggested you buy and install on your Quest 2 headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BzYKAc"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto"&gt;Head here to find the right installer for your operating system&lt;/a&gt; (I used the Windows 10 version for this how-to) and download it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9NwEZL"&gt;Once it finishes installing, run SideQuest &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="p8KAZs"&gt;At this point, your headset should show up as connected in the top-left corner of the SideQuest app on your PC with a green bubble. If it’s not showing as connected, check your headset’s display for a prompt. It may be waiting for you to allow your PC to access and modify the Quest 2’s file system. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sidequest app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/edGIzkrxEFjC_rfVmqW12xgoTV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220822/sidequestgreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The green light indicates that your headset is connected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AxsTDf"&gt;Sideload the Virtual Desktop VR patch for Quest 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zzx32q"&gt;Within SideQuest, type “virtual desktop” in the search bar. The result you’re looking for is called “Virtual Desktop VR Patch.” This is the necessary key to fooling your computer into thinking your Quest 2 is a wired headset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="k4e6Qs"&gt;With your Quest 2 connected to your computer, hit the “Install to Headset” button in SideQuest, located just below the search bar in the app. The process should be pretty snappy, lasting just a few seconds. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sidequest" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ziLKCpgcSGu-X0gG7CIl1FkaQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220813/questinstalltoheadset.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Install this necessary Virtual Desktop patch to your Quest 2 headset.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7F3xXK"&gt;Download Virtual Desktop Streamer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zwiEFT"&gt;There’s yet one more free application to download: &lt;a href="https://www.vrdesktop.net/"&gt;Virtual Desktop Streamer&lt;/a&gt;. Made by the same folks who made the Virtual Desktop app you purchased on the Quest 2, this app simply streams PC content to your headset via Wi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LRXQqT"&gt;Once this app is downloaded and installed, you’ll need to input your Oculus username in the Streamer window &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ovpydi"&gt;If you don’t know it off the top of your head, you can find it by opening the Oculus app on mobile, navigating to “Settings,” and then tapping on the area that shows your name and email address. The name that will display next to your avatar is your username.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-J0UPjJSbyMOlAcOy2iyZNZhBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220804/oculusname.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having a hard time finding your Oculus username? Tap on your full name in the Settings menu to see this view pictured above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dCc3Bu"&gt;After that’s entered, hit “Save”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RXWg5x"&gt;That’s the last step! But remember that it’s crucial to have the Virtual Desktop Streamer app open in order for your headset to communicate with your PC. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop Streamer" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uFCk8sazQ5CJ39c4U4ARWJVRwXA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220811/streamer.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what the Virtual Desktop Streamer app looks like. It’s very simple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FylPqj"&gt;Open Virtual Desktop on your Quest 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tFxMTY"&gt;If every step was done correctly, you’ll see your PC pop up in the list of available devices to connect to from within the Virtual Desktop app on your Quest 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWDSZP"&gt;Once you’ve connected, the Options button (the left Oculus Touch controller’s equivalent of the Oculus button) is mapped to open up the top-level menu for Virtual Desktop, as shown in the image below. From there, clicking “Games” will reveal every game that’s installed on your PC. You can simply boot each one from there, and your PC will handle all of the hard work. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RetcNAlbbLJZGLVlASVqciHC1_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220812/virtudaldesktopgames.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the VR-ready games installed on your PC will show up within Virtual Desktop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E4ucp4"&gt;If you aren’t happy with the visual fidelity within each game, you’re free to customize some settings that affect latency, refresh rate, and more. Note that you’ll likely get a clearer, more fluid image if your PC is powerful and your internet connection is fast. Given the reliance on your Wi-Fi network, your wireless router plays a large role in delivering a smooth experience, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNzjSC"&gt;Streaming VR over Wi-Fi certainly isn’t a perfect solution. I have a Wi-Fi 6-ready router and relatively speedy internet (235Mbps down, 19Mbps up), and I still experience the occasional spot of lag and slightly fuzzy image. Though with enough tweaking on the Virtual Desktop app (turning Wi-Fi off on seldom-used tech items never hurts), I think you’ll have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DraftKings announces it will now allow betting on drone races in some states</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0z1ast"&gt;Sports betting company DraftKings and the Drone Racing League (DRL)  will now allow betting on drone races in some states, the two &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-drone-racing-league-and-draftkings-take-flight-with-official-sports-betting-agreement-ahead-of-season-finale-races-301203192.html"&gt;companies announced&lt;/a&gt;. DRL, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/draftkings-and-drone-racing-league-partnership-lets-you-bet-on-drone-races.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; describes&lt;/a&gt; as a first-person view racing league, allows pilots to compete for prizes by flying their drones through courses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRta0L"&gt;Residents of Colorado, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Tennessee, and West Virginia will be able to bet on the races via their phones, and regulatory approval is pending for betting on drone races in other states, the companies said. The terms of the deal and the amounts of the prize money weren’t disclosed, but drone racers &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/19/drone-racing-is-worth-100000-in-upcoming-championship.html"&gt;in a 2017 tournament&lt;/a&gt; competed for $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1eN4af"&gt;“The sky is now the limit for DRL fans to get skin in the game, and we’re thrilled to partner with DraftKings to transform our high-speed race competition into the ultimate sport to bet on,” DRL President Rachel Jacobson said in a statement. According to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;, drones used in the events are built by DRL, and each one is worth about $2,000. The league has deals for media rights to the races with NBC Sports and Sky Sports, and a streaming arrangement with Twitter to host its preflight shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZcbws"&gt;DraftKings first introduced DRL drone races last year as a kind of test run, and says response was better than expected. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellore/2021/01/08/drone-racing-league-partners-with-draftkings/?sh=40faf1572a71"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the first free-to-play pool in November drew more than 150,000 entrants. DRL was &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fespn%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F13431957%2Fproponents-see-huge-potential-drone-racing-league&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F9%2F22222051%2Fdraftkings-drl-betting-drone-races#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;established in 2015&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5H8Cj"&gt;The first races, part of the 2020 DRL Allianz World Championship Season, are slated for Saturday at 4:30PM ET on NBC, Twitter, and Facebook. DRL and DraftKings will host pre-flight shows ahead of the live events to give fans details on how to participate. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s 2021, and the pandemic is still here </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dodger Stadium COVID-19 testing site, which is the largest in the U.S., will reopen today after a weekend closure for restructuring to alleviate traffic in the area.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wHWLA1"&gt;I regret to inform you that even with all of the other news happening this week, there is still a pandemic going on. It would have been great to sweep it out the door with the old planners and dead Christmas trees. But it’s 2021, and COVID-19 is still here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0l3wX"&gt;More than a year after this &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-virus-discovered-by-chinese-scientists-investigating-pneumonia-outbreak-11578485668"&gt;coronavirus made its big debut&lt;/a&gt;, it’s bigger than ever. Days after it was sequenced on January 7th, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/"&gt;there were 41 cases in China&lt;/a&gt; and one death. A year later, the toll now stands at 88,617,915 infected, and 1,907,608 dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="w91RX9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zFg5oT"&gt;Those numbers are rising rapidly. One in 30 Londoners has COVID-19, London Mayor Sadiq Khan &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MayorofLondon/status/1347530789710426113"&gt;tweeted on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. New &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant.html"&gt;variants of the virus&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be more transmissible, are spreading in the UK, South Africa, and around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4KcZN"&gt;The US broke records for COVID-related deaths multiple days this week, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/world/fauci-coronavirus-january.html"&gt;topping 4,000 on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. “We believe things will get worse as we get into January,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/01/07/954324536/december-was-pandemics-deadliest-month-vaccine-process-has-been-slow"&gt;told NPR&lt;/a&gt;. “Now’s not the time to pull back on this.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O28Jnr"&gt;It’s the time to speed up the manufacturing and distribution of vaccines. It’s time to keep wearing masks and keep our distance from one another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2H3IOz"&gt;It’s time to prioritize ending the pandemic that stole last year before it takes over this one, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWgu3O"&gt;Hindsight is 20/20. Let’s see if we learned anything from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL5wsO"&gt;Here’s what else is going on this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JiYo3P"&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1nsy03"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/health/coronavirus-variant-tracking.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Is Blind to Contagious New Virus Variant, Scientists Warn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;A national surveillance program could help track the new variants, but that kind of program doesn’t yet exist in the US. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206522/coronavirus-test-variant-contagious-uk-gene"&gt;quirk in some COVID-19 tests&lt;/a&gt; could help labs look for the variant, but they fall short of a more widespread system. (Carl Zimmer, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In short: if they are more easily transmissible, it’s easier for more people to get sick or die. (Brian Resnik, &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzeQwS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/08/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-mutation-contagious/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine not affected by mutation seen in contagious coronavirus variant, study indicates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Early research suggests that the Pfizer vaccine may be effective against one of the mutations found in some of the worrying variants. This is a good early sign, but the &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.07.425740v1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was small and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445645/coronavirus-covid-19-studies-problems-limitations"&gt;has not been reviewed by outside experts&lt;/a&gt;. (Andrew Joseph, &lt;em&gt;Stat&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

They had just two hours to safely administer 600 doses of the Moderna vaccine. Incredibly, they did it. (Anita Chabria, &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Other countries, including the UK, have decided to delay the second dose, in an effort to vaccinate more people. (Nicole Westman, &lt;em&gt;The Verge)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Adrianna Rodriguez, &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CHk1WQ"&gt;Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qGLYWI"&gt;It’s an enviable kind of know-how, the muscle memory of care. But like so much in medicine, it comes with complications, the everyday rifts that open up between your world and others’, the repetitive stress injuries of the soul. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="46XuC0"&gt;More than numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1DFTkk"&gt;To the more than 88,617,915 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBcryY"&gt;To the families and friends of the 1,907,608 people who have died worldwide — 367,635 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A few deals to get 2021 started off right</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B0WqZOZe3PbX16UNCFwNFeW4o9k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68642604/akrales_191008_3706_0023.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1sVPDW"&gt;After a brief hiatus over the holiday, we’re back with another Verge Deals dispatch. Since we last sent one of these out, many of the deals that filled our daily coverage around the holidays have come to an end, and recently, whenever a good sale comes around, it usually doesn’t last too long. Simply put, the dealscape is a little barren right now. Nevertheless, I’ve put in some of the week’s best offers for your perusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yUDgsn"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="H5AZAT"&gt;Save on Nintendo’s fantastic &lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v8xiQt"&gt;If you’re one of those people who makes a New Year’s resolution to get fit, there are a few deals you might want to know about. If you own a Nintendo Switch, consider picking up &lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a game that requires the use of a Pilates ring to help you work out. The game itself has standalone workouts, or you can hop into a full campaign where the activities will scale up in difficulty. It’s fun! Normally $80, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728851577196507064" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $70 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Given that it was almost impossible to find earlier in the pandemic, it’s cool to see that not only is it in stock, but it’s cheaper, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8IcAWV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10273326"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="lnyl0k"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yntBZt"&gt;Get a 75-inch Hisense 4K TV for $300 off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cgZ4ZS"&gt;In time for the Super Bowl, Best Buy has been dropping prices lately on large 4K HDR TVs from Hisense. Its 85-inch model was a popular deal with readers this past week, and while that particular model is no longer discounted, the 75-inch model is. Normally $1,000 even, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728939351250604130" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get it for $700&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JpSJ3x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10265690"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="noncpP"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xfKlEt"&gt;This is the last week to save 20 percent on six months of HBO Max&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O_zpAF3ROEkQleTH1Zz_YYORcEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20015310/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="33tgfd"&gt;January 15th is the last day to take advantage of a great deal on HBO Max. You can get 20 percent off the total cost of a six-month membership, &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;aff_sub=verge"&gt;bringing the cost down to $70 instead of $90&lt;/a&gt;. Note that this deal requires paying in full for the half-year of service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0aOIR"&gt;I’m highlighting this again because, in case you missed it, Warner Bros. is bringing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;all of its 2021 films will be released on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, for 30 days, at the same time that they’re released in theaters. So far, you can watch &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; in glorious 4K, but many more will be released throughout the year, like Denis Villeneuve’s take on &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="q8h7Fm"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LQqho2"&gt;OnePlus’ Nord N10 5G includes a free set of wireless earbuds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2pj0G5"&gt;The OnePlus Nord N10 5G just launched. It’s a confusing name for a phone with a very simple goal: bringing 5G to the masses in a $300 phone that has a 90Hz refresh rate display. To find out more and see some camera samples, read my colleague Allison Johnson’s great review on it. If you want to buy the phone, doing so will get you a complimentary set of OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alexa’s ‘Tell Me When’ skill combines reminders with contextual information</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0CK3D3apVhw4g_aMd4DeNkgurQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68642572/cwelch_191016_3739_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5k3di3"&gt;Amazon has updated Alexa in the last month with a modified version of its popular reminders skill. You can now ask Alexa to “Tell me when” an event happens and your device will give you background information and notify you when it actually occurs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mLXYF"&gt;You’ve been able to set a reminder for an event or task at a specific time for a while, and requesting Alexa to tell you when an event occurs can pull up relevant information. “Tell me when” is sort of a synthesis of the two tasks. Amazon provided a few examples: you could ask Alexa to “Tell me when the next Seahawks game is” and Alexa could tell you the time of the game and set a reminder to watch. Another interesting use is for email, you can now ask Alexa to tell you when an email arrives from a specific person, and Alexa can announce the email’s arrival to save you from constantly checking your inbox. Of course, you’d have to be comfortable giving Alexa access to your email for that feature to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPLJga"&gt;“Tell me when” shares some overlap with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21165985/new-alexa-features-nba-severe-weather-commute-directions"&gt;another earlier skill for severe weather alerts&lt;/a&gt;. You can ask Alexa to tell you when there’s a severe weather alert, and the assistant can remind you when there’s one in your area.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ub2IWJ"&gt;It’s may not be the most exciting feature on its face, but “Tell me when” is a good example of how Alexa has picked up the ability to provide more contextual information and follow-up questions over time. Amazon didn’t provide a full range of events that “tell me when” works for when we asked, but you should already be able to try out the skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9QEeO"&gt;For more updates on Alexa’s growing list of skills &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=21580762011&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check out Amazon’s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is deleting Trump’s attempts to circumvent ban</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VHFcNG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Twitter permanently banned Donald Trump today&lt;/a&gt;. For a brief moment, he managed to tweet anyhow — not from @realDonaldTrump, his suspended account, but rather the official @POTUS account reserved for the current President of the United States, one that will be handed over to Joe Biden on January 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kToazX"&gt;His message, before it was deleted, cryptically suggested that he will “have a big announcement soon” and that he was looking “at the possibilities of building out our own platform.”  Trump is currently deplatformed from most social media.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wKwgHeAiHNenKo76izVwUY5HJnM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223685/Screen_Shot_2021_01_08_at_8.31.12_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdDfZX"&gt;As I have been saying for a long time, Twitter has gone further and further in banning free speech, and tonight, Twitter employees have coordinated with the Democrats and the Radical Left in removing my account from their platform, to silence me — and YOU, the 75,000,000 great...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcKXgd"&gt;...patriots who voted for me. Twitter may be a private company, but without the government’s gift of Section 230 they would not exist for long. I predicted this would happen. We have been negotiating with various other sites, and will have a big announcement soon, while we...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPO01w"&gt;...also look at the possibilities of building out our own platform in the near future. We will not be SILENCED! Twitter is not about FREE SPEECH. They are all about promoting a Radical Left platform where some of the most vicious people in the world are allowed to speak freely...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KGDLvx"&gt;Twitter told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier Friday that Trump would not be able to evade a ban by tweeting from a different account, and that his tweets might be deleted if he tweeted from a government account (like @POTUS). &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mat/status/1347722670352158722?s=21"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; has confirmed with Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that is exactly what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoG6uP"&gt;If Trump tries to use a non-government account (say, if he created a new account), it would be permanently suspended “at first detection” according to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="davQJ0"&gt;Later on Friday evening, Trump tested that policy by tweeting the same messages from @TeamTrump, the Trump campaign’s official account. The messages remained active for a few minutes before the account was suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3-wp_eyoitewLmupT27aGxQHMSM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223744/Screen_Shot_2021_01_08_at_6.30.54_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ALjhlL"&gt;The account also posted this picture shortly before it was suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Opc_S2B3rMf95pXD_ZL_7Led5yc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223746/Image_from_iOS.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PJmFDa"&gt;Twitter confirmed that it permanently suspended @TeamTrump in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXvpVk"&gt;Gary Coby, listed on LinkedIn as the digital director for Trump’s 2020 campaign, has also had his account suspended after &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anthony/status/1347742612657217536?s=21"&gt;apparently offering it&lt;/a&gt; to White House social media director Dan Scavino for him to use and changing the display name and avatar to Trump’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TnFPh1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This was Coby’s last update &lt;a href="https://t.co/IyqFmRo7gQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/IyqFmRo7gQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Anthony DeRosa   (@Anthony) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Anthony/status/1347742612657217536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p id="zGkZGx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 8th, 10:29PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added Gary Coby’s suspension.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google pulls Parler from Play Store for fostering calls to violence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mgUTQz4YR_CqM727-nvBeR017rI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68641548/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hWoAss"&gt;Google has suspended Parler from the Play Store, as first reported by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleyrgold/status/1347704721281314823"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; reporter Ashley Gold&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve confirmed the app is no longer on the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yw0zxX"&gt;Here is the full statement, which was shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6iXjJs"&gt;In order to protect user safety on Google Play, our longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite violence. All developers agree to these terms and we have reminded Parler of this clear policy in recent months. We’re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US. We recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app’s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TvZxRE"&gt;Parler did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYoNi9"&gt;Apple has given an ultimatum to Parler to police its app or be removed sometime on Saturday, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-threatens-ban-parler?bftwnews&amp;amp;utm_term=4ldqpgc#4ldqpgc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; reported Friday evening&lt;/a&gt;. The app is still available on Apple’s App Store. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bX5bVR"&gt;Both Google and Apple have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220366/apple-google-parler-pressure-deplatform-violence-capitol"&gt;come under pressure&lt;/a&gt; to remove the app, which is known for having less moderation and as a conservative-friendly alternative to other social media platforms. The pressure comes two days after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, incited by President Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tbjw23"&gt;Twitter permanently suspended Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Friday evening&lt;/a&gt;, while Facebook placed an “indefinite” ban on Trump’s account &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLDWgw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 8th, 8:08PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxeUY9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: We originally said that &lt;/em&gt;Politico&lt;em&gt; reporter Cristiano Lima and &lt;/em&gt;New York Times&lt;em&gt; reporter Jack Nicas were first to report that Google removed Parler, but &lt;/em&gt;Axios &lt;em&gt;reporter&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ashley Gold tweeted the news before they did. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord bans pro-Trump server ‘The Donald’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QbUCivEbkGwjuIWBHBhF1Awhneo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68641509/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dHrqvT"&gt;Discord has banned a server called “The Donald,” a pro-Trump community linked to banned subreddit r/The_Donald and TheDonald.win. The news was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1347690173748834309"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt; writer (and &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;contributor) Casey Newton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTpubm"&gt;The ban comes two days &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;after a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol,&lt;/a&gt; encouraged by President Trump, though Discord says that it has no evidence that the server was used to organize the riots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qW3lIa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In STILL OTHER news, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/discord?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Discord&lt;/a&gt; says it has banned server The Donald, which was connected to TheDonald dot Win and the Donald subreddit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Made decision "due to its overt connection to an online forum used to incite violence and plan an armed insurrection,” spox says.&lt;/p&gt;— Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1347690173748834309?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qInvow"&gt;“We have a zero-tolerance policy against hate and violence of any kind on the platform, or the use of Discord to support or organize around violent extremism,” Discord said in a statement shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “While there is no evidence of a server called The Donald being used to organize the Jan 6 riots, Discord decided to ban the entire server today due to its overt connection to an online forum used to incite violence, plan an armed insurrection in the United States, and spread harmful misinformation related to 2020 U.S. election fraud.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJmOip"&gt;Reddit banned pro-Trump subreddit r/The_Donald &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21304947/reddit-ban-subreddits-the-donald-chapo-trap-house-new-content-policy-rules"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt; following an expansion of its policies to ban hate speech more explicitly. The Donald’s Discord server was one of the places former r/The_Donald members congregated following the ban, as detailed in this &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt; article &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/10/the_donald_reddit_discord/"&gt;from October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzVKpO"&gt;Reddit also banned unofficial pro-Trump subreddit r/donaldtrump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220834/reddit-trump-subreddit-ban-violence-us-capitol-mob"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt; “given repeated policy violations in recent days regarding the violence at the US Capitol.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter permanently bans Trump</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Donald J. Trump..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UtfFFpp7jfX6inoUrkzkGj_tSM=/0x0:5505x3670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68641193/1223057457.10.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e9BWTi"&gt;Twitter permanently banned President Donald Trump on Friday, days after a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol leaving five dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uXIs8"&gt;“After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” Twitter said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528?s=20"&gt;in a statement Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="au8oLY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;After close review of recent Tweets from the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@realDonaldTrump&lt;/a&gt; account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.&lt;a href="https://t.co/CBpE1I6j8Y"&gt;https://t.co/CBpE1I6j8Y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkSCC2"&gt;The ban comes after the president incited a mob that broke into the US Capitol building, disrupting Congress’ certification of Joe Biden as the President Elect. Twitter initially put a 12-hour ban on Trump’s account for “repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy” after he posted messages repeating lies that the election was stolen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygTtKY"&gt;At the time, Twitter said Trump would be banned permanently if he continued to violate its rules, including those around civic integrity or violent threats. Twitter said in a statement Friday that two new tweets posted since Trump’s initial suspension violated the platform’s rules, prompting the permanent suspension. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CAzEDjOtMBq8lFfqzrh2uLiV0Mo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223529/Screen_Shot_2021_01_08_at_3.22.26_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter permanently suspending President Donald Trump’s Twitter account Friday evening.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OBmP9k"&gt;“Due to the ongoing tensions in the United States, and an uptick in the global conversation in regards to the people who violently stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, these two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks,” Twitter said &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html"&gt;in its Friday blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYjq67"&gt;Twitter decided the new tweets were “highly likely to encourage and inspire people to replicate the criminal acts” at the Capitol, and shared its reasoning in five parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UOHV0r"&gt;President Trump’s statement that he will not be attending the Inauguration is being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate and is seen as him disavowing his previous claim made via two Tweets (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/1347103015493361664"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/1347103016311259136"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Dan Scavino, that there would be an “orderly transition” on January 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A91mvh"&gt;The second Tweet may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a “safe” target, as he will not be attending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtqrZ8"&gt;The use of the words “American Patriots” to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UXDAjH"&gt;The mention of his supporters having a “GIANT VOICE long into the future” and that “They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an “orderly transition” and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VbraO"&gt;Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jFrZa1"&gt;Twitter declined to comment on other Trump-related accounts like @POTUS when questioned by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. If Trump attempted to circumvent this ban by using a separate account, that account would be permanently suspended “at first detection,” according to Twitter. If a government account, like @POTUS, was used to evade @realDonaldTrump’s ban, Twitter said that it would try to limit the account’s use but would not suspend it unless it was necessary to curb real-world violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffehIo"&gt;Earlier Friday, more than 300 Twitter employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221386/twitter-employees-trump-ban-internal-letter-capitol-attack"&gt;signed onto an internal petition&lt;/a&gt; calling for Trump to be permanently banned following the January 6th Capitol riots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVBVy8"&gt;“We must examine Twitter’s complicity in what President-Elect Biden has rightly termed insurrection. Those acts jeopardize the wellbeing of the United States, our company, and our employees,” the employees wrote in the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltCwtD"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook put an “indefinite” ban on Trump&lt;/a&gt; that it said would last at least through Inauguration Day. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the risks “are simply too great” to allow Trump continued access after he used the platform to “incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwGgn6"&gt;The suspension has been a long time coming. For years, Twitter has faced pressure to remove Trump from its platform due to the large megaphone it’s offered him to spread hateful language and lies. The company justified his continued presence on the platform as being in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxq2GB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 1/8/20 at 7:22PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included new context on ban circumvention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="poBSC1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 1/8/20 at 7:39PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included additional context from Twitter on ban evasions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
