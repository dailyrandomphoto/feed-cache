  &lt;p id="yQnrks"&gt;Just as Facebook’s Antigone Davis was live on CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;defending the company’s policies and its handling of research data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701445/facebook-instagram-mental-health-research-pdfs-documents"&gt;suggesting Instagram is harmful to teens&lt;/a&gt;, its network of services suddenly went offline. On Twitter, Facebook communications exec Andy Stone &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1445058088436908045"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, “We’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products. We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmqBiE"&gt;A peek at &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/facebook/"&gt;Down Detector&lt;/a&gt; (or your Twitter feed) reveals the problems are widespread. While it’s unclear exactly why the platforms are unreachable for so many people, their DNS records show that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702876/slack-is-down-outage-morning-disruption-work-chat"&gt;like last week’s Slack outage&lt;/a&gt;, the problem is apparently DNS (&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/WmRbmf5"&gt;it’s always DNS&lt;/a&gt;). Cloudflare senior vice president Dane Knecht &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dok2001/status/1445056572703625218"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s border gateway protocol routes — &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;BGP&lt;/a&gt; helps networks pick the best path to deliver internet traffic — have been “withdrawn from the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x5968t"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing Facebook app. We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;— Facebook App (@facebookapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/facebookapp/status/1445060225468297216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jijz8O"&gt;&lt;a href="http://Instagram.com"&gt;Instagram.com&lt;/a&gt; is flashing a 5xx Server Error message, while the Facebook site merely tells us that something went wrong. The problem also appears to be affecting its virtual reality arm, Oculus. Users can load games they already have installed and the browser works, but social features or installing new games does not. The outage is thorough enough that it’s affecting Workplace from Facebook customers and, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1445058298034614278?s=21"&gt;according to Jane Manchun Wong&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s internal sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgO9qf"&gt;There’s no word yet from Facebook about what may be causing the problem or when those sites, including Messenger and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1445060216161116168"&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;, will be operational again, but we will update this article with more information when it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix launches ‘Play Something’ for Android users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o1zLWLwHvMmE_E0gZ817eEfTT70=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948609/Play_Something_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jsdBgm"&gt;Netflix is officially bringing its shuffle feature to its Android mobile users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hB9wjV"&gt;The company originally began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407467/netflix-play-something-shuffle-feature-launch-tv-movie"&gt;testing the Play Something feature&lt;/a&gt; back in April, but it’s officially launching the feature globally on Android today. The tool — which lets Netflix choose something for you to watch — is now available on TV and Android mobile devices, but it’s not supported on iOS just yet. Netflix said that it will begin testing the shuffle function on iOS in the coming months, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFlB09"&gt;Separately, Netflix is also launching its Fast Laughs feature — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311418/netflix-tiktok-clips-funny-movies-tv-shows-streaming-big-mouth-seinfeld"&gt;rolled out on iOS&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year — on Android mobile devices today in select markets, including the US, Australia, Canada, Ireland, India, Malaysia, Philippines, and the UK. The tool works like a highlight reel of funny clips from its series and films. It’s a little like TikTok but specifically for Netflix funnies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ceVKgL"&gt;Lastly, Netflix said Monday that it’s bringing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295236/netflix-downloads-for-you-recomendations-streaming"&gt;Downloads for You&lt;/a&gt; tool to iOS in the coming month. Originally launched earlier this year on Android, the opt-in feature automatically downloads stuff to watch offline based on your viewing history. It’s a neat feature to have toggled on if, say, you plan to travel and don’t want to forget to download content for offline viewing before your trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bxju2m"&gt;The Play Something button launching today on Android, meanwhile, can be found on mobile devices on the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen or roughly around the 17th row on the homepage. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Google’s budget feature on Android so you don’t overspend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FbPOvwu5O66nh4k60ryUXgFZhbw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67661713/jbareham_181010_2989_0296.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qnCBiu"&gt;Google has provided a budgeting feature in its Play Store that allows Android users to establish a monthly maximum they want to spend on digital content. This applies to apps, games, movies, TV shows, music, ebooks, and so on. As you get close to reaching your budget limit, you’ll see an alert that you’re nearing it — or have gone over the amount you specified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrHNS5"&gt;You access it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qpmLYU"&gt;Open the Play Store on your Android device, tap on your personal icon on the upper right side, and select “Payments &amp;amp; subscriptions.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ibqrH5"&gt;From there, select “Budget &amp;amp; history.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BTRG2W"&gt;You’ll see the amount you spent during the current month. Choose the “Set budget” option and enter the amount you’re comfortable spending on your apps, music, movies, TV shows, and ebooks for a month. Then hit “Save.” Your budget can always be adjusted or removed altogether from this same screen. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Choose an amount for your budget." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/64XbKwh8Woe-_LFqcBHLDLzmxiw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899906/Screenshot_20211004_110750.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose an amount for your budget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can remove or edit the budget anytime." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L1vHScBBWTV_5EbRSt2fr3-XI8s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899908/Screenshot_20211004_110832.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can remove or edit the budget anytime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="biBi74"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/9281767?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=3364261"&gt;As Google notes&lt;/a&gt;, setting a budget won’t actually do anything to prevent purchases or subscriptions on your Google Play account once you’ve exceeded it. This feature is meant to be an easy reference for tracking your spending that you can take advantage of; it doesn’t implement hard restrictions like &lt;a href="https://families.google.com/familylink/"&gt;Google’s Family Link&lt;/a&gt; parental controls can. One other thing to know is that you can only set budgets using the currency of the country where your Google Play profile is linked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8WQRo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 20th, 2020, 2:37PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on April 17th, 2019, and has been updated to reflect the fact that the feature is available to all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eO4wzo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 2021, 11:25AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect changes in the Android interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volvo announces plans to go public in bid to accelerate shift to electric cars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fRGTR7LndinbJDayzQ5PJ4MSbro=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948413/ahawkins_201221_4352_6471.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LNSCwN"&gt;Volvo, the Swedish luxury car maker owned by China’s Geely, &lt;a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/287174/volvo-cars-announces-its-intention-to-launch-an-initial-public-offering-and-list-on-nasdaq-stockholm"&gt;announced its plan&lt;/a&gt; for an initial public offering as it seeks to raise more cash to accelerate its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308851/volvo-electric-cars-only-2030-online-sales"&gt;transition to a fully electric car company.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ir54Rk"&gt;The announcement follows the news last week that Polestar, the electric car company that is a joint venture between Volvo and Geely, would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696139/polestar-spac-public-value-ev-startup-volvo-geely"&gt;going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC&lt;/a&gt;. That deal values Polestar at roughly $20 billion, despite selling only two models — a hybrid luxury coupe and an all-electric fastback sedan. Volvo is choosing a more traditional route by proceeding with an IPO in Stockholm that could value the company at upwards of $25 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Deb6LN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Volvo said it aims to raise about 25 billion kronor, equivalent to $2.86 billion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XhJuqE"&gt;Volvo said it aims to raise about 25 billion kronor, equivalent to $2.86 billion, by issuing new shares. The aim is to use this money to speed up plans to phase out the sale of gas-powered cars in its bid to become an EV-only company by 2030. It also represents a dramatic comeback for Volvo, which was sold to Geely by a beleaguered Ford for just $1.8 billion in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zka7fx"&gt;Volvo launched its first fully electric car, the XC40 Recharge, last year. The SUV has a roughly 200-mile range and can charge its batteries to 80 percent capacity in 40 minutes. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195499/volvo-xc40-recharge-ev-suv-first-drive-specs-price"&gt;our time with the car&lt;/a&gt;, we found it to be an “impressive blend of Swedish ingenuity, crossover utility, and electric performance. The follow-up, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22307699/volvo-c40-recharge-electric-vehicle-ev-specs"&gt;C40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt;, will be available later this year, while an electric XC90 SUV won’t be revealed until 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8N0xTd"&gt;The listing would offer investors a chance to bet on the auto industry’s transition to fully electric vehicles at a time of rising concerns about tailpipe emissions and a crackdown by governments around the world on the production of gas cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8B3dmW"&gt;Geely, which is the largest privately owned automaker in China, will sell some of its shares in Volvo as part of the IPO, though it hasn’t said how many nor how it could affect the company’s overall stake in the automaker. Earlier this year, the company backed off a plan to fully merge Volvo with Geely’s auto division. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A surgically implanted brain stimulation device could help treat severe depression</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Deus Ex Brain" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qjmQVNESA4pogOKATHRzS9lwfSo=/0x2:640x429/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948357/Deus_Ex_brain.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WtvAn7"&gt;Sarah had no options left. Over five years, she’d tried every possible treatment for her severe depression, and nothing had helped. “My daily life had become so restricted and impoverished by depression that I felt tortured by each day,” the 36-year-old said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Yy6Nj"&gt;But after undergoing an experimental procedure that implanted a device into her brain, she felt her depression lift for the first time in years. “It was like my lens on the world changed,” Sarah, who is remaining anonymous because of the stigma around depression, said during a press briefing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBaWGC"&gt;Sarah was the patient in a proof-of-concept trial of a new approach to treating severe, treatment-resistant depression, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01480-w"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. The findings open up another possible strategy for helping people with the disorder. The study only involved Sarah, and it’s still not clear how well it might work in other people. The lessons from the trial, though, helped the researchers understand more about the nature of depression and could apply to other efforts to treat the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThGd44"&gt;“We identified through this trial some fundamental properties about the brain,” said study author Katherine Scangos, a psychiatrist at the University of California San Francisco Weill Institute for Neurosciences, during the press briefing. “We think these findings about the brain will be available for the general public, and will help us develop new personalized depression treatments.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zE6n4C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“depression is caused by faulty circuits”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ICyAE2"&gt;The trial used a technique called deep brain stimulation, where electrodes implanted within the brain deliver electrical impulses in an attempt to change or regulate abnormal brain activity. It’s common for conditions like epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. Research over the past decade has shown that it can sometimes help with depression, but the findings have been &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/zapping-peoples-brains-didnt-cure-their-depression-until-it-did/558032/"&gt;inconsistent&lt;/a&gt;. Most previous efforts delivered stimulation to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5871707/"&gt;individual regions&lt;/a&gt; of the brain thought to be involved in depression. This study, though, was targeted at regions that were part of specific brain &lt;em&gt;circuits &lt;/em&gt;— interconnected parts of the brain that are responsible for specific functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BjCE4s"&gt;“What we are increasingly realizing now is that depression is caused by faulty circuits,” Scangos says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuLzLq"&gt;In addition, the circuits involved might be different for each person. So in this trial, the study team personalized the treatment approach to the specific patient’s depression. They mapped out the type of brain activity that occurred when Sarah’s depression symptoms flared. Then, they surgically implanted a device that could detect that brain activity and send stimulation to the circuit where the activity was happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMbHqU"&gt;For Sarah, the procedure was highly effective. Her scores on depression rating scales dropped the morning after the device was turned on. And perhaps more importantly, she felt dramatic changes in her mood. During her first time getting the stimulation, she laughed out loud in the lab. “And everyone in the room went, ‘Oh my god,’ because that’s the first time I spontaneously laughed and smiled, where it wasn’t faked, in five years,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAgicW"&gt;Sarah’s depression circuit flares up hundreds of times a day, and each time, the implanted device delivers a brief stimulating pulse. In total, she gets around 30 minutes of stimulation each day, Scangos says. Sarah can’t feel the pulses, but she said she does have a general idea of when they’re happening throughout the day. “There’s a sense of alertness and energy or positivity that I’ll feel,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAferA"&gt;Despite the overwhelming success for Sarah, this trial was just a first demonstration of this approach. The device used in the trial isn’t authorized to treat depression — it was originally designed to treat epilepsy and was used in the trial under an investigational device exemption from the FDA. “We have a lot of work ahead of us as a field to validate this result to see if it’s actually something that will be enduring as a treatment option,” said Edward Chang, an author on the study and the chairman of the department of neurosurgery at UCSF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d1q15y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a lot of these approaches we consider a last resort”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DmX9bR"&gt;If it proves to work for other people, it would likely be used only after trying all other options, Chang says. Surgery — especially brain surgery — is always a risk. For patients with Parkinson’s and epilepsy, patients who go that route have generally tried every other treatment. “For now, a lot of these approaches we consider a last resort,” Chang said. It’s an expensive approach, as well — the device used in this study typically costs &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/11/16/245468383/new-medical-device-treats-epilepsy-with-a-well-timed-zap"&gt;between $35,000 and $40,000&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9PAaf"&gt;But even just this demonstration could help push our general understanding of depression forward. The team was able to identify circuitry in the brain involved in at least one person’s depressive symptoms, and that circuitry could be shared by other patients. Having foundational information about depression circuits could help develop non-surgical strategies that target similar areas. “Having this information and knowledge we think is going to go far beyond this application,” Chang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4C388"&gt;Sarah thinks her success could also help cut through some of the stigma around depression. Going through the study helped Sarah reframe her relationship with the disease, she said. For her whole life, she said she’d internalized some of the idea that she should be able to feel better if she picked herself up and tried hard enough. “We tried every treatment possible, and I had such a positive attitude through all of it, and none of it worked. And it just reinforced the depression, and made me feel like I was the world’s worst patient, and that was my own personal moral failing,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxsYFF"&gt;The trial changed that and helped the constant refrain from her doctors — that her depression was a disease in her brain — fully sink in. “By the end of this I went, ‘Oh my god, this is no different than someone with Parkinson’s,’” Sarah said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbWUnV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Music will launch free background listening starting in Canada</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hCS0PP8jNbuypyRbk4vOZm5qOas=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948062/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s4Gq5M"&gt;YouTube Music is lifting one of its most annoying limitations — but only in Canada. Today, YouTube announced that beginning November 3rd, customers in Canada will be able to continue listening to their music in the background while doing other tasks on their phone or when the screen is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RS57Pp"&gt;Background listening will support both the standard ad-supported, personalized radio mixes and any uploaded content you’ve added to your account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmqOhT"&gt;This is the first time that YouTube Music has offered the feature without requiring that customers step up to a Premium subscription to get it. As for when listeners in other countries can expect to get the same convenience, for now, YouTube is only saying to “stay tuned for additional information and expansion plans.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2L8hAg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Music lovers rejoice!  Background listening is coming to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/youtubemusic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@YouTubeMusic&lt;/a&gt; app, and    will be the first to enjoy this new feature starting Nov 3! Get radio-like listening with your screen off and don’t stop the music!     &lt;a href="https://t.co/GPwRMcVhp1"&gt;https://t.co/GPwRMcVhp1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google Canada (@googlecanada) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/googlecanada/status/1445025116614709255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WjtsgN"&gt;Free background listening is table stakes among YouTube Music’s competitors, including Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, Tidal, and others, so this is an area where YouTube lags its rivals. Hopefully, that expansion will get underway sooner than later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhDtOY"&gt;Even if background playback comes to the free tier, YouTube Music Premium still has other benefits: offline downloads is the big one, but you also get to listen without any ads and seamlessly switch between regular audio and music videos. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some must-have Nintendo Switch games are $20 off at several retailers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OP-wdeSftWgDpWegiGTX6IdzBPg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948046/MHRISE_Gathering_Hub_Canteen.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZlBczm"&gt;This is a big week for the Nintendo Switch. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22690483/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-oled-console-hands-on-preview"&gt;Switch with an OLED screen and &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; launch Friday, October 8th. Whether you’re a Switch veteran, or you’re prepping for your first console with the $350 OLED model, there are some excellent deals on must-have, cartridge-based titles you should know about. &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt; are each $20 off. Amazon is the only retailer honoring this deal for all three games, but Best Buy and Walmart are hosting some deals, too. &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; is $20 off, but only at GameStop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KSEqI"&gt;All of these are noteworthy deals because they’re rarely discounted games. Nintendo sometimes hosts price cuts, but only for a select batch of games — many of which have been available since the Switch launched a handful of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MRMOxx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10660223"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="MDXV7k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10241211"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6aOgty"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10283625"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="0EdGQj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10415477"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ga2waH"&gt;Outside of Nintendo’s world, the Apple AirPods Pro are back down to one of their lowest prices yet. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling these wireless earbuds for $179&lt;/a&gt;, down from their normal $249 price. It’s not tough to find a decent deal on this model, but it rarely goes below this price point, outside of Black Friday, at least. In case you didn’t know, these high-end AirPods have active noise cancellation, excellent sound quality, and their case can charge via Lightning or wirelessly on a Qi charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4EcugC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wEebVp"&gt;If over-ear headphones are more your style, the Beats Studio 3 noise-canceling headphones in a few colorways are steeply discounted at Amazon. Originally $350, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio3-Wireless-Over%E2%80%91Ear-Headphones/dp/B085296FLT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some of the color options are available today for $170&lt;/a&gt;. This model released in 2017, and just like the first AirPods, they feature the W1 wireless chip that makes connecting to (and switching between) Apple devices a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="meveVx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10521384"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin is officially sending William Shatner to space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PM Jacinda Ardern Attends Rocket Lab Factory Opening" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BtEUPDmUVwJsNb1MGWyuV82mMOA=/0x0:4861x3241/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69947827/1051924568.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Phil Walter/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="to6ga4"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ spaceflight venture &lt;a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/shatner-powers-announced-ns18"&gt;Blue Origin is launching William Shatner&lt;/a&gt; — aka Captain James T. Kirk of the USS Enterprise — to space on the company’s New Shepard rocket. At 90 years old, he’ll become the oldest person to fly to space, surpassing legendary aviator Wally Funk, who flew on the first crewed flight of New Shepard this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCuLy0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/09/24/william-shatner-going-space-jeff-bezos-blue-origin/"&gt;TMZ first broke the news&lt;/a&gt; that Shatner would be flying on the next New Shepard flight, which is currently scheduled for October 12th out of Blue Origin’s launch facility in West Texas. The outlet claimed the Shatner’s flight will be filmed as part of a documentary. Shatner will be joined by two other customers announced earlier by Blue Origin: Chris Boshuizen, a former NASA engineer who co-founded the small satellite company Planet Labs, and Glen de Vries, the co-founder of software company Medidata and vice chair of life sciences at Dassault Systèmes, a French software company. Blue Origin also announced today that Audrey Powers, the company’s vice president of mission and flight operations, will become the fourth passenger on the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kMrue4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At 90 years old, he’ll become the oldest person to fly to space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bphwRI"&gt;This will be the second flight of New Shepard to carry people to the edge of space and back, as Blue Origin transitions into regular commercial flights of its suborbital rocket. After many years of test flights, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;the vehicle carried its first humans to space in July&lt;/a&gt; — a crew that consisted of Funk, Jeff Bezos, his brother Mark Bezos, and a Dutch teenager named Oliver Daemen, whose father paid an undisclosed sum for the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="se60iH"&gt;The New Shepard rocket is designed to launch vertically from Earth, carrying up to four passengers in a crew capsule on top. It then climbs above an altitude of roughly 62 miles (100 kilometers) over the Earth, where the planet’s thin atmosphere gives way to the vacuum of space. While in the sky, the capsule and the rocket separate, and the passengers inside feel a few brief minutes of weightlessness. Both parts of the vehicle fall back to Earth; the rocket lands upright after reigniting its main engine and the capsule lands under three main parachutes. All in all, the flight lasts about 11 minutes, from liftoff to capsule touchdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yfrsz"&gt;Shatner’s announcement comes just a few days after current and former employees at Blue Origin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702335/jeff-bezos-employees-essay-blue-origin-toxic-workplace"&gt;published a public essay alleging systemic sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt; and an unsafe work culture at the company. The essay claimed that at least one major executive had sexually harassed employees before getting fired for groping a female worker. The employees also expressed concern over the safety of Blue Origin’s New Shepard vehicle, citing a culture where competition was prioritized over safety, in which workers feared retaliation for raising concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VbWWe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 7 launches October 15th, preorders begin on Friday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VYJLsuxRPAJ9WlsPRgRLGPEsDnw=/0x47:1960x1354/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69947813/Apple_watch_series7_availability_hero_10052021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 includes a bigger display.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DEXMH2"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-watch-series-7-orders-start-friday-october-8/"&gt;is opening up preorders&lt;/a&gt; for its Apple Watch Series 7 on Friday, October 8th, with the devices set to ship on October 15th. Apple first revealed the Watch Series 7 at an event last month, but the company simply said it would be available later this fall. Preorders for the Apple Watch Series 7 will now begin at 5AM PT / 8AM ET on Friday, October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U4rsJI"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 includes a display&lt;/a&gt; that goes virtually to the edge of the case, with more rounded corners and a softer design. The Series 7 now comes in 41mm and 45mm sizes, up 1mm from the Series 6. The bezels around the display are just 1.7mm, and the always-on mode is 70 percent brighter than the Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rh_93UzApG97WIOiYk9nH-h8KZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899644/Apple_watch_series7_availability_contour_face_10052021.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new Contour watchface for the Watch Series 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CqsEmC"&gt;Apple has also created a variety of new watchfaces to take advantage of the larger screens on the Apple Watch Series 7. An improved modular watchface lets you view activity ring details alongside the regular complications found on the regular modular watchface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCCHDc"&gt;The screen size is really the big change to the Apple Watch Series 7, alongside watchOS 8 improvements like better outdoor cycling support, fall support in workouts, and some Fitness Plus upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NqShL"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 will start at $399 and will be sold alongside the Watch Series 3 at $199. If you buy a Watch equipped with cellular service, whether through Apple.com or directly from a carrier, there’s also a $100 rebate available after activation with T-Mobile/Sprint or Verizon. Preorders for the Apple Watch Series 7 start on October 8th, and devices will start shipping on October 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zALDC9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 10:45AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information regarding cellular activation and rebates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
