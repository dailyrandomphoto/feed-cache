    <title>The Verge’s favorite gaming gear</title>

  &lt;p id="31aGqn"&gt;Gaming was already popular when the pandemic hit in early 2020; with a large number of people stuck at home, it has become close to a national obsession. So once you have your console or computer, and your game (or games), what more do you need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hwAr5"&gt;We asked the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, many of whom are avid gamers, to talk about their favorite gaming gear. Below, we describe game controllers, mice, headsets, and other useful peripherals that can take your gaming experience up that extra notch (or even several notches). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtYStr"&gt;Have a great time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vp3y6a"&gt;Nintendo Switch Pro Controller &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo Switch Pro Controller  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oKuLZC"&gt;If you have a non-Lite Nintendo Switch, the Pro Controller is a necessary accessory, in my opinion. Although the regular Switch comes with two Joy-Con controllers, they’re small and not particularly ergonomic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PDoDE"&gt;The Pro Controller, on the other hand, feels great to hold and has held up for me over hours of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, &lt;/em&gt;and many other games. It’s not cheap, but it’s worth every penny. &lt;em&gt;— Jay Peters, news writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Y6b3or"&gt;Logitech G502 Hero gaming mouse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logitech G502 Hero &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jprll9"&gt;What can I say about the Logitech G502 line that has not already been said? My colleague, Cameron Faulkner, thinks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;it’s the best and most affordable wired take on the best gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now — and rightfully so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuuk3F"&gt;I play a ton of first-person shooters on my gaming PC, so when I was in the market for a new gaming mouse (I previously used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18168210/corsair-gaming-mouse-50m-clicks-omron-switch-m65-rgb-elite-ironclaw-ces-2019"&gt;Corsair’s M65 RGB Elite&lt;/a&gt;), I wanted something that had a good amount of programmable buttons — including one on the mouse’s left-hand side — as easy shortcuts for when I needed to aim my weapons quickly. Now, each macro is assigned to a conveniently placed button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seNQk1"&gt;I have used a good number of gaming mice before switching to the G502 Hero, and I honestly do not think any other gaming mouse will replace it. I might buy the wireless version at some point to minimize cable management, but at $50, the G502 Hero is a great gaming mouse for people who prefer wired gaming mice or who don’t have a ton of money to splurge on its wireless counterpart. &lt;em&gt;— Taylor Lyles, writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="pdUmcj"&gt;Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kO-l63-uXPjtpLTlYl9VxtB8xhc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253622/xbox_360_wireless_receiver.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ePHT3"&gt;Fifteen years ago, Microsoft released the best dongle ever made, one that I still use every single week. It’s an unconscionably long, six-foot USB cable with a little pod on the end that, uh, always reminds me of &lt;a href="http://bobcanada92.blogspot.com/2012/04/alien-porn.html"&gt;a Centauri tentacle&lt;/a&gt;. But this dongle is worth a little cringe: it lets me reliably connect four Xbox 360 wireless controllers to a Windows PC to play a wide array of games from across the room, and thanks to continued plug-and-play Windows functionality and robust Steam support, every game designed for controllers works perfectly with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Efufhu"&gt;It’s an amazingly stable, inexpensive way to get four-player couch games (like &lt;em&gt;Duck Game&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; SpeedRunners&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; TowerFall&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Overcooked!&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Spelunky&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Lance A Lot&lt;/em&gt;, etc.) up and running quickly, particularly since Xbox 360 wireless controllers are cheap and easy to obtain. I wish I could say the same for the adapter itself; some of the third-party knockoffs have compatibility issues, and tracking down the original might mean a visit to eBay. That’s how I bought one for a buddy this past holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsLdzG"&gt;If you do find an official one that doesn’t light up, don’t throw it out! If you’re handy with a soldering iron, it’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FMicrosoft%2BXbox%2B360%2BWireless%2BGaming%2BReceiver%2Bfuse%2Breplacement%2F118338&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22244488%2Fgaming-gear-recommendations-favorite-nintendo-logitech-microsoft#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pretty easy to replace (or even short)&lt;/a&gt; the burnt-out fuse. &lt;em&gt;— Sean Hollister, senior news editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TMDuYf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10298131" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"buttons_only"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xckdO4"&gt;SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless gaming headset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GzsMa8"&gt;If you’re willing to pay a premium, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better wireless gaming headset than the Arctis Pro Wireless. In 2018, I pitted it against &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1YZ4lqpnYIHhoy8IXDHhJMZRXGXcYujI5O1yYFHZcQsE/edit?usp=drive_web&amp;amp;ouid=117898641365769640880"&gt;every single one of its competitors&lt;/a&gt; and it got top marks for sound quality, mic quality, wireless range, battery life, and an array of unusually handy features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZgsmo"&gt;If I’m gaming with buddies and want a snack, I don’t need to stop chatting — I just walk several rooms away to the kitchen and the audio never cuts out. When a too-loud game drowns out my friends, I tap the dial beneath the ear cup to rebalance the audio between “game” and “chat” — it gives you two different audio devices in Windows. When the battery runs out, I can just pop a spare battery pack out of the base station and swap it in under 15 seconds. I make a lot of calls with the Arctis Pro Wireless, too, thanks to its built-in Bluetooth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKeD60"&gt;Just know it’s a little pinch-y on big heads, despite having the fabric band suspension design that makes a lot of SteelSeries’ other headsets comfortable. And be careful not to try to bend it wider using the ear cups; quite a few buyers have found the joints can snap if you apply too much force. &lt;em&gt;— Sean Hollister&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="a9UoK3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10298165" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"buttons_only"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="65YXoA"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GGXIgj"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus Quest 2 with Elite Strap" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IU-29DSpjtWyGdX4PtLf-9oAt78=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21885198/Quest_2_with_Elite_Strap_accessory.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BVq5nf"&gt;I love my Oculus Quest 2, but I’m not exaggerating when I say I find it almost unusable out of the box. The flimsy stock strap barely fits my head and makes the headset feel incredibly front-heavy, while the foam face pad gets hot and uncomfortable quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhjt0V"&gt;Fortunately, there are good solutions to both problems. Oculus sells an official Elite Strap for the Quest 2 for $49, which suggests the company itself knows the stock option isn’t great, and indeed it’s a huge improvement. It’s much sturdier, with a plastic back plate that better distributes weight and tightens around your head with an easily adjustable dial. There were reported issues with some early units cracking, but I haven’t had a problem with mine, and Oculus has addressed the issue with replacements and extended warranties, so I definitely recommend it. &lt;em&gt; — Sam Byford, Asia editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G4rLzw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10298202" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"buttons_only"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VWr4NY"&gt;VR Cover silicone cover for Oculus Quest 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;VR Cover silicone cover for Oculus Quest 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PC3cGq"&gt;The next way to upgrade your Quest 2 experience is with a simple piece of rubber. Various companies sell alternative face pad covers, and the one I’ve been using is the Quest 2 silicone option from VR Cover. I used swappable cloth versions from VR Cover with the original Quest, which was still an improvement over the stock foam, but I like the hypoallergenic silicone even better. It attaches to the Quest 2 easily and is much more comfortable to have pressed against your face for hours than clammy foam; plus, you can rinse it down easily after a hardcore &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; session. I don’t know why something like this doesn’t come in the box, but it’s absolutely worth the $14. &lt;em&gt;— Sam Byford&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="skT7xJ"&gt;This is a great accessory for anyone who wants to play emulated Wii games on their PC. It’s like the one that the Nintendo Wii console used to have, but offers Bluetooth to connect your Wii Remotes as well. I bought one of these for my own PC so I could use it to emulate Wii games — and hopefully get around to completing &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime 3&lt;/em&gt; one of these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbkKhK"&gt;Just remember that you’ll also need to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mribo-Wii-Controller-Replacement-Silicone/dp/B07F5FS4ST?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=e0bf60dc889adfb6fff9c4f8aa209fd1&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab a Wii Remote separately&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t already have one. &lt;em&gt;— Jon Porter, reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rIc0nE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"&gt;You’ve heard all the hype&lt;/a&gt; about the DualSense’s vibration motors and adaptive triggers. And to be sure, those things are awesome for the games that use them, but they aren’t what make the DualSense my favorite controller of those I’ve ever used. It’s that it has &lt;em&gt;everything &lt;/em&gt;a modern controller needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKcOhJ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21361885/sony-ps4-dualshock-4-colors-return-on-sale-august-berry-blue-red-ramouflage"&gt;DualShock 4&lt;/a&gt; had a headphone jack, but also the terrible micro-USB. The Switch Pro Controller has USB-C, but it’s a bit small for my tastes and doesn’t have a headphone jack. The DualSense has both USB-C and a headphone jack, and that’s just such a quality-of-life improvement. When I need to charge it, I grab my laptop charger, and when I want to keep the noise to myself, I grab my headphones. There’s no friction between me and playing whatever game I want to play. &lt;em&gt;— Mitchell Clark, news writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z8hn4F"&gt;It can be a real hassle to find the right gaming headset — one that’s both comfortable and compatible with most (or ideally, all) of your consoles. Few wireless solutions can do it all, but I really love using Creative’s BT-W3 USB-C Bluetooth receiver. It can pair to Bluetooth headphones you already own, making it a crafty and budget-minded purchase at around $40. It works seamlessly with PS5 and Nintendo Switch, and its USB-C-to-A adapter allows it to work perfectly on PC. Better yet, this dongle can toggle between low-latency and high-quality codecs with a push of a button, and it ships with a 3.5mm microphone that you can plug into your controller to chat with friends. &lt;em&gt;— Cameron Faulkner, writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RHFRAz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10304160" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"buttons_only"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lmz0T5"&gt;HyperX QuadCast &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HyperX QuadCast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FiVKfZ"&gt;I like to have the best audio possible, especially playing multiplayer games like &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Tom Clancy’s The Division 2&lt;/em&gt;. Because gaming headset mics will only do so much, I wanted a separate mic for audio output. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572162/remote-work-desk-home-set-up-writer-gamer-logitech-asus"&gt;Like I’ve mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;, that’s why I chose the QuadCast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seFRLc"&gt;At $140, it gives me great clarity when speaking, easy-to-use controls, and a shock mount adapter for boom arms. I also enjoy that the mute button is on top of the microphone. It might be unconventional, yet it’s conveniently placed if you’re using a boom arm, and it makes it easy to mute myself. It also comes with a three-meter cable; I find it annoying that some companies like Blue give you a too-short cable with their pricey USB mics. — &lt;em&gt;Taylor Lyles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PqnKbn"&gt;Here’s a slightly unconventional entry that has significantly improved my quality of life, so I want to share it with everyone here: a full-motion TV mount. Recently, I moved to a new, much smaller apartment. I had to find ways to maximize my space and, all joking aside, fit my rather large PS5 someplace. This is where the Echogear mount comes into play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxv9sQ"&gt;The model that I got is incredibly well built and strong enough to hold TVs up to 125lbs or 86 inches diagonally. With my 55-inch LG CX, it’s smooth to operate, and I can move it around as needed to find the perfect angle — which I do, because another downside of my new place is that the windows are right across from the TV. I never thought I’d get so much use out of a TV wall mount. Plus, TVs look super nice mounted on the wall and it’s a fun little home improvement project. Just don’t try to do it all by yourself. — &lt;em&gt;Vjeran Pavic, senior video director&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="uSwV6h"&gt;I’m not a huge fan of flight simulators and couldn’t justify spending hundreds of dollars on a full &lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=HOTAS"&gt;HOTAS&lt;/a&gt; kit. But when I heard &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt; was coming out on PC, I couldn’t limit myself to playing on a keyboard or gamepad. I love &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and wanted to ensure that I could recreate the experience of flying an X-Wing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjMjOU"&gt;I found the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick on sale, and it’s truly one of the best gaming peripheral purchases I’ve made. It features 12 programmable buttons, an eight-way hat switch, and a nice hand grip for people who use their right hand while playing games. If you’re like me and only need it for a few titles, you can’t go wrong with this flight stick. — &lt;em&gt;Taylor Lyles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boston Dynamics’ Spot adds self-charging to live at remote sites forever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dlJ92bV2exgBjx0Y72ePnykBDNQ=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756019/Arm_Industrial_Drag_Hose_Credit_to_Boston_Dynamics.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boston Dynamics will sell an arm to allow the robot to interact with objects in its environment.&lt;/em&gt; | Image; Boston Dynamics&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There’s also new browser based controls and a robotic arm attachment&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1V8YzS"&gt;Boston Dynamics’ robotic dog, Spot, is getting a lot more self-sufficient. Today the company is announcing Spot Enterprise, a new version of the robot that features a charging stand to top-up its batteries without any human interaction. The robotics company is also announcing Scout, a new browser-based control system that offers a streamlined interface for piloting Spot over the internet, as well as a new robotic arm to help the robot “grasp, lift, carry, place, and drag a wide variety of objects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U97MgU"&gt;The new features follow Boston Dynamics’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292684/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-on-sale-price"&gt;announcement last June&lt;/a&gt; that it was making the Spot Explorer robot available to any company that could afford its $74,500 price tag. The way Boston Dynamics describes it, today’s announcements are a response to the kinds of features Spot’s early buyers have been asking for. The company says there are currently over 400 Spot robots out in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zNfv9B"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Boston Dynamics Spot Enterprise with Spot Arm|100522" data-volume-uuid="3c38f540b" data-volume-id="100522" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-720" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RdxZut"&gt;“Customers in a lot of industries have sites with important equipment that are largely unstaffed, and it could take hours to dispatch someone to go check on something relatively simple,” Spot’s chief engineer Zack Jackowski tells me over a video call. “What they want to do is to put a Spot there permanently. That way, the person who is attached to follow up on an alarm going off or a routine inspection can just dial into a robot, stand up, and go take a look around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OrHcEQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Just dial into a robot, stand up, and go take a look around”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6mYTwc"&gt;Boston Dynamics’ web-based Scout software is part of its attempt to streamline remote control. For now, it mostly turns Spot into an expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/26/8294855/telepresence-robots-double-robotics-remote-skype-office"&gt;telepresence robot&lt;/a&gt;. Boston Dynamics tells me its new arm doesn’t work with its web-based software yet, making Spot better suited to inspecting and photographing an environment rather than physically interacting with it. Once the robotic arm is integrated with Scout, however, the robot should be able to do things like operate valves, pull levers, or turn handles, while its operator sits hundreds or even thousands of miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qt7YAf"&gt;Scout works with the company’s existing Spot Explorer, as well as the new Spot Enterprise robots. Although the new robot also features other upgrades like a more powerful CPU designed to run more advanced autonomy algorithms in the future, its self-charging capabilities are the major new feature. While the current Spot Explorer has around 90 minutes of battery life, the new Spot Enterprise can live on a remote site with a charging station “indefinitely.” When combined with Scout, the hope is that businesses can use Spot as an alternative to dispatching personnel to remote sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BK_vi0KtypUBESHj32OlAfa1-sY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275356/Enterprise_Industrial._Credit_to_Boston_Dynamicsjpg.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Boston Dynamics&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spot finds its charging station using the QR code-style “fiducial marker” you can see behind its hind legs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NrNOHY"&gt;The charging station works using “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiducial_marker#:~:text=A%20fiducial%20marker%20or%20fiducial,reticle%20of%20an%20optical%20instrument."&gt;fiducial markers&lt;/a&gt;,” small QR-code-like pictures that Spot’s cameras can identify and use to navigate. Once it’s close enough to the charging station to see its marker, Spot is able to position and lower itself so it comes into contact with the charging connectors on the stand. The stand also includes a hardwired internet connection, which makes it quicker and more reliable to upload sensor data gathered by Spot during its travels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8QTwg"&gt;Scout needs to work over slow internet connections because Spot is designed to be deployed in remote locations like offshore oil fields or underground mines. Jackowski estimates that controlling Spot only needs a “couple of megabits” of internet bandwidth (for reference, Netflix currently recommends &lt;a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306"&gt;3 Mbps of bandwidth&lt;/a&gt; for streaming in SD). This low bandwidth requirement is achieved by doing as much of the heavy processing onsite as possible, so Spot isn’t reliant on an internet connection to get around. The system relies on a Boston Dynamics server installed on the same local network as the robot to process and compress Spot’s data before sending it over the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qxVps_FPQJZ0VW30nnJtkNneFdw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275361/Scout_workfromhome_Credit_to_Boston_Dynamics.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Boston Dynamics&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scout’s interface shows a live video feed from the robot, alongside a series of simple controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UkRlrq"&gt;It’s been possible to control Spot over the internet before now. Companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267379/robot-dog-rocos-boston-dynamics-video-spot-shepherd-reaction"&gt;Rocos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/i-walked-the-boston-dynamics-spot-robot-dog-remotely-and-only-crashed-once-formant/"&gt;Formant&lt;/a&gt; have offered third-party control tools, and Boston Dynamics itself has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292684/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-on-sale-price#H9wpJb:~:text=One%20feature%20that%20Boston%20Dynamics%20is,assault%20course%20in%20the%20company%E2%80%99s%20headquarters."&gt;demonstrated software&lt;/a&gt; that it said would let potential Spot customers remotely test drive the robot around an assault course in its headquarters. But Scout is the company’s first streamlined, web-based software for controlling its robots, and customers will be able to use it to control their robots regardless of where they may be in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="07q2G4"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6DdxYD"&gt;To show off the software, Boston Dynamics let me take one of their new Spot Enterprise robots for a spin, giving me control of the robot in their Waltham, MA lab from my apartment in London over 3,000 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0Gxe8"&gt;It will not surprise you to learn that using Scout to pilot Spot through my browser was a laggy experience — nevertheless, it was still manageable. I could either control the robot like an action video game with my WASD keys (Jackowski tells me a game controller paired to my PC would have also worked), or via a point-and-click control scheme that’s not unlike what you’d find in a classic adventure game. You click on a point in the environment, and Spot walks to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7s0YyG"&gt;Controlling Spot felt like playing a low-resolution video game via a laggy streaming service. There was a significant delay between me pressing a button and the robot responding, and I’d probably have been constantly crashing into things were it not for Spot’s built-in obstacle avoidance technology. It felt like playing a game with assists like invisible walls turned on. I’d click a patch of ground behind a traffic cone, and Spot would walk to it while avoiding the cone. I directed the robot up a set of narrow stairs, and Spot walked up them while keeping itself away from the sides. There’s even an especially video game-like third-person view that uses the robot’s sensors to show its position in a virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MdP3r8E9zrHrtjNo02ONygfVQsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275364/msedge_TQcpzz2aQT.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Boston Dynamics / Scout&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scout can use the robot’s sensors to show the robot in a video game-like third-person view. Click in the environment to have Spot move to that point. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I6uVGj"&gt;It’s also possible to cede control to the robot completely in cases where it’s patrolling the same route every time. This can be pre-programmed by Spot’s operator, and the robot can be set to dock and charge itself between patrols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQP0VW"&gt;Remote control like this carries its risks. Boston Dynamics set up its demonstration to let me log into the control interface for the robot without a username or password, simply by following a link sent to me by the team. But in the real word Jackowski tells me there’ll be a lot more security around the 70-pound plus robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fqs1DX"&gt;“We’ve implemented best practices for security at every layer in the system,” Jackowski says. “The robot and the server both practice full data encryption both in transit and at rest,” and Boston Dynamics uses “standard battle hardened web protocol technologies.” He adds that all the equipment in use is taken through a security audit by a third-party company, and said he expects most customers to use VPNs to add a further layer of protection to the connection between an operator’s local system and the robot’s remote site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eZon7iG28j40DfaaE3L7zyW3Tgg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275366/msedge_vEKkzE7Qvo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Boston Dynamics / Scout&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The video feed is laggy and low-res, but the robot’s obstacle avoidance makes it manageable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="eNd4R8"&gt;Beyond Spot Enterprise and Scout, Boston Dynamics is also announcing the release of the Spot Arm, a robotic limb that attaches to the head of the robot that can do things like “close valves, pull levers and turn handles and knobs.” It’s functionally similar to what Boston Dynamics showed off in previous viral videos, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/2/20/17033982/boston-dynamics-spotmini-door-opening-video-interrupt-test"&gt;this one from 2018&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s more robustly designed and ready to be used in the real world. Jackowski tells me the team has integrated the arm with Spot’s existing controls, and has pre-programmed it with certain actions like being able to open a door or turn a valve. It’s not yet compatible with Scout, but that’s apparently in the works for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzCp7c"&gt;While he wouldn’t say exactly how much the new Spot Enterprise will cost, Jackowski admitted it’ll be more expensive than the existing $74,500 Spot (which Boston Dynamics plans to continue to sell). Meanwhile, the robotic arm will also be made available to owners of existing Spot robots, so long as they’re prepared to send their devices in to Boston Dynamics to have it professionally fitted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOI4Qe"&gt;Boston Dynamics recently made headlines after automaker Hyundai acquired a controlling stake in the company in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22167835/hyundai-boston-dynamics-aquisition-consumer-robotics"&gt;deal that valued it at $1.1 billion&lt;/a&gt;. When I asked about the deal, Jackowski said that it hadn’t resulted in any change in direction for the team, and said they were excited to benefit from Hyundai’s extensive manufacturing supply chains and expertise. Even before the deal was announced, however, it’s clear Boston Dynamics has progressed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/14/5209622/google-has-bought-robotics-company-boston-dynamics"&gt;beyond moonshots&lt;/a&gt; and entered a far more practical phase of its life, allowing any company with the cash to buy its robots for use in the real-world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOVhOH"&gt;But that doesn’t mean its R&amp;amp;D work is at any risk of slowing down. Selling each new product means getting feedback from real-world customers about what the company needs to work on next. That feedback loop will only intensify with the release of the Spot Arm. “We have some ideas for how folks are going to use it, but they’re gonna come back to us really quickly and say no no you didn’t quite get it totally right,” Jackowski predicts. “Let us tell you what’s gonna make this really valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="PITNFX"&gt;“When we introduce this arm, it’s gonna be like the original Spot again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCTR4j"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kuo adds fuel to Apple-Hyundai electric car rumors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yXrYCDYdYJOibfhFi9yCpFUPQtQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68755612/akrales_180329_2351_1027.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eC4sUl"&gt;TF Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo has corroborated reports that Apple and Hyundai are working together on an electric car. In a research note quoted &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/02/kuo-apple-car-to-use-hyundais-e-gmp-platform-gm-and-psa-eye-partnerships"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Kuo says that Apple’s first car will be based on Hyundai’s E-GMP platform for battery-powered electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1KbDg"&gt;The E-GMP platform was &lt;a href="https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/company/newsroom/-0000016584"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; late last year and is expected to be the basis for Hyundai’s electric cars from this year on. Hyundai claims that E-GMP vehicles can theoretically get over 500km (310 miles) in range on a full charge, with the battery able to reach 80 percent capacity in 18 minutes via fast charging — though individual vehicle performance would of course vary based on design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDVpEd"&gt;Kuo claims that the first Apple car will be produced together with Hyundai, but other vehicles involving collaboration with GM and PSA are also a possibility, and Apple will have to make use of automotive partners’ supply chain resources. Hyundai is said to be “taking the lead in component design and production” on the first car, while its smaller subsidiary Kia will be responsible for producing vehicles in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lc0qo3CAP7zdx8V8Gdw61rQRvIU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275313/csm_hyundai_ev_platform_e_gmp_01_e2e_0eaf8b99a1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyundai’s E-GMP electric vehicle platform.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fGsiK8"&gt;Last month Hyundai confirmed local reports that it was in talks with Apple before &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/hyundai-shares-jump-most-since-1988-after-report-on-apple-tie-up"&gt;walking back its statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ve been receiving requests for potential cooperation from various companies regarding development of autonomous EVs,” read the statement’s final version. “No decisions have been made as discussions are in early stage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzLZkb"&gt;Reuters &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-tech-apple-hyundai-motor-focus/hyundai-wrestles-with-the-risks-of-embracing-apple-idUSKBN29Y0FU"&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that Hyundai leadership was “divided” on the prospect of an Apple partnership. “We are agonizing over how to do it, whether it is good to do it or not,” an unnamed executive was quoted as saying. “We are not a company which manufactures cars for others. It is not like working with Apple would always produce great results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmWCNm"&gt;Kuo believes that the earliest possible date for an Apple car to hit the market is 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Control’s next-gen update feels right at home on the PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GW6mxNJJcaC99ZyBKbrZj0F5P0I=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68755568/Control_Ultimate_Edition_20210128152912.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p6tRZJ"&gt;Remedy’s supernatural thriller &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; was one of the best games on the previous generation of consoles, but it’s also one that clearly struggled on the hardware. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;when I reviewed the game on a base model PS4&lt;/a&gt;, you could feel the action chug along when the action got too intense. It worked, but just barely. (I don’t think any game has made my PS4’s fan quite so loud.) We already know that one of the best things about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X is that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;they make older games better&lt;/a&gt;, whether that’s through backward compatibility or, in the case of next-gen &lt;em&gt;Control: Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt;, brand-new versions that make use of the hardware. And now that I’ve spent a few hours with &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;on the PS5, I can say it really feels like the ideal way to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZgLJ1"&gt;The most obvious improvements are the expected ones. As with many XSX and PS5 games, the new version of &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;offers two modes: one focused on performance, the other visuals. In the former, the game runs at a constant 60fps, which makes a big difference. &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; is an action game about constantly moving: you use a combination of telekinetic powers and a shape-shifting gun to take out enemies, but sit still too long, and you’ll be overwhelmed. This makes speed essential. When the game stutters during a big shootout, even a little bit, it can really interrupt your flow. That doesn’t happen on the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jj9yL5"&gt;The other mode lowers the frame rate to 30fps but turns on high-end graphical features like ray-tracing. &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;’s setting is dark and gloomy, but there are lots of shiny surfaces, like marble flooring or underground puddles, where you can see the more realistic reflections. It looks great and adds more depth and texture to the world, especially because it’s typically so dark. But having the game at 60fps is my preference. It makes the game’s incredible combat just that much better. 30fps is still playable, but it can be hard to go back once you’ve played at a higher frame rate. (For a more technical breakdown, be sure to check out &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-control-ultimate-edition-next-gen-upgrade"&gt;this analysis over at Digital Foundry&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P8t8jL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10314388"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EnIhvt"&gt;The PS5 version also goes an extra step and makes use of the DualSense controller as well. Much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"&gt;games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the triggers now provide a bit of resistance when you fire your weapon. It sounds small, but it does help make the act of firing virtual bullets just a bit more satisfying. &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; is also one of the few non-Sony developed titles to make great use of the controller’s more subtle haptic vibrations. You can feel small footsteps as you wander around the creepy office, and it’s especially fun when you start using flying around tossing around objects with your mind. You can feel all that tension in your palms. Combined with the better frame rate, it makes &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;’s many lengthy battles much more thrilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQMKf3"&gt;Of course, all of this comes with a caveat. While you can play your current version of &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; on a new console through backward compatibility, to get all of the next-gen benefits you’ll have to purchase a brand-new copy for PS5 or XSX. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21377148/control-remedy-505-games-developer-next-gen-upgrade-ultimate-edition"&gt;no free upgrade path&lt;/a&gt; for existing users. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252475/control-free-date-ps-plus-playstation-ps5-ultimate-edition"&gt;Though there’s a slight workaround if you’re a PlayStation Plus subscriber&lt;/a&gt;.) Because of this, you also can’t use your existing save file with the next-gen versions. Basically, if you want to enjoy &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; on your shiny new console, you’ll need to buy a new copy and start the game over from scratch. This is the best version of &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; — but it’s up to you whether that’s worth the hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The tall lady in Resident Evil Village is taller than the tallest recorded human</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/glXS_dLwjLtR3BVs0Jo7kbvlaHI=/85x0:1003x612/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68754818/RE_Featured_Image.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lady Dimitrescu.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/01/21/resident-evil-village-maiden-demo-hits-ps5-today/" target="_blank"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FpjyoF"&gt;If you’ve been following recent news about &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village, &lt;/em&gt;the next game in the hit horror video game franchise, you may have heard about Lady Dimitrescu, a very tall woman / probably-vampire who has become &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/15/22233028/resident-evil-village-capcom-preview-fans-love-big-vampire-lady"&gt;very popular&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SATMAu"&gt;Seriously, she’s tall — just look at &lt;a href="https://gfycat.com/blindperiodichylaeosaurus"&gt;this GIF&lt;/a&gt; from Sony. Lady Dimitrescu towers over the other women / probably-vampires in this scene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tu7A9A"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 44px;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/blindperiodichylaeosaurus" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DZYBmX"&gt;A lot of people have wondered &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; how tall Lady Dimitrescu is, apparently, and &lt;em&gt;Kotaku’s&lt;/em&gt; Ash Parrish even went to great lengths to estimate that Lady Dimitrescu &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/i-figured-out-how-tall-the-sexy-resident-evil-lady-is-b-1846111780"&gt;is 96 inches tall (8 feet)&lt;/a&gt;. On Monday evening, though, the official Resident Evil Twitter account revealed that Parrish wasn’t even close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTwAHX"&gt;If you include her hat and high heels, Lady Dimitrescu officially stands at a giant 2.9 meters tall, which equates to a height of approximately 9 feet and 6 inches, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1356391885816823808"&gt;Tomonori Takano, &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village’s&lt;/em&gt; art director&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WitoyS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Your love for Lady Dimitrescu is loud and clear.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's a message from our RE Village art director Tomonori Takano, along with a very curious fact you may have wondered about: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Lj4m5pN2dJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Lj4m5pN2dJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1356391885816823808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5mYtfJ"&gt;That sounds terrifyingly tall to me — I’m nearly six feet tall, so I’d crane my neck trying to look her in the eye. (I guess that’s the perfect way to get me to expose my neck so she can chomp down on my jugular.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4p4N1T"&gt;But myself and a few of my colleagues wanted to get a better idea of just how tall that really is. Here are just a few comparisons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="j5bSjy"&gt;Lady Dimitrescu could easily slam dunk on Robert Wadlow, who holds the Guinness World Record for being the &lt;a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/tallest-man-ever/"&gt;tallest man ever&lt;/a&gt; at 8 feet and 11 inches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="k1ckq0"&gt;She’d peek over an ostrich, which can be up to 9 feet tall, &lt;a href="https://www.awf.org/wildlife-conservation/ostrich"&gt;according to the African Wildlife Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zUar3b"&gt;She’s taller than some elephants, as the average African elephant can be between 8.2 feet to 13 feet tall, &lt;a href="https://www.elephantsforafrica.org/elephant-facts/"&gt;according to the charity Elephants for Africa&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OdZtJE"&gt;And her hat would probably tickle the chin of some Kodiak bears standing on their hind legs, as a male Kodiak bear can be more than 10 feet tall, &lt;a href="http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=brownbear.trivia"&gt;according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="F1H1RW"&gt;Basically, she’s really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; tall. But I have just one more question — when Lady Dimitrescu takes off her hat and kicks off her shoes after a long day of hunting humans, how tall is she then? Guess we’ll just have to play &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; to see if this very important mystery gets answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EJ44j"&gt;The game’s out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242218/resident-evil-8-village-release-date-trailer-ps5-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;on May 7th&lt;/a&gt;, so we won’t have too much longer to wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJHXXQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk just showed how Clubhouse can succeed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NDg45AYS_pH36GPDaDCsqcN8VRY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68754665/acastro_191211_elon_decade_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6txraP"&gt;Hey, did you hear &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/elon-musk-goes-live-on-clubhouse-but-with-the-room-full-fans-stream-audio-on-youtube/"&gt;Elon Musk went on Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4332o1"&gt;The media and venture capital worlds were abuzz this weekend in advance of, during, and after Musk’s appearance on the not-quite-year-old audio social network. Musk is not exactly a recluse — he gives interviews more or less regularly to a variety of mainstream outlets, and will sit down with NBC tomorrow — but his arrival on Clubhouse served as validation for the company and the idea of live, interactive audio streaming more generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRFlgz"&gt;Despite beginning at 1AM ET on Monday, Musk’s room quickly hit the Clubhouse cap of 5,000 concurrent listeners — as did one overflow room hosting a broadcast of his appearance, and then &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; overflow room after that. All day long, hustlers and hucksters sought to get in on the action, hosting pre-show discussions, post-show recaps, and in at least one case, a cash giveaway sponsored by Square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHvaZV"&gt;The only social-networking moment I can compare it to in recent years would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8234769/how-meerkat-conquered-all-at-sxsw"&gt;the 2015 South by Southwest festival&lt;/a&gt;, when the streets of Austin were briefly overrun by people broadcasting themselves on Meerkat. Then, as now, the once-stable field of social networks hummed with a fresh sense of possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLBxUI"&gt;On Clubhouse, Musk appeared on &lt;em&gt;The Good Time Show&lt;/em&gt;, a roughly three-week-old late-night event hosted by the husband-and-wife team of Sriram Krishnan and Aarthi Ramamurthy. Guests and co-hosts on their show often include the partners of Andreessen Horowitz, Clubhouse’s lead investor and most prominent public cheerleaders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SA8mhJ"&gt;I’ve known Krishnan and Ramamurthy since 2012, when I interrupted their coffee date at the Creamery in San Francisco to interview them for &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/restaurants/article/Creamery-is-deal-central-for-SF-techies-3707983.php"&gt;a story about the cafe’s emergence as a hub for tech-boom dealmaking&lt;/a&gt;. Krishnan went on to work in product roles at Facebook, Snap, and Twitter, and Ramamurthy started an e-commerce company and now works at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMkcnZ"&gt;The tone of their show is lightweight by design — successful tech people getting together after they put their kids to bed to discuss the news of the day, without ever being too critical of anyone involved. In this aspect, the show is tonally consistent with the mission that Andreessen Horowitz laid out last week &lt;a href="https://a16z.com/2021/01/25/doubling-down-marketing-update-new-media/"&gt;in its blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing that it would create “a new media property” aspiring to be “&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; go-to place for understanding and building the future, for anyone who is building, making, or curious about tech.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3RqRxn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A16z spotted a gap in the mainstream tech coverage market, and now seeks to fill it with rational optimism&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4yCyrk"&gt;Mainstream tech coverage in recent years has become, &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/clubhouse-is-a-unicorn-clubhouse-versus-podcasts-monetization-moderation-and-monopoly/"&gt;in the sharp framing of Ben Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, dominated by rational skeptics; A16z spotted a gap in the market, and now seeks to fill it with rational optimism. A16z can serve that audience by creating its own media empire out of blog posts and podcasts, which is already performing quite well under the leadership of Sonal Chokshi.  But it can also serve that audience by funding and promoting services like Clubhouse, which enable optimists like Krishnan and Ramamurthy to build miniature properties of their own and “go direct” to an audience eager to hear a chummy conversation with the heroes of capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0STyUG"&gt;At least, that’s how it seemed before news came out on Monday that Krishnan himself &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/37008f"&gt;had recently become a general partner at A16z&lt;/a&gt;. And that the firm &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/a16z/status/1356340470633422856"&gt;is releasing the conversation officially as the first episode in a new live podcast series&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RsiETf"&gt;In the television industry, a “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot#Backdoor_pilot"&gt;backdoor pilot&lt;/a&gt;” is a kind of proof of concept of a full series: an episode of an existing show that introduces characters who go on to have their own show. There are a bunch of ways to think about Clubhouse, but I think it is notable and will be consequential that one of the first successful uses of Clubhouse was to create a backdoor pilot for a venture capital firm’s end run around the mainstream media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pckQji"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II. What Clubhouse discovered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Bu46YF"&gt;This is not the most &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; way of thinking about Clubhouse, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqJhXV"&gt;In 2016, a startup called Anchor launched with a product its founders hoped would “democratize radio.” It offered some dead-simple creation tools for recording audio, a place to host that audio, and some social features to let you find and follow other creators. The team struggled to find product-market fit — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/7/14845902/anchor-app-audio-snapchat-stories"&gt;maybe the recordings should feel more like Snapchat stories&lt;/a&gt;, it asked, fruitlessly, at one point? — and few hit podcasts emerged from the platform. Still, Spotify ultimately &lt;a href="http://www.insideradio.com/podcastnewsdaily/revealed-exactly-how-much-spotify-paid-for-gimlet-anchor-and-parcast/article_9bc972f2-b549-11e9-b27e-0f4f38c967f8.html"&gt;bought Anchor for $150 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3KQHfV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Spotify is paying podcasters tens of thousands of dollars to buoy its own sponsorship tool ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22241066/spotify-anchor-sponsorships-ad-money-spend-podcasting"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="87xAOD"&gt;I haven’t listened to a ton of Anchor podcasts, but most that I listened to were terrible. It turns out that podcasts do not lend themselves easily to a do-it-yourself approach. It’s hard to record pristine audio; it’s even more tedious to edit. And the podcast market is now robust enough that there are almost certainly numerous professionally recorded podcasts, hosted by celebrities in their field, that would be more fun to listen to than any DIY project uploaded to Anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aX8Bh5"&gt;Fast-forward to 2021, though, and I’m spending real time on Clubhouse. Yes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/8/21316172/clubhouse-content-moderation-taylor-lorenz-harassment-abuse"&gt;I’ve had my concerns about Clubhouse’s early inattention to moderation&lt;/a&gt;. But the company &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/welcoming-more-voices"&gt;now seems to be taking those concerns appropriately seriously&lt;/a&gt;. And while I’m tempted to blame the 30- and 40-minutes stretches I’ve spent listening to people talk about various aspects of tech and life on an 11-month quarantine, I also want to acknowledge that Clubhouse has hit upon something genuinely compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlHoQA"&gt;Unlike the median Anchor show, the median Clubhouse room isn’t unbearable to listen to. Because you’re literally on the phone while you use it, the mediocre audio quality doesn’t grate as much — it just sounds like a phone call. (Albeit one you could join at any time.) And because the conversation is live, you’re less sensitive to the fact that it’s unedited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlBMwC"&gt;As Musk’s appearance highlighted, there’s a serendipity about Clubhouse that makes it compelling. The most interesting part of his talk wasn’t the first half-hour or so, where he fielded softballs about colonizing Mars and his favorite memes, but later, when he invited Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev onto the stage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GsoX8"&gt;Robinhood had, of course, had a hell of a week, and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/02/01/elon-musk-robinhood-clubhouse-gamestop/"&gt;Musk has been vocally skeptical about the company’s moves to stop users from buying GameStop stock&lt;/a&gt;. “Everyone wants to know, did something shady go down here?” Musk asked Tenev. In response, Tenev explained how regulators had required Robinhood to increase its deposits to cover the risks associated with market volatility. Essentially, Robinhood had enabled a mob whose trades it could briefly not afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TyCTHN"&gt;This was not exactly investigative journalism on Musk’s part, and Robinhood PR had posted a variation of this explanation on its blog earlier this weekend (though without as much detail). And A16z is a major investor in Robinhood, as it is with Clubhouse, giving the whole thing the feel of a stunt. As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EricNewcomer/status/1356356405817712641"&gt;Eric Newcomer put it&lt;/a&gt;: “So undisclosed future a16z partner hosts event with a16z partner where a16z portfolio company does crisis PR but it’s billed as this big organic thing with Elon Musk?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="35ORWu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;so undisclosed future a16z partner hosts event with a16z partner where a16z portfolio company does crisis PR but it's billed as this big organic thing with Elon Musk?&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Newcomer (@EricNewcomer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EricNewcomer/status/1356356405817712641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P4J1hi"&gt;It’s a fair point, but it also skips over the absolute novelty of the world’s richest man lightly interrogating the CEO of the week’s most controversial company in a live, free broadcast. From Facebook to Twitter to Twitch, streaming video tools have been available for years now, but we’ve never seen them used quite like this. There’s something more approachable about an audio-only broadcast that seems to have enabled entirely new uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtfjKk"&gt;I thought about this last week when my friend Maran Nelson and I started a room to talk with Newcomer about &lt;a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/the-unauthorized-story-of-andreessen"&gt;his recent piece on A16z and its independent media ambitions&lt;/a&gt;. Before I knew it, roughly a thousand people were there, including Marc Andreessen himself, and a number of other A16z partners. Two of them, Margit Wennmachers and Andrew Chen, came on stage along with Chokshi to respond to our questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6leWZa"&gt;This isn’t &lt;em&gt;shocking&lt;/em&gt;, exactly — I have met all these people in person various times over the years — but the serendipity of it all took me by surprise. I pondered for a moment how long it would have taken to schedule a call with me, four Andreessen partners, and the dozen-plus tech reporters who showed up to listen. Years, I imagine. But on Clubhouse, Maran and I just tapped a few buttons on our phones and immediately we were having a productive discussion about the increasingly fraught relationship between some VC firms and prominent journalism outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fR7R1K"&gt;By the diminished standards of pandemic-era social life, I found it exhilarating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wgOnHa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like Medium, Clubhouse is there when Musk needs it, and never needs to be thought about otherwise&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MpDMig"&gt;When Medium launched in 2012, two things about it struck me immediately. The first was that the design, particularly of its content management system, was radiant. The second was that it filled an obvious hole in the media market: it gave people a place where they could blog &lt;em&gt;without any expectation that they would keep blogging&lt;/em&gt;. In the 2000s, every person’s second blog post began with an apology for having taken so much time to write it after the first one. Medium made that forever unnecessary by telling people they could just write whenever inspiration struck, and it would promote them when they did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5X82i6"&gt;Today we are absolutely awash in podcasts. By now it seems that every person of note has been interviewed by every other person of note on one podcast or another. And yet if you want to reach the sort of person who listens to podcasts, starting a regular podcast and building up its audience over time has really been your only option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpaSqx"&gt;That’s fine for dedicated podcasters. But if you’re Elon Musk, and just want to ask Vlad Tenev a few questions in front of an audience? Well, now you go on Clubhouse. Like Medium, it’s there when he needs it, and never needs to be thought about otherwise. It offers him all the distribution upside of a podcast without the planning or editing that recording an actual podcast would entail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGtsXj"&gt;It’s what Anchor tried to become and never quite did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sOdSFx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III. Robinhood’s big mistake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mWgHoT"&gt;And what of Robinhood?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCWAof"&gt;It’s amazing how, given how conspiracy-laden last week’s most viral posts about the company were, how mundane the explanation for everything seems to be. Robinhood has to keep a certain amount of money in reserve to enable its platform; that amount of money rose tenfold amid meme stock mania; the platform shut down purchases of those meme stocks while it worked to resolve the imbalance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhIEZo"&gt;As of Monday, it had raised two new rounds of funds. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-raises-another-2-4-billion-from-shareholders-11612197680"&gt;The first was $1 billion; the second was $2.4 billion&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/robinhood-raises-trading-limit-on-gamestop-shares-to-4-from-1.html"&gt;gradually letting people buy stocks again&lt;/a&gt;. And while thousands of people appear to have quit Robinhood over the momentary inconvenience, hundreds of thousands more people signed up to use Robinhood for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9WbpL"&gt;Given the situation, lots of folks are asking why Robinhood didn’t say more about what happened when it first halted sales of GameStop stock. Perhaps the company was simply embarrassed — “we built a platform we can no longer afford” is admittedly a funny thing to tell your user base — but it’s also easy to imagine an official company Reddit post headlined “LOL you crazy bastards literally broke Robinhood” being showered in upvotes and karma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qjMas"&gt;Instead, by trying to hide a liquidity crisis, Robinhood created a brand crisis. A liquidity crisis is easy for a company like Robinhood to get out of — you just raise more money from the people who are lining up to hand it to you. A brand crisis, though, is a much trickier proposition to navigate. Robinhood told users that it existed to “democratize” finance; in the end, like so many other platforms, it turned out to be a monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBZO1d"&gt;I’m interested to see how the company will fare now that the jig is up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The writing’s on the wall for Google Stadia</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E8M46y"&gt;After fourteen months, Google has decided it doesn’t want to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964386/google-stadia-pre-launch-editorial-cloud-gaming"&gt;a game company&lt;/a&gt; anymore. Where once it had its own cloud-based console, controller, and the promise of homegrown triple-A games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;it no longer wants to build its own games&lt;/a&gt; as of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIY1l0"&gt;And though a Google spokesperson emphasizes that the company continues to “remain committed to Stadia as a platform,” it’s looking increasingly likely that platform won’t be a service where you sign up with Google to buy and rent cloud games.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omavzt"&gt;Stadia boss Phil Harrison announced that Google was shutting down the company’s game studios in a memo today, and I think the exact wording of that memo is extremely telling. &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/focusing-on-stadias-future-as-a-platform-and-winding-down-sge/"&gt;Go read it for yourself&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPFDxz"&gt;Back? Good. Did you see the part about how Stadia is now a platform for Google’s partners? It’s pretty hard to miss: Harrison brings it up no fewer than &lt;em&gt;five times&lt;/em&gt; in four paragraphs. In all but the very last paragraph, “partners” — not gamers — come first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qr9dJe"&gt;This suggests Google has realized an important truth: Stadia, like so many of Google’s other businesses, is optimally one where you aren’t the customer. The paying customers, if Google can get them, are game publishers themselves, and possibly ISPs that would like to deliver a cable-like bundle of games to go along with their cable-like bundles of shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuGTYI"&gt;Today, Harrison defines Stadia as a “technology platform for industry partners” — which suggests to me that he’s talking about turning Stadia into a white-label cloud gaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYN4PO"&gt;If you’ve been following the cloud gaming space, you know white-labeling isn’t a new idea — this is how cloud gaming platforms worked from the start. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/16/4442372/inside-gaikai-how-to-make-cloud-gaming-as-easy-as-watching-youtube"&gt;The pitch&lt;/a&gt; for OG game streaming service Gaikai, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"&gt;years before Sony squashed it into the form of PlayStation Now&lt;/a&gt;, was to sell companies like Electronic Arts on hosting racks of dedicated servers that would beam free, instantly accessible demos of their games from the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2IOID"&gt;(Phil Harrison knows this; he sat on Gaikai’s advisory board. Jack Buser, Stadia’s head of business development, ran Sony’s PlayStation Now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="aKKg2n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Sony bought, and squandered, the future of gaming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oKi5LQ"&gt;Nvidia wound up selling so-called “GeForce Grid” servers to do the same thing, some of which wound up being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/16/3023502/ubitus-cloud-gaming-service-gtc-2012"&gt;white-labeled by companies like Ubitus&lt;/a&gt; to stream Assassin’s Creed games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18293458/nintendo-switch-japan-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-odyssey"&gt;to the Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt; and Final Fantasy games to iPhones &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ubitus-launches-final-fantasyxiii-on-chromecast-in-japan-300253725.html"&gt;and Chromecasts&lt;/a&gt;, among other screens. Several cellular carriers in Asia currently offer white-labeled versions &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/03/23/kddi-geforce-now-japan/"&gt;of GeForce Now as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BswcW3"&gt;There’s nothing inherently wrong with white-labeling. Done properly, it might even unlock one of the most magical things about cloud gaming: the ability to instantly try a game no matter where you are. While companies like Google already claim games are “instantly available,” what they really mean is “after you sign up, log in, and sometimes buy a game.” That’s partly due to the complex web of licensing agreements that game publishers make cloud services sign. But if game publishers were in charge of their own games, they might feel differently. They could give you Gaikai-esque instant access game demos again, ones where you could tap a YouTube advertisement for a game and &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; start playing it, no friction whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNUu5L"&gt;But moving to a white-labeling model would likely mean the end of one of Stadia’s biggest advantages compared to other cloud streaming platforms. Stadia promised you’d eventually be able to use the full horsepower of &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; cloud servers to offer gameplay and graphics that were never possible with a single game system in your home. But it seems incredibly unlikely that an Activision Blizzard or Electronic Arts would build a game that requires multiple Stadia servers for a white-labeled service — the risks of lock-in there would simply be too high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nV49Vx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's a damn shame we'll never see the "only possible in the cloud" game concepts that might've made Stadia exciting to people who already own/planned to buy game consoles and PCs. &lt;a href="https://t.co/urmgKJVE9f"&gt;https://t.co/urmgKJVE9f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dan Stapleton (@DanStapleton) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanStapleton/status/1356326448164872192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lUx53W"&gt;I’ve interviewed a bunch of cloud gaming leaders, but Google was the first to do more than hint at this kind of multi-server platform — it actually promised to build those games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18272996/google-stadia-studio-games-entertainment-exclusives-gdc-2019"&gt;poaching former leads&lt;/a&gt; behind the &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164801/google-stadia-shannon-studstill-playa-vista-studio-sony-santa-monica-god-of-war"&gt;and &lt;em&gt;God of War &lt;/em&gt;franchises&lt;/a&gt; to make it happen. Google had an incentive to do it too, since it needed killer apps to sell you on a Stadia subscription, but other publishers already have a huge install base of partner consoles waiting for whatever games they build. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjBQpF"&gt;Exclusive, cloud-first games were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21454917/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-comparison-google-stadia-microsoft-xcloud-game-pass-geforce-now"&gt;one of the things that set Google apart from Amazon Luna&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia’s GeForce Now, Sony’s PlayStation Now and the rest. Now, not so much. Google still has some of the best streaming quality and impressive latency to entice partners, but it requires them to port games to Linux right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kkt9Jy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Amazon’s Luna cloud gaming service compares to Stadia, xCloud, and GeForce Now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21454917/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-comparison-google-stadia-microsoft-xcloud-game-pass-geforce-now"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="lcqfKG"&gt;Today’s message, if I’m reading it right, is an olive branch to the game publishers who weren’t properly committed to Stadia before. “Come partner with us; we don’t plan to compete with you anymore.” At the same time, it’s diplomatically worded not to piss off existing Stadia players. Prospective partners don’t want to hitch themselves to a public failure — which is what Stadia might look like if Google shut down the game service now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHjUOB"&gt;But ask yourself: given Google’s track record of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21012505/google-decade-failed-projects-discontinued-wave-glass-daydream-vr"&gt;axing niche projects&lt;/a&gt;, and the current level of interest in Stadia (versus, say, next-gen consoles), how much longer do you think Google will continue to offer and promote a consumer-facing cloud gaming service?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H66PyC"&gt;Google has never released Stadia sales or subscriber numbers, so we can’t say for sure how many people have ever seriously tried it, but I’m wondering if today’s announcement tells us everything we need to know. Google just launched &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; — the hottest game of the year — on Stadia, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575100/google-stadia-one-year-anniversary-cloud-gaming-cyberpunk-2077-launch-test"&gt;we called &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;a make-or-break moment for the service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; had everything going for it on Stadia, including solid performance at a time when next-gen consoles and GPUs have been impossible to find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167303/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-console-google-stadia"&gt;and last-gen consoles struggled to play the game at all&lt;/a&gt;, plus a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/19/21572301/cyberpunk-2077-google-stadia-free-premiere-kit-preorder-deal"&gt;complimentary hardware kit&lt;/a&gt; if you purchased the game. Did Google look at &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk’s&lt;/em&gt; sales, grimace, and wonder if a future Google-produced game could do any better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5DXqd"&gt;Harrison’s blog post is titled, in part, “focusing on Stadia’s future as a platform.” That’s exactly what Google appears to be doing. Consumers trying to decide where they should purchase their next game might want to “focus on Stadia’s future as a platform,” too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will pay $2.5 million to underpaid female engineers and overlooked Asian applicants</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oJYif5BeRXU8cbYLYwDRLl5wIJw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68754412/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fQsPrY"&gt;Google has agreed to pay $2.5 million to more than 5,500 employees and job applicants impacted by alleged systematic pay and hiring discrimination. &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20210201"&gt;The US Department of Labor found&lt;/a&gt; that female software engineers were being underpaid. It also identified “hiring rate differences that disadvantaged female and Asian applicants” for Google engineering positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMdHBv"&gt;As part of &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OFCCP/foia/files/2021-01-15_Google_ERCA_PA_Redacted.pdf"&gt;the settlement&lt;/a&gt;, Google will hand over $1,353,052 in back pay and interest to 2,565 female engineers. It will also pay $1,232,000 in back pay and interest to 1,757 female engineering applicants and 1,219 Asian engineering applicants for “engineering positions not hired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyMWk9"&gt;The alleged disparities impacted employees at Google offices in Mountain View, Seattle, and Kirkland, Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jq08gl"&gt;Google will also set aside $1,250,000 for pay-equity adjustments, for a total of $3.8 million to resolve this issue. That $1.25 million is earmarked for engineers in Mountain View, Seattle, Kirkland, and New York, which house 50 percent of Google’s engineering staff in the US, according to the Department of Labor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmUhaB"&gt;The news comes after years of conflict between Google workers and management. In 2018, more than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18057716/google-walkout-20-thousand-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai-meeting"&gt;20,000 employees walked out of work&lt;/a&gt; to protest the company’s handling of sexual harassment allegations. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html"&gt;roughly 230 employees and contractors formed a minority union&lt;/a&gt;. The organization, the Alphabet Workers Union, now has more than 800 members. AWU specifically wanted contractors to be part of the union, as they typically get left out of the high salaries and benefits enjoyed by full-time employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIiiWL"&gt;“Pay discrimination remains a systemic problem,” said Jenny R. Yang, director of the office of federal contract compliance programs. “Employers must conduct regular pay equity audits to ensure that their compensation systems promote equal opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uo4GEn"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Google spokesperson said: “We believe everyone should be paid based upon the work they do, not who they are, and invest heavily to make our hiring and compensation processes fair and unbiased. For the past eight years, we have run annual internal pay equity analysis to identify and address any discrepancies. We’re pleased to have resolved this matter related to allegations from the 2014-2017 audits and remain committed to diversity and equity and to supporting our people in a way that allows them to do their best work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cv00OJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXv94w"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ctg6U9v5jr9RrXkzgL82pqnQOXQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67735830/vpavic_4261_20201023_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="WgKD6z"&gt;It looks like we’ll be spoiled for choice when it comes to movies about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22253363/wall-street-bets-verge-stories-gamestock-reddit-discord"&gt;WallStreetBets / GameStop saga&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; is reporting that both &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/mgm-ben-mezrichs-the-antisocial-network-wall-street-1234684378/"&gt;MGM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/netflix-gamestop-stock-movie-screenwriter-mark-boal-noah-centineo-scott-galloway-makeready-1234684568/"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; have plans to make one, before the dust has even settled (via &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/someone-already-sold-the-movie-rights-to-an-unpublished-1846173930"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/1/22260573/netflix-gamestop-stock-movie-wallstreetbets"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you weren't paying attention to the stock-spikes, short squeezes, and diamond hands that were going on last week, we have an explainer that should &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL2p85ltIvg"&gt;get you caught up on the big picture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlksSW"&gt;MGM’s version of the movie is set to based as a book that hasn’t yet been written. The author of that book is Ben Mezrich, who wrote &lt;em&gt;The Accidental Billionaires&lt;/em&gt;, which was the basis for David Fincher’s 2010 movie &lt;em&gt;The Social Network&lt;/em&gt;. Mezrich was apparently inspired by Fincher’s title, as he’s calling his new book &lt;em&gt;The Antisocial Network&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeAEAF"&gt;Netflix is trying to get Mark Boal, the screenwriter and a producer on &lt;em&gt;The Hurt Locker&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Detroit&lt;/em&gt;, to write its adaptation. (Does this mean we could see Kathryn Bigelow directing? Please say yes.) The company is also planning on having &lt;em&gt;To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before &lt;/em&gt;star &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/netflix-gamestop-stock-movie-screenwriter-mark-boal-noah-centineo-scott-galloway-makeready-1234684568/"&gt;Noah Centineo play a major role&lt;/a&gt;. Who he’ll be depicting is anyone’s guess, because the story literally isn’t done unfolding in real life yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZK6CWZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Trading on Robinhood is a big part of the story, but is hard to show on screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZP7gMd"&gt;I can imagine it’s hard to be a movie producer tasked with turning the WallStreetBets story into a movie, because on one hand you want to get it done ASAP so the movie is still topical, but on the other you have to wait until the story is done before you can really start working on it. Even now we’re seeing new developments as WallStreetBets starts &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-day-traders-are-moving-into-spacs-11612175401"&gt;to target SPACs&lt;/a&gt; (shell companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;meant to help private companies easily&lt;/a&gt; go public) and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddit-users-fuel-rally-in-silver-11612182810"&gt;silver commodities&lt;/a&gt;. It would be a tragedy if a movie didn’t include a scene of a Redditor having to take delivery of 300 bars of silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twMG8s"&gt;There’s also the question of how big a role trading platform Robinhood will play in the movies. The platform created a firestorm of controversy and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;user anger&lt;/a&gt; when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;halted the buying of WallStreetBets’s favorite stocks&lt;/a&gt; last week, but &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; reports that the app is &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizahaverstock/2021/02/01/exclusive-robinhood-secures-another-1-billion-in-funds-and-is-in-talks-for-more-as-downloads-hit-record-1-million-per-day/?sh=309e88133005"&gt;still getting a million downloads a day&lt;/a&gt;. It’s something that would be hard to put into a movie, but is obviously a big part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFHEGG"&gt;Neither movie has a release date yet (again, because it’s hard to tell when this whole thing will be over), or much talent attached to speak of, but I’m excited to see how they turn out. Hopefully one of these adaptations could be like &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt;, staring Michael Cera &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256582/roaringkitty-deepfuckingvalue-keith-gill-profile-gamestop-wallstreetbets-wsj"&gt;as u/DeepFuckingValue&lt;/a&gt;, and, if I’m really dreaming here, maybe they’ll both be released the same week like Netflix and Hulu’s &lt;a href="https://www.tvguide.com/news/which-fyre-fest-documentary-should-you-watch-hulu-netflix/"&gt;competing Fyre Festival documentaries&lt;/a&gt;. Such weirdness would only be fitting for the absolute roller coaster that the GameStop stock ride has been, and will likely continue to be. &lt;/p&gt;
