    <title>Biden administration says DHS can’t collect even more social media info at the border</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zqgFH2"&gt;The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has denied a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) request to expand its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/31/18647401/state-department-visas-social-media-trump"&gt;collection of social media account information&lt;/a&gt; from people entering the country, &lt;a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202007-1601-001"&gt;saying that the DHS hadn’t proved&lt;/a&gt; the information collection was practically useful. The DHS was mandated by former President Donald Trump to collect and surveil visa applicants’ social media accounts, but President Biden rescinded the executive order requiring it, a fact that was cited in the rejection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNpQyU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/a-promising-first-step-towards-curtailing-social-media-surveillance"&gt;According to the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University&lt;/a&gt;, the DHS’s proposal would have required 30 million applicants to include their social media accounts on immigration or foreign travel forms, expanding the measures that were already in place. The concern with the DHS requiring applicants to show their social media accounts is that it could have a chilling effect on speech — people may censor themselves out of fear that saying the wrong thing would cut off their access to travel or immigrate to the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJF0Al"&gt;It’s important to keep in mind that the denial doesn’t get rid of the existing measures that have been in place since 2019. However, the administration &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/183e7f1c-8a08-4bde-86a8-0c4f813bba0a"&gt;is currently taking a look at those&lt;/a&gt; as part of a review that’s set to finish on May 20th. Today’s news could be an additional sign that the new administration is interested in rolling back the current social media requirements. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google banks big in Alphabet’s post-pandemic-peak Q1 2021 earnings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YARmSwerMPL3eCEEYXj-YpUluVw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194964/acastro_180130_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sgnfKJ"&gt;During the height of the pandemic last year, Google was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348652/pandemic-earnings-antitrust-google-facebook-apple-amazon"&gt;the rare tech giant&lt;/a&gt; that actually saw a revenue decline — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345014/google-youtube-alphabet-revenue-decline-q2"&gt;the first in the company’s history&lt;/a&gt; — but only by 2 percent. To say Google has now recovered would be the understatement of the week: Alphabet’s just-released Q1 2021 earnings show it raking in a stunning amount of cash this spring, nearly as high as the all-time record revenues and profit it set last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fe9OcK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2021Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=0cd3d78"&gt;Alphabet’s filing (PDF&lt;/a&gt;) shows revenues of $55.3 billion, nearly as much as the $56.9 billion it pulled in Q4 2020, alongside $17.9 billion in profit compared to $15.2 billion. That’s also 34 percent more revenue year over year, though that’s admittedly comparing to March 2020 when the effects of some pandemic shutdowns may have been included in the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCcwIN"&gt;Alphabet’s all-important Google Cloud business does still seem to be losing money — last quarter, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263048/google-cloud-loss-alphabet-q4-2020-earnings"&gt;broke out Google Cloud sales for the first time ever&lt;/a&gt; to reveal an eye-watering $5.6 billion loss in 2020. But the bleeding has slowed, with the company losing less than a billion dollars ($974M, to be precise) on over $4 billion in revenue — each prior reported quarter saw &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt; a billion in losses after pulling in &lt;em&gt;under&lt;/em&gt; $4B, so those are both improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9tMBu"&gt;We also learned for the first time last year how much money YouTube brings in (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21121207/youtube-google-alphabet-earnings-revenue-first-time-reveal-q4-2019"&gt;it was a $15-billion-a-year business in 2020&lt;/a&gt;) and while YouTube didn’t pull in &lt;em&gt;quite &lt;/em&gt;as much money in the spring quarter as in Q4 ($6.0B vs. $6.9B previously), it’s still a huge increase from the flat $4 billion YouTube’s ads delivered a year ago in Q1 2020. Back to back $6B quarters for YouTube would suggest we’ll be looking at far more than a $15 billion a year business — assuming people don’t dramatically cut back on their YouTube viewing as vaccines spread and people get back out in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TltEy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing... we’ll be updating this story with more info from Alphabet / Google’s earnings release and the investor conference call at 5PM ET. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft reports strong Surface, Xbox, and cloud growth for Q3 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft logo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3QXlkyKnIZWU9xrgX6K6brGC6tQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194902/DSCF1179.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BnAHnK"&gt;Microsoft posted the third quarter of its 2021 &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2FInvestor%2Fearnings%2FFY-2021-Q3%2Fpress-release-webcast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;financial results today&lt;/a&gt;, reporting revenue of $41.7 billion and a net income of $15.5 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 44 percent. Once again, Microsoft has seen strong growth for Surface, Xbox, and cloud-related services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gD6KJK"&gt;The PC market &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380920/pc-market-q1-growth-year-over-year-chip-shortage-covid-demand"&gt;isn’t slowing down&lt;/a&gt;, despite a global chip shortage, and Microsoft is benefiting from this once again. Windows OEM revenue has grown by 10 percent, reflecting the strong consumer PC demand. Windows non-pro OEM revenue also grew 44 percent, and only Windows OEM Pro revenue declined by 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1XLXj"&gt;This is surprising growth for Windows over all, and reflects the pandemic demand we’ve seen for laptops and PCs over the past year. We’re now expecting Microsoft to detail some of its upcoming changes to Windows 10 at Build next month, and the planned “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Surface Laptop 4 15-inch open on a picnic table with a pink apartment building in the background. The screen displays sand dunes with a blue sky." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xzsU1BDYLgFE0cnffasVMYGhqrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22456006/mchin_20190710_4532_0003.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surface Laptop 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nohOTt"&gt;Speaking of PCs, Surface hit a $2 billion business milestone in the previous quarter, and Microsoft has recorded $1.5 billion of revenue in Q3, 2021. That may look like a dip, but it’s actually up 12 percent year over year during what’s usually a more quiet quarter for Surface sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WY7j3A"&gt;While Microsoft just unveiled its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt; and accessories earlier this month, the Surface Pro 7 Plus also debuted for businesses and schools during this recent quarter. The Surface Pro is Microsoft’s most popular Surface device, and this latest model includes a bigger battery, Intel’s 11th Gen processors, a removable SSD, and LTE.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pbAzXdoj8lYSIyPs8SCiAXCUEZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22013843/vpavic_201103_4275_0163.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6o8e4Q"&gt;Microsoft is also home to Xbox hardware and games, and once again revenue has grown across gaming. This is the second quarter of sales of Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, and hardware revenue has grown by a massive 232 percent thanks to these next-gen consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyoCyB"&gt;Xbox content and services revenue has also increased by 34 percent compared to the same quarter last year. Gaming became a key hobby for many during 2020, and that trend has remained throughout 2021. Microsoft’s overall gaming revenue is up 50 percent, after reaching $5 billion for the first quarter ever last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tvoo8r38JspLwSG334rhUtap-mk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19858602/microsoft365consumers.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft 365 for consumers has grown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XI4BWz"&gt;While hardware and Windows are Microsoft’s main consumer-facing businesses, cloud services are huge on the commercial side. Office commercial and cloud services revenue has grown 14 percent this quarter, along with Office 365 commercial growth of 22 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoWTuU"&gt;Even Office consumer offerings are doing well for Microsoft. Office consumer products and cloud services revenue grew 5 percent this quarter, thanks to Microsoft 365 Consumer subscription revenue and a big 27 percent jump in subscribers to 50.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1vfSD"&gt;Elsewhere, Microsoft’s server products and cloud services revenue is up 26 percent, with the entire “intelligent cloud” part of Microsoft’s business up 23 percent thanks to Azure growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcPoig"&gt;Microsoft breaks down its sprawling businesses into three main buckets: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The More Personal Computing bucket includes Windows, Surface, Xbox, and search, and it has contributed $13 billion to Microsoft’s overall $41.7 billion this quarter. That’s around 31 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgw6R2"&gt;Intelligent Cloud, which includes server products and Azure, makes up $15.1 billion this quarter — around 36 percent. And finally, Productivity and Business Processes contributes $13.6 billion, nearly 33 percent. That’s not a perfect split between all three buckets of different businesses, but it’s impressive that Microsoft still has such diverse revenue sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yep51j"&gt;Microsoft will now hold an earnings call at 5:30PM ET / 2:30PM PT today, and we’ll update this article with any relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Nest Wifi router bundle is $80 off at Adorama</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uho8ltz89Q0Bmhg2xEZV80CCRa8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194803/vpavic_191010_3722_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CHjCNK"&gt;Google’s Nest Wifi bundle that includes one router and one Point (Google’s name for an extender) costs $189 at &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/1032678/1036?sharedid=VergeGooglesNestBundle042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga00822us.html"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen yet for this model. You can get this deal until Saturday, May 1st by adding the offer code &lt;strong&gt;EXTRAOFF80 &lt;/strong&gt;at the checkout screen (located under the payment section). To put that price in context, the router alone usually costs $169 and the additional Point is priced normally at $149. In other words, this is like getting the Point for just $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pwCvGH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10306054"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MLvYEi"&gt;Like in most mesh Wi-Fi systems, the Nest Wifi router and extender differ in a few ways, so you’ll want to plan how you arrange them accordingly. The router has two Ethernet ports (one of which will be used by your internet modem), and it’ll provide faster Wi-Fi speeds than the Point. While connected to the Point, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features"&gt;my colleague Dan Seifert noted in his review&lt;/a&gt; that “speeds were cut in half, likely due to the Point’s less capable antennas and the lack of a dedicated backhaul channel for the router to communicate to the Point, like the Eero Pro and Orbi systems have.” That said, each Point has a microphone (that can be turned off with a switch) and speaker that allows it to serve as a smart speaker, in addition to being a mesh Wi-Fi device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnIhma"&gt;Still, he noted that the system had no issue having 50-plus devices connected to it at once. Plus, performance of the router and Point were solid, providing “strong Wi-Fi in every part of my home and gave me enough bandwidth to stream 4K video wherever I had a signal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EukJoc"&gt;You can add onto this Nest Wifi system with more routers or Points you might find discounted in the future, as well as Google’s previous iteration of Nest Wifi hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvvjxI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX wins approval for lower Starlink orbits, overcoming rival objections</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Starlink logo of a satellite..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0JmWGiJybmimT-dPwTYG_K3dczM=/0x0:3888x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194603/1231317438.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SxXhB5"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday granted SpaceX approval to operate 2,814 Starlink satellites in lower orbits than originally planned, handing a win to Elon Musk’s satellite internet project. The decision delivered a partial defeat over its competitors, like Amazon and OneWeb, which sought to thwart the tweak over concerns it would create harmful frequency interference and ramp up risks of satellite collisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHbN2g"&gt;The FCC found that allowing lower orbits for Starlink satellites “does not create significant interference problems.” Lowering the orbits, it said, allows SpaceX to make “safety-focused” changes to the constellation, like being able to more quickly discard any dead or broken satellites by steering them toward a fiery end in Earth’s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGtiUM"&gt;The approval came with some conditions: SpaceX must coordinate with other operators to ensure signals from Starlink satellites don’t interfere with others. The company will need to provide semiannual reports to the FCC on Starlink failures. Those reports will also list any “conjunction events” or any maneuvers or close calls with other satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2jy9B"&gt;SpaceX’s Starlink network so far has over 1,300 satellites in orbit. The company plans to launch thousands more to provide global broadband internet to rural parts of the world, for governments and consumers alike. Amazon and OneWeb are also developing their own satellite internet networks. OneWeb has launched 182 of its planned 648 satellites. Amazon’s Kuiper network hasn’t launched any yet, but it won &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348768/fcc-amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-approval"&gt;FCC approval in 2020&lt;/a&gt; to launch 3,236 satellites, half of which must be in space by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9k101I"&gt;SpaceX &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/27/18519778/spacex-starlink-fcc-approval-satellite-internet-constellation-lower-orbit"&gt;won approval&lt;/a&gt; to operate its first group of 1,584 satellites in a lower-than-planned orbit in 2019. Almost all of those satellites are already in space, making the FCC’s decision on Tuesday timely for SpaceX’s next tranche of satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7DB0q"&gt;The FCC’s approval means that SpaceX can lower the altitude of its next 2,814 satellites from a previously planned altitude of around 1,150 km to around 550 km, the same orbital neighborhood as Amazon’s proposed constellation. The FCC said SpaceX’s modification application attracted “nearly 200 pleadings” from other organizations and “a significant number” presentations and additional letters, most of which pushed back SpaceX’s change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOgHMH"&gt;Those organizations included rivals Amazon and OneWeb, which sought to convince the FCC that SpaceX’s proposed altitude change would create signal interference with nearby satellites and increase risks of orbital collisions — especially as SpaceX’s autonomous collision avoidance system doesn’t tell other orbital operators which way a Starlink satellite will move to avoid a crash. Rivals also claimed the several proposed modifications to SpaceX’s original license, granted in 2018, should be treated as an entirely new constellation with a more rigorous approval process, an idea the FCC rejected in Tuesday’s ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ab3cG9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SpaceX’s rival, Amazon, says the decision “is a positive outcome”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jZ4AJC"&gt;In a statement, Amazon cast the FCC decision as a win, pointing to one of the FCC conditions of the modification that says SpaceX must “accept” any interference from Amazon’s Kuiper constellation in the future. The condition suggests SpaceX’s 2,814 satellites must work around Amazon’s constellation, instead of Amazon having to adjust its network to SpaceX’s modification — a prospect the company fought against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ck5iCz"&gt;“This is a positive outcome that places clear conditions on SpaceX, including requirements that it remain below 580 km and accept additional interference resulting from its redesign,” a company spokesman said. “These conditions address our primary concerns regarding space safety and interference, and we appreciate the Commission’s work to maintain a safe and competitive environment in low earth orbit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Jm3we"&gt;Amazon’s fight against the SpaceX modification &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251127/elon-musk-bezos-amazon-billionaires-satellites-space"&gt;tumbled out of the obscure FCC meetings and into the open&lt;/a&gt; in January, when Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354018055014260738?s=20"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; Bezos’ company of trying to “hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation.” Amazon shot back in a company statement, saying “it is SpaceX’s proposed changes that would hamstring competition among satellite systems” and that Musk’s company is trying “to smother competition in the cradle if they can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncv1M8"&gt;On SpaceX’s autonomous collision avoidance system, which the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374262/oneweb-spacex-satellites-dodged-potential-collision-orbit-space-force"&gt;temporarily disabled this month to coordinate a collision-avoidance maneuver&lt;/a&gt; with a OneWeb satellite, the FCC said none of the companies “raise specific or particularized concerns that warrant additional inquiry at this time.” Questions about SpaceX’s automated system, the FCC said, “could be addressed through good faith coordination among the operators”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4b7DJ"&gt;Moving Starlink satellites to lower altitudes is a plus for astronomers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/29/18642577/spacex-starlink-satellite-constellation-astronomy-light-pollution"&gt;who for years have complained that SpaceX’s satellites reflect sunlight&lt;/a&gt; during ground-based nighttime observations and stain images of the cosmos with obtrusive streaks of light as they pass by in orbit. Lowering the satellites’ altitude puts them further into Earth’s shadow from the Sun. And combined with other efforts to reduce their reflectivity, operating the satellites in lower altitudes helps mitigate their impacts on visual astronomy, the American Astronomical Society was cited as saying in the FCC filing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Go Fest is back this July as a global event</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y8aulW"&gt;The annual &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; Fest is back again this summer, scheduled for July 17th and 18th. Last year’s event was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272334/pokemon-go-fest-2020-online-niantic"&gt;held online&lt;/a&gt; due to the COVID-19 pandemic, instead of taking place in person in select cities around the globe. It sounds like this year’s fest will once again happen virtually; developer Niantic describes the event as a “global event.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6Rc4S"&gt;Niantic didn’t share many other details, though it did tease that this year’s event could be particularly noteworthy. “2021 marks both the twenty-fifth anniversary of Pokémon and the fifth anniversary of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, so trust us when we say you won’t want to miss &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; Fest 2021!” &lt;a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/pokemongofest2021-save-the-date"&gt;Niantic said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qxExJA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Time to mark your calendars, Trainers!  ️ &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonGOFest2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PokemonGOFest2021&lt;/a&gt; will be a two-day global event from July 17 to July 18!   We can’t wait to show you what’s in store. &lt;a href="https://t.co/L0fcETooMj"&gt;https://t.co/L0fcETooMj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jljTUQBE1h"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jljTUQBE1h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pokémon GO (@PokemonGoApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1387090560637456384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fF0EfE"&gt;Last year’s online-only &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; Fest was a huge success, with “a record number of millions of trainers” in 124 countries and regions catching nearly a billion pokémon in total, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344717/pokemon-go-fest-2020-stats-numbers-niantic"&gt;Niantic said&lt;/a&gt; after the 2020 fest. Niantic also said that players walked nearly 15 kilometers each on average.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer is slapping its logo on SSDs and RAM made by a company called Biwin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ACER SSDs" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f8rPvxmrruF3QfW1nJ6rvC5lr00=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194328/acerbiwinssd.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starting with SSDs, but soon RAM sticks will be launched.&lt;/em&gt; | Acer / Biwin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HnsUTp"&gt;Acer announced &lt;a href="https://www.acerstorage.com/news-detail/biwin-to-offer-acer-branded-memory-and-personal-storage-products.html"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it’s getting into the flash storage and memory business with help from a Chinese manufacturer called Biwin. Acer’s brand will be slapped onto each of these SSDs, but it’ll be another company that’s responsible for building them. Even though you’ll see an Acer logo on this storage, &lt;a href="https://www.acerstorage.com/support/warranty-policy/"&gt;it’s Biwin that’ll handle the warranty&lt;/a&gt; for these products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFiBfR"&gt;Acer isn’t the only major company utilizing Biwin’s hardware. This storage and memory manufacturer also &lt;a href="https://hp.biwintech.com/products/"&gt;puts out HP-branded products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Portable-External-1F5P4AA-ABC/dp/B08DDJZP3N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;portable SSDs&lt;/a&gt;, NVMe SSDs, 2.5-inch SATA SSDs, and RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pa6eMw"&gt;The latest partnership aims to release Acer-branded products first in the US, China, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and in the UK. Release dates and prices weren’t shared, but &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted Biwin for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FX1SMw"&gt;Acer and Biwin are kicking things off with a 2.5-inch SATA SSD called the SA100 with up to a 1.92TB version available, which has up to a 560MB/s read speed. Its RE100 comes in a 2.5-inch form factor, or as an M.2 SATA SSD, and either will have configurations of up to 4TB, and its read and write speeds top out at 560MB/s and 520MB/s, respectively. Lastly, a much faster M.2 PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSD called the FA100 will come in capacities up to 2TB, with read and write speeds of up to 3,300MB/s and 2,700MB/s, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VghxzB"&gt;The partnership will also yield an assortment of laptop and desktop RAM, ranging in capacities from 4GB to 32GB per stick, with up to 3,600MHz in speed. All of these RAM products &lt;a href="https://www.acerstorage.com/products/i-3/"&gt;are listed as “coming soon” on Acer’s storage site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE is selling a $200 phone with wireless charging through Visible and Yahoo Mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sjp5VRooId_eTJ7urb12esvpm5Y=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194294/Blade_11_Prime_Front_Left.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZTE Blade 11 Prime features a 6.5-inch display and also supports wired reverse charging.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: ZTE&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cR9ydL"&gt;ZTE is offering a feature rarely seen in the budget class of phones: wireless charging. The Blade 11 Prime is on sale now in the US for $192 through Visible and Yahoo Mobile, two MVNOs that use Verizon’s network. It’s an otherwise fairly unremarkable budget device, with a 6.5-inch 720p display shipping with Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdOn9x"&gt;In addition to wireless charging, the Blade 11 Prime supports reverse wired charging to provide some power to other devices in a pinch. However, the phone’s 4,000mAh battery is on the smaller side, so the feature is probably best reserved for emergencies. The 11 Prime uses a MediaTek 6762 chipset with 4GB of RAM and offers 64GB of built-in storage. It features 16-megapixel standard and 8-megapixel wide rear-facing cameras, plus an 8-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t200QA9ZovjDyprLI6twl9ojvXY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473490/Blade_11_Prime_Back.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: ZTE&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 11 Prime includes a 16-megapixel main camera in its rear triple-cam array.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DUlctz"&gt;There’s not a lot to get excited about here outside of wireless charging, but it is a nice feature to have available as an option in the budget class. More than a few phones around $200, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;OnePlus Nord N100&lt;/a&gt;, offer huge battery capacity as a differentiating feature, but the option to use a wireless charger that’s likely compatible with other gadgets you already own is another handy proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Congress is way behind on algorithmic misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Judiciary Committee Holds Hearing Examining Voting Rights" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q6-nMN9tpoLgAAxOKT_-rWTmT3g=/0x96:7675x5213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194232/1232421321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Evelyn Hockstein-Pool / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HwVi0T"&gt;One of the scariest concerns about social media is the idea of algorithmic misinformation — that the recommendation systems built into platforms like Facebook and YouTube could be quietly elevating the most harmful and disruptive content on the network. But at a Senate hearing Tuesday titled “Algorithms and Amplification: How Social Media Platforms’ Design Choices Shape our Discourse and Our Minds,’’ lawmakers didn’t appear any closer to finding a solution for the violence platforms like Facebook have &lt;a href="https://t.co/6tvhkqG8hA?amp=1"&gt;internally recognized&lt;/a&gt; they cause in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTx8iL"&gt;At the top, Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) said “there’s nothing inherently wrong” with how the testifying companies, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, leverage algorithms to keep users engaged on their platforms. He said the committee wasn’t weighing any actual legislation and that the hearing was set to serve as a listening session between the lawmakers and the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Aksd9s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The biggest problem facing our nation is misinformation-at-scale.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k7ZkH2"&gt;It’s a major contrast from more focused issues like Facebook’s acquisition practices or Apple’s App Store fees, which have seen immediate action from courts and regulators often set off by congressional fact-findings. But the algorithm issue is thornier and harder to address — and increasingly, there doesn’t seem to be much appetite from lawmakers to take it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mdpog"&gt;Congress’ slow walk was particularly notable compared with the expert panelists, who presented algorithmic disinformation as an existential threat to our system of government. “The biggest problem facing our nation is misinformation-at-scale,” Joan Donovan, research director at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, said Tuesday. “The cost of doing nothing is democracy’s end.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdgpWt"&gt;Donovan expressed frustration about the hearing on Twitter afterward, saying lawmakers should have pressed the platforms for more information about the specific mechanisms used to rank content. “The companies should have been answering questions about how they determine what content to distribute and what criteria is used to moderate,” Donovan said. “We could have also gone deeper into the role that political advertising and source hacking plays on our democracy, or the need for curatorial models for information integrity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbvJHc"&gt;Still, the overall impression was that the federal government’s approach to algorithms hasn’t developed much since 2016, and it doesn’t seem likely to move faster anytime soon. “We are still talking about conversations that we’ve had four years ago about spread of misinformation,” said Tristan Harris, co-founder and president of the Center for Humane Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="179cdJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IT MEANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pOoJJp"&gt;Congress first started hearing these arguments on how algorithms amplify extremist content following the 2016 presidential election and the rise of the Trump-wing of the Republican Party. Over the last few years, lawmakers have held hearings. They’ve sent letters. But unlike the testy exchanges and deluge of bills we’ve seen around antitrust and content moderation, they’ve steered clear of regulating algorithms, broadly opting to politely nudge these companies in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTwGLy"&gt;It’s something the lawmaker chairing Tuesday’s hearing, Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), acknowledged &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2021/03/19/one-on-one-with-biden-ally-and-tech-leader-chris-coons-794105"&gt;in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last month. Coons said, “Congress regulates the internet and social media rarely, and when it does, whatever it puts in statute often has ended up being stuck or set in place for years.” He continued, “And in an area where technology is moving fairly quickly, sometimes oversight hearings, letters [and] conversations with the leaders of major social media companies can result in those companies demonstrably changing their practices faster than we can legislate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="phSdv2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Congress regulates the internet and social media rarely”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j5SPEv"&gt;This theme was apparent throughout Tuesday’s hearing, and it’s unclear exactly how the committee may move forward on regulating social media algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PswbKI"&gt;The closest Congress has come in recent weeks is a bill introduced in the House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7MYX8"&gt;In March, Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) and Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) reintroduced the “&lt;a href="https://malinowski.house.gov/media/press-releases/reps-malinowski-and-eshoo-reintroduce-bill-hold-tech-platforms-accountable"&gt;Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act&lt;/a&gt;.” The bill would amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in a way that would remove liability immunity for a platform if its algorithm amplified content related to a civil rights violation. (&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201026/16090345592/another-section-230-reform-bill-dangerous-algorithms-bill-threatens-speech.shtml"&gt;Critics argue it may do more harm than good&lt;/a&gt;.) While the bill has garnered some partisan support in the House following the Capitol riot, the Senate hasn’t taken it up or offered its own solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x0G1vr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT’S NEXT? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MMIpiJ"&gt;Most likely, more talking. “I’m encouraged to see that these are topics that are broadly of interest and where I believe there could be a broadly bipartisan solution,” Coons said at Tuesday’s hearing. “But I also am conscious of the fact that we don’t want to needlessly constrain some of the most innovative, fastest growing businesses in the West. Striking that balance is going to require more conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;
