    <title>A Scott Pilgrim anime adaptation is reportedly in development for Netflix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7IiScW-8sDbNVI2M5gmfKTlDDRo=/121x0:1159x692/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70362011/Scott_Pilgrim_Vs._The_World___Official_Trailer_0_8_screenshot.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An anime adaptation of the cult comic book series could be a perfect fit.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wd5KEaOtm4" target="_blank"&gt;Universal Pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jILi0Y"&gt;Netflix is developing an anime adaptation of the &lt;em&gt;Scott Pilgrim&lt;/em&gt; graphic novel series, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/scott-pilgrim-anime-series-netflix-1235071580/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The adaptation doesn’t have a series order yet, &lt;em&gt;THR&lt;/em&gt; says, and there aren’t any details about when it could hit the streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtXpe0"&gt;Bryan Lee O’Malley, who created the &lt;em&gt;Scott Pilgrim&lt;/em&gt; graphic novels, one of the writers and executive producers for the adaptation, reports &lt;em&gt;THR. &lt;/em&gt;Edgar Wright, who directed the 2010 film &lt;em&gt;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&lt;/em&gt;, will also reportedly be serving as an executive producer. If the series gets the green light, animation would be done by the animation studio Science Saru, which produced two shorts for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/22684843/star-wars-visions-anime-anthology-disney-plus-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Visions&lt;/em&gt; anime anthology&lt;/a&gt; released in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMe3IM"&gt;This potential anime adaptation isn’t the only recent &lt;em&gt;Scott Pilgrim&lt;/em&gt; revival. In 2021, Ubisoft brought back the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228652/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-the-game-review-switch-stadia-ps4-xbox"&gt;long-lost cult hit video game &lt;em&gt;Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, releasing it on new platforms including the Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One, PC, Google Stadia, and Amazon Luna.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon workers will now get only a week of COVID PTO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YI135cppwXY049Mt9G4chpuRcFU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70361975/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eUY2UE"&gt;Amazon has changed its PTO policy for workers forced to quarantine, as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/07/amazon-cuts-paid-covid-leave-for-workers-as-cdc-guidance-shifts.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-trims-covid-19-isolation-period-for-workers-but-doesnt-mirror-cdc-11641582144"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The policy has shrunk to one week (or 40 hours) off, down from its initial length of 14 days, which is still mentioned on an &lt;a href="https://hiring.amazon.com/covid-19-updates#/"&gt;Amazon hiring page&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-covid-leave-policy-reduction-213033841.html?src=rss"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) but had already been shortened to ten days. &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;’s report includes an excerpt of Amazon’s notice to employees about the change, citing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/27/22856114/cdc-covid-isolation-guidelines-shortened-omicron"&gt;the CDC’s updated recommendations&lt;/a&gt; that people who have tested positive for COVID should isolate for five days, as long as their symptoms are gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaF8H7"&gt;Amazon isn’t alone in changing its policies along with the federal government. As &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt; points out, Walmart &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-walmart-halves-paid-leave-covid-positive-workers-extends-hybrid-work-2022-01-05/"&gt;has also cut down the number of PTO hours&lt;/a&gt; employees who contract COVID get. There have &lt;a href="https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2022/01/05/workers-with-covid-19-lost-pay/"&gt;also been reports&lt;/a&gt; of sick workers across the country losing protections after the American Rescue Plan expired on September 30th, leaving state and local governments (and individual employers) to decide the rules for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1IAt5C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some health experts have expressed concern about employees who are still sick having to work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bwLjev"&gt;The CDC’s new guidance, released at the end of December, took the recommended isolation time down from ten days to five. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/27/22856114/cdc-covid-isolation-guidelines-shortened-omicron"&gt;Public health experts have said&lt;/a&gt; it’s supported by research, but some have expressed concern about employees who are still sick being brought back to work. According to a copy of Amazon’s revised policy seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, there are “additional leave options are available for individuals who remain symptomatic beyond one week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iigQIg"&gt;For some employees, their economic situations could force a return to work if they’re not paid to stay home, regardless of company policy about coming in sick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fC4P2W"&gt;Amazon doesn’t have one singular directive for how its office employees will return to in-person work, instead opting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721096/amazon-work-from-home-policy-teams-decide-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;let individual teams decide&lt;/a&gt; how much of their work should be remote. This, of course, isn’t the case for jobs that have to be in-person, like Amazon’s warehouse workers, delivery drivers, IT staff working on AWS servers, and more. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850036/amazon-mask-mandate-warehouse-employees-omicron-covid-19"&gt;reinstated its mask mandate for warehouse workers&lt;/a&gt; in December after lifting it in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TJI9n"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says Tesla is raising the price of its ‘full self driving’ software to $12k</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iH_GDJU4Xzqf0eW_IK7fLYdsTh8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70361881/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tesla is raising the price of its “full self driving” software | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bNIMim"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the company is raising the price of its “full self driving” (FSD) software to $12,000. Musk tweeted Friday that the new price, which is an increase of $2,000, will take effect January 17th for customers “only in the US.” He said the monthly subscription price of $199 for FSD &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1479596403487916032?s=20"&gt;would rise&lt;/a&gt; as the software got closer to wide release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9NHWF"&gt;Tesla began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528508/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-first-reaction-video"&gt;testing FSD in beta in October of 2020&lt;/a&gt; — when it was priced at $8,000 — with a select group of customers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541571/tesla-full-self-driving-price-increase-10000-dollars-autopilot-beta"&gt;Tesla increased the price&lt;/a&gt; of FSD to $10,000 shortly after. The software does not make Tesla vehicles fully autonomous; Musk himself said &lt;a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/24/tesla-inc-tsla-q3-2019-earnings-call-transcript.aspx"&gt;during a 2019 earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that Teslas with FSD are “able to drive from one’s house to work, most likely without interventions. So it will still be supervised, but it will be able to drive.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tB4LJf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tesla FSD price rising to $12k on Jan 17&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1479590995595517958?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jtk0zc"&gt;In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;Tesla opened the FSD beta&lt;/a&gt; to more drivers via a “request” button on vehicles’ dashboard screens, but to get access to the software, drivers have to have a good “safety score.” &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/safety-score"&gt;Tesla determines the safety score&lt;/a&gt; using five criteria that estimate “the likelihood that your driving could result in a future collision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0761vh"&gt;Musk has promised a wider release of Tesla’s FSD for several years. &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2018/06/10/tesla-version-9-software-update-fully-self-driving-features-elon-musk/"&gt;He said&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 that the “long awaited” version of FSD would begin rolling out that summer, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18512580/elon-musk-tesla-driverless-cars-lidar-simulation-waymo"&gt;projected  in 2019&lt;/a&gt; that “a year from now” there would be “over a million cars with full self-driving, software, everything.” Those dates came and went, but Tesla’s FSD remains in beta, available only to early adopters who bought the FSD package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqUkRj"&gt;The FSD software has also drawn a fair amount of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724171/nhtsa-tesla-letters-fsd-beta-autopilot-recall-emergency-vehicles"&gt;scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528508/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-first-reaction-video"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt;; in August 2021, US. Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630954/markey-blumenthal-ftc-lina-khan-tesla-full-self-driving-musk"&gt;asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate&lt;/a&gt; how Tesla was marketing its driver assistance software, accusing the company of “deceptive and unfair practices.” &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="USGxSy"&gt;When it comes to true wireless earbuds, there are a ton of brands and products to choose from. Whether you enjoy the unconventional design of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live or prefer Jabra’s compact Elite 75t, there’s a pair of wireless earbuds for just about everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsWVXq"&gt;Regardless of which brand you prefer, we’ve compiled some of the best deals on wireless earbuds available right now. Of course, if you want to do more research before making a buying decision, we also encourage you to read our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you determine which pair of earbuds are right for you. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;Apple AirPods deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the latest Pros offer better sound quality and feature active noise cancellation, not to mention seamless integration with iOS and a MagSafe-compatible charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;While the AirPods Pro carry a lofty, $249.99 price tag, they also go on sale rather frequently. During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, for instance, we saw them drop as low as $160. They’re no longer available at that low of a price, but you can still get a pair with the MagSafe charging case for about $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MLWK3AM-A-New-AirPods/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/612734/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro-with-MagSafe-Charging-Case%2F975690481&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPY6Vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;second-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt; — now the entry-level model — with either a wired or wireless charging case. The base AirPods normally retail for $129, but you can currently get the version with the wired charging case for &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-84852693%3Fpreselect%3D54191098%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals"&gt;$115 at Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F604342441%3Fathbdg%3DL1600&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$119 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DcXNMK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;If you prefer a little more convenience, you can also get a new pair of second-gen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods with a Qi-compatible wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt; for a few dollars more. We saw them drop to $99 at Walmart during the most recent shopping holiday, but at the moment, you can only get them for &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-84852693%3Fpreselect%3D54191099%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals"&gt;$159.99 at Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iGBbls"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vnM4qN"&gt;Last on the AirPods block is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;third-gen model&lt;/a&gt;. These are the latest addition to the AirPods line, blending a bit of the AirPods Pro look with the hard-plastic build of the second-gen, and packing a MagSafe wireless charging case. While they’re the newest model, they have seen a fair share of discounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vb6iWX"&gt;The third-gen AirPods normally sell for $179, but you can currently get them for $169.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-true-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-77603772%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-3rd-generation%2F510546422&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. It may not be $140, the price we saw them going for around Black Friday, but if you like the newer design with MagSafe charging case, it’s worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xK3Kl4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and some of the best sound quality of any Samsung earbuds to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the Galaxy Buds Pro were more than $50 off, bringing the price down to around $150 — nearly an all-time low — in select colorways. They are still on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWifJWOA7P" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099X4HMV4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-pro-true-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds%2F-%2FA-82244531%3Fpreselect%3D82026965%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, but only for $169.99 ($30 off).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="x23GrZ"&gt;Samsung released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; — a good-sounding pair of earbuds with active noise cancellation, wireless charging, and a subtle design — back in August, and we’ve seen plenty of discounts since then at retailers like Woot and Amazon. Right now, for instance, you can get them at &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-13140759?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds2-true-wireless-anc-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot for $99.99&lt;/a&gt;, their lowest price to date. While these are in new condition, they only carry a 90-day warranty from Woot. If that gives you pause, they’re also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Lightweight-Graphite/dp/B094242FV1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $119.33&lt;/a&gt; with a one-year manufacturer’s warranty.&lt;/p&gt;

A successor to the original Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in an assortment of colors. Right now, you can buy the $149.99 Galaxy Buds Plus in black for just &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest price we’ve seen in the last several months and likely one of the last major discounts we’ll see before the earbuds become unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;

The Buds Live is a good option if you want earbuds that produce powerful sound and showcase marathon battery life. Right now, you can purchase a pair of the $169.99 Galaxy Buds Live in the red colorway for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J3Y4W5J/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$97.37 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, about a $73 discount, or in an assortment of colors for $109.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9wI2v49bF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-live-true-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds%2F-%2FA-81111923%3Fpreselect%3D80785948%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="qWuBwy"&gt;Sony WF-C500 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LKm4yz"&gt;While the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; and their predecessors, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt;, are usually our favorite picks when it comes to Sony’s wireless earbuds, their usual sale prices have chilled in the new year. The WF-1000XM4 may still be worth it to some at their regular price of about &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM4-Industry-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B094C4VDJZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$280&lt;/a&gt; — after all, they are our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best earbuds you can buy&lt;/a&gt; — but if you’re seeking a deal, it’s best to now look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtinQ3"&gt;Enter the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22828293/sony-wf-c500-earbuds-review-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony WF-C500&lt;/a&gt;. These affordable buds came out at the end of 2021, and they prove their worth as a put-together set with very aggressive pricing. The wireless earbuds feature good sound quality and excellent battery life, and you can currently pick them up for about $69 ($30 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones-resistance/dp/B09CFP6J6D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm5INFe0Vm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsony-wf-c500-truly-wireless-in-ear-bluetooth-earbud-headphones%2F-%2FA-84783666%3Fpreselect%3D83702943%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-WF-C500-Truly-Wireless-In-ear-Headphones-Black%2F985519962%3Fathbdg%3DL1700&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. You may not get ANC with these earbuds, but they’re an exceptional value for solid performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CsGdjs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10943913"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="9wJvFX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 41,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="1TXXf4"&gt;Jabra Elite 85t deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="P0sP2n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Jabra overhauls true wireless earbuds lineup with three new models","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649800/jabra-elite-7-pro-active-3-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;In 2020, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s current lineup. They offer more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t, however, they also feature less bass and an inferior fit. That said, you can currently buy the $229.99 Jabra Elite 85t for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$183.24 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not quite the best price of $140 that we have seen in the past, but Amazon currently has the only sizable discount on this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L8bJWl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10355180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TBz3wY"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ3wLT"&gt;If you’re currently in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you also can’t go wrong with the predecessor to the Studio Buds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place while exercising; they’re also IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;Currently, there are a few different discounts available for the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest we see right now is at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B07W5JZBVJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm5XKI8Lp1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which are selling the earbuds in a handful of colorways for $179.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0RcdxX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="s5FT0v"&gt;UF Fits deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="m5v8fu"&gt;After testing a pair for ourselves, we remarked in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537150/ue-fits-review-wireless-earbuds-review-custom-fit-ear-tips" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; that the UE Fits were the most comfortable consumer earbuds on the market. That’s because, unlike the other wireless earbuds on this list, the UE Fits are uniquely capable of permanently molding to the shape of your ears in just 60 seconds. They thus make great a choice for those concerned their earbuds may come loose or fall out. At the same time, we found they also offer good sound quality, as well as lengthy, eight-hour battery life. Normally $249.99, you can get them right now for just &lt;a href="https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/c/482924/500013/8590?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcustom.ultimateears.com%2Fproducts%2Fue-fits%3Firclickid%3DwiuzeN2aXxyIU-LSYLyQdQ62UkG2ya3h1ykOzY0%26utm_source%3Dradius%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26irgwc%3D1&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$169&lt;/a&gt; in various colors from Ultimate Ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3gZxqS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10881349"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>California appeals decision regarding Activision Blizzard settlement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v3DTaCV0hYaz5Mr6SX_x_7Kb7BY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70361867/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x7v9cv"&gt;Activision Blizzard’s legal troubles just took another potential turn. The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) is appealing a judge’s decision that denies it from intervening in the $18 million settlement between the game developer and the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21175592-dfeh-appeal"&gt;according to a document filed Friday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHuoqG"&gt;Activision Blizzard and the EEOC settled a lawsuit regarding the developer’s allegedly toxic culture &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697341/us-eeoc-sues-activision-blizzard-sexual-harassment-discrimination"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, establishing a consent decree that included Activision Blizzard creating an $18 million settlement fund to compensate employees. This case is separate from the DFEH’s lawsuit against Activision Blizzard filed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt;, which is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2Fy0u"&gt;In October, however, the DFEH filed a motion to intervene, arguing that the consent decree could release Activision Blizzard from the state’s claims and potentially allow the company to destroy evidence relevant to the DFEH’s case. A judge denied the motion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834691/judge-denies-california-dfeh-block-activision-blizzard-eeoc-lawsuit-settlement"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, and now, the DFEH is appealing that decision.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lBKNH"&gt;The game developer has been embroiled in controversy since the DFEH filed its lawsuit last summer. Employees have petitioned to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789679/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-employees-petition-removal"&gt;remove CEO Bobby Kotick&lt;/a&gt;, but he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/21/22795286/activision-ceo-bobby-kotick-is-not-resigning-yet"&gt;remains in his post&lt;/a&gt; despite a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"&gt;bombshell report&lt;/a&gt; alleging &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;he was aware&lt;/a&gt; of sexual misconduct allegations at the company for years. And some employees have been striking &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1478186596688179202"&gt;for weeks&lt;/a&gt; in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820549/activision-blizzard-raven-software-layoffs-walkout-call-of-duty"&gt;surprise layoffs of QA employees at Raven Software&lt;/a&gt;, which is known for its work on the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku exec Scott Rosenberg, who helped launch the Roku Channel, is stepping down </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gUi5sXuqjKx7ZFvp_odSQvvs-6s=/60x0:708x432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70361831/roku_channel.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vpOlnf"&gt;Scott Rosenberg, a prominent Roku executive who helped launch the Roku Channel, is stepping down after nearly a decade at one of the largest streaming names in the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsZlat"&gt;Rosenberg is currently SVP and general manager of platform business at Roku, a title he’s held since 2017, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220107005111/en/Roku-Announces-Scott-Rosenberg-to-Step-Down-as-SVP-and-GM-of-Platform-Business/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to his role in the development of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22795069/roku-originals-new-shows-free-channel-streaming"&gt;Roku Channel&lt;/a&gt;, which is now home to Roku’s original programming, Rosenberg created and scaled the streamer’s advertising business, Roku spokesperson Sarah Novatt confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqapy0"&gt;According to the company, Rosenberg was a key player in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/28/16378944/roku-ipo-value-2-billion-nasdaq"&gt;Roku’s 2017 IPO&lt;/a&gt;. Other notable oversight roles listed on Rosenberg’s LinkedIn include partnerships, revenue, product, analytics, payments, and operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzP0Mo"&gt;In its third-quarter &lt;a href="https://image.roku.com/c3VwcG9ydC1B/3Q21-Shareholder-Letter-Final.pdf"&gt;shareholders letter&lt;/a&gt;, Roku reported that it grew revenue for its Platform business 82 percent year over year to $583 million. The company reported at the time that total net revenue shot up 51 percent year over year to $680 million. The company added that The Roku Channel was one of the platform’s top five channels by active account reach. Roku reported active accounts had reached 56.4 million, up 1.3 million from the previous quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jJSVF"&gt;Rosenberg reported to Roku boss Anthony Wood, who in a statement said that while Rosenberg “remains deeply invested in the company’s success, he’s ready for his next professional challenge and believes this is the right timeframe for him to make a change. I respect and fully support his decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epowEM"&gt;Rosenberg will officially step down at some point during the spring, the company said. Roku has already begun the recruitment process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KInedy"&gt;“Working at Roku these last nine years has been the most rewarding time of my career, without a close second,” Rosenberg said in a statement. “Deciding to leave was difficult, but made possible by my belief in the incredible bench strength of the Platform team and the company as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="HkBldN"&gt;Spin, the e-scooter company owned by Ford, announced a major restructuring Friday where it will pull out of “nearly all open permit markets.” More specifically, Spin is beginning to exit “a few” US markets, Germany, and Portugal, and it is “projecting” to close down in Spain as soon as February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkY4nJ"&gt;Moving forward, Spin says it will focus on “limited vendor markets,” where only a designated number of scooter companies are allowed to compete in a location, in the US, Canada, and the UK. Spin sees “double the revenue per vehicle” in limited vendor markets, &lt;a href="https://www.spin.app/blog-posts/spin-forward"&gt;according to Ben Bear, Spin’s CEO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tJV1l7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This decision to restructure impacts roughly a quarter of our staff”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P9zKTc"&gt;“This decision to restructure impacts roughly a quarter of our staff,” Bear said, which appears to mean they will be laid off. Bear said Spin will offer severance packages to “affected employees,” along with “an additional stipend that may be allocated for outplacement services.” He added that staff who had been issued company laptops will be allowed to keep them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wiflwa"&gt;Bear complained about “open permit markets,” which allow multiple scooter companies to operate in a market. They apparently proved tough competition for Spin. Bear said the market dynamics “make it difficult to identify a clear path to profitability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKbR1W"&gt;Spin was acquired by Ford &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/11/7/18073046/ford-electric-scooter-spin-acquisition"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. The company announced an aggressive expansion plan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8929994/ford-spin-scooter-expansion-next-gen-model"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and expanded to Europe &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155719/spin-ford-electric-scooter-sharing-company-cologne-germany-launch"&gt;in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Following Friday’s announcement, though, it seems that the company is switching its focus for the immediate future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 7" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u4_l39DGwYmgazbTsBa7JXG8W0E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_211006_4796_0061.15.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 currently starts at $369 instead of $399.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch to help you achieve your New Year’s fitness goals? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;order one of the new Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. Apple’s latest wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Thankfully, each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The highest-end is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399. If either of those models seems too expensive, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44jktU"&gt;Finally, there’s the four-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Yen8lP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a decent entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and solid build quality — especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range — but it’s also not one we would recommend picking up at this point. The design is aging, the processor is slower, and its paltry 8GB of internal storage hampers some of the more recent features introduced to the Apple Watch, like the ability to store music and podcasts for offline listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSKChG"&gt;If you still want to go this route, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229763/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals172022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Gen-3-Series-3-38mm-Space-Gray-Aluminum-Black-Sport-Band-MTF02LL-A%2F706203065%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is discounting the 38mm, GPS-enabled Series 3 in black by $50, bringing the price down to $159. Best Buy is also selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgdJbF1VDYU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same model with the space gray aluminum case and black Sport Band&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm6hYBluei" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver aluminum case with a white Sport Band&lt;/a&gt;, for $169. If you prefer the bigger, 42mm configuration with GPS, it’s on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $179 in white and at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYU8dEI5wH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $199 in black instead of $229. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N8sVLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ryWZk"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped Watch SE with a space gray aluminum case and the midnight Sport Band from &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1159614/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchRoundup122121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F645876604&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart for $229&lt;/a&gt;. That’s $10 shy of the lowest price we’ve ever seen this model go for. You can also buy the same configuration in select colorways for $249 instead of $279 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm1llTisAz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The GPS and LTE versions of this size are discounted at both retailers as well, selling for $299 instead of $329 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm1AJ5SW4B" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-40mm/dp/B09G95JSRJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and Best Buy is throwing in an additional month of Apple’s $9.99-a-month fitness service, Apple Fitness Plus, with each purchase. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review Apple Fitness Plus review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebnXzp"&gt;For larger wrists, Walmart is selling the bigger, 44mm, GPS model with the silver aluminum case and blue Sport Band for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229763/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals172022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F634588522&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$269 instead of $309&lt;/a&gt;. Best Buy is also selling the same configuration but in different styles for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm1UifrrO3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$279&lt;/a&gt;, along with the cellular and GPS variants for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm1VZLc9hy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$329 instead of $350&lt;/a&gt;. Like the smaller model, each comes four months of Apple Fitness Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k7Seuv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Dmq74g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10966490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716438/apple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s no longer officially a part of Apple’s wearable lineup&lt;/a&gt;, you can still buy the Apple Watch Series 6 at several retailers. The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. Right now, Walmart is selling the 40mm, GPS-enabled model for $349 in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1219877/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals172022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229763/9383?subId1=TheVergeBestAppleWatchDeals1722&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F386345423&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pink&lt;/a&gt;. The retailer was also selling the larger, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;44mm version with GPS in red for $299&lt;/a&gt;, but it has since sold out. Instead, you can buy it in an assortment of colorways for around $429 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1155142/2092?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatch172022&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-6-gps-aluminum-case%2F-%2FA-81498743%3Fpreselect%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm7aAnar8H" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which is throwing in an additional month of Apple Fitness Plus with each purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="iK520N"&gt;With a slightly altered design and larger display, the new Series 7 comes in either a 41mm configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm configuration starting at $429. Right now, you can pick up the 41mm, GPS-equipped model for $369 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the cellular version is selling for $459 instead of $499 in select styles at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF6QF5J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1066108/9383?subId1=TheVergeBestAppleWatchDeals&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-7-GPS-Cellular-41mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-with-Midnight-Sport-Band-Regular%2F969328673&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBoAQG"&gt;If you prefer the larger, 45mm variant with GPS, it’s currently available in select colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HFGSRJ7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $399 instead of $429. The larger, 45mm model with support for GPS and cellular is also going for $509 instead of $529 in all colorways at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1207219/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals121721&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-7-GPS-Cellular-45mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-with-Midnight-Sport-Band-Regular%2F637310631%3Fathbdg%3DL1700&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HFM35F9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4m59DD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="rwvKCC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2hTVr"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPbDgH"&gt;Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models. However, we are currently seeing a rare sale on the cellular Apple Watch Series 7 with the stainless steel case. Right now, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HFGVDS6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;45mm version is on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $629 ($120 off), an all-time low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ARKcVr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10966602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="hjNY0P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p id="n3zSlO"&gt;Satechi &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsatechi.net%2Fproducts%2F165w-usb-c-4-port-pd-gan-charger%3Fvariant%3D39787940905048&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F7%2F22872565%2Fsatechi-gan-4-port-usb-c-165w-charger-desktop-stand-macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced a charger&lt;/a&gt; with some interesting specs: it has four USB-C ports capable of supplying 165 watts of power at once, and it will sell for $120. It’s capable of pumping out 100W of power for a single device and can even do that while charging one or two other devices, depending on the power they draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KTRuZ"&gt;That’s impressive, given that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22852051/anker-usb-c-4-port-120w-power-brick-547-charger"&gt;120W Anker brick we wrote about last month&lt;/a&gt; (which also had four ports) wasn’t capable of doing the same — it could only charge at a 60W / 30W / 20W split, where the Satechi can do 100W / 30W / 30W. It can also provide two devices with 60W and give the third 45W if you’re more into charging a few lighter-weight computers at a time — for example, maybe a 13-inch MacBook Pro, a Chromebook, and a MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SAuKkchQ-MawTjXFIMx2aUe4qaI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23153572/p.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Satechi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back of the charger lays out the various configurations you can use it in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt67kP"&gt;That 100W charging will go away if you hook up four devices, though — from there, it’ll drop to putting out 60W / 45W / 30W / 30W. Still, that’s not bad for a device that weighs 12 ounces (or around 340 grams), according to its spec sheet. If you’re one to carry a lot of USB-C devices with you while traveling, the Satechi could be a good way to charge them all up at once without having to juggle multiple bricks and outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nlWleP"&gt;All that juice is great and everything, but my favorite feature has to be the little stand that comes with it to hold it upright on a desk. Not only would it make the charger easier to use as a home charging station, but it also makes it look like a cute little robot (at least to my eyes). It may also help with boring things like cable management, keeping the detachable charging cable away from the up to four USB-C cables coming out from the front.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O451QoY2__XS0BpzghvRnI0OSdk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23153576/p.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Satechi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Satechi’s really made this charger stand out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vr1lwR"&gt;The charger is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsatechi.net%2Fproducts%2F165w-usb-c-4-port-pd-gan-charger&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F7%2F22872565%2Fsatechi-gan-4-port-usb-c-165w-charger-desktop-stand-macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to preorder on Satechi’s website&lt;/a&gt; for $120, but the company says you can get 20 percent off by using the code “CES20” until January 13th, bringing the price down to $96 before any applicable taxes and shipping. According to the product page, the US version will ship by January 14th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tq98Xx"&gt;If you don’t need quite as much power and portage, Satechi sells a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-USB-C-3-Port-Wall-Charger/dp/B0988TCFGW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;66W three USB-C port charger for $55&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866945/anker-nano-ii-100w-usb-c-736-charger-smallest-ces-2022"&gt;Anker also announced&lt;/a&gt; a $79 100W charger with two USB-C ports and one USB-A port at CES, claiming that it’ll be the “world’s smallest 100W gallium nitride wall charger.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pixar’s Turning Red is ditching theaters to premiere on Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OYXhF7m4z7HyBSwCQwEiZcfFvk0=/0x0:1023x682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70361018/turningred_pixar.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Pixar&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Mqj4a"&gt;Late last year, movie studios seemed set on returning to theatrical premieres for all movies for the first time since the pandemic started, but now &lt;a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-and-pixars-turning-red-to-premiere-exclusively-on-disney-on-march-11/"&gt;Disney has announced&lt;/a&gt; a change of plans for an upcoming family flick, Pixar’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22575165/turning-red-disney-pixar-trailer-panda-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning Red&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of coming to theaters on March 11th, now it “will premiere exclusively in homes worldwide” on Disney Plus, but still on March 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="b8n8BG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Disney and Pixar’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TurningRed?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TurningRed&lt;/a&gt; will stream exclusively on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyPlus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DisneyPlus&lt;/a&gt; beginning March 11. &lt;a href="https://t.co/QrOKVtkktY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QrOKVtkktY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Disney+ (@disneyplus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1479552297831055361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s1AhS1"&gt;There’s no plan for a Premier Access video-on-demand setup like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365053/mulan-disney-plus-cost-streaming-new-trailer-churn-subscriber-premier-access"&gt;the company arranged for &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Instead, it will be available to all subscribers in the same way that Pixar’s last two animated features, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508491/pixar-soul-disney-plus-release-date-christmas-holidays-streaming-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22406133/pixar-luca-sea-monsters-transformation-interview-disney-plus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, were (the Disney Animation production &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698341/disney-encanto-animation-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;premiered in theaters for Thanksgiving, with a 30-day run that saw it arrive on Disney Plus in time for Christmas).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dctGoZ"&gt;Disney Media &amp;amp; Entertainment Distribution chairman Kareem Daniel was seen announcing theatrical releases for many 2021 movies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/11/22668326/disney-movies-exclusive-theatrical-streaming-black-widow-eternals-johansson"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, but in a statement about &lt;em&gt;Turning Red&lt;/em&gt;, he now says, “Given the delayed box office recovery, particularly for family films, flexibility remains at the core of our distribution decisions as we prioritize delivering the unparalleled content of The Walt Disney Company to audiences around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8d1bAB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Movie theaters are breaking records thanks to Spider-Man, even as omicron spreads ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22843051/movie-theaters-spider-man-no-way-home-records-amc-regal-cinemark"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="B53Vlt"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; broke box office records less than a month ago, a spike in COVID-19 cases driven by the omicron variant and lackluster performances by non-Spider-Man flicks could push certain films back to streaming premieres. Or they could be pushed into another set of extended delays, like Sony Pictures’ &lt;em&gt;Morbius&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22867135/morbius-movie-delayed-why"&gt;recently adjusted its release date from January 28th to April 1st&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
