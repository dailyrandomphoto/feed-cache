    <title>Blizzard president J. Allen Brack is out after sexual harassment suit, employee walkout</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fWb4t6"&gt;In the last week or so, we’ve learned about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;the state of California filing a lawsuit against Blizzard citing numerous stories of sexual harassment at the company&lt;/a&gt;. The revelations have been followed by even more stories of unacceptable behavior by leaders of the company, and now the president of Blizzard (who was named in the lawsuit) is leaving the company “to pursue new opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FJKdF"&gt;Employees were informed of J. Allen Brack’s departure this morning, and &lt;a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23706475/new-leadership-at-blizzard"&gt;an announcement&lt;/a&gt; from Activision Blizzard says that former Vicarious Visions leader Jen Oneal and former Xbox executive Mike Ybarra will take over as co-leaders of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FtUi9B"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J. Allen Brack:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPtY51"&gt;I am confident that Jen Oneal and Mike Ybarra will provide the leadership Blizzard needs to realize its full potential and will accelerate the pace of change. I anticipate they will do so with passion and enthusiasm and that they can be trusted to lead with the highest levels of integrity and commitment to the components of our culture that make Blizzard so special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="stKY6I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Realme launches MagDart magnetic wireless charging devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_uLABIWNFvtb7IAxYfsNGoK0h4=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671195/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.009___.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5RDuFl"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595550/realme-flash-magdart-wireless-charging-magnetic-android-specs"&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt;, Realme is working on a magnetic wireless charging system for its Android phones, and today it’s revealed a full range of products that’ll use the new technology. Realme is calling the system MagDart, and it’s basically a high-powered take on Apple’s MagSafe system for the iPhone 12 range of phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8jHox"&gt;The key product in the lineup is the 50W MagDart charger, which Realme says is the world’s fastest magnetic wireless charger. It has an inescapably bulky cuboid design that makes room for a cooling fan, but Realme is banking that users will make the tradeoff for faster charging speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oD8xGq"&gt;When plugged into the company’s 65W SuperDart wired charger, Realme claims that the MagDart charger will fill a 4,500mAh phone battery up to 100 percent in 54 minutes. That’s almost as fast as what you get from Realme’s 50W wired charger.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UMWayB2ya6IR8I5bD7B1J1qihsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757981/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.011___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RFObBC"&gt;If you don’t want to have to plug a charging brick into a charging brick, Realme is also working on a somewhat sleeker and more convenient 15W MagDart charger, which basically looks like Apple’s MagSafe puck — though Realme points out it’s 26.4 percent thinner and claims faster charging speeds. It’ll fill a 4,500mAh battery in 90 minutes, according to Realme, which would indeed be &lt;a href="https://www.cambrionix.com/magsafe-usb-c-charging-speed-tested"&gt;much faster&lt;/a&gt; than Apple’s own 15W option.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RA93AmxmWRjo782pjm_7h35o2XE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757985/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.021___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H9ZFQG"&gt;Wireless charging convenience aside, a major advantage of a magnetic design like MagDart and MagSafe is the potential for slick portless accessories, and Realme has a bunch of those as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="6mfuyn"&gt;The 2-in-1 MagDart Power Bank is similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;Apple’s recently-released MagSafe Battery Pack,&lt;/a&gt; but it comes with a dock that lets you use the battery as a phone stand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVPrDZ-dVzmqXS8K8vO_CQ9Fbck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758014/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.001___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZKrtej"&gt;The MagDart Case is a carbon fiber-style case for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534618/realme-gt-hands-on-europe-launch-price-specs"&gt;the new Realme GT flagship phone&lt;/a&gt; with a passthrough USB-C port and headphone jack as well as built-in MagDart connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQa74990q8Wpfirf_vgZoOLEsUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758017/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.043___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="mbW209"&gt;The MagDart Wallet is, you guessed it, a three-card sleeve similar to Apple’s MagSafe wallet. But this one has a kickstand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8jKMiMMweJ5mfrbwMxdsjwDKU9M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758020/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.040___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="qQDjyf"&gt;Perhaps best of all is the MagDart Beauty Light, a flip-up ring light for selfies that’s powered by reverse wireless charging. It has 60 mini LEDs and a dedicated control button that lets you adjust settings like brightness and color temperature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V5tmot1sqNpTLFLqUmEHiD6E5ks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758023/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.038___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1wpXkD"&gt;Realme hasn’t said anything about a release date or pricing for any of these products, and the sole existing phone confirmed to work with any MagDart device is the Realme GT — and that’s only if you buy the dedicated case. Realme is demonstrating the ecosystem with a “concept phone” called the Realme Flash, which is pictured in the above images and does have MagDart directly built in, but there aren’t any plans to actually release it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhvDRX"&gt;That’s a pretty big catch for what’s ostensibly a launch for a major new ecosystem of products. But if Realme does integrate MagDart into its future phones, it could be a solid differentiator. Wireless charging is consistently one of the key omissions from Chinese phones that otherwise have impressive spec sheets — Oppo only recently adopted the tech, and Vivo is yet to get on board. And since Oppo’s VOOC fast-charging system made its way to OnePlus and Realme phones due to the companies’ shared ownership and supply chain, it’s plausible that the same could happen with MagDart.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter to work with AP and Reuters to provide more context around disputed topics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kbbe8JZnKPwENA-YiNW6UM1aqzM=/0x0:4962x3308/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671108/MisleadingInfo.png.img.fullhd.medium.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter’s added context for content on its platform.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="toli3h"&gt;Twitter is working with news agencies the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;to more proactively combat misinformation on its platform, the &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/bringing-more-reliable-context-to-conversations-on-twitter"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The platform’s internal teams already work to explain and add context to Twitter content, but it says the two news agencies will help provide more authoritative information, especially when facts are in dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meIFu2"&gt;In particular, Twitter says it wants to be more proactive about providing accurate information on topics as they develop, before misinformation emerges. “Rather than waiting until something goes viral, Twitter will contextualize developing discourse at pace with or in anticipation of the public conversation,” the platform says. &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; will also provide feedback on fact-checking provided via Twitter’s crowd-sourced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248903/twitter-birdwatch-fact-checking-misinformation"&gt;Birdwatch program&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently in a pilot phase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iixPOC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re excited to announce a new collaboration with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Reuters?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Reuters&lt;/a&gt;! Conversations move fast on Twitter and we need to be able to surface credible context just as quickly. Learn more about where you’ll see these updates: &lt;a href="https://t.co/ptp5PWiFxq"&gt;https://t.co/ptp5PWiFxq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1422288755197726731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uMSnC3"&gt;The collaboration is an expansion of Twitter’s existing attempts to stop misinformation from spreading on its platform. The company’s Curation team already adds explanatory content to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418044/twitter-trending-topics-representative-pinned-tweets-descriptions-misinformation"&gt;trending topics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254733/twitter-covid-19-misleading-information-label-warnings-misinformation"&gt;certain misleading tweets&lt;/a&gt;, and will surface authoritative information when users search for specific terms, or during major events like elections or public health emergencies. But Twitter says the new partnerships will help “when Twitter’s Curation team doesn’t have the specific expertise or access to a high enough volume of reputable reporting on Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZM4nF"&gt;It will be the first time Twitter has formally collaborated with news agencies to provide accurate information on its site, the company &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-partners-with-ap-reuters-battle-misinformation-its-site-2021-08-02/"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Associated Press &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;already work with Facebook to fact-check content on its platform, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-58065463"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmVvGs"&gt;Twitter says its collaboration with the two news agencies will be separate from the work done by its own enforcement teams, and that neither &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; nor &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;will be deciding whether tweets break Twitter’s rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSk1qN"&gt;The new partnerships come as social media platforms are facing intense scrutiny from regulators for the amount of misinformation they spread. The problem has become particularly acute in light of the global COVID-19 pandemic, in which misinformation about the virus and now its vaccines has spread online. Last month, US surgeon general Vivek Murthy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines"&gt;called on platforms&lt;/a&gt; to do more to combat coronavirus misinformation, including redesigning their algorithms to avoid amplifying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4Dbi7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRCoGV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP is flooding the zone with seven new gaming monitors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HP gaming monitors" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4pw4exhbKOnJ7U2r6OREkwyejuk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671039/hpecosystemmonitors.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X34 1440p monitor sits in the middle of the fleet of new models.&lt;/em&gt; | HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vb6p4B"&gt;HP has gone on a tear and announced seven new gaming monitors in its X lineup, featuring a range of sizes, panel types, and resolutions, as well as some that are curved or flat-screened. It seems like HP is aiming to deliver a flurry of options that have a high refresh rate, low response time, competent design, and crucially, competitive prices. HP is staggering this launch over the next few months, with availability starting now for some of its monitors and continuing through October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZaRHW"&gt;To being with, there’s HP’s X27, which is available now and comes in a 1080p version for $259.99 or a 1440p variant called the X27q that costs $339.99. Both are IPS panels with a 165Hz refresh rate and a 1ms response time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16WfcB"&gt;Resolution differences aside, they’re very similar in design. Each features slim bezels on three sides and can be raised, swiveled, and rotated to your liking. If you don’t like the stand that’s included, they include VESA mounts so you can mount them to one of the many monitor arms that are available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aT6ebf"&gt;In terms of ports, these are simple offerings with a DisplayPort 1.4 port, a HDMI 2.0 port, and a headphone jack. Each panel can reach up to 400 nits of brightness (the X27q, the X32, and the X34 that’s mentioned below support HDR content, but at the HDR400 standard that isn’t all that bright), and there’s AMD’s FreeSync Premium for variable refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9kKxW"&gt;(In fact, every monitor announced today has the same selection of ports, and each has an adaptive sync feature that works with both AMD and Nvidia GeForce GTX 10 series, GTX 16 series, and newer graphics cards. I’ve reached out to HP for clarification on how its adaptive sync compares to Nvidia G-Sync compatibility.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP X34" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NewQ3P2XvXxdPDDPH3gTeXjjMz8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22756754/hpx34monitor.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X34 is the biggest option to come in HP’s late 2021 lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FWSpRA"&gt;Coming in August is a larger variant called the HP X32, a 1440p monitor with many of the same specs and features as the X27q (though it can’t pivot or swivel); it will cost $389.99. A month later, in September, the HP X34 will add an ultrawide option to the lineup; it will cost $459.99. It has a 21:9 aspect ratio display and a 3440 x 1440 resolution. It’s still limited to just one DisplayPort and a single HDMI port for video input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTHBYe"&gt;HP will release three different sizes of 1500R curved gaming monitors in October, and these are similar in design, port selection, and feature set to the flat panel options. These, however, have VA panels that usually boast more narrow viewing angles, but that’s less of an issue on a curved screen. They also have 350 nits of peak brightness compared to 400 nits in the flat panel monitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iD7pRv"&gt;The X27c with a 27-inch 1080p curved screen is $259.99 — the same price as the flat X27. The X27qc is the 1440p curved variant, bumping the cost just $10 over the non-curved option at $349.99. Finally, HP is releasing a 31.5-inch X32c with a bigger 1080p curved display that costs $309.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTRJVt"&gt;Each of these monitors support VESA mounts and can be raised or lowered, but don’t support pivoting or swiveling. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP X32c" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ubaYhDTuX1h_nkUVeh4WFLi22tg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22756757/x32cmonitor.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1500R isn’t as curvy as gaming monitors come these days, but it’s certainly more immersive than a flat panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ae5hSK"&gt;Those are appealing prices if you’re thinking of dipping a toe into the world of curved gaming monitors. You could get two of each size and still spend less than the cost of a single &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22587089/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-49-inch-curved-gaming-monitor-price-specs-release-date-features"&gt;Samsung 49-inch Odyssey Neo G9&lt;/a&gt;. The picture quality and features provided by that $2,499 monitor are way ahead of these curved HP models, but you’re paying dearly for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPIbIj"&gt;In announcing &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many monitors at once, it’s clear that HP wants to flood shelves with plenty of options for the latter half of 2021. Seven monitors might be overkill, but these could be worth checking out if you’re on a budget and don’t want to decide between buying a graphics card or a display.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="K1f7IU"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/amazon-drone-delivery-prime-air"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into Amazon’s drone delivery program in the UK says the operation has lost over 100 employees, with insiders saying the project is “collapsing inwards.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4P7k9o"&gt;Citing testimony from former employees, &lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;describes a culture of managerial dysfunction and overwork. In February 2020, for example, Amazon reportedly shut down a team of dozens in the UK dedicated to analyzing drone footage to identify humans and animals, only to re-open the unit months later. Other stories cited in the report include the fast turnover of senior staff, an employee drinking beer at their desk in the morning, and another “pinning down the ‘approve’ button on their computer so that all the frames of footage were being approved irrelevant of whether there were hazards in them or not.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fjfroc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“they put people in charge who didn’t know anything about the project and they oversold”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8fA6fc"&gt;As one former worker told &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;: “Everything started collapsing inwards because they [Amazon] piled too much on, they put people in charge who didn’t know anything about the project and they oversold. It’s all one gigantic oversell — just so many promises that can’t be kept.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGgpcL"&gt;A spokesperson for Amazon told &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; that the company will continue to have a Prime Air presence in the UK, but did not confirm its current or future headcount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5J6rWS"&gt;It’s not clear how the dysfunction described in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;’s report extends to Amazon’s overall drone delivery program, which was first announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/1/5164340/delivery-drones-are-coming-jeff-bezos-previews-half-hour-shipping"&gt;all the way back in 2013&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly, the company has oversold the ease of introducing the technology, though, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18654044/amazon-prime-air-delivery-drone-new-design-safety-transforming-flight-video"&gt;promising in June 2019&lt;/a&gt; it would be launching a delivery service in “the coming months.” In August last year, Amazon did finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408646/amazon-prime-air-drone-delivery-faa-clearance-approval-health-safety-alphabet-wing"&gt;receive approval from the FAA&lt;/a&gt; to deliver packages in the US — which it cited as a key restraint — but has yet to outline a timeline for when this might happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GV5dhm"&gt;Amazon positioned the UK as a big market for its technology, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/14/13952240/amazon-drone-delivery-launch-uk"&gt;announcing in 2016&lt;/a&gt; that it had made its first real drone delivery in Cambridge, England. But this was a stunt using a pre-arranged order, and Amazon has never offered commercial deliveries in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSm8fc"&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;’s report focuses on the UK operation, some of the problems identified in the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;story seem like they would affect Amazon’s overall drone ambitions. These include the company’s desire to land its drones to deliver their packages, a method which takes particularly careful navigation. Rivals like Google-owned Wing, by contrast, drop off packages without actually descending to the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrDuWR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has contacted Amazon for further comment and will update this story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi overtakes Samsung to take top spot in European phone shipments in Q2 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LPLZPwxGXWuTO09gw8-Cz5XZ6Q8=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69670808/DSCF7531.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xiaomi Mi 11 offers similar features to Samsung’s S21 ultra for much less money. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GDnNl2"&gt;Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is continuing to post solid growth. After overtaking Apple as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22579771/worldwide-smartphone-market-share-ranking-q2-2022-canalys-xiaomi-apple-samsung"&gt;number two smartphone vendor in the world&lt;/a&gt; in the second quarter of 2021, it’s now become the top seller in Europe for the first time, according to &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210802005339/en/Strategy-Analytics-Xiaomi-Captures-Top-Position-in-European-Smartphone-Shipments-for-the-First-Time-in-Q2-2021-%C2%A0"&gt;new figures from Strategy Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fn4FXW"&gt;Xiaomi overtook Samsung to take the top spot in Europe, with 12.7 million phones shipped in Q2, up 67.1 percent year-on-year. Samsung’s shipments fell 7 percent in that same period to 12 million units, though the Korean company remains the world’s biggest phone vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGCRE1"&gt;Overall smartphone shipments in Europe increased in 2021 thanks to post-COVID recovery, say Strategy Analytics’ researchers, with Apple also showing decent growth. The iPhone maker was up 15.7 percent compared to 2021 thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596120/apple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;strong interest in the iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smartphone shipment figures for Europe in the second quarter of 2021. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMvtvW"&gt;Xiaomi’s focus on value, though, seems to have helped broaden its appeal in Europe. “Xiaomi has seen great success in Russia, Ukraine, Spain and Italy among others and found customers eager for its Mi and Redmi series of feature rich, value smartphones,” said Boris Metodiev, associate director at Strategy Analytics, in a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210802005339/en/Strategy-Analytics-Xiaomi-Captures-Top-Position-in-European-Smartphone-Shipments-for-the-First-Time-in-Q2-2021-%C2%A0"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlUdGv"&gt;Xiaomi’s growth has also been assisted by the demise of Huawei, which continues to vacate the European market after its phones lost access to Android and Google services in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qs7Yqd"&gt;In one of our recent reviews of Xiaomi’s hardware, looking at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;the company’s flagship Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;, we were impressed by the phone’s value. “It costs less than the $799 Galaxy S21 in markets where it’s sold, but in many ways, it has more in common with the $1,199 S21 Ultra,” noted  reviewer Sam Byford. “My biggest takeaway from the Mi 11 is that Samsung is lucky Xiaomi doesn’t sell phones in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLbsyh"&gt;Perhaps, buoyed by its success in Europe, Xiaomi will now be considering a US invasion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will give you a whole $10 for your palm print</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uhuU4G-YwxcEAtJ7TTX9iAnDyNc=/103x0:1218x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69670735/amazon_one_palm_print.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon One identifies unique patterns in your palm to confirm payments in Amazon stores. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5X5L15"&gt;Amazon is offering $10 in credit if you enroll your biometric data in the company’s palm print recognition system, Amazon One. The promotion, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;says people must connect their palm print to their Amazon account to claim the reward, though it’s not clear exactly where it’s available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZyqLB"&gt;Amazon launched Amazon One in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493094/amazon-one-palm-recognition-hand-payments-amazon-go-store"&gt;September last year&lt;/a&gt;, presenting it as an easy way to pay in the company’s stores, as well as a future identity service to be used by other venues and businesses. Users simply position their hand over the company’s scanners, which recognize their unique palm print based on its patterns of lines, ridges, and veins. This information can be used to verify payments in stores, but also in lieu of entrance tickets and the like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vq9n0v"&gt;Amazon One is currently available in 50 US locations, including Whole Food stores and Amazon Go shops. In &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-one-continues-expansion-now-available-as-a-contactless-payment-option-at-initial-whole-foods-market-store-in-seattle"&gt;April&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon said “thousands” of customers have enrolled in the service, though the company did not respond to a request for comment about this promotion. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xjockeZL5OqFY4W_pdVtSOfG4Z0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757992/amazon_store_palm_prints_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/" target="_blank"&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Amazon One promotion&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7xpg71"&gt;The retailing giant presents Amazon One as a “fast, convenient, contactless way for people to use their palm to enter, identify, and pay.” But critics say the technology is unnecessary, with similar benefits provided by contactless payment cards, and a potential security risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPtyUp"&gt;“The advantage [of your palm print] is that it’s on you all the time, this isn’t something you can lose, but that’s also a disadvantage because you can never change it,” security researcher and University of Oxford academic Reuben Binns &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496673/amazon-one-palm-reading-vein-recognition-payments-identity-verification"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;. “You can never change your palm like you change your password or other identification tokens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KC7QK"&gt;Many have expressed concerns about a company like Amazon in particular collecting such data. The firm has been criticized in the past for pushing new technology in uncomfortable ways: selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287101/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police-ban-one-year-ai-racial-bias"&gt;biased facial recognition algorithms&lt;/a&gt; and aggressively expanding its &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvg48d/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ring-amazons-surveillance-camera-company"&gt;network of police-connected home surveillance cameras&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KADp3N"&gt;It’s clear also that Amazon wants other businesses to use Amazon One as an identity service. This would potentially allow Amazon to track people around a greater variety of physical venues — not just shops, but office buildings, stadiums, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This $55 Amazon Smart Soap Dispenser is dumb as dirt</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kAJH5L_ZCedkb192KHOzicA_yJE=/7x0:1648x1094/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69670715/amazon_smart_soap.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xunZyB"&gt;Not &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; needs Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Case in point is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GWRT223?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s new Smart Soap Dispenser&lt;/a&gt;, the latest let’s-stick-a-chip-in-it replacement for ordinary objects. And because it’s made by Amazon, it’s design to be paired with an Echo speaker to run Alexa routines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0sWMC"&gt;Why? Well, according to Amazon, it’s to “automatically play songs, jokes, and more when you wash.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7HgBu"&gt;The 12oz liquid soap dispenser is fitted with 2.4GHz (only) 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi and features an LED timer around the top that reminds you to keep scrubbing until the CDC-recommended minimum wash time of 20 seconds has elapsed. The rechargeable battery is said to last three months on a single charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iRFdth"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A feature available on touchless soap dispensers that cost a lot less&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HOr7Kn"&gt;One useful feature is the variable rate dispenser that pumps out more soap the farther away from the nozzle you hold your hand. But that feature’s available on a variety of touchless soap dispensers that cost a lot less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7dHR0"&gt;If you do end up buying this device then please, by all means, install it in a bathroom alongside some type of occupancy sensor. Then alert the household whenever someone uses the toilet and fails to wash. Public shaming can be highly motivational to a fragile human psyche incapable of being alone for even 20 seconds at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bdbRN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgWBp6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates have officially divorced</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TENNIS: MAR 15 BNP Paribas Open" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mjhqjNnnP0Bs4OHKWyY5wpulfR0=/0x50:3000x2050/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69670679/1130788958.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0I0X1b"&gt;Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates filed for divorce on May 3rd after 27 years of marriage. Now, three months later, the separation of one of the world’s richest, most powerful couples has been finalized by a judge in King County, Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPN50M"&gt;Court records show that neither party will change their name or receive “spousal support,” report &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/02/tech/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-finalized"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-02/bill-gates-and-melinda-french-gates-divorce-becomes-official?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but exactly how the Gates’ immense fortune will be divided is unclear. Washington is a community property state, which means all assets accumulated during a marriage must be divided equally in the event of a divorce. But the Gates’ split is being carried out under the aegis of a separation contract, details of which are unknown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X4RTvO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bill Gates is currently the fourth richest man in the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gf8msU"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Billionaires Index&lt;/a&gt;, Bill Gates is currently the fourth richest man in the world, worth $151 billion. The judge who finalized the divorce said only that the contract was “just and equitable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSHXH8"&gt;After the divorce was announced earlier this year, stories emerged of Gates’ inappropriate behavior in the workplace. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-directors-decided-bill-gates-needed-to-leave-board-due-to-prior-relationship-with-staffer-11621205803"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft’s board of directors thought Gates should step down after investigating an affair he pursued with an employee. Gates resigned from the board in 2020 before the investigation was completed, with a spokesperson claiming this had nothing to do with the investigation. “There was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably,” the spokesperson told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAcVR1"&gt;Members of Microsoft’s board were also reportedly interested in Gates’ relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. As &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/16/business/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-epstein.html"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in May, Gates became friendly with Epstein in 2011, three years after the financier pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from children as young as 14. The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that “Ms. French Gates had expressed discomfort with her husband spending time with the sex offender, but Mr. Gates continued doing so.” A spokesperson for Gates told the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;that the paper’s “characterization of his meetings with Epstein and others about philanthropy is inaccurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdusKk"&gt;One of the big unknowns following the divorce is the future of the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which has just under $50 billion in assets, reportedly making it the second largest charitable foundation in the world. Currently, the foundation plans to pursue a &lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/gates-foundation-trustees-commitment"&gt;two-year trial period&lt;/a&gt; to see if the former couple can continue to work together constructively as co-chairs and trustees. If not, Melinda French Gates will resign from the foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFZgpU"&gt;“In such a case, Melinda would receive personal resources from Bill for her philanthropic work,” said the foundation’s CEO Mark Suzman last month. “These resources would be completely separate from the foundation’s endowment, which would not be affected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMP9vd"&gt;Following the announcement of their divorce, Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates committed an additional $15 billion to the foundation, which will bring its total endowment up to $65 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify is testing a less restrictive ad-supported tier costing $0.99 a month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_aM2-y-aYoWbYTAmN0jOB-eLSps=/1x0:1096x730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69670663/lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Unlimited skips and on-demand listening’ for $0.99 a month.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ux6RY7"&gt;Spotify Plus is a new low-cost subscription tier being piloted by the streaming service which combines elements of its existing free and premium tiers. The plan still features ads like Spotify’s free tier, but it doesn’t impose any limits on the number of tracks you can skip per hour. Users are also free to pick which specific songs they want to listen to, rather than mostly being limited to shuffling within albums and playlists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tv3HtV"&gt;At least one user has seen Spotify Plus being advertised at $0.99 a month (a tenth of the cost of its standard $9.99 premium tier), but it’s understood that Spotify’s test involves offering the new plan randomly at a variety of price points to gauge user interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9H3f2T"&gt;Spotify’s free tier has existed in its current form &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17274844/spotify-app-update-free-account-playlist"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t let users skip more than six tracks per hour, and only lets them pick and listen to specific tracks from 15 select playlists, ranging from editorial-selected playlists to algorithmically generated collections like “Discover Weekly” and “Daily Mix.” Outside of these playlists, free users can only listen to shuffled tracks. The new Spotify Plus tier is a relatively cheap way to reduce some of those restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify Plus is ad-supported, but comes with a subscription cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8LJeO5DkFUD6xZ8JzF6hvQtBRQs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757966/Attachment.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In-app ads for the tier have also been appearing for some users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6pZlqS"&gt;News of the new test tier was initially shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;by a reader (&lt;em&gt;thanks, Gustovo!&lt;/em&gt;) and later confirmed by Spotify in a statement. “We’re always working to enhance the Spotify experience and we routinely conduct tests to inform our decisions,” a spokesperson said. “We’re currently conducting a test of an ad-supported subscription plan with a limited number of our users.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGmjoR"&gt;However, Spotify cautioned that there’s no guarantee that the new tier will launch in its current form. “Some tests end up paving the way for new offerings or enhancements while others may only provide learnings. We don’t have any additional information to share at this time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wc8D22"&gt;Spotify has a history of testing new features years before they actually launch, if they ever release at all. The best example of this is lossless audio streaming, which Spotify was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/5/15168340/lossless-audio-music-compression-test-spotify-hi-fi-tidal"&gt;testing as far back as 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Although the service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;officially announced its lossless “HiFi” tier&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, it’s still yet to become available. Other tests include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726183/spotify-stories-playlist-snapchat-instagram-christmas-hits"&gt;Snapchat-like stories for select playlists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21346490/spotify-visual-quote-michelle-obama-podcast"&gt;visual quote cards for podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, both of which no longer appear to be visible in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHjupD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 3rd, 7:34AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to confirm Spotify Plus is being offered at a variety of price points as part of the experiment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
