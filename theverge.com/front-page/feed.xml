    <title>Facebook’s News tab comes to UK in first launch outside of the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G7mPdCMruAp5aOocoroD54co3ik=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68719848/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MarpJ1"&gt;Facebook’s News tab will go live in the UK on January 26th in its first launch outside the US. The company says the section will offer a mix of curated and personalized news stories, but for select publishers the bigger news is that it will see Facebook paying them to license their content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vbjxrb"&gt;Although Facebook declined to give information on the amount it expects to pay publishers, a spokesperson said the company plans to invest “substantial” amounts over a number of years. These payments are expected to mainly go to publishers whose content isn’t already on Facebook — for instance, like content that’s normally paywalled. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/01/facebook-to-pay-uk-media-millions-to-licence-news-stories"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that some publishers expect these payments to be worth millions of pounds a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guuDyj"&gt;Alongside the news of the section’s launch, Facebook is announcing a number of new publishing partners whose stories it’ll include. These include the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, Sky News, Channel 4 News, Telegraph Media Group, DC Thomson, and the Daily Mail group. These join existing publishers announced by Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754847/facebook-news-tab-uk-launch-january-2021-paying-publishers-partner"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Vogue&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and local news sites from publishers like Reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5QXrN1I5-Rwize6jUaW0q790as0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258375/__News_Tab___UK_cropped.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tab features a mix of curated and personalized stories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BGXKFIxnrjh7ulohAF7MO1VGfao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258374/__Controls___UK_cropped.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are also controls to allow you to hide articles or publications from your feed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fLxciz"&gt;Facebook News will include a combination of curated stories chosen by “a team of journalists” and articles that are shown based on what users read, share, and follow, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285656/facebook-news-tab-section-launch-us-local-publishers-partnership"&gt;how the section works in the US&lt;/a&gt;. The company promises that it’ll provide controls to let you hide topics or publishers from your feed if you don’t want to see them. New digests will also be produced to cover major news stories (such as stories relating to the COVID-19 pandemic), which Facebook says will highlight “original and authoritative reporting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrnz6v"&gt;While Facebook News offers a dedicated section in the app for browsing news stories, the company emphasizes that users will still be able to share articles from their profiles and pages, and will be able to read them via the News Feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAJRIp"&gt;As well as launching in the UK on Tuesday, Facebook says it’s currently in “active negotiations” with partners to launch the feature in France and Germany. In August last year, following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285656/facebook-news-tab-section-launch-us-local-publishers-partnership"&gt;launch of the News tab in the US&lt;/a&gt;, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21400960/facebook-news-tab-expand-plans-brazil-germany-uk-india-france"&gt;listed Brazil and India&lt;/a&gt; as two additional countries to which it was considering bringing the section.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amnesty International calls for a ban on facial recognition in New York City</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7EslQ_sI97vO6VlLyrxFeLk7A8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68719846/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bNyO1K"&gt;Amnesty International has launched a new campaign against facial recognition titled &lt;a href="http://www.banthescan.amnesty.org/"&gt;Ban The Scan&lt;/a&gt; — and is launching with a demand for New York City to halt police and government use of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyTohf"&gt;Amnesty argues facial recognition is incompatible with basic privacy rights, and will exacerbate structural racism in policing tactics. “New Yorkers should be able to go out about their daily lives without being tracked by facial recognition,” said Matt Mahmoudi, an AI and human rights researcher with Amnesty. “Other major cities across the US have already banned facial recognition, and New York must do the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gWNnOO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The NYPD has used facial recognition to track tens of thousands of New Yorkers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8qIurc"&gt;Amnesty is joined in the New York portion of the campaign by a range of groups, including the Urban Justice Center, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the city’s Public Advocate office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEOf6e"&gt;The New York Police Department has run afoul of facial recognition critics before, most notably when it used facial recognition &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373316/nypd-facial-recognition-black-lives-matter-activist-derrick-ingram"&gt;to locate and arrest a Black Lives Matter activist&lt;/a&gt; in August. The department claims it &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/news/pr0313/press-release---nypd-facial-recognition-policy"&gt;only uses facial recognition to generate leads&lt;/a&gt;, and doesn’t make arrests based on the information. Still, &lt;a href="https://www.gothamgazette.com/city/9608-nypd-facial-recognition-policy-leeway-department-not-using-black-lives-matter-protests"&gt;many civil liberties groups&lt;/a&gt; find the existing protections inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYagEx"&gt;The Ban the Scan campaign is launching with a website that will allow users to leave comments on the NYPD’s policies through a local public oversight rule. Later, Amnesty plans to build in a tool for filing &lt;a href="https://www.dos.ny.gov/coog/freedomfaq.html"&gt;Freedom of Information Law&lt;/a&gt; requests, and in May, a tool to geolocate facial-recognition-capable cameras throughout the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbhbSs"&gt;“For years, the NYPD has used facial recognition to track tens of thousands of New Yorkers, putting New Yorkers of color at risk of false arrest and police violence,” said Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project at the Urban Justice Center in a statement. “Banning facial recognition won’t just protect civil rights: it’s a matter of life and death.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple has a new head of hardware engineering in latest executive shuffle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cDhkj1CFPULcfezeUfQ-BqTa6uc=/56x0:1904x1232/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68719477/Apple_dan_riccio_begins_a_new_chapter_at_apple_Ternus_01252020_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;John Ternus, Apple’s new senior vice president of hardware engineering | Photo: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NBEKW7"&gt;Apple’s hardware team is getting its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F01%2Fdan-riccio-begins-a-new-chapter-at-apple%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22249393%2Fapple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;biggest shakeup&lt;/a&gt; in nearly a decade, as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fleadership%2Fdan-riccio%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22249393%2Fapple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dan Riccio&lt;/a&gt; — who served as the company’s senior vice president of hardware engineering since 2012 — transitions to “a new role” at the company. He’ll be replaced as Apple’s head hardware engineer by John Ternus, who led the hardware team designing the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro, in addition to working on Apple’s M1 chips. Ternus has been vice president of hardware engineering at Apple since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="to8wIv"&gt;The role of senior vice president of hardware engineering at Apple is a key one: the position reports directly to CEO Tim Cook and is responsible for leading the Mac, iPhone, iPad, and iPod engineering teams. Ternus’ new role will put him in charge of the company’s hardware efforts, much in the same way that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fleadership%2Fcraig-federighi%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22249393%2Fapple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Craig Federighi&lt;/a&gt; — Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering — runs the development of iOS and macOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKhEUo"&gt;Riccio won’t be leaving Apple, though: he’ll be working on an unspecified “new project” for the company in a role directly reporting to Cook. “Next up, I’m looking forward to doing what I love most — focusing all my time and energy at Apple on creating something new and wonderful that I couldn’t be more excited about,” explains Riccio in Apple’s announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q8UdolxBHH9VEnHKDHAnyp9a23w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259288/Apple_dan_riccio_begins_a_new_chapter_at_apple_01252020_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan Riccio, Apple’s now-former SVP of hardware engineering.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g6eoId"&gt;If that language sounds familiar, it’s because it’s almost the exact same description that Apple provided for Riccio’s predecessor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/27/3272577/apple-bob-mansfield-dan-riccio-engineering"&gt;Bob Mansfield&lt;/a&gt;, when he stepped down as SVP of hardware engineering in 2012. Like Riccio, Mansfield transitioned to “work on future projects” in an unnamed role that reported directly to Cook — which &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-08/apple-shifts-leadership-of-self-driving-car-division-to-ai-chief"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; included leading Apple’s self-driving car team until December 2020, when Mansfield fully retired from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pND1HN"&gt;Apple’s future automotive ambitions are currently being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163939/apple-self-driving-car-john-giannandrea-ai-siri"&gt;led by artificial intelligence executive John Giannandrea&lt;/a&gt;. But following Mansfield’s departure, there would appear to be a vacancy in senior hardware engineers on that project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19PYcm"&gt;Riccio’s move is the latest departure from Apple’s executive leadership team in recent years, following legendary product designer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/28/20986838/jony-ive-last-day-apple"&gt;Jony Ive&lt;/a&gt; (who stepped down to form his own design firm, LoveFrom, in November 2019) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354367/apple-phil-schiller-fellow-greg-joswiak-head-marketing-store-events"&gt;Phil Schiller&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, who was replaced by Greg Joswiak in 2020 as Schiller refocused on running the App Store and Apple Events. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden wants to replace government fleet with electric vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PW58tzRJVIVSLnww26Ctf0oJA3E=/72x0:6368x4197/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68719405/All_New_Ford_E_Transit_06.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zcvx0Y"&gt;President Joe Biden will start the process of phasing out the federal government’s use of gas-powered vehicles and replacing them with ones that run on electricity. The announcement is the fulfillment of a promise Biden made on the campaign trail to swap government fleet vehicles with American-made EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nMouO"&gt;“The federal government also owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which we’re going to replace with clean electric vehicles made right here in America, by American workers,” Biden said during a briefing Monday announcing his “Buy American” executive order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nr3CGT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pres. Biden: "The federal government also owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which we're going to replace with clean electric vehicles made right here in America, by American workers."&lt;a href="https://t.co/figJbDMrpt"&gt;https://t.co/figJbDMrpt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/racgwk9VGw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/racgwk9VGw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ABC News Live (@ABCNewsLive) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABCNewsLive/status/1353809013348171778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Towotc"&gt;This is great news for US-based EV makers like Tesla, Rivian, and Lordstown, as well as legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors that are in the midst of multibillion-dollar investments in electric vehicle production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL7Xku"&gt;As of 2019, there were nearly 650,000 vehicles in the federal government’s fleet, &lt;a href="https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/vehicle-management-policy/federal-fleet-report"&gt;according to the General Services Administration&lt;/a&gt;. This includes 245,000 civilian vehicles, 173,000 military vehicles, and 225,000 post office vehicles. Those vehicles traveled 4.5 billion miles in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLU1mq"&gt;Biden also promised to create a system that offers rebates or incentives for consumers to replace gas cars with electric vehicles — though there aren’t any more details about that plan at this moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ueJtm1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Biden promised rebates for consumers to replace gas cars with electric vehicles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rRp2NS"&gt;The details of both plans are still being worked out, but taken together, they represent a huge win for the EV investments made by automakers over the last several years. Ford has said it will spend $11 billion introducing a raft of new EVs, including the Mustang Mach-E and an electric version of its best-selling F-150 pickup truck. GM has committed to spending $27 billion on electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxUJaS"&gt;Meanwhile, Tesla’s remarkable stock market rally throughout 2020 has made it the most valuable automaker in the world, and its CEO Elon Musk the richest man on the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANrji9"&gt;Biden’s order may not be a direct win for Tesla, though, which has mostly focused on luxury and performance vehicles. Automakers that could benefit include Ford, which recently unveiled an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21559954/ford-e-transit-electric-delivery-cargo-van-price-specs-range"&gt;electric version of its Transit vans&lt;/a&gt;, and GM, which just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;spun out a new company called BrightDrop&lt;/a&gt; focused on electric delivery vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lc0gCQ"&gt;One federal agency that could desperately use a new fleet of zero-emissions vehicles is the United States Postal Service. Hundreds of the agency’s mail trucks, which are manufactured by Northrop Grumman, have caught fire over the last several years, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3ezx4/post-office-delivery-trucks-keep-catching-on-fire"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; recently reported&lt;/a&gt;. And the USPS’s deadline for official bids to make its next-generation mail truck was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259037/usps-coronavirus-pandemic-next-generation-mail-truck-program-delay"&gt;delayed last year&lt;/a&gt; due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIcXgY"&gt;The program to replace the USPS’s current trucks was launched in 2015. But it has dragged on, forcing the postal service to keep its current trucks in service past their expected life span — despite the fact that they were introduced in the late 1980s and early ‘90s and lack features like air conditioning. Two of the original six companies have dropped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jnr6U"&gt;One of &lt;a href="https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/#"&gt;Biden’s goals&lt;/a&gt; is to create 1 million new jobs in the auto sector and to “position America to be the global leader in the manufacture of electric vehicles and their input materials and parts.” The president has said he will reach that goal by swapping out the government’s fleet for electric vehicles and through a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931983/schumer-electric-car-trade-in-gas-discount-proposal-zero-emission"&gt;“cash-for-clunkers”-style plan&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that every vehicle on the road is zero-emission by 2040. And he pledged to spend billions of dollars to add 550,000 EV charging stations in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22P2hj"&gt;Biden has also said he supports the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles and would be open to considering new incentives to encourage car buyers to consider making the switch to electric. Former President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-11-trump-budget-2020-electric-vehicle-tax-credit.html"&gt;tried to end the federal EV tax credit&lt;/a&gt; in his 2020 budget proposal but was not successful. Also under Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency rolled back Obama-era emissions rules aimed at forcing the auto industry to manufacture less-polluting vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZlwkE"&gt;Biden has already taken steps to roll back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201036/trump-epa-obama-fuel-economy-rule-rollback-emissions-consumer-cost"&gt;Trump’s rollback&lt;/a&gt; (roll forward?) of the Obama-era emissions rules. On the day of his inauguration, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-biden-executive-actions-transportati/biden-to-order-agencies-to-revisit-vehicle-tailpipe-emissions-standards-idUSL1N2JV08I"&gt;Biden ordered&lt;/a&gt; federal agencies to revisit fuel efficiency standards as well as rules governing emissions from airplanes and appliance and building energy efficiency standards. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Alexa can now act on its own hunches to turn off lights and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RIscYa8w5azfuiiycAFMbrXgNGQ=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68719335/dseifert_201025_4263_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qGEx5E"&gt;Amazon is enabling a new feature today that allows Alexa to proactively complete tasks around the house, such as turning off lights, based on your habits and frequent requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JceNR"&gt;Alexa has been able to sense these habits and ask about them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17883396/amazon-alexa-hunches-prediction-smart-home-ai"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt; — the company calls them “hunches” — but before this update, Alexa would ask permission before acting on something like lowering the thermostat before you went to bed. If the new proactive hunches are enabled, though, Alexa will skip asking for permission for a task and just do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W6V4DQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/whahElqS5eA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="24sgVb"&gt;While proactive hunches seem like they could make Alexa a lot more useful, having granular controls over what Alexa can automatically act on will be important. An Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G26GBKGQ228X44TH&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;support article&lt;/a&gt; seems to suggest you can select what types of hunches Alexa can complete on its own, but we’ve reached out to Amazon for more information on how much you can customize proactive hunches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHPvFO"&gt;Along with new Alexa abilities, Amazon is also rolling out its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454582/amazon-alexa-guard-plus-subscription-service-security-price-release-date"&gt;Guard Plus security subscription service&lt;/a&gt;. The service can alert you if Alexa picks up on certain types of sounds in your home and offers access to human agents who can call emergency services on your behalf, similar to ADT. You’ll be able to sign up for Guard Plus in the Alexa app, and it will cost $4.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhe7GL"&gt;Amazon is also rolling out an energy dashboard to the Alexa app that can monitor and estimate how much power compatible devices connected to Alexa use if their manufacturers support it. This can include anything from TVs to water heaters, and Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=21442874011&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a whole list of compatible products&lt;/a&gt; on its site about the new dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nerf’s new blasters curve their shots a la Angelina Jolie in Wanted</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M58h4BhLffvlotymKMnZEDV7qas=/0x3:500x336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68719289/nerf_rival_curve_shot_5.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zyu1QZ"&gt;Nerf’s got a new trick up its sleeve: Hasbro’s latest foam-flinging sidearms can &lt;em&gt;curve&lt;/em&gt; their shots, possibly letting you hit targets you can’t even see. (Think Angelina Jolie or James McAvoy in &lt;em&gt;Wanted &lt;/em&gt;but with bouncy balls instead &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1d4BewyhlI"&gt;of bullets&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RfYtul"&gt;That’s because each of Nerf’s three new Rival Curve blasters has an adjustable barrel you can twist to change the angle of your shot: left or right to shoot around corners, up to shoot straight, or down to lob balls over cover.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rdxgETv5mT-yDpMdgX0m8PKfTrM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258801/nerf_rival_curve_shot_5.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jUU3ug"&gt;Feeling skeptical? I would also be looking at this CG, especially considering &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZ4lCKv1ik"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MythBusters&lt;/em&gt; all but proved you can’t bend a real-life bullet&lt;/a&gt; over a decade ago. But you actually &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;curve toy projectiles like these foam balls. In fact, companies like Hasbro have already been doing it for years to increase their accuracy and range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZlvYf"&gt;When Hasbro first introduced its Rival lineup in 2015, it borrowed a feature popularized in airsoft guns called a “hop-up” — a nub that puts a backspin on the ball as it leaves the barrel, making it float in the air. It’s known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_effect"&gt;the Magnus effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onyJw1"&gt;Normally, a hop-up is designed to make a ball hop, well, &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt;, but the Nerf community has long known you can simply twist a hop-up to curve your shots instead. Here’s Out of Darts &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyFdjKcPUn0"&gt;demonstrating that in 2016&lt;/a&gt; (skip to 2:40 to be thoroughly convinced):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Eg3Nn"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VyFdjKcPUn0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PrChnR"&gt;Here, that twistable hop-up is coming to official blasters you can buy for between $15 and $30, including a single-shot pistol called the Flex; a neat bolt-action blaster with a 12-round internal magazine called the Sideswipe; and, best of all, a 20-round hopper-fed, pump-action blaster called the Helix, which has a genuine lip on its pump grip to keep your hands from sliding off, something that’s pretty dang rare in Nerf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jh6Qj7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10302404"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ANmxzY"&gt;Just know that you’re likely sacrificing a good bit of range to get that curve. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYKeTIV3J_I"&gt;An early demo on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; suggests it might be a pretty shallow curve to start. You may need a strong wind to get results like Hasbro is imagining in the image atop this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pucRFe"&gt;Here are the full details on each new blaster, straight from Hasbro. The first two will arrive in March, with the Helix set to be a Target-exclusive blaster in the US starting this August.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>5G boxes are coming to people’s homes, whether they want them or not</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KkVO6SfuvjlgEbC6yOjb84JnHg4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68719277/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nDFbTN"&gt;When most people look out their windows in the morning, they likely aren’t expecting to be surprised by a chest freezer-sized box that’s feeding a 5G antenna, but that’s the exact experience some Houston residents have been having. Verizon has been installing the boxes as part of its 5G network rollout since at least 2019, and from the &lt;a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Streamlined-5G-buildout-puts-ground-15889021.php#photo-20522171"&gt;reporting done by the &lt;em&gt;Houston Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it seems as if it’s been anything but smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzhQWp"&gt;The boxes are known as “ground fixtures,” and they supply power and data to 5G antennas that are placed on utility poles nearby. The ones gracing people’s front window views are being set up to build out Verizon’s 5G home internet service. It’s well-known at this point that, while millimeter-wave tech is blazing-fast, it also has terrible range. The solution to that is to blanket an area with antennas, and the equipment for that has to go somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZsLc77"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Streamlined 5G buildout puts ‘ground furniture’ in Houston’s front yards &lt;a href="https://t.co/je47v706lk"&gt;https://t.co/je47v706lk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Houston Chronicle (@HoustonChron) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HoustonChron/status/1352590511404675072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TAx3ol"&gt;The first speed bump is that Verizon is under no obligation to get permission from homeowners before installing the boxes. In fact, it’s not even required to notify them that it’s going to happen. This is because, technically, the boxes (and the utility poles that go along with them) are installed on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_verge#Terminology"&gt;right-of-way&lt;/a&gt;, which is land owned by the county. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3Qbk4"&gt;The permits to place the equipment are dirt cheap to telecoms, only costing $300. They used to be $2,700 before a law was passed by the state of Texas in 2017. But it’s not just Houston that’s having to deal with the surprise boxes, and it’s not just Verizon putting them down. This drama &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/03/18/want-5-g-wireless-box-front-your-house-editorials-debates/410824002/"&gt;has been playing out for years&lt;/a&gt; as telecoms are trying to expand their networks and prepare for the 5G transition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgCPlf"&gt;While it may be startling, there are other complaints homeowners have. A common one is that the cellular equipment &lt;a href="https://www.inquirer.com/business/5g-wireless-verizon-fios-bucks-county-doylestown-pole-20190904.html"&gt;brings their property values down&lt;/a&gt;, which can lead to some extreme emotional reactions. And then, perhaps worst of all, there’s the mistakes that can come with installing new equipment: the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;’s article tells of contractors digging into pipes and bursting them, flooding a street not with 5G signal, but with water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S65NJh"&gt;While the strife is currently limited to certain areas, it’s perhaps a sign of things to come. As 5G continues its rollout, we can probably expect to see many more stories like this, where the desires of homeowners push up against the desires of telecoms and the community at large. If discussions aren’t starting about how to deal with it now, the surprises are going to keep showing up — if not on our doorsteps, then at least somewhere in the vicinity. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slow certification process keeps some pharmacists from giving COVID-19 vaccines   </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New York City Close To Running Out Of Covid Vaccinations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d04AKXRGXO4Xo8Gm7aOCaKJYf60=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68718878/1297842349.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I8FnQI"&gt;When pharmacist Erin McCreary moved to Pennsylvania in 2018, she didn’t anticipate ever having to administer vaccines. She’d taken a vaccination certification course back in pharmacy school six years earlier, but it wasn’t part of her job description as an infectious diseases pharmacist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. That’s why she wasn’t concerned about the state pharmacy board rule that pharmacists had to file their certificate &lt;a href="https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.papharmacists.com/resource/resmgr/toolkits/Immunization_License_Applica.pdf"&gt;within two years&lt;/a&gt; of receiving it or they’d have to take the course again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2S4KCn"&gt;“Well, now, of course, COVID-19 happened,” McCreary told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. She wanted to sign up to help with COVID-19 vaccination efforts, so she emailed the board asking if they could waive the requirement. “I have my pharmacists license, I have my certificate from 2012,” she says. The board said no, she says, and that she had to retake the 20-hour course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXrSqg"&gt;Many pharmacists who work in community practices or drug stores give vaccines regularly and are set to help with COVID-19 vaccination efforts. But plenty of others, like McCreary, work in hospitals or academic medical centers and don’t normally give shots. Pharmacists who fall into that category in some states have been stuck navigating bureaucratic red tape before they can volunteer to help, at a time when health care centers and health departments need to scale up the contingent of people able to put shots in arms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGllSQ"&gt;“All of that is just delay, and time, and pushes back the available people that are able to do these,” says Monica Mahoney, the clinical pharmacy coordinator of infectious diseases at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Njc1ys"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All of that is just delay”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R2Olyw"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services put out &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/guidance/sites/default/files/hhs-guidance-documents/licensed-pharmacists-and-pharmacy-interns-regarding-covid-19-vaccines-immunity.pdf"&gt;a guidance&lt;/a&gt; in September saying that any pharmacist could give a COVID-19 vaccine. In order to perform the vaccinations, though, they’d have to complete a training and certification program. “It’s not like you can just say, I’m going to go give vaccines today, and learn on the job,” says Debbie Goff, an infectious diseases pharmacist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnESx8"&gt;Those courses are offered by groups like the American Pharmacists Association, which has seen a big uptick in interest in the certification program. Around 17,000 people have taken the course in the past few months, Daniel Zlott, senior vice president of education and business development for the American Pharmacists Association, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qGM4F"&gt;Today, most pharmacists take the course as part of their regular schooling. (Pharmacy schools started integrating them into curricula &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6630863/"&gt;around a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;.) Those who work in community pharmacies or at chains like CVS also usually have to be certified — giving vaccines, like the flu shot, is often a bit part of the job. But a swath of older pharmacists (who went to school years ago) or who don’t work in a community setting fall into a gap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="BMdbsL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a lot of barriers and red tape”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m0HbG9"&gt;“When we graduated, we weren’t trained in providing the vaccine. There’s a lot of barriers and red tape, and additional hurdles that we have to jump through,” Mahoney says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ix93Ps"&gt;The course itself is the first barrier: it’s a 20-hour course, involving both instructional hours and an in-person component where pharmacists and technicians have to perform injections under supervision. The American Pharmacists Association training is a great program, says Jason Gallagher, a clinical pharmacy specialist at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5gy5v"&gt;“I actually thought it was excellent. I learned from it, stuff I thought I already knew. But it’s overkill for what you need in order to actually vaccinate someone with a single vaccine that needs to be done millions of times,” Gallagher says. He thinks it could be condensed down to a few hours of instruction specifically targeted at the COVID-19 vaccine. McCreary agreed. “I feel like states could work together, and potentially organizations could work together, to come up with a crash course,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="finmvA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s overkill for what you need in order to actually vaccinate someone with a single vaccine.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i3EbMa"&gt;The courses are also expensive and can run $350 or $400. Gallagher had his payment covered by his employer, but he says he has colleagues who decided not to take the course — and, by consequence, not participate in COVID-19 vaccinations — because of the cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7ptCM"&gt;After obtaining certifications, pharmacists have to get clearance from their state pharmacy boards in order to immunize. Every state handles that process in a different way. Some want paper certificates mailed in before they sign off, Mahoney says. Others might want certain documentation notarized. Gallagher is getting certified in New Jersey, which asks for that step. “I had to have my application notarized, but for that, you go to a bank — and many bank lobbies aren’t open,” he says. “It’s silly things like that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0RQgx"&gt;The Pennsylvania and New Jersey state pharmacy boards did not respond to requests for comment by publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9IaTE"&gt;There’s a huge need to add to the COVID-19 vaccination workforce. Right now, at Temple University Hospital, vaccinations are limited by the number of people available to give them, Gallagher says. If he gets cleared, he’d be able to contribute to the effort and get more people in the community vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTCGS7"&gt;McCreary is currently taking a certification class and hopes to pitch in with the vaccination effort. Pharmacy chains like CVS and Walgreens are also hiring as many vaccinators as they can for short-term stints as they prepare to deliver shots to the broader community. “One of my friends applied for a job, and she told me she got a job offer the next day,” McCreary says. The friend works as an inpatient pharmacist, and the chain asked that she come in for a few shifts whenever she’s able. “Healthcare is 24-7,” McCreary says. “Maybe you work a weekend, so you have Wednesday off, and go vaccinate all day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnzFRB"&gt;Gallagher says he’s frustrated these kinks haven’t been worked out earlier in the vaccination process. “It doesn’t seem like it’s an all hands on deck operation to get everyone in the door and helping,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="kKDn2C"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0eLZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch SE review: pay a lot less to give up only a little","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6p1Qub"&gt;The best deal right now on the Apple Watch SE 40mm with GPS is at Amazon, which has knocked $10 off its normal price in gold or space gray, bringing the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5W9QWZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=f487a960520964ac860d89f77404bb1b&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;price down to $269&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYyAAC"&gt;The 44mm with GPS is also on sale at several retailers. The lowest you can currently get this model for at Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5QB5QT/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=f16e9235da90ab510af5e23d08d74daf&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$280 in silver with a white band&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XTRZD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b1bbcc98b9b514babd7b0198463cd917&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$294 in space gray&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5V7H7H/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b1bbcc98b9b514babd7b0198463cd917&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. Walmart also has this model on sale for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F168696232%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$280 in silver with a white sport band&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QdFhyi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 6 review: minute improvements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jwogLj"&gt;If you are looking for the 40mm with GPS, Amazon has the lowest price right now for this model: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5RBMRN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=6439a0460fc67d733f45fd0ffdf01e6a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$339 if you buy the watch in red&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5QC43Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=d928d23da9a8ddcd7d25142fa6b65927&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="pJw2UJ"&gt;Walmart has the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Space-Gray-Aluminum-Case-with-Black-Sport-Band-Regular%2F896460500%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray configuration for $339&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj7LGifJ1euP-dbrplwPMhD36I4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67781485/dseifert_191123_3810_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJm2GwlbGF56gpDmNhJwIgppWKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989898/dseifert_201025_4263_0002.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Echo Dot with LED display&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. There are no active deals for a single Echo Dot right now, but you can buy it for its usual price of $50 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B084J4MZK8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=9&amp;amp;imprToken=02bb7b89-6329-50a3-a29&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21988756%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fauthors%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1bb3f1fd7fd46e44af2bcb7b4e69ac37&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598862588130784" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. However, if you want a pair, Amazon is currently running a promotion that allows you to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B084J4MZK8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=6&amp;amp;imprToken=02bb7b89-6329-50a3-a29&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=a703bc6b8141b27e290f322ffa1dd1f6&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21988756%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy two for $10 off&lt;/a&gt; (before tax) when you enter the code &lt;strong&gt;DOT2PK&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version, but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40. Right now, there are no current deals for a single Echo Dot Kids Edition, but you can buy one for $60 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=3b2eb028219e410a9d64a5272c5f5c00&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;There are no active deals right now for a single Amazon Echo smart speaker, but you can get it right now for its usual price of $100 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085HK4KL6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=2dfe20818827f68bbc17c1bb24f2a7a8&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598980020491868" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770247%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon also has a few bundles going on right now; for $100, Amazon is also offering a bundle that includes &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KVFM2XM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=851994527ed58c86f5dc08317a8ee1a0&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one Echo smart speaker plus two Philips Hue Bulbs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, Amazon is currently running a promotion that allows you to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085HK4KL6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=2dfe20818827f68bbc17c1bb24f2a7a8&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy two for $20 off&lt;/a&gt; (before tax) when you enter the code &lt;strong&gt;ECHO2PACK &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is also selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $180&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $20 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is one of two smart displays to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90, but right now, you can buy the device at its best-ever price of $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=d1731cf9b61b13aa734867a184283f9a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Best Buy also has a few bundles currently available, including a $55 bundle that includes the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445461281046110" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and one 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445590854581686" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two Echo Show 5 units for just $90&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Show 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GGyBnu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device; this includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;Normally, this device costs $130, but it has seen some good price reductions in the past. We have seen the device go down as low as $65. But if you are looking to buy the device now, you can get it for just $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=219180a6a4a19b87c9c42ea655fce557&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy an Echo Show 8 on Amazon right now, you will also receive a one-year subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20884074/amazon-discovery-food-network-kitchen-guy-fieri"&gt;Food Network Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x04s5v"&gt;If you’re looking to buy a pair of Echo Show 8 devices, Best Buy is offering &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445786444943756" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two units for $160&lt;/a&gt;, $100 off the usual price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TQX4oe"&gt;In 2019, Amazon released its first pair of true wireless earbuds: the Echo Buds. The Echo Buds offer superb sound quality, a comfy fit, and Bose’s noise reduction features. And, of course, they also include Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
