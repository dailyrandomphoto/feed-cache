    <title>SEC chair calls for more power to regulate cryptocurrency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SEC Chairman Gensler Readies More Crypto Oversight To Protect Investors" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xEoHpkdQJL_7YjuSFli-XGBdAQc=/0x15:4000x2682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69673569/1234425306.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BDgFdd"&gt;On Tuesday, chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission Gary Gensler called on Congress to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-will-police-cryptocurrencies-to-maximum-possible-extent-chair-gary-gensler-says-11628007567?mod=e2twp"&gt;expand the agency’s authority&lt;/a&gt; in regulating cryptocurrency trading, lending, and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezyOF2"&gt;“Right now, we just don’t have enough investor protection in crypto. Frankly, at this time, it’s more like the Wild West,” Gensler said in a speech to the Aspen Security Forum Tuesday. “We have taken and will continue to take our authorities as far as they go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FypL1s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s more like the Wild West”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xrCnXV"&gt;Over the last few years, cryptocurrency tokens and platforms have flourished as US financial regulators have struggled to develop and apply to the new technology. Last December, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195834/cryptocurrency-fincen-regulations-private-wallets"&gt;proposed new regulations&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier for the federal government to track Bitcoin transactions in one of the few moves to monitor the market. But while other securities markets are directly overseen by federal regulators, but there is no single regulator in charge of overseeing cryptocurrencies as a financial market. Cryptocurrencies hit a record capitalization of $2 trillion earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-sec-chair-gensler-calls-162645064.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjTgqQ"&gt;Gensler’s remarks on Tuesday were some of the clearest he’s made regarding his thinking on cryptocurrency. Lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have called on regulators like Gensler to clamp down on the market. “These regulatory gaps endanger consumers and investors and undermine the safety of our financial markets,” Warren wrote &lt;a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/warren-asks-sec-chair-gensler-about-risks-posed-by-cryptocurrency-exchanges"&gt;in a letter to Gensler&lt;/a&gt; last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdbqy9"&gt;On Tuesday, Gensler responded by calling on Congress to give the SEC additional authority. “If we don’t address these issues, I worry a lot of people will be hurt,” Gensler said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTYEKS"&gt;On Sunday, a bipartisan group of Senate negotiators reached a deal on a $1 trillion infrastructure package that included some language on cryptocurrency markets. Specifically, the bill included changes that would define some players in the market as “brokers,” opening them up to greater IRS scrutiny. As of Tuesday, that language was altered to assuage concerns by the cryptocurrency community, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/us/politics/infrastructure-cryptocurrency.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple updates Mac Pro GPUs with new AMD Radeon options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Mac Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/93TofDu9HVHOOk2O6kqKkMDgKsY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69673316/awhite_200121_3873_0021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Avery White for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3AQ2yM"&gt;Apple is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmac-pro%2Ftower%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22607730%2Fapple-mac-pro-amd-radeo-pro-gpu-options" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;updating to the Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; with new graphics card modules on Tuesday, featuring options based on the AMD Radeon Pro W6000 series. The company claims the new Radeon Pro W6800X MPX Module, Radeon Pro W6800X Duo MPX Module, and Radeon Pro W6900X MPX module should give a boost to performance for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161358/mac-pro-review-apple-display-xdr-adobe-hardware-software-price-video"&gt;the graphics-heavy tasks Apple designed the Pro around&lt;/a&gt;. Continuing to support the Pro by bringing new GPU options to Apple’s custom Mac Pro Expansion Module (MPX) system is a pretty good sign that the company remains committed to its new, modular design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUaMPb"&gt;AMD &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2021-06-08-new-amd-radeon-pro-w6000-series-workstation-graphics-amd-rdna-2"&gt;first announced the new graphics cards in June this year&lt;/a&gt;, with the promise that the W6800 would bring “up to 79 percent faster performance than the previous generation.” Now a little over two months later, Apple claims in some cases the GPUs in their MPX forms can get “up to 84 percent faster performance when running Octane X” and “up to 23 percent faster performance when using DaVinci Resolve.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Mac Pro with two Radeon Pro W800X Duo MPX Modules.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FDvlUq"&gt;The GPU modules range in price per the listings on Apple’s store shared below, and each adds an additional four Thunderbolt 3 ports and an HDMI 2.0 port, regardless of the version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="u5RoKX"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Radeon Pro W6800X MPX Module:&lt;/strong&gt; an additional $2,400 “with 32GB of GDDR6 memory delivering up to 512GB/s memory bandwidth...[and] up to 16.0 teraflops of single-precision or 32.0 teraflops of half-precision computing.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GI7KTj"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Radeon Pro W6800X Duo MPX Module:&lt;/strong&gt; an additional $4,600 for two linked GPUs, “each with 32GB of GDDR6 memory delivering up to 512GB/s memory bandwidth ... [and] up to 30.2 teraflops of single-precision or 60.4 teraflops of half-precision computing” when two modules installed together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="F7KLQG"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Radeon Pro W6900X MPX Module:&lt;/strong&gt; an additional $5,600 “with 32GB of GDDR6 memory delivering up to 512GB/s memory bandwidth ... [and] up to 22.2 teraflops of single-precision or 44.4 teraflops of half-precision computing.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qUc1X3"&gt;Apple says the new GPU modules will replace the previous AMD Radeon Pro Vega II MPX Modules in the configure-to-order options on Apple’s website, and as standalone kits. As part of this new module launch Apple is also specifically phasing out the AMD Radeon Pro Vega II Duo MPX Module and AMD Radeon Pro Vega II MPX Module, but will still offer both in standalone kits for existing customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Proposed federal standard would require cars to ‘prevent or limit operation’ by impaired drivers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V9tO5Tlx_J1XM7t1J4RNyj5Agnk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69673055/acastro_181106_1777_flag_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a4VdjO"&gt;On Sunday, a bipartisan group of Senators published draft text of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605917/senate-negotiators-bipartisan-infrastructure-broadband-electric-vehicles-cryptocurrency"&gt;a massive new bipartisan infrastructure bill&lt;/a&gt;, proposing more than a trillion dollars in spending and a vast array of far-reaching provisions. But a little-noticed section in the bill could have significant implications in the fight against drunk driving, eventually mandating a new in-car safety technology to actively prevent Americans from driving while impaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnYIz1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/text"&gt;Introduced under the heading “Advanced Impaired Driving Technology,”&lt;/a&gt; the provision would require the Department of Transportation to set a new standard for detecting and preventing impaired driving. The bill calls on the secretary of transportation to release a standard within three years, with the requirement taking effect for new cars three years after that. The specific provisions of the standard are vague, but it would require cars to “passively monitor the performance of a driver of a motor vehicle to accurately identify whether that driver may be impaired” and “prevent or limit motor vehicle operation” if impairment is detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4qDIDo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The system would “passively monitor the performance of a driver ... to identify whether that driver may be impaired”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ahbAJ"&gt;The specific means of creating that system are still undetermined, but advocates say much of the technology is already available. Driver monitoring systems, which track a driver’s face or eyelids to ensure they are alert and actively piloting the vehicle, are already offered in some models by &lt;a href="https://lexusenthusiast.com/2007/09/08/a-look-at-the-lexus-ls-600hls-driver-monitoring-system/"&gt;Lexus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/cars/news/bmw/146565-bmw-live-cockpit-bmw-operating-system-7-0-infotainment"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.slashgear.com/mercedes-looks-to-new-sensors-so-lavish-2021-s-class-is-more-user-friendly-10628510/"&gt;Mercedes Benz&lt;/a&gt;. Systems like lane detection could also be used to detect impairment, creating an alert if the driver is consistently veering outside their lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bntwDc"&gt;“Twenty years ago, this technology didn’t exist,” says Jason Levine of the Center for Auto Safety. “[But] we have the technology available now. We can install tech in vehicles that helps to monitor whether someone is impaired and stops that person from hurting themselves or others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vphdkP"&gt;Crucially, the new standard wouldn’t be limited to drunk drivers. Because the systems measure impairment directly, they would be just as effective at detecting impairment from prescription drugs, emotional distress, or simple distraction. A longer-term effort would also seek to mandate passive alcohol monitoring systems, like those &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volvocars-safety/safety-first-volvo-to-add-in-car-sensors-to-prevent-drunk-driving-idUSKCN1R11SB"&gt;currently being developed by Volvo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqklaZ"&gt;While the provisions are aimed at creating a new mandatory requirement for automakers, such a requirement is still a long way off. Negotiations around the infrastructure bill are still in flux, and the provision could still be removed or altered by lawmakers. Even if it passes into law, the Department of Transportation will have wide leeway in how and when to implement the requirement and could easily delay it beyond the schedule set by Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27EskP"&gt;Still, auto safety advocates see this as a rare opportunity to fight back against impaired driving, which causes as many as 10,000 deaths a year by some estimates. “This will take some time, but you have to start somewhere,” says Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. “Seatbelts, airbags, electronic stability control: all of those technologies started with this kind of rulemaking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEV58i"&gt;Still, the new measures could face significant political blowback. Previous safety measures were essentially additional features protecting users in the event of a crash. But an impaired driving detector would directly limit the functionality of the vehicle, preventing users from driving at a moment when they would otherwise choose to drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tye40"&gt;But for auto safety advocates, the rising death toll from impaired driving is simply too urgent to ignore. “I think [the political fight] is a very real concern,” Chase says, “but we also have these victims whose family members were taken from them because someone got behind the wheel while impaired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHaMur"&gt;For auto safety advocates like Levine, it’s a proposal that’s worth fighting for. “Will there be some people who don’t like this feature? Sure,” he says. “What we’ve got is a generational opportunity to stop adding lists of victims of drunk drivers to these memorials, and do so in a way that is using existing technology and getting after the performance as opposed to the behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Chromebooks will now have Google Meet installed by default</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a Google Meet meeting on a Chromebook that includes five participants." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/njGW2i-o9g9ty-a8TbWzGhQIGFI=/31x0:969x625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69672919/5_people.max_1000x1000.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Google Meet app on Chrome OS.&lt;/em&gt; | Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oPQ5Us"&gt;With Chrome OS’s latest update, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/express-yourself-and-connect-with-others-on-chromebooks/"&gt;Google has announced&lt;/a&gt; that its Google Meet app will be preinstalled on all Chromebooks. The announcement is part of the company’s larger push to adapt its operating system for remote meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SKKoA"&gt;The new feature shouldn’t make too much of a difference to longtime Chromebook users who already have a preferred video chat platform installed. But for new students receiving a Chromebook for the first time, or other folks who are trying the platform out, it could certainly mean the difference between using Google Meet for meetings and social calls or turning to competitors like Zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4b1zE2"&gt;Google also says it’s made performance improvements to Google Meet’s experience, including “adapting video calls to different network conditions and adjusting video performance during screen sharing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40Qm7K"&gt;Updating Chrome OS hasn’t installed Google Meet in our recent testing, so this update only appears to apply to new Chromebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a Chrome window on a Chromebook with the new emoji picker emanating from the top text field." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6IV_Xtc-mdrcaT6NN-pJOiMEj7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758615/EmojiPicker_Default_EmojiInserted_1.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See your recently used emojis first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0m4gZn"&gt;The update also includes an updated emoji picker with a search bar (which you can bring up with the shortcut Launcher + Shift + Space), support for eSIM on eSIM-compatible Chromebooks (including the recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412759/acer-chromebook-spin-513-review-specs-price"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 513&lt;/a&gt;), a new digital magazine for kids and families in the Explore app, and a new collection of wallpapers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix documentary Countdown will follow SpaceX’s first civilian mission</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mcsYM3O_S4eL_cCV10QxGk9pY7c=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69672751/Countdown_Inspiration4_Mission_To_Space_DSC_4204.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Inspiration4/John Kraus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ywp3kp"&gt;The first “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261038/spacex-announces-first-all-civilian-mission-to-space"&gt;all-civilian&lt;/a&gt;” mission to space is set to blast off on a SpaceX rocket in mid-September, and the process of getting those astronauts trained and (eventually) into orbit will be documented in a new five-part Netflix series called &lt;em&gt;Countdown: Inspiration4 Mission To Space&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kuLLEi"&gt;Announced Tuesday, &lt;em&gt;Countdown &lt;/em&gt;is being billed by Netflix as the first documentary series from the streaming company to cover an event in “near real-time.” Netflix says the first two episodes will arrive on September 6th, followed by two more on September 13th. The company says SpaceX is targeting September 15th for the launch, and if that schedule holds, the fifth episode — a “feature-length finale” — will premiere by the end of the month. The documentary is being co-produced by Time Studios and will be directed by Jason Hehir, who created the Michael Jordan series &lt;em&gt;The Last Dance&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ip66cg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;From the director of ‘The Last Dance’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9LB2tG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A StoryBots Space Adventure, &lt;/em&gt;a “hybrid live-action animation special for kids and families,” is also in the works and will air September 14th. The show will explain the basics of the mission, how rockets work, and how people eat and sleep in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDogwm"&gt;Elon Musk’s space company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261038/spacex-announces-first-all-civilian-mission-to-space"&gt;revealed the civilian mission in February&lt;/a&gt;, which will see the crew live in the Dragon spacecraft for up to five days in orbit around the Earth. The CEO said at the time that he considers it an “important milestone towards enabling access to space for everyone.” It’s being commanded by Jared Isaacman, the CEO of Shift4 Payments, who is also using the mission to raise $200 million for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. (Isaacman donated the first $100 million to St. Jude when the mission was announced and is trying to raise $100 million more.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjxW6w"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Never imagined a Netflix documentary when we kicked off &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inspiration4x?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@inspiration4x&lt;/a&gt; just 8 months ago.  Amazing how fast things come together.  Proceeds from this directly benefit &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StJude?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@StJude&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; our $200 million fundraising objective. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7Wslcd6m8a"&gt;https://t.co/7Wslcd6m8a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jared Isaacman (@rookisaacman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rookisaacman/status/1422585135698878467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MAsZYu"&gt;SpaceX has since announced the three other civilians who will join Isaacman on the trip: geosciences professor (and two-time NASA astronaut candidate) Sian Proctor, who will be the “mission pilot”; Hayley Arceneaux, a physician assistant at St. Jude and pediatric cancer survivor, who will become the first person in space with a prosthetic body part; and US Air Force veteran (and Lockheed Martin engineer) Chris Sembroski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5Oiv4"&gt;As long as everything goes as planned, the Inspiration4 launch will be the realization of a longtime goal for Musk and SpaceX. The company has booked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465134/spacex-axiom-space-sign-bulk-deal-private-crew-dragon-missions"&gt;at least four other private missions&lt;/a&gt; on its Crew Dragon capsule and one on its massive Starship rocket, which — once fully developed — will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309546/japanese-billionaire-maezawa-dear-moon-spacex"&gt;fly around the Moon and back&lt;/a&gt;. Inspiration4 will wind up being the second space tourism launch of the year, though. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;Jeff Bezos joined three others on the first human mission&lt;/a&gt; on Blue Origin’s New Shepherd rocket / capsule combination in July. And Virgin Galactic is getting close to flying its first paying customers as soon as next year — the company’s billionaire founder Richard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;Branson rode to the edge of space with three other company employees&lt;/a&gt; in July to test the company’s SpaceShipTwo cabin experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQAFj3"&gt;Neither of those missions went into orbit, though, which requires far more speed and precision to achieve. SpaceX has already sent government&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;astronauts to orbit (and then to the International Space Station) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22398981/spacex-launches-third-nasa-astronaut-crew-used-crew-dragon-capsule"&gt;three times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fG16zG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fandango chooses Vudu as the way forward for its streaming business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YtHmJk4UWDjZBM6gSRYMIXkcvIA=/34x0:2494x1640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69672717/342818F3_F8B5_47DB_B149_A0CB69F22997.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Fandango&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u9LsSG"&gt;Fandango has announced that it will phase out the branding of its “FandangoNOW” streaming service and focus on Vudu as its lone app for rentals and purchases of movies and TV shows. The change means that Vudu will now become the default portal for rentals and purchases on many Roku devices, where FandangoNOW has long been the digital store for movies and TV content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2frsRf"&gt;Fandango says the united service will “offer more than 200,000 new release and catalog movies and TV shows to rent or buy, including the largest collection of 4K UHD titles and thousands of titles to watch for free — all with no subscription required.” It’ll also continue to support Movies Anywhere and the high-quality video streams that made Vudu popular among home theater enthusiasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRcor3"&gt;“By bringing its two services together on Vudu, Fandango will be able to rapidly innovate and make bolder, faster enhancements to benefit consumers and partners, especially important during an ever-changing media landscape,” Fandango said in today’s press release. “Vudu’s size, reach and breadth of content, paired with Fandango’s scale in theatrical ticketing, will provide even more opportunities for studios, brands and marketers to reach a massive high value entertainment audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipQ9Th"&gt;FandangoNOW customers can transition their accounts to Vudu beginning today. After that, their movie and TV show libraries will be provided through Vudu. The switchover from FandangoNOW to Vudu on Roku home screens should happen automatically. That prominent placement could be huge for the service. (Fandango goes out of its way to mention that Vudu supports Roku Pay for checkout.) The Vudu app icon is getting a little busier with the rebranding and will now have “— Fandango —” beneath it, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="jp3dkr"&gt;Walmart &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21228486/fandango-vudu-streaming-purchase-walmart-comcast-nbcuniversal-amazon-itunes"&gt;sold Vudu to Fandango last year&lt;/a&gt; for an undisclosed sum. Though Fandango is best known to many people for its movie ticket sales, it has a large digital network that includes Rotten Tomatoes, Flixster, and Movieclips; the company says the latter is the number one movie trailers channel on YouTube. Vudu has helped push along streaming video with high-bitrate streams combined with early and comprehensive support for Dolby Vision, Movies Anywhere, and unique programs like “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vudu.com%2Fcontent%2Fmovies%2Fd2d&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22607391%2Fvudu-fandango-now-combining-roku-movies-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disc to digital.&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s newest Xbox controller is a dazzling blue and has rubber side grips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vUh21rstzrTMzXYQ0lRgOfkbTfk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69672580/E73ordpVUAESCcY.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Aqua Shift Special Edition Xbox controller.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xVEGWx"&gt;Microsoft has just revealed its newest Xbox controller — &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/08/03/shimmer-up-your-controller-collection-with-the-aqua-shift-special-edition/"&gt;the Aqua Shift Special Edition&lt;/a&gt; — and it has a striking, shimmery blue finish that makes it perhaps Microsoft’s flashiest controller yet. But the shiny blue color isn’t its only distinctive feature: the controller also has rubberized side grips that have “a unique dual color swirl on every unit,” according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hylLIu"&gt;You can get a close-up look at the controller’s shiny finish and one of the grip patterns &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1422558271366303748"&gt;in a tweet from Xbox&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jZlIKj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Close up, far out. Aqua Shift’s marble grips keep you in control &lt;a href="https://t.co/L2VLND8aCI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/L2VLND8aCI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xbox (@Xbox) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1422558271366303748?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K7QzY4"&gt;You can preorder the Aqua Shift Special Edition controller now in “select Xbox markets worldwide” for $69.99. For me here in the US, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Faqua-shift-special-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s store&lt;/a&gt; shows an August 31st availability date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFHY1J"&gt;The Aqua Shift Special Edition joins &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%3Fxr%3Dshellnav%23controllers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the many other Xbox Series X / S controllers&lt;/a&gt; that have been released so far. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22531865/microsoft-xbox-design-lab-series-x-colors"&gt;also reopened the Xbox Design Lab in June&lt;/a&gt; to let players design their own custom controllers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boeing postpones its Starliner mission after detecting a technical issue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Boeing Orbital Flight Test-2 Prelaunch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E2dD15O2EC4s3W2SKP6f8nQcYGQ=/0x0:5006x3337/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69672320/1234403556.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Aubrey Gemignani /NASA via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9RRkxN"&gt;Boeing postponed the test launch of its uncrewed Starliner astronaut capsule on Tuesday, the company said in a statement. The delay was caused by a technical issue that popped up after lightning storms on Monday. Mission teams are determining whether the issues can be resolved in time for Starliner’s next launch opportunity on Wednesday around noon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3LJ86"&gt;During routine engineering checks the day before Starliner’s planned launch, engineers noticed the position of some valves within Starliner’s propulsion system appeared out of place, Boeing said, adding that the issue was detected “following yesterday’s electrical storms in the region of Kennedy Space Center.” Starliner was slated to launch atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on Tuesday at 1:20PM ET. But now “Boeing and NASA teams are assessing the situation” to see whether Starliner can fly on Wednesday at 12:57PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FhHIKB"&gt;The Starliner launch is a test mission without any humans aboard. It’s poised to fly to the International Space Station, demonstrate a clean docking procedure, and stay docked for roughly ten days before returning back to Earth. The mission comes more than a year and a half after Boeing’s first orbital Starliner test &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22595730/boeing-starliner-astronaut-capsule-launch-nasa-oft2"&gt;failed to reach the station&lt;/a&gt; and returned home earlier than planned in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GvyV2N"&gt;Tuesday’s launch “scrub” — industry jargon for a launch delay — marks Starliner’s second so far. The spacecraft was initially set to fly to space on Friday, July 30th, but a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600306/uncontrolled-firing-from-russian-module-causes-brief-tug-of-war-on-international-space-station"&gt;mishap involving Russia’s new science module&lt;/a&gt; at the ISS forced Boeing to postpone the launch to Tuesday as NASA made sure the space station was safe and ready for a new spacecraft arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSgezZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NyGY7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube creators can now get $10,000 per month for making Shorts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Three screenshots showing the interface of YouTube Shorts in beta. One shows a video, another shows a carousel of videos on the YouTube app’s main screen, and the third shows a grid of videos using the same sound." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IWPkpGiuvRt7v7-hl7L8GpheuuE=/0x1:4332x2889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69672262/youtube_shorts_beta.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dheGLX"&gt;YouTube will pay creators up to $10,000 per month for making popular videos on its TikTok competitor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334540/youtube-shorts-us-beta-tiktok-competition-launch"&gt;YouTube Shorts&lt;/a&gt;. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429350/youtube-shorts-fund-video-payments-tiktok-competitor"&gt;plans to pay $100 million&lt;/a&gt; throughout the next year, with the first payments going out this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TrX7e"&gt;The fund could mean a whole lot of cash for creators, but payouts aren’t guaranteed. The popularity needed to earn money will depend on just how many people are making and watching Shorts each month, and payouts will also depend on where each creator’s audience is located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWfP9W"&gt;YouTube is also requiring these to be original videos. Reuploads and videos tagged with watermarks from other platforms — aka TikTok, Snapchat, or Reels — will disqualify a channel for payments. The payments are only available in 10 regions for now, including the US, UK, India, and Brazil, among others, and YouTube says it plans on expanding that list “in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zmVYn1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The model has to work differently.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sum57e"&gt;Creators have traditionally gotten paid on YouTube based on the ads that run in front of their videos, with there being a direct relationship between the number of ad views and the amount of money they receive. But with Shorts, YouTube doesn’t want to run an ad in front of every quick clip, so it’s building out this alternate form of payment to reward creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDfOHF"&gt;The Shorts Fund will eventually be replaced with a “long-term, scalable monetization program,” Neal Mohan, YouTube’s chief product officer, said on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22370337"&gt;today’s episode of &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The fund is “a way to get going and to actually really start to figure out” how monetization should work for creators making these videos. “You’re essentially consuming a feed of shorts, and so the model has to work differently,” Mohan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHUfFw"&gt;Payment schemes like this have become increasingly common. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335404/tiktok-creators-monetization-fund-followers-youtube-content-videos"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; both pay out to creators based on the popularity of their videos, rather than based on ads. The result is potentially lucrative for creators, though there’s less transparency on how much creators may earn any given month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMC3Vm"&gt;For YouTube, the fund offers a way to kickstart its late-in-the-game effort at a short-form video service. Though TikTok has a huge head start, YouTube is, at the end of the day, YouTube — an enormous and hugely popular video platform — which could give it an edge as it tries to spin up Shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRohP3"&gt;Mohan indicated that YouTube wouldn’t require creators to use Shorts in order to boost their overall engagement on the platform. “Our goal there is to give every creator a voice,” Mohan said on &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;. “If the creator wants to do that through a two-hour documentary about a particular topic they’re passionate about, then YouTube should be the place for that. If they want to do that through a 15-second Short, that mixes in their favorite hit from their favorite music artists, they should be able to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Maps on iOS is finally getting a dark mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m4G8VE4wdz1u8VUKcn7f5mIbW-Q=/35x0:2612x1718/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69672241/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_3.19.53_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Maps’ dark mode on iOS.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zKLvei"&gt;Google Maps will finally be getting a dark mode on iOS, nearly two years after Apple rolled out dark mode &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20872972/apple-ios-13-review-iphone-update-dark-mode-arcade-maps-photos-siri"&gt;as part of iOS 13&lt;/a&gt;. The feature, which is arriving in the coming weeks, should be welcome for when you’re using the app at night or in dark environments. You can get an idea of what dark mode will look like in the picture at the top of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="su2nNx"&gt;To turn on dark mode, go to the settings menu, tap on dark mode, and then tap “on.” And if you want Google Maps to flip between light and dark mode to match your system settings, you’ll be able to do that, Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00Hdds"&gt;Google Maps on iOS is getting a couple other features in August as well. The app will support widgets and will offer two different options: one that shows the traffic conditions near you and another that has shortcuts for Google Maps’ search bar and places like your home or restaurants near you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5TUAX_fmNktFLzQv4whm0JQC_Zc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757320/Untitled.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Maps’ iOS widgets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GlHCNx"&gt;The widgets have already rolled out to me, and I noticed that the shortcuts on mine differed from the ones shown in the above press image. A Google spokesperson said that’s because the shortcuts are personalized based on a variety of factors, like your location, saved places, interests, and past searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsKyFH"&gt;Google will also soon let you share your live location from iMessage, which could be a handy way to tell your friends or family in a group chat where you are. By default, your location will only be shared for an hour, but you can share it for up to three days if you’d like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QG2vTD"&gt;When the feature is rolled out to you, tap the Google Maps icon in iMessage and you’ll see an option to share your real-time location.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uWoXz1qNWKCUPHwUZRjO1KC6kxY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757331/Untitled.gif"&gt;
