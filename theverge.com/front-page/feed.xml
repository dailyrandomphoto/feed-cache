    <title>Google struggles to fix its new Stadia game after shutting down own studios</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B625CFq1H0rW6wcImkOGS2rofLI=/0x0:1475x983/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68860608/stadia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z4QpcB"&gt;Google is struggling to fix one of its new Stadia games, after closing down its own in-house game studios earlier this month. &lt;em&gt;Journey to the Savage Planet &lt;/em&gt;debuted on Stadia on February 1st, the same day &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;Google shut down its Stadia studios&lt;/a&gt; and fired a number of developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qj7LpC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journey to the Savage Planet &lt;/em&gt;was developed by Typhoon Studios, a studio Google acquired to build out its first-party Stadia titles. Players of the game have found it’s riddled with bugs on Stadia, including game breaking issues that won’t let certain players get past the main menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AMDLBu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The game launched on Stadia earlier this month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iFHbun"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-02-23-stadia-struggling-to-fix-journey-to-the-savage-planet-bug-after-firing-developer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Reddit users have been complaining about the issues for weeks, and it’s not clear who will actually fix it. As employees at Typhoon Studios have either left Google or moved on to new roles, &lt;em&gt;Journey to the Savage Planet&lt;/em&gt; players on Stadia have been trying to reach out to Google, and publisher 505 Games. While 505 Games published the game on other platforms, it’s Google that owns all the game code and data according to a support response that &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/lp5ver/rant_google_im_disappointed_journey_to_savage/"&gt;Reddit users claim to have received&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ptb2be"&gt;That’s left players confused at who will fix the game, and Google has stepped in to promise it’s looking into the issues. “We’re aware of this and our team is diligently working with our partner publisher on a fix,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleStadia/status/1363426586943389696"&gt;says the Stadia team on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. A Google employee also posted on the Stadia subreddit to confirm the company is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/lqc1io/update_regarding_issues_with_journey_to_the/"&gt;looking into the issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VTilo"&gt;It’s not clear when a fix will be available, and the game is still bundled free as part of Google’s Stadia Pro subscription. &lt;em&gt;Journey to the Savage Planet&lt;/em&gt; was one of the first games to launch from Google’s Stadia Games and Entertainment first party internal development organization. It’s now shaping up to be a memorable last one, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dream of mid-air wireless charging teased with rollable Oppo X</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YnofQDNtJeeqWU0JBdKfWuyPlgY=/88x0:736x432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68860411/Jyr8m06UdO.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OHAS6g"&gt;Oppo has teased a new wireless charging solution that works when a phone is up to 10 cm (3.9 inches) away from a charging pad. The company has shown off its Wireless Air Charging tech in a &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4607703588020148"&gt;30-second clip on its Weibo page&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.oppo.com/en/newsroom/press/oppo-to-unveil-innovations-partnerships-at-mwcs-2021/"&gt;coincide with MWC Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;. The clip shows the Oppo X 2021 rollable concept phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571056/oppo-x-2021-rolling-phone-ar-glass-concept-inno-day-2020"&gt;announced in November&lt;/a&gt;, charging above the pad, even when held at an angle. The technology offers charging speeds of up to 7.5W, Oppo says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgVaeJ"&gt;The Chinese manufacturer is the latest to announce a truly wireless air charging solution, following Xiaomi and Motorola’s teases from earlier this year. Back in January, Xiaomi announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255625/xiaomi-mi-air-charge-technology-wireless-charging"&gt;Mi Air Charge Technology&lt;/a&gt;, which it says can charge multiple devices at 5W “within a radius of several meters.” The next day, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/motorola-no-contact-wireless-charging/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on a demonstration from Motorola which showed one of its phones charging 100 cm (40 inches) away from a charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CWsriV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"&gt;Your browser does not support HTML5 video.&lt;source src="https://f.video.weibocdn.com/002un6p6gx07KAuN5DFt01041200ctFy0E010.mp4?label=mp4_1080p&amp;amp;template=1920x1080.25.0&amp;amp;trans_finger=0bde055d9aa01b9f6bc04ccac8f0b471&amp;amp;media_id=4607697065279496&amp;amp;tp=8x8A3El:YTkl0eM8&amp;amp;us=0&amp;amp;ori=1&amp;amp;bf=4&amp;amp;ot=h&amp;amp;ps=3lckmu&amp;amp;uid=3ZoTIp&amp;amp;ab=3915-g1,966-g1,3370-g1,1493-g0,1192-g0,1191-g0,1258-g0&amp;amp;Expires=1614082265&amp;amp;ssig=gG5MHIjc46&amp;amp;KID=unistore,video" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="37mkFZ"&gt;At 10 cm, the range of Oppo’s technology is more limited than Xiaomi’s competitor, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oppo-contactless-charging-1203197/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;. The video’s presenter makes a very deliberate effort to hold the phone directly above the charging mat. However, the charging is shown working even when the phone is slightly tilted above the wireless charger, and while playing back a video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPJyZN"&gt;Distinctions like this are academic right now since none of these technologies have been released in commercial products. Xiaomi has confirmed its technology won’t be ready to release this year, and the rollable phone that Oppo used for its demonstration also doesn’t have an official release date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lU0Nt3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A closer look at Wireless Air Charging&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working on or off axis with the charger, you can charge up and use the smartphone at the same time without being tethered to a charging stand or cable!      &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MWC21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MWC21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOxMWC21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPOxMWC21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/9iiunPBzPs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9iiunPBzPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OPPO (@oppo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1364108983821234178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NVDxYm"&gt;As well as developing wireless chargers that work over longer distances, manufacturers are also working to make standard wireless charging faster. Xiaomi is developing an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522730/xiaomi-mi-80w-wireless-charging-technology-announced"&gt;80W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; solution, which it announced just months after Oppo revealed its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325289/oppo-125w-fast-charging-65w-airvooc-wireless-charger"&gt;65W wireless charging tech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YGJC1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 23rd, 6:53AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with official name of charging solution, and more details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s an interactive 4K view of Perseverance’s Mars landing site</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x7S8PCm-Qp1z7kKm0nSW1nFk_vg=/86x0:2465x1586/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68860299/mars_rover_360.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uqzMmt"&gt;NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has posted an interactive 360-degree view of the Perseverance landing site on Mars in 4K resolution. It’s the latest jaw-dropping imagery to return from the mission, including that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295739/nasa-perseverance-rover-landing-mars-video-footage"&gt;incredible video&lt;/a&gt; of the rover plunging through the Martian atmosphere before being “skycraned” down to the surface of the red planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8wmdpi"&gt;The 60-second video was captured by Perseverance’s color Navcams perched atop a sensing mast above the rover. The 360-degree scene can be navigated in a browser or in the YouTube app on your phone or 4K smart television. The images were captured on February 20th, two days after the Perseverance landed in the Jezero Crater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lq2RVo"&gt;Perseverance has a total of &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/cameras/"&gt;23 cameras&lt;/a&gt;, the most of any Mars rover to date: 16 for engineering and science and another seven that recorded those dramatic images of entry, decent, and landing. Audio captured at the landing site by Perseverance’s microphones has also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fnasa%2Ffirst-sounds-from-mars-includes-rover-self-noise&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F23%2F22296788%2Finteractive-4k-360-degree-view-mars-perseverances-landing-site" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;been posted to NASA’s Soundcloud account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NASA image showing location of the two color Navcams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XYV3PZ"&gt;NASA’s Perseverance mission has already made public a total of &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/"&gt;4,796 raw images to date&lt;/a&gt;. Perseverance is capable of transmitting data at rates up to 2Mbps to the orbiters overhead. The Mars orbiters then relay the data back to Earth using their much larger antennas and more powerful transmitters. The video of the vehicle descending down to the surface amounted to about 30GB of images stitched together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dMAHQ"&gt;The Perseverance rover is designed to seek signs of life and better understand the ancient geology of Mars. It will spend at least one Mars year (two Earth years) exploring the area around the landing site.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook brings back news after Australian government amends upcoming law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xub-iudHy2nODLjOZTmQ3XP_H4Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68860276/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EvhhJ5"&gt;Facebook will restore news content to its platform in Australia after the government agreed to amend its proposed News Media Bargaining Code. In an &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/"&gt;update posted today&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s William Easton, managing director of Australia and New Zealand, said that the company is “satisfied that the Australian government has agreed to a number of changes and guarantees that address our core concerns.” News content will return to the platform “in the coming days,” Easton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSYHRd"&gt;Facebook and Google have been at loggerheads with the Australian government about an upcoming law that will require them to pay publishers for content shared on their platforms. In response to the proposed bargaining code, Facebook took the extreme measure last week of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287776/facebook-block-news-australia-regulation-media-link-sharing"&gt;blocking news from being shared on its platform&lt;/a&gt; by Australian users and publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJ351b"&gt;The amendments, which were outlined in a &lt;a href="https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/media-releases/additional-amendments-news-media-and-digital"&gt;release from the Australian government&lt;/a&gt;, include giving tech companies and publishers two months to reach agreements with one another, which &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/technology/facebook-australia-news.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; appears to give Facebook more time to strike deals, similar to those reached by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SXnPRi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook has committed to entering into good-faith negotiations with Australian news media”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8ld5mM"&gt;Another amendment notes that the government should take into account whether a tech company has already reached commercial agreements with the Australian news industry. The &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; notes that this opens the door to Facebook and Google to avoid the most feared aspects of the bargaining code by signing more media to their respective Facebook News and Google News Showcase products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qnhcb4"&gt;The big US tech companies are particularly concerned about the law forcing them into arbitration with news companies if they can’t reach a deal. They claim this arbitration process underestimates the value their services provide to news publishers, such as web traffic that can then be monetized with ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pscPIF"&gt;In a statement, Facebook’s vice president of Global News Partnerships Campbell Brown said the Australian government “has clarified we will retain the ability to decide if news appears on Facebook so that we won’t automatically be subject to a forced negotiation.” She added that it means Facebook can “support the publishers we choose to, including small and local publishers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XJ9Fg"&gt;Responding to the deal, Australian treasurer Josh Frydenberg said “Facebook has committed to entering into good-faith negotiations with Australian news media businesses and seeking to reach agreements to pay for content,” the &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-agrees-to-last-minute-amendments-to-media-code-20210222-p574kc.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoP0eE"&gt;While Facebook took the extreme step of blocking all news in the country in response to the law, Google has been busy &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/feb/17/news-corp-agrees-deal-with-google-over-payments-for-journalism"&gt;brokering deals with the country’s news publishers&lt;/a&gt; to pay them as part of its News Showcase product. As part of the product, Google is also making deals with international publishers to cover other publications around the world. Initially, Google had also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243468/google-threatens-to-remove-its-search-engine-from-australia-if-new-law-goes-into-effect"&gt;threatened to withdraw services from Australia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KA3Ae3"&gt;With the amendments signed off on Tuesday morning, the &lt;em&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt; notes that the legislation could pass through the country’s Parliament as soon as Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk co-authored a COVID-19 antibody study of SpaceX workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w4VKnorc3O8vxoTR9A85nZzt9Ew=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68859326/llopatto_180917_2962_0027.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Elizabeth Lopatto / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KGzjQm"&gt;More that 4,300 SpaceX employees volunteered to be part of a COVID-19 antibody study co-authored by CEO Elon Musk in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ocuyw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-021-21336-8&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22295821%2Fspacex-employees-covid-study-paper-antibody-research-elon-musk" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt;, which was recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, shows evidence that infected people who exhibited milder symptoms developed less of an immunity to COVID-19 than those who got sicker from the disease. The group behind the study found some evidence that suggests there’s a particular threshold of antibodies that could provide immunity, though they wrote that “the precise levels [...] associated with protection from re-infection remain unclear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nmst0R"&gt;Vaccines also produce a much stronger immune response than cases with little to no symptoms, the authors note. They hope that this research, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/health/covid-vaccine-single-dose.html"&gt;other studies like it&lt;/a&gt;, could help policymakers figure out how to distribute limited vaccine supplies effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OI32Bo"&gt;SpaceX employees were asked by email in April 2020 to be a part of the study — right around the time that Musk was spreading dangerous misinformation about the virus in internal company emails and on Twitter. In March 2020, Musk told SpaceX employees in an email that he believed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179291/elon-musk-coronavirus-tesla-memo-car-accident-deaths-comparison"&gt;they were more likely to die in a car crash than of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, and that he didn’t see the virus being “within the top 100 health risks in the United States.” He also tweeted that same month that there would “probably close to zero new cases” in the US “by [the] end of April.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PCWMle"&gt;&lt;q&gt;92 percent of the volunteers were male&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hbvaLV"&gt;Nearly 500,000 Americans have died since. Musk contracted COVID-19 in November 2020 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21563590/elon-musk-tests-postive-coronavirus-pcr-antigen"&gt;said he experienced mild symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QErQut"&gt;The spaceflight company had its existing medical director — who oversees SpaceX’s budding human flight program — work with an infectious disease expert from Harvard and a doctor from the Ragon Institute &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-got-4-000-spacex-workers-to-join-a-covid-19-study-heres-what-he-learned-11613826001"&gt;to develop the antibody testing program&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. A group of 30 total co-authors from MIT, Harvard, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Howard Hughes Medical Center, SpaceX, and others collaborated on the study. The effort received funding from, among others, the National Institutes of Health, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22221173/elon-musk-tesla-foundation-philanthropy-wealthiest-person"&gt;Musk’s own charitable foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the Gates Foundation’s COVID-19 &lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2020/11/Gates-Foundation-announces-new-funds-to-develop-COVID-19-vaccines"&gt;vaccine accelerator&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/hrp/tri"&gt;NASA’s Translational Research Institute for Space Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFOkl9"&gt;The employees who signed up gave blood samples roughly every month. The paper’s authors note that 92 percent of the volunteers were male, and the median age was 31, which could skew the results. The full paper and dataset &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-021-21336-8&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22295821%2Fspacex-employees-covid-study-paper-antibody-research-elon-musk" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are available for free on Nature’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG denies the Rollable phone has been put on hold</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TqQeaVOklqPzLrYnZIpT9moH_yE=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68859280/LGRollable.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="71AgBO"&gt;LG Electronics has told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company’s phone with a resizable screen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;the LG Rollable&lt;/a&gt;, has not been put on hold. “I can firmly deny that any such decision on future mobile products has been finalized,” says an LG spokesperson. The denial comes in response to &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210222005600320"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Yonhap News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that LG had reportedly told parts suppliers that the Rollable had been put on hold and that they could request a refund for their development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WO1AeI"&gt;Denying that a final decision has been made is not quite the same thing as reassuring everyone that the Rollable is still coming in 2021, but it could reflect the general uncertainty that comes with designing, manufacturing, and shipping complicated electronics during a global pandemic. And it could also be that the &lt;em&gt;Yonhap News&lt;/em&gt; report is somewhere near the truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iidMdy"&gt;LG also firmly denied a report in January that it was planning to exit the smartphone business, and Korean outlet &lt;em&gt;TheElec &lt;/em&gt;wound up deleting that report, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240282/lg-smartphone-business-exit-2021-internal-memo"&gt;only to see LG turn around later and admit that it was indeed considering an exit from smartphones&lt;/a&gt;, even if the decision hadn’t been finalized yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cqafV"&gt;If LG did decide to put the Rollable on hold, it could be to change release dates or to re-engineer some part of its design. Not every change in manufacturing schedule necessarily means cancellation. It would probably come as a surprise to LG employees if it did get canceled, though: &lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt;’s now-deleted story originally suggested that smartphone business or no, Project I (LG’s codename for the Rollable) would continue, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lg-not-shutting-down-smartphone-business/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgPYyP"&gt;LG has had a hard time competing with other smartphone makers like Samsung or Huawei, and its smartphone business has lost approximately $4.5 billion over the last five years. But it has seemed committed to making sure the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;LG Wing&lt;/a&gt; isn’t the last “unique” phone design it releases. The Rollable’s future is uncertain, but the story definitely isn’t over yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLBw29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BATTGi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDHcEJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejHZqN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Is1ek"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWy0oK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXKiuW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google has finally added iOS’s privacy labels to Gmail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lDiTaGgRPH8tpV59gVwCp7BsgcU=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68859215/IMG_0879.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Pn0zK"&gt;Google has finally added Apple App Store privacy labels to its Gmail app, almost a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250648/google-apple-app-store-privacy-label"&gt;we ran an article wondering what was taking so long&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/google-gmail-app-privacy-labels/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The app is the second major Google app to get the labels, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/13/22282000/google-bug-fix-ios-youtube-app-privacy-apple-gmail-docs-search-update"&gt;they were added to YouTube&lt;/a&gt; when it was updated earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohaNAl"&gt;So how does it look? Well, that’s up for you to decide. The app apparently shares your coarse location and user ID with advertisers, as well as information about your interaction with advertisements. According to the privacy label, though, it doesn’t collect your name, physical address, or phone number (though as an email client, Gmail obviously collects your email address). Location data is also used for analytics and there are some features of the app that will request it as well. If you want to see the full label, there’s a video below that scrolls through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xqi01Q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What does the app privacy label for Gmail look like? See for yourself. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LpOPfg4Iq2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LpOPfg4Iq2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1364014742419828743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jIwgfq"&gt;For contrast, here’s the app privacy information for another email app, Hey. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oIoCTNloyt8hSUXVNmV2j_Uazt8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22321818/IMG_0882.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The information Hey requests fits on one page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="57dzTT"&gt;It is worth noting that Apple’s app privacy labels are meant to show all the things that the app &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; access, not what information that app &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; access. For example, an app may only use location data when it needs to show you a map, but the privacy labels don’t make that clear — it’s just a binary used/not used. Also, the information in the labels is submitted by the company itself, and Apple doesn’t make promises about its accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59vquM"&gt;Strangely, Google added the labels without actually updating the Gmail app, even though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277304/google-ios-apps-out-of-date-update-message"&gt;it was literally crying out for an update&lt;/a&gt; (because of a fun bug). The last time Google updated the iOS app was two months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zzyIO"&gt;So far, Google’s other large apps like Maps, Photos, Docs, and Chrome haven’t gotten the labels yet. But the fact that both YouTube and Gmail have had them added indicates that Google is starting to roll them out to its bigger apps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says Starlink internet speeds will double to 300Mbps this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ssh5y_HqBQk8flDyMaCEK7q7SOA=/426x0:2418x1328/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68858859/Screen_Shot_2020_09_03_at_10.38.05_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4g4FjE"&gt;Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite-based internet provider, will double in speed “later this year”, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1363763858121256963?s=20"&gt;a tweet by Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;, posted as a reply to someone who had just received their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536073/spacex-starlink-public-beta-testing-email-user-terminal"&gt;Starlink beta kit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/elon-musk-spacex-will-double-starlinks-satellite-internet-speeds-in-2021/?ServiceType=facebook_page&amp;amp;UniqueID=D7D4F968-7539-11EB-B2F4-9E263A982C1E&amp;amp;PostType=link&amp;amp;ftag=COS-05-10aaa0a&amp;amp;TheTime=2021-02-22T18:14:45"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company &lt;a href="https://www.starlink.com"&gt;currently promises speeds between 50 to 150Mbps&lt;/a&gt;, and Musk specifically calls out a 300Mbps goal in his tweet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Z4EGl"&gt;While 300Mbps isn’t unheard-of speed, it’s faster than many people currently have access to, especially in the low-to-medium population density areas that Musk talks about targeting in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1363774017606348802?s=20"&gt;a second tweet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4z4Yxo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Speed will double to ~300Mb/s &amp;amp; latency will drop to ~20ms later this year&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1363763858121256963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="jAsFxM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Most of Earth by end of year, all by next year, then it’s about densifying coverage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Important to note that cellular will always have the advantage in dense urban areas. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Satellites are best for low to medium population density areas.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1363774017606348802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MbHOoo"&gt;In the reply, Elon also tells the person that their latency should improve to around 20ms as well. In the speed test screenshots, their latency was at 34 and 44ms respectively, while Starlink’s website says to expect between 20 and 40ms during the beta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdLDn1"&gt;The speed increase and latency improvements should come as a nice surprise to anyone who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;put down a $100 Starlink pre-order&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s well known that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/8/7/20758944/elon-musk-twitter-tesla-funding-secured-private-420"&gt;Elon’s promises about the future should be taken with a grain of salt&lt;/a&gt;, especially if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/27/13024542/elon-musk-spacex-mission-to-mars-preview-budget-schedule-nasa"&gt;they’re about timelines&lt;/a&gt;. Still, this shows that SpaceX is looking to speed up Starlink, and it might be able to keep pace with what’s available from a copper wire running to your house. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lucid Motors is going public in a major SPAC merger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lGzfPBEZNRPgCMsbUSBai1eVL3k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68858569/akrales_170324_1554_A_0021.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LX5SBy"&gt;Lucid Motors is going to become a publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange in a deal that will leave the electric vehicle startup with $4.4 billion in cash. The California startup, which is majority-owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, plans to start shipping its first luxury electric vehicle — the 500-mile range Air sedan — later this year. An electric SUV is slated to follow in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxUhx6"&gt;Much like many other startups in the automotive space have done over the past year, Lucid Motors is skipping the traditional path to becoming a publicly-traded company and is instead merging with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, Lucid Motors is merging with Churchill Capital Corp IV, which is already listed on the NYSE. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; first reported that Lucid Motors and Churchill — which is run by investor Michael Klein, who has architected deals for Saudi Arabia in the past — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/lucid-motors-said-to-be-in-talks-to-list-via-michael-klein-spac?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;were in talks back in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZLjky"&gt;Roughly $2.1 billion of that cash will come from Churchill. Some $2.5 billion will come from a new round of funding running concurrently with the merger, which is anchored by Saudi Arabia but includes BlackRock, Fidelity Management, and others. Some will go to fees, the rest will go to the newly combined version of Lucid Motors. The deal values Lucid Motors at $24 billion. It’s expected to close in the second quarter of this year, and Lucid Motors’ shares will trade on the NYSE under the ticker “LCID.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jibxp0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lucid Motors is the latest EV startup to do a SPAC merger&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DMKFCk"&gt;Led by Peter Rawlinson, a former Tesla engineer who helped bring the Model S to life, Lucid Motors was founded way back in 2007 as Atieva. It was initially focused on battery technology, but ultimately pivoted into becoming an electric vehicle startup a few years ago. It has since grown to more than 2,000 employees and begun construction on a $700 million factory in Arizona where the Air will be built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvzIT1"&gt;Like many of its peers, Lucid Motors struggled for a time as it searched for new funding. Complicating matters was the fact that Jia Yueting, the founder of fellow EV startup Faraday Future, wound up owning around 30 percent of Lucid Motors. Jia became an obstacle in the company’s fundraising efforts, which &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/20/15999024/lucid-motors-ford-funding-tesla-electric-car"&gt;included solicitations from major OEMs like Ford&lt;/a&gt;. (Ford ultimately forged its own path into EVs, though it has supplemented that effort with a partnership with Volkswagen and&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240212/ford-lincoln-cancel-rivian-suv-ev-coronavirus-pandemic-investment"&gt; an investment in buzzy EV startup Rivian&lt;/a&gt;.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyAqOr"&gt;In the meantime, Lucid Motors turned to hedge funds for loans to keep the lights on, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/20/17757218/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-funding-tesla-billion"&gt;using its intellectual property as collateral&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;first reported in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Nphkv"&gt;Lucid Motors eventually found a savior in Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, or PIF. PIF pledged &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302524/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-pif-investment-majority-shareholder"&gt;more than $1 billion to Lucid Motors in 2018&lt;/a&gt; (just a few weeks shy of the slaying of Jamal Khashoggi) in exchange for majority ownership in a startup that aligned with the clean energy ambitions touted by the Kingdom’s de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HF0WB7"&gt;According to the investor presentation published Monday, PIF currently owns 85 percent of Lucid Motors following a new injection of $600 million that is supposed to sustain the startup until the SPAC deal is closed. Jia is &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/1/18511540/silicon-valley-foreign-money-china-saudi-arabia-cfius-firrma-geopolitics-venture-capital"&gt;reportedly now out of the picture&lt;/a&gt;, and Faraday Future is one of the many other EV startups to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22247942/faraday-future-spac-merger-public-psac-property-solutions-nasdaq"&gt;announce a SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzc5hj"&gt;Since then, Lucid Motors has been hard at work prepping the tech-forward luxury Air sedan for its debut. The car leverages the company’s long history in battery technology to deliver more than 500 miles of range, which would make it as capable as Tesla’s most advanced Model S sedan. Lucid Motors also plans to sell it directly to customers, much like Tesla and other EV startups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="bmNHu8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Unlike other EV startups, Lucid Motors has a long history&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bBOz2C"&gt;That battery tech is one reason Klein’s SPAC is investing so deeply into Lucid Motors, &lt;a href="https://www.lucidmotors.com/files/lucid-investor-deck-february-2021.pdf"&gt;according to the investor presentation&lt;/a&gt;. Lucid Motors has “untapped potential in battery storage solutions and powertrain technology licensing,” the companies write. They imagine the batteries specifically being used in everything from commercial vehicles, to helicopters or drones and other aircraft, and heavy equipment, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jU46vU"&gt;The investor presentation also talks up Lucid Motors’ growing cache of executive talent. That includes former Apple VP Michael Bell, who helped bring the iPhone into the world. Bell was previously CTO of Rivian until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21143374/rivian-cto-mike-bell-left-apple-intel"&gt;he abruptly left last February&lt;/a&gt;. Former Tesla executives Peter Hochholdinger (manufacturing) and Peter Hasenkamp (supply chain) are also among Lucid Motors’ executive ranks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AC4i4n"&gt;Lucid Motors believes it can generate gross profits as soon as 2023, which is when its first SUV — called Gravity — will debut, and to get truly into the black by 2025. It expects to be able to make and sell 20,000 cars in 2022, 49,000 in 2023, and as many as 500,000 cars a year (including the Air, the Gravity SUV, and future models) by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is bringing back Twisted Metal... as a TV show</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vk0oCLWqIPpJD2lywHB0MeFlLtU=/0x100:1322x981/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68858065/Twisted_metal.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dXeJYE"&gt;Sony is bringing back its &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal &lt;/em&gt;franchise, but this time it’s going to be a TV show, not a video game. &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/twisted-metal-tv-series-deadpool-writers-1234911825/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the show is moving ahead in its production, with the writers of &lt;em&gt;Deadpool&lt;/em&gt; and actor Will Arnett signed on as executive producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5i8WA"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal&lt;/em&gt; games center mainly around getting in a heavily armored car and blowing other drivers up. The series, which the head of PlayStation Productions calls “one of the most beloved franchises from PlayStation,” started on the original PS1 and got releases on the PS2 and PS3 as well (though my personal favorite was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_Metal:_Head-On"&gt;the PSP version&lt;/a&gt;, which I sunk hours upon hours into). The series went dormant during the years of the PlayStation 4, however, with no signs of a console comeback any time soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JztXeL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The show will be going for a comedic (but probably not lighthearted) tone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9NcR4f"&gt;The show’s plot synopsis reads like a cross between &lt;em&gt;Mad Max &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Death Race&lt;/em&gt;, with a car thief and vague protagonist having to fight down highways to deliver a package. It’s also rumored to include Needles Kane, the terrifying clown whose face or ice cream truck (named Sweet Tooth) grace the cover of pretty much every game in the series. If you’ve been bummed that &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal: Apocalypse &lt;/em&gt;never saw the light of day, maybe this TV show will scratch that itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpQjMW"&gt;While the idea for the series seemingly came from Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, who wrote the &lt;em&gt;Deadpool &lt;/em&gt;movies, the actual writing was done by &lt;em&gt;Cobra Kai&lt;/em&gt;’s Michael Jonathan Smith. It seems like the show will be going for a comedic (but probably not lighthearted) tone, with Sony Pictures’ Glenn Adilman, the company’s executive vice president of comedy development, calling the script “action-packed [and] brilliantly funny.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXSpdb"&gt;The return to the property comes after a long drought: the first &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal &lt;/em&gt;game came out in 1995, and the most recent one was released in 2012 for the PlayStation 3. It’s a bit strange that Sony is making a television show about a franchise that hasn’t seen a release in almost a decade — especially since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261214/destruction-allstars-playstation-5-ps5-sony-interview-cars-demolition-derby"&gt;one of the flagship PS5 games is &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has the same theme of vehicular violence. That’s not to say that &lt;em&gt;AllStars &lt;/em&gt;should’ve been a &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal &lt;/em&gt;game, just that it might be a bit awkward if the &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal&lt;/em&gt; show and &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; were stopped at a red light next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDwCgS"&gt;It’s unclear when the show will come out, but it probably won’t be any time soon — it seems like it’s just now cleared to start production. It’s also worth noting that Sony has tried to make a &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal&lt;/em&gt; movie before, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2012/02/ghost-riders-brian-taylor-in-7-figure-sony-deal-to-writedirect-twisted-metal-movie-231020/"&gt;which was announced in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://collider.com/twisted-metal-movie-update-brian-taylor/#nicolas-cage-sweet-tooth"&gt;the man who was supposed to have directed&lt;/a&gt; it said that it fell apart because Sony didn’t want to spend the amount of money needed to make it feel like, well, &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal&lt;/em&gt;. Hopefully the show will get the budget, otherwise fans may wish they had heeded the lesson &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal &lt;/em&gt;games always end on: be careful what you wish for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9xXVA"&gt;If and when the show starts hitting screens, it’ll likely be part of Sony’s first wave of PlayStation-based film and television content, including the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21583442/hbo-the-last-of-us-tv-show-playstation-neil-druckmann-craig-mazin-series-order"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last Of Us&lt;/em&gt; HBO show&lt;/a&gt; starring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277687/mandalorian-star-pedro-pascal-joel-hbo-the-last-of-us-tv-show"&gt;Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528606/tom-holland-nathan-drake-first-photo-uncharted-movie-sony"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie&lt;/a&gt; staring Tom Holland and Antonio Banderas. &lt;/p&gt;
