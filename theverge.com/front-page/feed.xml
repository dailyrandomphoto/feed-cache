    <title>Here is the purple iPhone 12, which is purple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A purple iPhone 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iW_qOjdrAN-ln6gAgylVTAJ-pe0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69168438/vpavic_4547_20210421_0022.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A purple iPhone 12&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qNuuh3"&gt;Apple managed to surprise us during its live stream event earlier this week by announcing a new iPhone. Well, a new &lt;em&gt;color&lt;/em&gt; for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini: purple. Apple sent one to us along with some sample AirTags and so we have duly taken some photos of this, a purple iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrgmXw"&gt;It’s a lightish shade of purple. One might be tempted to call it lavender, but to me it’s a bit more like a lilac or maybe a wisteria. It lacks the redness you’d expect in a mauve or the blue tones you’d see in a violet. There are many &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender_(color)"&gt;shades of purple&lt;/a&gt;, but this one is what Apple went with and I like it. It’s unmistakable even at a distance, whereas the light green iPhone 12 models could be mistaken for off-white in certain light. I am also glad it doesn’t have a fancy name. It’s just “purple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnU4Uy"&gt;The purple iPhone 12 is in all other ways the same as the other colors of the iPhone 12: it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;very fast, has a very nice screen, 5G, and great cameras&lt;/a&gt;. It’s just a little more royal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>EA announces new Battlefield mobile game launching in 2022 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SJanE04kl2-chP6eJeoS4Fw4JSg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69168446/bfv_standard_16x9.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="luxSg9"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; series is headed to mobile devices. The hugely popular shooter franchise will make its debut on smartphones and tablets in a new game that’s set to release in 2022. The game will be developed by Industrial Toys in partnership with longtime &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; developer DICE, which is owned by Electronic Arts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NemQTF"&gt;“Make no mistake, this is a standalone game,” Oskar Gabrielson, the general manager of DICE, said in a blog post. “A completely different game from the one we’re making for console and PC, designed specifically for the mobile platform. It’s being built from the ground up by iToys to make &lt;em&gt;Battlefield-&lt;/em&gt;on-the-go a reality and you can expect a fully-fledged, skill-based experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHn9JQ"&gt;Shooters are some of the biggest hits on mobile right now, and EA is likely looking to capitalize on that popularity with the introduction of a mobile &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; title. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; had a colossal launch week when it debuted in 2019, reportedly racking up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever"&gt;more than 100 million downloads&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, which was released in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350782/pubg-mobile-one-billion-downloads-tencent"&gt;just surpassed one billion total downloads in March&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wr9qsM"&gt;Gabrielson also reiterated that DICE is hard at work on the next &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; game for consoles and PC, which is planned for release later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In a surprise to no one, Instagram is testing ads in Reels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nr3B4z5r4H8-V0sQMN9qRLY2BN0=/0x0:1812x1208/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69168439/Reels_Ads.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;This is a mockup of what ads might look like in Reels. | Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g8issF"&gt;Instagram puts ads just about everywhere in its app, and now, they’re coming to Reels. The company says today it’ll start testing ads in its TikTok copy product in India, Brazil, Germany, and Australia. The plan is to then expand that group in the coming months. The ads can be up to 30 seconds long, like Reels, and will look similar to the ones you see in stories in that they’re vertical and full-screen. Unlike those story ads, though, people can comment on, like, view, save, share, and skip them in Reels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tq3FLL"&gt;The broader Facebook company also previewed its new sticker ads for Facebook Stories, which will be tested with select advertisers and creators over the coming weeks. The company announced them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22323398/facebook-stories-ads-stickers-creator-monetize-update"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt; with the idea being that the stickers are just that, cute stickers, but that they can also be tapped to buy a product. Creators will get a cut of the revenue, and you can see an example below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WqHmF7bdHZ6W83PQkgf1QqKvy3Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461139/Sticker_Ads__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sticker ads will be tested on Facebook, and creators will take a cut of the revenue made through their content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C8htgh"&gt;The ads in Reels comes as no surprise, given that Facebook’s business is built around them. It’s more unexpected that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165957/instagram-reels-shopping-update-global"&gt;brought shopping to Reels&lt;/a&gt; globally before ads, but it’s possible Instagram didn’t want to turn people off from the format with consistent advertising wedged between actual content. Instagram head Adam Mosseri even noted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238513/instagram-adam-mosseri-reels-decoder-interview-podcast"&gt;he wasn’t “happy”&lt;/a&gt; with the feature yet, as of January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhcQgT"&gt;With sticker ads, more people could become influencers, and product placement might look more organic than a clear brand shoutout that someone’s being paid to promote. In the sample mock-up, the sticker does note that it’s “sponsored,” but the font is thin and discreet — I expect people to miss that small disclaimer and also to possibly not know that the people posting them receive a kickback from any sales made.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AirTag location trackers are smart, capable, and very Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An AirTag and the Find My app" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iuJjx3uLgXhd5Bp9vyxoGP1gtsg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69168440/vpavic_4547_20210421_0097.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An AirTag and the Find My app&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;They work super well, and they’re one more thing keeping you on the iPhone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="f3bzgq"&gt;I was starting to get really worried that I wouldn’t find my friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeS892"&gt;For this first look at AirTags, I sent Vjeran Pavic off into an unfamiliar city with a single Apple AirTag and no phone, no smartwatch, or any other mode of communication. The challenge was to see if Apple’s Find My system for locating AirTags would be able to lead me to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKAkp8"&gt;Apple AirTags weren’t designed for an elaborate game of hide-and-seek. They can help you locate anything they’re attached to; most of the time you’ll be listening for their little chirps as you hunt down the keys you inexplicably left sitting on top of the fridge instead of on the hook where they belong. For that purpose they work incredibly well, right on down to a little arrow on the iPhone’s screen pointing in the direction and little haptic taps as encouragement that you’re getting warmer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPyX0j"&gt;But this exercise was a very good stress test for the new $29 iPhone accessory ($99 for a four pack), because it meant that the only chance I had of tracking Vjeran down is if one of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-introduces-airtag%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F22%2F22396693%2Fapple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;near-billion&lt;/a&gt; Find My-enabled devices on the planet happened to pick up the AirTag’s Bluetooth signal and send it back to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RLUSJr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It only took a couple of passing iPhones to accurately locate an AirTag&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IbWZ9W"&gt;After a half-hour of walking around, I finally found him. He was standing on a street corner with no foot traffic whatsoever, which meant that the intermittent signals I got detailing his location came from a couple of iPhones in cars that were driving by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sG4SFn"&gt;That’s impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvexyC"&gt;AirTags have been rumored for years but never seemed to materialize. They’re really here now and though I wouldn’t go so far as to say they’re worth the wait, I do think Apple has put together a thoughtfully designed system that goes a long way toward ensuring privacy and safety while still making it easier for you to locate your stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtRueK"&gt;AirTags are a very Apple-y Apple product, and that ends up being great but also just a little annoying (and, for third-party companies like Tile, troubling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FhLnnx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here is the purple iPhone 12, which is purple ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22160543"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="AirTags" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qPeprEY3uZnYIrPxafC5-14_lS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461387/vpavic_4547_20210421_0074.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AirTags&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ikPenn"&gt;The basics of AirTags are simple enough to understand: each one is a tiny little puck with a Bluetooth Low Energy radio and a U1 ultra-wideband (UWB) chip. You pair it with your iPhone just like you do with AirPods, holding it nearby and then tapping through a short setup process. After that, they’re available in a new “Items” tab in the Find My app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zhkyu"&gt;From the app, you can set the AirTags to chirp, mark them as lost (which enables some different features), or just tap the button that lets you locate them in space. If you have an iPhone with UWB, it can locate the AirTag in physical space and point a little arrow at it when you get within four feet or so. It all works very well and is very satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An AirTag in an Apple keychain accessory" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RV4V3dolejjqJ3ffVAvRQcROfzY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461382/vpavic_4547_20210421_0058.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An AirTag in an Apple keychain accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An AirTag in an Apple Leather Loop accessory" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6HtVcSHgAaaBhX6TuKfMTrj7XVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461386/vpavic_4547_20210421_0070.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An AirTag in an Apple Leather Loop accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TBtYbz"&gt;From a design perspective, an AirTag is &lt;em&gt;classic&lt;/em&gt; Apple. It’s a white and shiny silver little button, and you can have custom emoji or letters printed on the plastic. They are as cute as the buttons they resemble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjMn8K"&gt;However, you’ll soon find the plastic is scuffed and the chrome on the back is scratched. Sincerely, do not expect these to stay looking pristine for long — not since the weird early days of the iPod nano has an Apple product gotten scuffed this easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HcPV4Y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here’s the scuffs and scratches on an AirTag after a few hours of handling. I don’t think we did anything excessive here either. I mean it’s not a huge deal that this happens but it’s still pretty weird! &lt;a href="https://t.co/kkD2A6OhCn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kkD2A6OhCn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1385223768981733376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="18Zubv"&gt;One clever touch is that the plastic body itself serves as the speaker. It’s what vibrates to make the chirping noise. It gets plenty loud, though my old ears had a bit of a difficult time using just that sound to locate one. Also, if for whatever reason the AirTag is squeezed or compressed, that will dampen how loud it can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBCOhY"&gt;There’s also no hole on them for a lanyard loop. If you want to actually attach one to anything instead of dropping it in a pocket, you’ll need to buy an accessory. That, increasingly, also feels like a classic Apple move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GesLat"&gt;The one &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;-Apple part of the design is that the battery is actually user-replaceable. A little twist of the bottom reveals a standard CR2032 cell, which Apple claims should be good for a year of battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/se0Xj94XLrepGAWvfBgQdxaRhSE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461436/IMG_2741.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n00obOEmwKOlY40OBccRkzNCyLU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461435/IMG_2742.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EtKqBR"&gt;The real trick — and the hidden complexity — arises when you are tracking an AirTag out in the world, when something is truly lost. Like everything in Apple’s Find My network, the AirTag’s location is end-to-end encrypted so only you can see its location. But any iOS device can send that location to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlOWLw"&gt;If somebody comes upon a lost AirTag, they can tap it via NFC to see information about it, including its serial number (which could be important if you think it’s being used to track you). If the owner has put it in “Lost Mode,” they have the option to have that information page show their phone number and a brief message so you can contact them. This NFC feature works equally well with iPhones and Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPCQeu"&gt;That means all it takes to locate an AirTag is for any iPhone with Bluetooth on to see it — even if that iPhone is whizzing by in a car. Apple is leveraging its huge network of devices as a competitive advantage here — along with the competitive advantage of directly offering this functionality as a system-level feature. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/"&gt;Tile has asked Congress&lt;/a&gt; to look into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The pairing process for AirTags is just like pairing AirPods" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/00YS7IOym90TTCaI-N9Z8H6Pk8o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461378/vpavic_4547_20210421_0032.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pairing process for AirTags is just like pairing AirPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6yT5cP"&gt;A Bluetooth device broadcasting anything is a potential privacy risk, so Apple is cycling each AirTag’s Bluetooth identifier “frequently.” More than that, though, Apple has also done some work to develop a system that also considers personal safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxuLSK"&gt;If the Find My network notices that an AirTag has been separated from its owner for a while and seems to be in the same place you are, it will alert you. If you’re an iPhone user, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227"&gt;you’ll see a notification&lt;/a&gt; that says “AirTag Found Moving With You.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bunch of AirTags" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/my-JQ011JKmly4wAl-rJczGViMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461476/vpavic_4547_20210421_0131.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A bunch of AirTags.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside id="Br9q28"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It tries to alert you if it thinks it’s being used to track you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fahKUR"&gt;Apple says that there are options to disable these “Safety Alerts” if you are “borrowing” something. But the real purpose is clear: to protect you from somebody using an AirTag to surreptitiously track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3GVuC"&gt;When you see the alert, you can tap the notification to get a screen that will allow you to make the AirTag start beeping. The alert will also instruct you on how to disable the AirTag by removing the battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XxBey"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aT8MXm"&gt;Finally, Apple says, “If you feel your safety is at risk, contact your local law enforcement who can work with Apple. You might need to provide the AirTag or its serial number.” Apple won’t be able to provide your location, but it could provide governments with information related to the person who registered the AirTag as theirs in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9TzBRX"&gt;If you’re an Android user, well, virtually none of this is going to work for you. However, the AirTag does have at least one potential trick. If it’s been separated from its owner and then detects that it’s suddenly on the move, it will start beeping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsG7bO"&gt;All in all, I think it’s a thoughtfully designed system, but it’s also definitely one that leverages Apple’s strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An AirTag" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tN1fzfEdBhCr_ZytOAxuh2IIq_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461379/vpavic_4547_20210421_0038.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An AirTag.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r0aAf4"&gt;Really, the AirTag is the Most Apple Product I’ve seen in a while. It’s just a little more expensive than the competition. It’s beautifully designed, but its hardware still somehow fails to actually take the practical realities of our dirty, messy world into account. It’s very privacy-focused. It really only works with Apple devices. It offers features that no third-party device can really match thanks to Apple’s tight integration (or tight grip on its APIs, depending on your point of view). And since there’s no Android version of Find My, it’s another piece of the Apple ecosystem that’s going to keep you from switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQDaRB"&gt;An AirTag is a very Apple-y thing for Apple users who already live in Apple’s ecosystem. They work great — and will be great at keeping you in Apple’s world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 will reportedly include notifications revamp, new iPad home screen, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPad Pro 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e-XAW00ALCCBbPtkZjGEnfblsnk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69168139/ipadpro2021lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple announced a new iPad Pro this week with a beefy M1 chip&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Can new software take advantage of this processibng power? &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w9veBM"&gt;Apple is getting ready to announce a raft of software updates for the iPhone and iPad in June according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/apple-plans-notifications-ipad-home-screen-upgrades-for-ios-15?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including “the most significant update to the [iPad’s] Home Screen since first launching the product in 2010.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YWEG4"&gt;The new versions of iOS and iPadOS — iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 — will be unveiled at Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22320961/apple-wwdc-2021-event-date-software-updates-ios-ipados-macos"&gt;upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference&lt;/a&gt; (WWDC) on June 7th, says &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Last year’s iOS 14 update was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21291695/apple-ios-14-updates-home-screen-redesign-features-release-date-wwdc-2020"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; at WWDC on June 22nd, before becoming available for download on September 16th in time to accompany the iPhone 12 release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bps6pf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s story has a host of details about what to expect from the latest versions of Apple’s mobile software, but here are the biggest points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Y3ud1p"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;New notification filters based on user status&lt;/strong&gt;. From a new menu accessible from the Lock Screen and Control Center, users will have more granular control over how notifications are displayed (do they play sounds or not, for example) based on whether they’re driving, sleeping, at work, or have turned on Do Not Disturb mode. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3f7V32"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;iPad home screen upgrade&lt;/strong&gt;. This will reportedly include the ability to add widgets (introduced in iOS last year). &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t offer any more details, but claims this will be the most significant update to the iPad home screen since the product launched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DFopT1"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Quick access to privacy data&lt;/strong&gt;. A new menu will reportedly let users see what information apps are collecting about them. Presumably this would tap the same data used by Apple for new “privacy labels” introduced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;the App Store&lt;/a&gt; last December. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GLpMxQ"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Updated iOS Lock Screen&lt;/strong&gt;. This will include access to the above privacy menu. It’s not clear if any other changes are coming. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tuL8w5"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Social upgrades for iMessage&lt;/strong&gt;. New features would help iMessage compete with WhatsApp “with the eventual goal of acting as more of a social network.” But &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;says these are “still early in development” and might be announced later this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="e8w1Mt"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Minor updates for macOS, watchOS, and tvOS&lt;/strong&gt;. Apple launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295489/apple-macos-big-sur-update-redesign-apps-features-catalyst-wwdc-2020"&gt;big redesign for macOS&lt;/a&gt; last year with Big Sur, so it seems right to expect only small changes this time round. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="sfJAc4"&gt;These are the first reliable rumors we’ve heard about what to expect from iOS and iPadOS 15, though they aren’t particularly surprising. Updated notification filters and access to app data are solid additions but not splashy features. Meanwhile, giving iPadOS the same widgets available in iOS is welcome but hardly a major change. Given that the iPad Pro got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;upgraded with a beefy M1 processor&lt;/a&gt; this week, we’re still hoping that Apple will be a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22391979/apple-ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air-2021-anouncement"&gt;bit more ambitious&lt;/a&gt; about what its tablets can deliver in future in terms of software. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t suggest a leap forward but we’ll have to wait for WWDC to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJAeBS"&gt;Meanwhile, iOS 14.5 is set to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394200/apple-ios-14-5-watch-os-7-4-mac-os-11-3-release-date"&gt;arrive next week&lt;/a&gt; featuring support for Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;new AirTag&lt;/a&gt; item trackers, and the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;new podcast features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yes, older Apple TVs can also be calibrated with your iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qR88KYp2MIxI8ccvGKLTsRIJb84=/0x0:964x643/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69168121/msedge_E88SepwLyF.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H2LdR5"&gt;Apple’s new TV calibration feature, which uses the iPhone’s front-facing sensors to sense and tweak the output of the Apple TV, works with the company’s older streaming boxes, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/21/new-tvos-14-5-color-balancing-feature-works-with-older-apple-tv-models-heres-how-to-use-it/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The new feature will arrive with tvOS 14.5, which is due to release “early next week” for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017"&gt;2017 Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt; and 2015 Apple TV HD. Apple says viewers will see “much more accurate colors and improved contrast” after calibration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ibt1KG"&gt;The calibration feature was announced alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22386298/apple-tv-4k-a12-bionic-price-features-release-date"&gt;new Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt;. It works by having you hold up the front of your iPhone to your TV, so it can sense how the screen is outputting different colors. If the phone’s light sensor sees that color is being outputted inaccurately, the Apple TV can adjust its output to compensate. The process only covers the Apple TV’s content, and won’t affect the TV’s built in apps or other devices it has plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tMNJxe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple promises “much more accurate colors and improved contrast” from the feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgUool"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;, Apple TV HD and 4K owners can access the calibration feature via the Video and Audio section in the Settings app. As well as requiring an Apple TV updated to tvOS 14.5, the feature also requires Face ID-equipped iPhone running iOS 14.5. Both &lt;a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1618987304"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FlatPanelsHD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/neat-new-iphone-trick-optimize-your-apple-tv-picture-settings-with-your-phone-heres-how/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;note that the feature doesn’t work on TVs with Dolby Vision enabled after testing it with older Apple TVs running the latest tvOS 14.5 beta build, though it’s not immediately clear why this is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpSCJK"&gt;Between this and the news that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394196/apple-tv-4k-new-siri-remote-sold-separately-price-buttons"&gt;Apple’s redesigned Siri Remote will also work with older Apple TVs&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is making it pretty easy for existing Apple TV owners to hold off on upgrading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxexnI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opyVb4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brompton electric bikes recalled by US government over unexpected acceleration bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QRKv6L4EKPGFdWeSN7LLTU8qthM=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69167939/verge-DSC_5407-2040pxl.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uCBRZr"&gt;Hundreds of foldable electric bikes made by UK firm Brompton have been &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Brompton-Bicycle-Recalls-Electric-Folding-Bicycles-Due-to-Fall-and-Injury-Hazards#"&gt;recalled for repair&lt;/a&gt; by the US government. A software fault is causing the bikes’ electric motors to deliver “forward momentum” when the rider is not pedaling. It’s an issue that poses “fall and injury hazards,” according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), but can be remedied by a free software upgrade performed at certain Brompton dealers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDraO9"&gt;The problem affects roughly 600 bikes sold by Brompton’s US dealers between June 2020 and March 2021, with the bicycles themselves retailing for between $3,500 and $3,800. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YD3crU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the risk of an accident occurring is very low,” say brompton&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lyV6vp"&gt;Owners can check if their bike is one of those affected by entering the product’s serial number (found on a sticker on the frame) into a tool on &lt;a href="https://us.brompton.com/recall"&gt;Brompton’s website&lt;/a&gt;. If necessary, they can head to a Brompton dealer to get the firmware upgrade. Anyone affected can apply for a $30 credit voucher provided by Brompton “as a gesture of goodwill.” Presumably this voucher can only be redeemed at Brompton’s &lt;a href="https://us.brompton.com/shop"&gt;online store&lt;/a&gt;, where you can find a range of sensible biking wear and leather accessories specially designed for commuting fetishists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LzahR"&gt;Although unwanted acceleration is pretty high on any company’s list of “software oopsies we don’t want affecting our electric vehicle,” Brompton says the actual danger posed by the issue is extremely low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mYUFQ"&gt;“Under specific circumstances if a system failure occurs, there is a low possibility that the electric system may continue to provide assistance to the motor, causing continued forward momentum, when the rider is not actively pedalling,” said the company in a statement on its website. “The risk of an accident occurring is very low with only one reported minor fault, which did not result in any injury or accident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ayawE"&gt;If you want to hear this same message delivered in soothing tones by Brompton’s chief design and engineer officer Will Carleysmith, you can watch the video on the issue below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fJKgoA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SYjga6Tbpys?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9h5Mv4"&gt;Brompton’s folding bicycles have achieved something of a &lt;a href="https://qz.com/704008/a-quirky-english-folding-bike-has-achieved-cult-status-with-its-specific-appeal-to-urban-cyclists/"&gt;cult status&lt;/a&gt; among a certain sort of nerdy and affluent urban commuter. However, a combination of Brexit and COVID have hit the company’s manufacturing operations &lt;a href="https://road.cc/content/news/brompton-reels-impact-brexit-and-covid-282435"&gt;hard&lt;/a&gt;, causing material shortages and rising production costs. A recall is hardly good news in such a tricky business environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rmay77"&gt;In our review of Brompton’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/2/19040479/folding-e-bike-review-price-weight"&gt;most recent folding electric bike&lt;/a&gt; (unaffected by the software issues that prompted this week’s recall) we found it to be extraordinarily adaptable thanks its folding design but lacking in comfort needed for longer commutes. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Touch ID Magic Keyboards work with all M1 Macs, not just the iMac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple’s Magic Keyboard in purple, with a Touch ID button in the top right corner." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZkZxtSCDTUFhTdFFRaP9NJbAzRQ=/0x16:1933x1305/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69167929/132_2021_04_20_132_vlcscreen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new Magic Keyboard has a Touch ID sensor on the top right.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nFtMuY"&gt;The Touch ID sensor in Apple’s new Magic Keyboard, which debuted alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;updated iMac&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, works with any Mac fitted with Apple’s M1 processor, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1384588508820647940"&gt;Rene Ritchie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/magic-keyboard-touch-id-compatible-all-m1-macs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. However, the sensor &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/touch-id-magic-keyboard-m1-ipad-pro/"&gt;won’t work with the new iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which also uses the M1 chip. For now, the new keyboard is only sold with the new M1-equipped iMac, which is available to preorder from April 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yLBdK"&gt;Apple has been shipping MacBooks with built-in Touch ID for a while now, but this is the first time it’s been available in an accessory. The biometric security method can be used for logging into the device, as well as authorizing purchases and signing into some third-party apps. The new Touch ID keyboard is available with a compact layout, as well as a full size keyboard with a numpad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You can only buy them with the M1 Mac (for now?) but you can use them (with Touch ID!) on other M1 Macs, or just as BT keyboards (no Touch ID) on Intel Macs/other devices. &lt;a href="https://t.co/mOOp5mbmg2"&gt;https://t.co/mOOp5mbmg2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rene Ritchie (@reneritchie) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1384588508820647940?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dk29bH"&gt;The bad news for owners of older Macs is that the Touch ID functionality in the new keyboard won’t work with any Intel-based machines. The keyboard itself will reportedly function, just not the biometric security. As &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fimac-features-all-new-design-in-vibrant-colors-m1-chip-and-45k-retina-display%2F%23gallery-26ed471606120fad275da1d426bc5785%3A%7E%3Atext%3DCustomers%2520can%2520choose%2520from%2520three%2520models%2CMouse%2520and%2520the%2520industry%252Dbest%2520Magic%2520Trackpad.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F22%2F22397196%2Fmagic-keyboard-touch-id-m1-mac-macbook-intel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s press release&lt;/a&gt; explains, the new keyboard requires the Secure Enclave in the M1 processor to encrypt the transmitted fingerprint information end-to-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8hitW"&gt;Although the Touch ID keyboard is currently only available with the new all-in-one, &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes that Apple has previously opened up exclusive accessories for general sale. For example, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17168720/apple-space-gray-keyboard-mouse-trackpad-now-available-pricing"&gt;started selling&lt;/a&gt; the gray keyboard, mouse, and trackpad for anyone to buy in 2018, after previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15743110/apple-imac-pro-space-gray-magic-mouse-keyboard-colors-wwdc-2017"&gt;limiting them to the iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt; in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden pledges to drastically slash US greenhouse gas emissions by 2030  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks And Signs Executive Actions On Climate Change And Creating Jobs" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lHyvWSRc3YLalRvqWfJBD2JOSD0=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69167893/1230821964.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;U.S. President Joe Biden speaks about climate change issues in the State Dining Room of the White House on January 27, 2021 in Washington, DC. President Biden signed several executive orders related to the climate change crisis on Wednesday, including one directing a pause on new oil and natural gas leases on public lands. | Photo by Anna Moneymaker-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U946jq"&gt;President Joe Biden announced a new goal to sharply cut down US greenhouse gas emissions this decade. The country’s new mandate is to reduce planet-heating gases by 50 to 52 percent of what the US emitted in 2005. It significantly ramps up a previous commitment under the Paris climate agreement made by former President Barack Obama, who pledged to slash emissions between 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ft5jLG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US hopes to regain respect on the international stage &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WlUYTP"&gt;The urgency for the US to gut its climate pollution has only grown since the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015. Global carbon dioxide emissions need to drop by half this decade and reach close to zero by the middle of the century in order to hit the goals of the Paris Agreement and prevent some of the most devastating effects of climate change, a landmark &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;2018 report&lt;/a&gt; found. The US has a huge role to play as the second biggest greenhouse gas polluter after China. But it abdicated leadership on the climate front under former President Donald Trump, who briefly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21548147/united-states-paris-agreement-climate-change-presidential-election"&gt;pulled the US out&lt;/a&gt; of the Paris accord and &lt;a href="https://climate.law.columbia.edu/climate-deregulation-tracker"&gt;drastically rolled back&lt;/a&gt; environmental regulations in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEX9HE"&gt;Now the US hopes to regain respect &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22239441/us-paris-agreement-rejoin-climate-change-joe-biden"&gt;on the international stage&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to tackling the climate crisis. Biden will hold his own &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/leaders-summit-on-climate/"&gt;virtual summit&lt;/a&gt; on climate today (Earth Day) and tomorrow aimed at encouraging other countries to ratchet up their goals. All countries are expected to update their individual commitments to combating climate change ahead of a United Nations climate conference scheduled to take place in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJJ8sQ"&gt;“[The Biden administration is] very cognizant that the US as a credible actor and leader in this space really depends in large measure on having a really robust new target,” says Pete Ogden, vice president for energy, climate, and the environment at the United Nations Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43eT24"&gt;Major environmental groups like Sierra Club have &lt;a href="https://addup.sierraclub.org/campaigns/tell-president-biden-commit-the-us-to-reducing-climate-emissions-by-at-least-50-by-2030"&gt;pushed&lt;/a&gt; the Biden administration to target a reduction of at least 50 percent. Hundreds of &lt;a href="https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/ambitious-u-s-2030-ndc/"&gt;businesses&lt;/a&gt;, including Amazon, Apple, and General Motors, did also. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFzoMe"&gt;Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-government-and-politics-environment-and-nature-business-climate-8b27e89270de7cb03f2e61f23d0ba4b9?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=122623923&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--d1EiTS1GYd8wQXq7HwM3WLwLsbvmcJ4hyCpHseNPDbjQMNaB6uugUmcQYZDz9aA3JomNV5K0H90xvIik4zUGT0DRNNBjA9bTIUyqIBfgqfYqXu0c&amp;amp;utm_content=122623923&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the 50 percent goal “is precisely what is needed ... an actionable goal within the next decade that puts us on the path toward limiting warming below a catastrophic 1.5 degrees Celsius.″  The Paris agreement seeks to stop global average temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, a &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/"&gt;threshold&lt;/a&gt; that scientists project would lead to catastrophic effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCJ5jf"&gt;Some progressive groups &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22396522/us-climate-change-commitment-paris-agreement-joe-biden"&gt;called for deeper emissions cuts&lt;/a&gt;, citing the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/24/18512804/climate-change-united-states-china-emissions"&gt;US’s history of contributing more to the climate crisis&lt;/a&gt; than any other country. “There exists in my mind no possible ethically justifiable story in which the United States does not do more,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22396522/us-climate-change-commitment-paris-agreement-joe-biden"&gt;said Tom Athanasiou&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the activist think tank EcoEquity, which is part of a &lt;a href="https://usfairshare.org/"&gt;network&lt;/a&gt; that has called on the US to reduce its emissions by at least 70 percent below 2005 levels this decade.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OI32R6"&gt;More countries are expected to ratchet up ambitions this week during Biden’s climate summit. The UK announced on April 20 that it plans to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 78 percent compared to 1990 levels by the year 2035. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pG3I9f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a dire warning.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lqV8Kp"&gt;Those commitments couldn’t come any sooner as climate pollution continues to grow. After a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309374/global-china-carbon-dioxide-emissions-rising"&gt;temporary drop&lt;/a&gt; in planet-warming CO2 emissions during the pandemic, annual emissions this year are on course for the sharpest rise since 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aN6aYL"&gt;“This is a dire warning that the economic recovery from the Covid crisis is currently anything but sustainable for our climate,” Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/global-carbon-dioxide-emissions-are-set-for-their-second-biggest-increase-in-history"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the new estimate for 2021 emissions. “Unless governments around the world move rapidly to start cutting emissions, we are likely to face an even worse situation in 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzIJCr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drKa4d"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSRbMs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKDXYB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s solar panels will soon only be sold in bundles with Powerwall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Solar Roof" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lsl_dTJ8P4gkIm_zDrOWTVMoI_w=/216x0:1784x1045/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69167810/tesla_solar_roof_smooth_glass.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tesla’s solar roof.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YH5WU4"&gt;Tesla’s solar products will soon only be sold together with the company’s Powerwall battery, CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385042598692147204"&gt;announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Integrating them into a single product will making installations easier and home backup more seamless during outages, according to Musk. The change will affect both Tesla’s Solar Panels (which sit on top of an existing roof), and Solar Roof (which replaces a home’s existing roof slats).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aoKIA"&gt;The new policy was announced just hours after Musk responded to a tweet from Ark Investment Management’s director of research Brett Winton, who had complained that his Tesla solar panels hadn’t generated any electricity since installation because he was waiting on his local utility company to approve the connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3VIjnp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp;amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp;amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385048499415183360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FtuU27"&gt;“Did you buy a Powerwall?” Musk tweeted at Winton, “Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery.” &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/telsa-s-solar-panels-to-be-sold-with-powerwall-from-next-week?utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that Ark Investment has been a big supporter of Tesla, and holds “significant stakes” in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VKqK20"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp;amp; can stabilize grid.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385011236270526464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W79UAP"&gt;Signs of Tesla’s intention to bundle its solar products with the Powerwall were reported &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/15/tesla-stops-taking-orders-powerwall-without-solar-panels/"&gt;last month by &lt;em&gt;Elektrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who spotted that the company was only accepting new Powerwall orders when combined with a Tesla solar panel project. Powerwall supply shortages were thought to be to blame for the shift, with demand and wait times increasing for the home battery solution. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Tesla installed 86 mega-watts (MW) of solar energy, a 59 percent increase compared to the same period the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zhehxr"&gt;Alongside the change, Musk announced an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385099771220688906"&gt;upcoming software update&lt;/a&gt; for the Powerwall, which he says will enable upwards of a 50 percent power increase depending on production date. The current Powerwall is &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/powerwall/Powerwall%202_AC_Datasheet_en_northamerica.pdf"&gt;rated to provide&lt;/a&gt; 5 kW of real power (7 kW peak) in North America, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385105599608672257"&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; the CEO said that Tesla’s newest units can “probably” provide as much as 10kW continuous, and “double that in peak” under the right circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YAGZP"&gt;The changes come after Tesla faced criticism for substantially raising the prices of some of its solar products. Earlier this month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380057/tesla-solar-roof-price-increase-contract-amount"&gt;one customer reported&lt;/a&gt; that the company had told them a $35,000 solar roof order would now cost them $75,000, while the price of the accompanying batteries would increase from $30,000 to $35,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zzgwtp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNDjYn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
