    <title>Air taxi startup Archer shows off small electric aircraft but no flight test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SnfPxTf6z1z583CTmt8rE46l3yo=/0x0:4884x3256/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440242/Archer4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rZgwmM"&gt;Archer Aviation, a Santa Clara-based aviation startup, unveiled a new electric aircraft Thursday that it says will serve as the basis for a future fleet of air taxis that will criss-cross cities and help alleviate traffic. But much like the majority of these startups, the company was not able to demonstrate its flying taxis doing the thing they’re supposed to do: flying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvU5Iw"&gt;At an event in Los Angeles Thursday, complete with dramatic lighting, soaring visuals, and even a pair of drummers, the company showed off the 12-rotor aircraft, which it is calling Maker. Clocking in at 1,508kg (3,324lbs), the gleaming silver vehicle looks like an airplane / helicopter hybrid, with two wings sporting six rotors each jutting out from an egg-shaped fuselage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t1SXNz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the gleaming silver vehicle looks like an airplane / helicopter hybrid&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9IAzXP"&gt;It will have a range of 60 miles thanks to a 75kWh battery, and a top speed of 150mph. The entire wingspan is 40 feet. And when cruising 2,000 feet in the air, Archer says that the aircraft will be “100X quieter than a helicopter, generating only 45 decibels of sound” — similar to a loud bird call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PRlusy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QLC_JNMeLdk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GQuN8t"&gt;Maker is a “full-scale, two-passenger demonstrator aircraft,” said Adam Goldstein, one of Archer’s co-founders. “Its purpose is to serve as a certification test bed, and also to keep pushing our key enabling technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aS7xza"&gt;Archer did not demonstrate Maker’s flight capabilities, though, nor did it say when it anticipated receiving certification for test flights. The company has said it expects to eventually build a five-seater aircraft to serve as the main vehicle in its eventual commercial operation, which it plans to launch in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0VZ31j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The type of aircraft Archer is developing is typically called a “flying car”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8AidXH"&gt;The type of aircraft Archer is developing is typically called a “flying car,” though they rarely resemble actual cars. They are electric-powered, able to carry only a handful of passengers,  and intended for short flights within a city or regionally. Using tilt-rotors, Maker is designed to take off and land vertically like a helicopter and then transition into forward flight like a plane. There are dozens of similar startups building these types of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, but they have yet to be rolled out for commercial service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoMcHJ"&gt;Archer has recently made news for raising $1.1 billion by &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/"&gt;going public through a reverse merger&lt;/a&gt; with a special acquisition company, or SPAC. The merger, which is valued at $3.8 billion, is also backed by Stellantis, the parent company of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, and United Airlines. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/united-airlines-orders-electric-vertical-aircraft-invests-in-urban-air-mobility-spac.html"&gt;United has placed a $1 billion order&lt;/a&gt; for 200 Archer electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, with an option to purchase 100 more for $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzlEpa"&gt;It has also found itself the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22369921/wisk-sues-archer-trade-secrets-theft-flying-taxi"&gt;target of a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; from rival aviation startup Wisk Aero, which accused Archer of stealing its trade secrets and infringing on its patents. Wisk, which is a joint venture between Boeing and Kitty Hawk, recently filed a preliminary injunction to block Archer from using its technology and the US government opened an investigation into the matter. Archer countersued Wisk over “false statements” regarding the criminal probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rv0T5i"&gt;Asked for a reaction to Archer’s unveiling, a spokesperson for Wisk said, “Nothing new was revealed in tonight’s launch. We look forward to continuing our case in court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SxBPx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VeM8bX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is trying to dominate watch parties, but it needs more help</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ft-o9a0LPyS-oG4BM2_sWZNV3ZQ=/0x59:941x686/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440167/download.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SharePlay displayed on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3QfG3e"&gt;Apple is bringing one of streaming’s trendiest features to iPhone users with the debut of SharePlay in iOS 15 later this year, allowing FaceTime users to stream music, online videos, and movies together with friends. The move positions FaceTime to compete more directly with platforms like Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and Houseparty, which all offer ways to video chat while watching things as a group.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It offers Apple a chance to hook a new generation of users on FaceTime — but the service is still missing some key integrations to make that happen, particularly for the teens most likely to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AR91ld"&gt;SharePlay, announced earlier this week and likely arriving in the fall, will allow FaceTime users to share and stream media in real time from an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV. It’s a neat tool for the pandemic era, and it takes inspiration from the watch party modes that &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/hidden-code-on-the-disney-site-suggests-a-watch-party-1844906374"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307519/amazon-watch-party-prime-video-virtual-parties-streaming-netflix-disney-hbo-scener-twitch"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22092452/hulu-watch-party-now-available-all-subscribers"&gt;streaming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452744/sling-tv-watch-party-live-tv-beta-chrome-available-now"&gt;platforms&lt;/a&gt; — including Disney Plus, Hulu, and Prime Video, among others — added themselves in the last year. For services where it’s not supported, like Netflix, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21307583/watch-videos-movies-online-friends-streaming-netflix-hulu-amazon-scener-extensions"&gt;there are popular extensions&lt;/a&gt; that enable simultaneous streaming and chatting as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WHxU0"&gt;The goal isn’t to compete with those native platforms, though. After all, you’re still watching Hulu, just in a different space. Instead, the update puts FaceTime square against services like Facebook Messenger that dominate messaging and have already been trying to build out co-watching experiences, but without as robust of a service list as Apple has the ability to line up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3uFYit"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SharePlay makes sense for teen streamers, but the feature needs wider app support if it’s going to work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HvQexT"&gt;SharePlay particularly makes sense for the next generation of iPhone users, as teens are more &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/young-americans-watching-online-videos-spike-to-the-highest-rate-ever-2019-10-29"&gt;inclined to watch videos&lt;/a&gt; on their phones. Video-based social media apps like Instagram and TikTok are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/31/17382058/youtube-teens-preferred-platform"&gt;immensely popular&lt;/a&gt; among teens, and an &lt;a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/uploads/research/2019-census-8-to-18-key-findings-updated.pdf"&gt;overwhelming majority&lt;/a&gt; of teens have access to these apps on their own personal smartphones. Video chatting is hugely popular, too, with a &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2015/08/06/teens-technology-and-friendships/"&gt;2015 survey&lt;/a&gt; from Pew Research finding that 59 percent of US teens video chatted with their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DrWEL"&gt;The introduction of SharePlay also jibes with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/apple-plans-notifications-ipad-home-screen-upgrades-for-ios-15?sref=i3mD6rA5"&gt;reported plans&lt;/a&gt; to make iMessage compete more directly with Facebook-owned WhatsApp by becoming more of a social network. It makes a lot of sense that the company would similarly invest in developments for its video-calling product as well, which is just a couple of taps away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCdLPN"&gt;But if Apple wants SharePlay to be a success among the demographic of consumers most likely to use it, it’ll need to expand the number of apps that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jDU2mj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fewer than a dozen services were included on Apple’s SharePlay slide at WWDC&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fnpZzZ"&gt;Apple said that at launch, Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, HBO Max, Hulu, MasterClass, Paramount Plus, Pluto TV, TikTok, and Twitch will be supported on SharePlay, which is a somewhat limited grab bag of streaming options. Granted, there’s plenty of time for that list to get longer before iOS 15 officially rolls out to users in the fall. And Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that SharePlay will be available to any streaming app that wants to support it, so we’re likely to see wider adoption down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2z7kOl"&gt;Some of the best applications of this feature failed to make their way into Apple’s initial slide of supported services, though. Netflix is perhaps the most obvious of these simply on the basis that virtually everyone has a Netflix login, whether they’re actually paying for it or not (at least until the inevitable &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-netflix-password-sharing-crackdown-has-begun-1846460641"&gt;password crackdown&lt;/a&gt;). But YouTube was not mentioned either, and neither company had comment to share about potential support down the line when contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this week. A spokesperson for Peacock, however, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that SharePlay support was on its “roadmap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7TPW8"&gt;YouTube, in particular, seems like a huge miss for Apple, especially &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/young-americans-watching-online-videos-spike-to-the-highest-rate-ever-2019-10-29"&gt;where teens are concerned&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube hosts just about every digital media format imaginable — music, movies, news, personalities, tutorials, live feeds, etc. — but most importantly, it’s free. As video callers &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2010/10/13/video-calling-and-video-chat/"&gt;tend to skew younger&lt;/a&gt; already, apps with highly shareable content like livestreams seem like the best use case for SharePlay outside of live sporting events. That’s particularly true given that for paid services, each participant in a SharePlay streaming session will need a login for the app. After all, if the tool didn’t require credentials and allowed just anyone to drop in a FaceTime stream of content from a paid service, SharePlay would be a piracy nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="M0YGcs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Are users prepared to pay up just to stream a title with friends?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XiHmsQ"&gt;But that’s part of what makes the practical application of SharePlay a bit of a puzzler. Streaming the game or a movie premiere could get expensive fast. If your friends are watching NFL coverage on Sling TV, you’ll need a $35 subscription to join in (assuming the content is included in one of the service’s base plans). If you wanted to watch a Premier Access release like &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; on Disney Plus, you’d need to pay the $8 monthly subscription cost &lt;em&gt;on top of&lt;/em&gt; an additional $30 early access ticket fee. (A spokesperson for Disney Plus confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that SharePlay users still need to pay for access to watch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfmiOk"&gt;It’s hard to imagine that most users would pay for a service just to be able to FaceTime while they’re watching a title. Then again, based on recent media consumption trends among teens, maybe SharePlay is part of the future of how entertainment is consumed, at least for the younger subset of Apple users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWNNec"&gt;It makes sense that a company investing heavily in its services offerings would jump on the watch party trend, if not a little late, and it does feel like a natural way for Apple to not only stay relevant but also sell subscriptions and hardware — even if right now, SharePlay alone seems unlikely to balloon numbers for streaming services. Free, social-leaning services and streaming titans are most likely to see success with this feature, and livestreaming apps seem likely to perform best. But they’ll actually have to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; SharePlay for that to work. As it currently stands, many are not.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple finally supports Windows Precision Touchpad gestures in new Boot Camp update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gO-zeq-e1F3DMbq3XMdaOqXkZJU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69439491/vpavic_191118_3800_0122.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wOOYiW"&gt;Apple is finally adding support for Windows Precision Touchpad drivers in its latest Boot Camp update. The new 6.1.15 update includes support for Windows Precision Touchpad, including single tap to click, lower-right corner to right-click, down motion to scroll up, and three or four finger gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fo8U2R"&gt;Various &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/nx558h/apple_finally_adds_support_for_windows_precision/"&gt;Reddit users noticed&lt;/a&gt; the surprise update went live yesterday, and it apparently works better than third-party solutions like Trackpad++ and mac-precision-touchpad that people have had to use for years. “Works way better than both of them with better palm and thumb detection too,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bootcamp/comments/nwva18/boot_camp_6115_released_adds_support_for_windows/"&gt;says one Reddit user&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3nRyEZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft started supporting Precision Touchpads more than seven years ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YbbGDR"&gt;Microsoft first started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/3/4489692/windows-8-1-precision-touchpad-support-intel-synaptics"&gt;introducing Windows Precision Touchpad&lt;/a&gt; with Intel in 2013, in an effort to fix what were notorious PC trackpad issues at the time. It has taken Apple a long time to enable Windows Precision Touchpad in Boot Camp, but not every MacBook is supported. An &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/bootcamp-control-panel/bcmpa82153f3/mac"&gt;Apple support document&lt;/a&gt; notes that only Mac computers with a T2 chip will be able to access Windows Precision Touchpad, which is most MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models from 2018 onward (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862"&gt;full list here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eeo71j"&gt;The timing of such a significant update to Boot Camp is also surprising and could hint that Intel-based Macs will coexist with Apple’s M1-based Macs for a while yet. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559003/apple-mac-macbook-air-pro-mini-m1-intel-processor-cpu"&gt;discontinued Intel-based MacBook Airs&lt;/a&gt; last year, but you can still buy a 13-inch MacBook Pro with an Intel CPU for now. Apple has said that its “transition to Apple silicon will take about two years to complete.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>When does sharing become oversharing?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of a phone with the Tiktok logo, the Instagram logo, and heart and speech bubble icons floating out of it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pufh1MfkrR_aKhAIcblBmSuGncA=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69439390/VRG_4614_10_Oversharing.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yqvnLX"&gt;I’m a chronic oversharer on social media — and usually an intentional one. Mostly, I write about my severe mental health struggles and things that deeply enrage me, but that constant oversharing can be hard to maintain. As much as I post, I delete a lot too, either because posts are too vulnerable, too hurtful, or too likely to spark conflict. It’s hard to know if the defiant overshares are really helping, or if I’m just worried about how a judgmental world will respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JEgXB"&gt;The intimacy of social media can lead us to share a lot, and being vulnerable in those spaces can give us a rare sense of power. The #MeToo movement brought on a flood of women disclosing their experiences with sexual violence and other issues, leading to increased accountability for perpetrators, a deeper sense of community for survivors, and greater education around consent. Yet at other times, sharing can have unexpected negative consequences, like shaming, security issues, or professional and personal conflict. But if the whole point is to share &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, how should we think about the choice of what to share and what not to share?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y4I5ys"&gt;&lt;q&gt;How should we think about the choice of what to share?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s72Haa"&gt;Christopher Hand, a lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University who studies online harassment, says the benefits are hard to peel apart from the risks.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“We live in a world that seems to be riddled with double-edged swords,” Hand told me, “things that have clear positives and clear constructive applications, but that are also vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OspUZi"&gt;I’ve seen that two-sided dynamic play out with my own sharing. People have told me that my own disclosures about mental health helped them with their shame or their healing trajectory. But the cost to my own mental health is significant. Knowing that my most traumatic moments are being judged and gossiped about — often in malicious ways — makes me anxious and even angry. Some appreciate the oversharing; others demonize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joAZdw"&gt;Of course, it depends on who is doing the sharing. Hand points out some research that indicates that various factors, including the perceived attractiveness of the poster, can affect how we judge the “appropriateness” of information shared on social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oKuOeP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When Nicole shares vulnerable thoughts online, she sees it as sharing with her friends, not the whole world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vt8YZm"&gt;Lindsay McGlone, an activist and public speaker who goes by The Fierce Fat Feminist online, says that she feels a lot of judgment coming from “the idea of ‘craving’ attention,” a gendered characterization that can paint women or other marginalized groups as dramatic or unstable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvnBBC"&gt;That risk is worth it for many of the marginalized users who go to social media to find community. Nicole Froio, a Brazilian freelance journalist and researcher on gendered violence, says sharing on social media has helped manage her feelings of isolation. “When I was doing my PhD, I was one of the few Latin American students in my department, so oversharing was important to process the xenophobia and racialization I was experiencing.” She told me that, as a bisexual woman, finding community among others who share that identity is also validating, and that when she shares vulnerable thoughts online, she sees it as sharing with her friends, not the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mv4hY"&gt;McGlone, too, says that stigma doesn’t matter. “[Social media] has always been an online diary for me, a place to document my daily life, my wins and successes, and of course my downfalls, especially living in a marginalized body.” Her social media is focused on creating a platform to highlight the discrimination that fat people face every day, and this is an overwhelmingly positive thing for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YuKntK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I am a big fan of the block button.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oFrTns"&gt;For users focused on a broader mission, the biggest issue becomes managing the trolls. “I am a big fan of the block button,” Ysabel Gerrard, lecturer in digital media and society at University of Sheffield, told me in an email. “Too many of my friends are targeted for their identities, particularly the trans community, and blocking people is an important method of protection (though sad that it’s necessary).” Posting anonymously is also an option, Gerrard says. Kids often use apps like YOLO to share without concerns about revealing their identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EW0vjP"&gt;“I’d also encourage people to make use of having multiple accounts on social media and embracing pseudonymity,” Gerrard writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vaqLAh"&gt;Another person, Kelsey*, told me she decided to use social media completely anonymously to discuss mental health, while also protecting her identity and that of her husband, who has a high-profile career. “I needed a space where I could anonymously spill my guts without burdening my loved ones,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="239o1d"&gt;The possible harms are real: embarrassment, stalking, and conflict with loved ones. Often, people don’t realize they have shared too much until it’s too late. Froio said venting online led to a fight with her parents. Another person, Noa*, told me she was required to see a school counselor she did not want to see due to one of her posts. “My boundaries were overstepped,” Noa said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bhdFQ"&gt;More and more, I’ve found oversharing on large platforms unpleasant and unfulfilling. I know that I can help people through sharing and community, but I reject the idea that I have to expose my own struggles and traumas in the process, that I have to bleed out over a pixelated screen to be of worth to society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6pXUa"&gt;That seems to be the takeaway for most people. “Oversharing” isn’t really defined by what you share. It’s defined by how well you’re honoring your own boundaries and prioritizing your own health when you share — keeping in mind that you can’t control others’ reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Kiyo webcam is 25 percent off at multiple retailers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rlat2j3lt3I6dml6ggoShxPvTlQ=/0x0:1090x727/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69439170/razer_kiyo_lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Arv0X"&gt;Finding a webcam during the early stages of the pandemic was borderline impossible. That’s not the case anymore. Most models are in stock, and sometimes, they’re even cheaper than their original prices, like Razer’s unique Kiyo webcam that has a ring light built in to make you look a little more lively during video calls. Normally $100, it’s $75 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kiyo-Streaming-Webcam-Built/dp/B075N1BYWB/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743127958055029996#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fproduct%2F874650107%2Fsellers&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. This webcam supports 1080p at 30 frames per second, or 720p resolution at 60 frames per second. Those aren’t cutting-edge specs, but there’s a good chance that it’s better than your laptop’s webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dH60Q"&gt;The $200 Kiyo Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295235/razer-kiyo-pro-webcam-review-adjustable-field-of-view-streaming-zoom-video-calls-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;released in early 2021&lt;/a&gt; with support for 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second, but it doesn’t have the built-in ring light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jbzRhL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10602056" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6mEMuK"&gt;There was a $30 off deal on the Apple AirPods Max over-ear headphones earlier this week, but we wanted to let you know that another $20 has been knocked off the original $549 price on the silver and blue colorways. You can get either at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Silver/dp/B08PZD76NP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now for $499 —in case a $20 difference was make-or-break for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzuWIa"&gt;It’s possible that we’ll see even more price cuts with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Prime Day 2021&lt;/a&gt; coming up soon, though I personally expect the best deals happening for less costly (but still brilliant) headphones, like Sony’s WH-1000XM4 and the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9VWBjH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="creCoA"&gt;At Best Buy, you’ll get a free $10 gift card to the store &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743129009092845332" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;if you purchase a $100 Apple gift card&lt;/a&gt;. That Apple gift can be used on apps and games in the App Store, as well as on hardware like iPads, AirPods, and anything else you can buy on Apple’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n2dFLy5O2Yifdz2zfO2V133Qs9c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652449/basiliskv2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fGOJl3"&gt;Razer’s excellent Basilisk V2 wired gaming mouse is $30 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743129071294433514#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082G5BDNC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, taking the price down to $50. For that price, you’ll get one of the more ergonomically built and customizable mice for gaming. Its scroll wheel can tilt to the side for extra inputs, and the scroll wheel’s tension can be adjusted on the fly to be more tactile or smooth. Additionally, it has thumb buttons and a DPI clutch that’s useful as a dedicated sniper button to slow down your movement speed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The race is on for quantum-safe cryptography</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of three computer chips stacked with the letters NIST and a lock imprinted on them." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9WCPogLz9vDOFpV2247-JuQAHgc=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69438987/VRG_4614_7_NIST.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbjSxF"&gt;In 2016, Lily Chen started a competition to rewrite the building blocks of encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGurag"&gt;With her team of mathematicians at the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, Chen reached out to academic and industry cryptographers around the world to find algorithms that could resist new threats posed by quantum computers. Five years later, the project is almost complete. After three rounds of elimination, Chen and her team have now narrowed the 69 submissions down to a final seven algorithms, with several winners to be named at the end of the year. If things go according to plan, the result will be a new set of NIST-certified algorithms — and a new measure of protection against the chaos of a fully operational quantum computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRrBsT"&gt;“Cryptosystems in devices and communication systems will not be secure anymore” when those computers reach their potential, Chen says. “It’s time to prepare for quantum threats.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IVlh9t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s time to prepare for quantum threats.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iQuDa5"&gt;Chen has technical reasons to be concerned. Existing encryption systems rely on specific mathematical equations that classical computers aren’t very good at solving — but quantum computers may breeze through them. As a security researcher, Chen is particularly interested in quantum computing’s ability to solve two types of math problems: factoring large numbers and solving discrete logarithms (essentially solving the problem &lt;em&gt;bx&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;a &lt;/em&gt;for &lt;em&gt;x)&lt;/em&gt;. Pretty much all internet security relies on this math to encrypt information or authenticate users in protocols such as Transport Layer Security. These math problems are simple to perform in one direction, but difficult in reverse, and thus ideal for a cryptographic scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQpXa6"&gt;“From a classical computer’s point of view, these are hard problems,” says Chen. “However, they are not too hard for quantum computers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOw2M7"&gt;In 1994, the mathematician Peter Shor outlined in a paper how a future quantum computer could solve both the factoring and discrete logarithm problems, but engineers are still struggling to make quantum systems work in practice. While several companies like Google and IBM, along with startups such as IonQ and Xanadu, have built small prototypes, these devices cannot perform consistently, and they have not conclusively completed any useful task beyond what the best conventional computers can achieve. In 2019, Google reported that its quantum computer had solved a problem faster than the best existing supercomputers, but it was a contrived task with no practical application. And in 2020, academic researchers in China also reported their quantum computer had beat conventional computing in performing an algorithm that could offer utility for specialized optimization tasks. But so far, quantum computers have only managed to factor tiny numbers like 15 and 21 — a useful proof of principle, but far from a practical threat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zwdd2x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A geometric puzzle in a grid of points, arranged across hundreds or even thousands of dimensions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UIRLa9"&gt;That hasn’t stopped researchers from trying to stay one step ahead of the quantum challenge. Peter Schwabe, a mathematician at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy, has devised several cryptography schemes with colleagues that have beat the third round of NIST’s competition. One of his submissions qualifies as a lattice-based protocol, a class of quantum-resistant algorithms that involve a geometric puzzle in a grid of points, arranged across hundreds or even thousands of dimensions. To crack the code, the computer must use given line segments to solve the puzzle, such as finding the most compact way to connect the lines end to end in the grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQwOi1"&gt;“Lattice-based cryptography is, at the moment, considered the most realistic drop-in replacement for the protocols we have today,” says Schwabe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpfnh7"&gt;It’s important to establish cryptographic standards now because once NIST standardizes a new cryptographic protocol, it will take years for some users to buy and set up the necessary technology. Another worry is that hackers today could intercept and store encrypted information, and then decrypt the messages a decade later with a quantum computer. This is a particular concern for government agencies that create documents intended to remain classified for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjpkuZ"&gt;“We have to try and get these cryptosystems ready well in advance of quantum computers,” says NIST mathematician Dustin Moody, a member of Chen’s team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="imsnMf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A head start in testing and implementing quantum-safe cryptography&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z23oAZ"&gt;In advance of NIST’s standards, some companies have already begun experimenting with these new cryptography schemes. In 2019, Google and the security company Cloudflare began &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/"&gt;testing the speed and security&lt;/a&gt; of two quantum computing-resistant protocols. “We hope that this experiment helps choose an algorithm with the best characteristics for the future of the internet,” wrote cryptographer Kris Kwiatkowski of Cloudflare in a blog post after the tests were performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPxg7m"&gt;When the winning algorithms are chosen, the hope is that NIST’s federal certification will spur more companies to follow suit, and give them a head start in testing and implementing quantum-safe cryptography. Ultimately, NIST researchers see this work as public service. They aim to make these cryptographic standards freely available. The agency doesn’t pay cryptographers to participate in the competition, and winners will not receive any money. “You just get fame in the cryptographic world, which carries its own weight,” says Moody. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKNuLj"&gt;And the winners get the satisfaction of knowing they’ve completely redesigned swaths of internet infrastructure. The new protocols will alter fundamental interactions on the internet, like how your computer confirms you’ve actually accessed the right website and not a hacker’s server — not to mention how companies encrypt your credit card number when you make an online purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blO9Nz"&gt;But the revolution will be quiet. “The average user is not really going to see or notice this,” says Moody. “Hopefully, it’ll all be done behind the scenes by the cryptographers and the people who put this into their products.” Like the best security products, you can tell it’s working when nobody notices the change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ultimate hotel room coffee-making guide</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A great travel coffee kit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ib8lzFDaScoAx4pOHOm1izg6aE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69439016/dbohn_20210528_4612_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A great travel coffee kit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A thousand times better than whatever’s in the room&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="s18Klx"&gt;Here is my philosophy on great coffee: drink it if you can get it, and don’t be a snob if you can only get something basic. But I have my limits on what I’ll accept, and those limits are well above what’s usually available in the little basket in your typical American hotel room. I am currently sitting in my first hotel room in over a year and figure a few of you might be doing the same soon, so here’s my guide for how to make the best coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T70JiH"&gt;The obvious option is to locate the nearest coffee shop where you’re traveling, but that would necessitate leaving your hotel room, and the whole point of coffee is to build up the wherewithal to face the world in the first place. Instead, I prefer to make the coffee myself in the most convenient way given the limitations and options usually available in a hotel room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Aeropress Go makes it very simple to make good coffee in all conditions" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oS0ra8qNxa34EeVhD6xR5C4UsC8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22601956/dbohn_20210528_4612_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AeroPress Go makes it very simple to make good coffee in all conditions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yE0yQA"&gt;The best portable coffee brewer: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/AeroPress-Portable-Travel-Coffee-Press/dp/B07YVL8SF3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AeroPress Go&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RLDAXb"&gt;Of all the coffee makers in all the travel bags in all the world, the AeroPress Go is the best for travel. It comes with a bunch of pieces of equipment that you’ll want on hand. There’s the basic system itself, which consists of a tube and plunger, of course. But it also packs itself into its own plastic cup and comes with a little container for filters, a scoop, and a stir stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIjw4L"&gt;There are a few reasons the AeroPress Go is so great for travel. First, it’s indestructible. Everything is plastic and can be knocked around. It’s also light, self-contained, and easy to clean. Most importantly for me, it’s an incredibly forgiving coffee maker. Conditions in a hotel room are going to vary from your home setup: unless you’re willing to devote space to a proper kettle and scale, you will be using smaller and simpler methods for getting hot water and measuring your ratios. Given that you can’t do everything exactly as you might like, the AeroPress has the best Good Coffee To No Fuss Ratio I’ve found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teQSX2"&gt;It comes with a coffee scoop and stir stick, if you like using those when you brew your coffee. (I don’t bother with either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1csFi3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10599315" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A simple immersion boiler is super portable — but never use it unattended" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tv1gQ2r-C2x-E5N_xsShG1V5M3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22601968/dbohn_20210528_4612_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A simple immersion boiler is super portable — but never use it unattended.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TZUzp7"&gt;The simplest way to boil water in a hotel room: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Norpro-Instant-Electric-Immersion-Heater/dp/B01M0Q84BR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;immersion heater&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7H6k4H"&gt;This little coil is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; thing that unlocked my entire travel coffee setup. The thing about making coffee is you need very hot water, and the thing about hotel rooms is your options for making very hot water range from bad to none. An immersion heater neatly solves that problem without taking up too much space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHKLy5"&gt;You may be tempted, as I have, to buy a portable water kettle — the kind that collapses down. I have tried two or three, and they’re all bad: too fussy, hard to clean, and too big. This little coil is really all you need to boil water, provided you have a vessel you can drop it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yef3j8"&gt;A couple words of warning. 1. I don’t think it’s a great idea to use this in the cup that comes with your AeroPress. I’ve done it in a pinch, but I think you should use something else. I use my own thermos, but you can also get by with whatever mugs are provided to you in the hotel room. 2. This coil is a blunt instrument: it’s a coil of metal literally hooked directly into the outlet. &lt;em&gt;Never&lt;/em&gt; leave it unattended when plugged in, and &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; plug it in without first ensuring it’s submerged in water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DLkxQ"&gt;One thing you’ll miss out on is directly controlling the exact temperature of your water with this boiler. That’s fine because you’re already using the AeroPress, which is very forgiving about things like water temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oiX2xY"&gt;When packing, I stuff this coil and its cord inside my travel mug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ab4eSi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10599326" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="I always try to buy local beans at my destination" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/feuoyayc8J7SuTuxm_d-Jr4c3rw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22601947/dbohn_20210528_4612_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I always try to buy local beans at my destination.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c9XHJD"&gt;Get good coffee beans or grounds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jrhzWU"&gt;You’re going to need good coffee to make good coffee, so get some good coffee. How you handle this is entirely up to you. My setup includes a hand coffee grinder (see below), but pre-ground beans are perfectly fine for hotel room coffee if you ask me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5o1a8G"&gt;My preferred way of handling the Bean Question is to not bring my own from home. Instead, I do a tiny bit of research before I leave and then buy them from a local shop when I arrive in town. I aim to try coffee that’s local and / or new to me. If you choose not to bring a grinder, the move is to go to the shop and ask them to grind the beans for you — that way, they’ll be just a little fresher than if you buy a pre-ground bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqgHNy"&gt;The last couple items below are totally optional. An AeroPress Go, a water boiler, and coffee are really all you need. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="This Zojirushi travel mug keeps your coffee hot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwgw4WRCBxQ64pCYFfJVtetL7dg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22601970/dbohn_20210528_4612_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Zojirushi travel mug keeps your coffee hot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jaa8Wx"&gt;My favorite travel mug: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-SM-KHE48AG-Stainless-Steel-16-Ounce/dp/B00HR0WZP4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zojirushi stainless steel travel mug&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lvQjBt"&gt;I won’t deign to tell you what kind of travel mug you should use, but this one is my favorite. It’s compact, utterly spillproof, and doesn’t slosh coffee into my face when I’m walking and sipping. It’s a lovely coffee mug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iTsEd"&gt;There are two downsides. You have to take some pieces apart to properly clean it; the lid is made up of plastic and gaskets. It’s not difficult to do and easy to put back together, but it is a little bit of work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtBL0D"&gt;The second is a weird one, but here we go: for some people, it’s &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; good at keeping coffee hot. It sounds strange to complain about a coffee thermos being too good at its job, but sometimes you will use it at a coffee shop where you don’t have complete control over the temperature. For me, I’d rather have something that I know will keep my drink hot for hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHFCJW"&gt;I also use this as my travel water bottle when the coffee runs out. I recognize the irony of putting all this work into making great coffee only to use the same mug to drink water that will taste vaguely coffee-esque if I can’t clean it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Myl1bm"&gt;
&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10599328" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Hand-grinding your beans in a hotel room is next-level coffee-nerd, but you feel like you earn your cup." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JuaQcXI0SCG620DGac7R0XOk-dY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22601990/dbohn_20210528_4612_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hand-grinding your beans in a hotel room is next-level coffee nerd, but you feel like you earn your cup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C01pP3"&gt;My favorite portable coffee grinder: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085C8L78K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Timemore Chestnut C2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Yg02EU"&gt;Okay, this is where I’ve gone off the deep end, I admit it. Hand-grinding your beans, one cup at a time, is obviously and inherently ridiculous when you’re sitting in a hotel room. But I bought this Timemore grinder on a lark a couple years ago, and it’s such a good little machine that I pack it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6Wwv8"&gt;There are lots of different hand grinders, but I love this one because it’s relatively small and has a satisfying heft. It has a ton of different grind size options. I’ve used it enough that I can eyeball how much to fill it with beans to get the right amount of coffee ground to use in the AeroPress Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fWU5T"&gt;It’s over the top, I know. But fresh, burr-ground coffee really does taste better — which is to say you have to work for it with manual labor, and therefore you will convince yourself you can taste the difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7VMATt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10599334"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My coffee gear takes up a little more than the space of a folded pair of bluejeans. Worth it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UE7zcC"&gt;Bonus: A simple AeroPress Go recipe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WLzUtY"&gt;There are a kajillion AeroPress recipes on the internet. I am here to tell you that the best one is the one you land on yourself after some trial and error. In a hotel room, I do not bother with a scale. (I’m not a maniac, I swear.) Here’s my recipe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="iPMbtu"&gt;Put a (dry) filter in the AeroPress, and set it on top of the included cup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DG0s55"&gt;Grind the coffee as fine as I feel like. (The finer it’s set, the more work it is to hand-grind.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aK9muW"&gt;Eyeball the amount of coffee I put into the AeroPress. I fill just over the base of the filter cap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3Spe83"&gt;Fill it up with just-off-the-boil water just over the number 3 on the side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ARtM9b"&gt;Set the plunger on and pull up slightly to make a vacuum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TPT8Ci"&gt;After two minutes, swirl the whole thing to agitate, then press for 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YG03k5"&gt;Taste. Add a little water if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="JlYKaq"&gt;Here’s a slightly more detailed recipe from James Hoffman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IfrakO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6VlT_jUVPc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to stop your emails from being tracked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of a letter envelope with a target over it with pixels floating around both." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Pi8r0uc4i8-kswTyRNU-H0pTaQ=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68841883/VRG_4614_3_EmailTracking.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wmDbQw"&gt;All of those obnoxious marketing emails that crowd your inbox aren’t just pushing a product. They’re also tracking whether you’ve opened the email, when you opened it, and where you were at the time by using software like Mailchimp to embed tracking software into the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1f75NZ"&gt;How does it work? A single tracking pixel is embedded in the email, usually (but not always) hidden within an image or a link. When the email is opened, code within the pixel sends the info back to the company’s server. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYBZIp"&gt;There have been some attempts to restrict the amount of information that can be transmitted this way. For example, since 2014, &lt;a href="https://gmail.googleblog.com/2013/12/images-now-showing.html"&gt;Google has served all images in Gmail through its own proxy servers&lt;/a&gt;, which could hide your location from at least some tracking applications. And extensions such as &lt;a href="https://uglyemail.com/"&gt;Ugly Email&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixelblock/jmpmfcjnflbcoidlgapblgpgbilinlem"&gt;PixelBlock&lt;/a&gt; have been developed to block trackers on Chrome and Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6EFgJ"&gt;There is also a simple, basic step you can take to avoid trackers: stop your email from automatically loading images, since images are where the majority of these pixels hide. You won’t be able to avoid all of the trackers that can hide in your email this way, but you will stop many of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjXsAd"&gt;Here’s how to disable image autoloading in the major desktop and mobile email apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="91Fgwl"&gt;Gmail on the web&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zbqpz9"&gt;Click on the gear icon in the upper-right corner to access your settings, and then click on “See all settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZEfys0"&gt;In the “General” tab (the first one), scroll down to “Images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z0QTtq"&gt;Select “Ask before displaying external images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VeQHzw"&gt;Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on “Save Changes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="yRek5v"&gt;Note that this will also turn off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282636/amp-gmail-shopping-rsvp-forms-inbox-google-beta"&gt;Gmail’s dynamic email feature&lt;/a&gt;, which makes emails more interactive. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In the “General” tab, scroll down to “Images” and select “Ask before displaying external images.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OyvGIew6m_cCzL7vC_d31z8230c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544004/gmail_pixel.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the “General” tab, scroll down to “Images” and select “Ask before displaying external images.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XrhZKY"&gt;Microsoft Outlook.com&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xDoAal"&gt;While the browser-based version of Outlook doesn’t let you stop loading images, you can make it load images through its own service. To enable that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CurYRn"&gt;Click on “Settings” (the gear symbol in the upper-right corner). In the column that opens, click on “View all Outlook settings” at the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="exNksS"&gt;Select “General” &amp;gt; “Privacy and data.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oQoFLs"&gt;Scroll down to “External images” and select “Always use the Outlook service to load images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Outlook.com can route incoming images through its own service." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1JWz2g79d9AWZqgrg2XZ_vorNPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544343/outlook_online__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outlook.com can route incoming images through its own service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GlQKBG"&gt;Microsoft Outlook (Office 365) for Windows 10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MIRvx9"&gt;Click on “File” &amp;gt; “Options.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="132JwF"&gt;In the “Outlook Options” window, select “Trust Center.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bgp9g6"&gt;Click on the “Trust Center Settings” button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8dvLox"&gt;Check the boxes labeled “Don’t download pictures automatically in standard HTML email messages or RSS items” and “Don’t download pictures in encrypted or signed HTML email messages.” You can make a number of exceptions to the first item, if you like, by reviewing the boxes underneath it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To stop automatic downloads, go to the Trust Center." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qvp5woUtECVNQ68MfnG_uWpguBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545835/outlook_screenshot.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To stop automatic downloads, go to the Trust Center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uyuAUz"&gt;Microsoft Outlook (Office 365) for Mac&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 gives you better tools to fight the firehose of notifications — with a catch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EuCoVA7ssG0Z3TCAXxJ7Soj_i0o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69438771/vpavic_4243_20201018_0144.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NfUox1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 preview&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week gave us a look at an important new feature coming to your iPhone’s notifications: help. A few new tools may act as a life preserver for those of us up to our eyeballs in a sea of notifications every day, regulating which apps and people are allowed to bug us, and when. But on the flip side, app developers get some additional tools for getting your attention, too, and could very well start sending you even &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;notifications — albeit in a less disruptive way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="LI7bZA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10601863"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SwzC2c"&gt;First, the good news: the new notification features in iOS 15 look genuinely good and useful. There’s a new feature called Focus that allows you to choose which people and apps you’d like to see notifications from at a given time. It’s like Do Not Disturb but with much more customization than simply turning off every possible disruption. You can set up modes for work, sleep, personal time, and other scenarios like workouts. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i13_lA5OsvFV8CNunF44yImFsvI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651209/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_12.53.38_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;People who message you in third-party apps can be associated with their profile in your contacts list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zZv4cm"&gt;When setting up a new Focus mode, Siri can scan your outgoing messages and calls and automatically suggest allowing notifications from the people you talk to most. There’s a neat trick here too: communications from the people you approve can come from other apps, like Facebook Messenger, not just from iMessage or texts. When you get that Facebook Messenger message in iOS 15, you may see prompts to associate that person in that app with a matching person in your contacts list, too. Once you’ve done this, communications from that person in a third-party app will be allowed to interrupt your Focus mode, provided that you approved them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSS4Kr"&gt;You’ll also have the option to set &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22524031/apple-focus-away-message-aim-wwdc-aol"&gt;a kind of away message&lt;/a&gt; when you’re using a Focus mode that will let others know you’re temporarily unavailable when they send you an iMessage. When your friend doesn’t hear back from you for hours, they won’t have to guess whether you hate them or you’re just really busy with work, and that’s nice for everyone. iOS 15 also adds notification summaries, which will batch lower priority notifications into digests you’ll receive at certain times of day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3PgZKCDdDimtOWb1gdIt3zWT6AA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652212/notification_summary_ios_15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notification summaries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Rl0sTv"&gt;All of this gives you more control over interruptions, which is great! But what about app developers who want you to ~engage~ with their platform? They have new options too. They can now use one of four notification interruption types, two of which are new in iOS 15. First are passive interruptions, a new, less obtrusive kind of notification available to developers that doesn’t wake your screen or cause your phone to vibrate — they go straight to your notification center. Previous versions of iOS allowed the user to designate notifications from certain apps to be delivered silently, but this new framework lets the app developer choose to deliver them this way. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0u0PzzhdQyA4vW8XJnDCG7vf8Dg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651200/passive_int.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Notifications classified as “passive” appear in your notification center silently, without buzzing your phone or breaking through a Focus mode.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv5hsy"&gt;These are the types of notifications likely to end up in summaries if you’ve enabled that feature. They don’t just appear in chronological order in the summary digest either — machine learning helps sort them by priority. They’ll likely include images and other visuals too, since Apple encourages developers to include media as part of the notification to increase its chances of showing up at the top of the summary list. And since the risk of annoying you is lower, developers have some incentive to send more frequent, more engaging notifications. They’ll be less disruptive, but these are the kinds of notifications we’re likely to see more of in iOS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aWF6uI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;since the risk of annoying you is lower, developers have some incentive to send more frequent, more engaging notifications&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RzQfNX"&gt;The other new interruption type is “time sensitive,” which is kind of a Notification Plus. It behaves like a standard notification, lighting up your screen and playing a sound or vibrating, but with an important difference: it’s allowed to break through your focus mode settings and notify you even if they aren’t from an “approved” app. The option to see time sensitive notifications can be turned on and off by the user, so if you really don’t want to see them, you don’t have to. In theory though, they should be for truly time sensitive events, like a package being delivered or your credit card company making sure it was you who bought two round-trip tickets to Maui. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwITss"&gt;In theory. Apple lets developers decide which notifications deserve time sensitive designation, so it’s more or less on the honor system. The company urges them to maintain trust and keep in mind that users can turn off notifications for their app if they feel they’re being bothered unnecessarily. And lest we forget, Apple itself has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21165087/ios-apple-push-notification-advertising-marketing-now-allowed-app-store"&gt;bent the rules before&lt;/a&gt; on what’s considered too intrusive for a notification. Could developers end up overusing time sensitive notifications? Possibly, but they likely won’t gain much from doing so, since users can opt out of them and may decide to silence the app entirely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgEnYi"&gt;There are a few other things worth noting about notifications in iOS 15:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gzZDTh"&gt;With compatible audio devices like AirPods, Siri will be able to read any incoming notification to you. Previously, this function was limited to things like incoming messages. By default, Siri will read the contents of messages and time sensitive notifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mSzX54"&gt;Notifications with a “critical” interruption type basically remain unchanged: these are things like Amber Alerts, which bypass your ringer settings to play a sound and get your attention. App developers still need special permission for these notifications, so we shouldn’t suddenly start seeing more of them in iOS 15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2XzQyl"&gt;Notifications will look a little different, with bigger app icons and images of contacts included in messages. The actions you can take on a notification (liking an image, etc.) will get graphical icons, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
