    <title>FTC opens antitrust probe into Meta’s purchase of VR fitness app Supernatural</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KF6XqMiPf_vdDmE4BU3x9oDyrsE=/0x4:2160x1444/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70284319/Supernatural_VR.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EnIbqZ"&gt;The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened an in-depth antitrust probe of Meta’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753403/supernatural-within-studio-facebook-meta-oculus-vr-fitness-experiences-metaverse"&gt;plan to buy the popular VR fitness app Supernatural&lt;/a&gt;, according &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ftc-slows-meta-platforms-metaverse-strategy-by-extending-antitrust-probe-of-vr-deal?utm_source=ti_app&amp;amp;rc=k5vrz1"&gt;to a new report by &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUXFEt"&gt;The probe means that antitrust regulators are starting to scrutinize the-company-formally-known-as-Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537795/is-facebook-cornering-the-vr-market"&gt;interest in scooping up VR startups&lt;/a&gt;, not just its traditional social media acquisitions. According to &lt;em&gt;The Information’s &lt;/em&gt;Josh Sisco, Meta’s previous five virtual reality acquisitions, including its deal for the studio behind hit game &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;, weren't probed by the government because the purchase prices were too small. “But those regulators are slowing down the $400 million-plus Supernatural deal, according to two people with knowledge of the situation,” the report notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBYLQq"&gt;It’s unclear what criteria the FTC, which is simultaneously suing Meta in a bid to unwind the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, is using to evaluate the VR deal. VR is a nascent but fast-growing industry that third-party estimates say Meta has a majority market share of, thanks mostly to the early success of its Quest 2 headset. While the FTC might eventually approve the Supernatural deal, its decision to investigate signals that Meta’s playbook of quickly buying the hottest VR startups on its platform may already be coming to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 will no longer have NFTs after fan outcry</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FbPxxc45qbR4Q667wib3mLae1Xk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283878/ss_3b56a4aea69f1d49d4871eeb1913f460f067a138.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSC Game World has scrapped its plans for NFTs in &lt;/em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: GSC Game World&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dgKLMj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; will no longer include NFTs, developer GSC Game World &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stalker_thegame/status/1471620399997886472"&gt;announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The news arrives after a heavily criticized announcement Wednesday and after the studio posted and then deleted an explanation on Thursday that initially tried to explain it would, in fact, still have NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5eQnq5"&gt;“Based on the feedback we received, we’ve made a decision to cancel anything NFT-related in &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&lt;/em&gt;,” the new statement says. “The interests of our fans and players are the top priority for the team. We’re making this game for you to enjoy — whatever the cost is. If you care, we care too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OcGmlC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/mffnmpiQiw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mffnmpiQiw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— S.T.A.L.K.E.R. OFFICIAL (@stalker_thegame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stalker_thegame/status/1471620399997886472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qPGkOp"&gt;GSC Game World had announced Wednesday that it would be partnering with NFT platform DMarket on digital items for the game. One of the NFTs it had planned to offer would have allowed the owner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22834567/stalker-2-nfts-metahuman-dmarket"&gt;to become a “metahuman,”&lt;/a&gt; which actually meant they’d be turned into an NPC in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lLxJ6"&gt;Now, those plans are scrapped. I guess this explains why the studio deleted its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840383/stalker-2-developer-explain-nfts-gsc-game-world-deleted-tweet"&gt;earlier tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Read the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 developer’s deleted explanation for why you’re getting NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q2fqs1yOiltD5WxR3elJR9hAjLM=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283780/ss_6a0d30d5fad86c12df46e59042efb55c9a4a3b53.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSC Game World deleted a tweet elaborating why it plans to offer NFTs.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: GSC Game World&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0SYqpL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 16th, 6:44PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; 11 minutes after we posted this story, GSC Game World announced it was canceling &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840488/stalker-2-nft-metahuman-gsc-web3-canceled"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“anything NFT-related in &lt;/em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&lt;em&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Guess that explains why the earlier explanation was deleted. Our original story follows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="e2Iruk"&gt;
&lt;p id="QsA7uB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; developer GSC Game World posted a now-deleted statement on Twitter elaborating on its widely criticized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22834567/stalker-2-nfts-metahuman-dmarket"&gt;plans to add NFTs to the game&lt;/a&gt;. In short, the company said it will be using funds earned from the NFTs to help with development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tU5Rsk"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; is truly the biggest and the most complex game we have ever created,” GSC Game World said. “All the funds that we earn during the development process (including the potential income from NFT) will be spent on improving the long-awaited game to make it even better.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fXmleqcEh9gVI-BE2T-RBfPtBN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23102587/slack_imgs.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GSC Game World&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSC Game World’s now deleted statement addressing its plans to add NFTs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gbYE23"&gt;On Wednesday, the developer revealed it would be partnering with NFT platform DMarket on the virtual items. As part of its NFT plans, GSC Game World said it would be offering NFTs that allowed the owners to become a “metahuman,” or an NPC added to the game in their likeness. In its Thursday update, GSC Game World downplayed the role of those NPCs, saying they “aren’t even involved in the story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HonLN"&gt;The company had previously been vague about its other planned NFTs, but GSC Game World shared more information in the deleted statement about what’s to come, acknowledging that after the metahuman, “some of you thought we would go a bit too far from here.” Here’s what’s apparently coming down the pike: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6Za2pb"&gt;We are going to implement (nick)names of the owners on some in-game desks / walls / etc. (please remember it’s a large open world we’re talking about), gloves / tattoos, skins / badges for the multiplayer mode (releasing as a free update after the story campaign) and collectible cards (DMarket platform only, no integration in &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4MvrzB"&gt;The studio ended its Thursday statement by saying, “Please accept our apologies for yesterday’s miscommunication and all the feelings it caused. We know that you wish only the best for our game, and we appreciate it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kD5dDI"&gt;GSC Game World didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the deleted statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vqh4zw"&gt;This month, there has been a wave of video game NFT announcements. Ubisoft launched its own heavily criticized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822410/ubisoft-nfts-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-breakpoint"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost Recon: Breakpoint&lt;/em&gt; NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, some of which require &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1469051945490993162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1470107122239262724%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fembed%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fid%3Dtwitter-1470107122239262724autosize%3D1"&gt;hundreds of hours of gameplay&lt;/a&gt; be claimed. Peter Molyneux also revealed details about a business simulator where people can buy an NFT &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22832188/peter-molyneux-22cans-gala-nft-blockchain-business-simulator-game-interview"&gt;actually called “Land.”&lt;/a&gt; The virtual plots have already pulled in more than $54 million in total, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/peter-molyneux-nft-game-sells-plot-for-900k"&gt;according to &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/peter-molyneux-raises-54m-on-promise-of-play-to-earn-nft-game-legacy/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are a go-to pick that’s often on sale&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HYaZ7v"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but there are still some great discounts available on Apple’s AirPods. In fact, we’ve actually been seeing some deals that are even better than they were during the recent shopping holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SziSp1"&gt;Since Apple launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; in October and unveiled its new AirPods lineup, we’ve seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model drop from $159 to $129. Even better, we’ve seen many retailers starting to heavily discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even recently seen some significant discounts on the third-gen AirPods, despite how recently they launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UJyTOI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"},{"title":"Which AirPods should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. It only sells the model with a wired charging case, however, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. Despite their age, we found these easy-to-use earbuds offer great wireless performance and reliable battery life, making them a great pick if you can live without a wireless charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtXs0h"&gt;Right now, Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods are selling for their lowest price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has discounted the earbuds to $89.99 (with delayed shipping), which is less than what we saw them go for on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;AirPods (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;The newest pair of wireless earbuds support Apple’s MagSafe technology. The short stems yield a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPrKN"&gt;Deals were once hard to come by on the third-gen model, but we finally started seeing some significant deals starting around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In fact, like the second-gen AirPods, they’re currently selling for less than they were last month. At the moment, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling the $179 earbuds for $139.99, yet, just like their predecessor, with delayed shipping. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-3rd-generation%2F510546422&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeBestAirPodsdeals1222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is also discounting the third-gen model, but only by $10 or so. You will, however, be able to get the earbuds in time for the holidays, if you intend to use them as a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q2OXRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; an iPhone owner can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and come with swappable silicone tips. In addition, they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713126/airpods-pro-conversation-boost-firmware-update"&gt;recently received a firmware&lt;/a&gt; update that added Conversation Boost, an accessibility feature for those who are hard of hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM8uVd"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi"&gt;recently launched a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods. These start at $249, but you can buy them right now for $169 in-store at Staples until December 18th. If you miss out on that deal, they’re also going for $179 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and $179.99 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro-with-magsafe%2F-%2FA-77603773&amp;amp;subid1=Verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not quite as low as the $159 price we saw this model drop to during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s still roughly a $70 discount off the cost you’d pay through Apple directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="THtgJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and a wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max were discounted to $429 at Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, prices have since increased.

    <title>Peloton rival Echelon’s new connected bike is fit for the club</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Echelon’s EX-8S against a dark background and blue LED flywheels" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-YuPO_T-aOJ3qgY7DMKW5UwYR4s=/0x197:3676x2648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283671/Echelon_ex_8s_product_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behold, the EX-8S&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Echelon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oWVBtB"&gt;While Peloton is the most familiar name in connected fitness, Echelon’s bikes are probably the ones you’ve seen before without noticing. Echelon’s bikes are among the first that pop up when you google “cheaper Peloton alternative,” and it’s also the company behind Walmart’s $497 connected bike. (You might also remember them from last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452145/amazon-prime-bike-500-disavow-echelon-fitness-peleton-competitor"&gt;Amazon Prime Bike debacle&lt;/a&gt;.) Well, now one of Peloton’s biggest rivals is back with a new premium bike — the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fechelonfit.com%2Fpages%2Fechelon-ex-8s&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F16%2F22840197%2Fechelon-ex-8s-bike-peloton-curved-touchscreen-led" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EX-8S&lt;/a&gt;, and it is extremely extra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5G2UBL"&gt;For starters, the bike sports a 24-inch 1080p curved touchscreen. Echelon says that’s to create a more immersive experience and that the screen itself also flips open 180-degrees for off-bike workouts. It’s also got not one but two light-up flywheels that can be customized by color and lighting pattern thanks to 15 LED lights — just in case you want to recreate that whole “I’m biking in a club” feeling from SoulCycle and other boutique cycling studios. During a briefing, an Echelon spokesperson confirmed you can see the lighting while you’re on the bike itself and that it’s also possible to sync them to your workout metrics. The company also claims that the two-flywheel design gives the bike better stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1p9VLW"&gt;If it looks like a light-up Peloton, that’s not a coincidence. Echelon says the bike was designed by Eric Villency, who designed the original Peloton bike and the SoulCycle bike. The bike also features 32 levels of motorized magnetic resistance. While most bikes rely on a resistance knob to tweak difficulty levels, the EX-8S also has a patent-pending digital resistance controller built into the handlebar. According to Echelon, this is so riders can easily adjust resistance while in third position (pedaling while standing). The bike itself weighs 125lbs and can support riders up to 300lbs. As for connectivity, the EX-8S also supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It’s also compatible with SPD pedals. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P_xymY9ndJMnMsFg13ztqLtws9M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23102366/Echelon_ex_8s_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Echelon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Peloton’s Bike Plus, the EX-8S’s screen rotates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CpKtHY"&gt;That said, connected fitness also heavily leans on its content, and Echelon’s content library hasn’t always been as polished as its competitors. On that front, Echelon says it’s adding new fitness programs and challenges in 2022, along with “more immersive multimedia experiences” like music videos, performances, and artist spotlights. That apparently includes former NFL athletes joining rides, spotlights from artists like Lady Gaga and Norah Jones, as well as Broadway shows like &lt;em&gt;Phantom of the Opera &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Dear Evan Hansen&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXhiG2"&gt;Is the bike itself a tad ridiculous? Yes. It’s unclear who exactly sits in the Venn diagram of LED bike lovers and &lt;em&gt;Dear Evan Hansen&lt;/em&gt;. However, Peloton’s had a rocky quarter, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22778851/peloton-growing-pains-connected-fitness-tonal-hydrow-mirror"&gt;competition in connected fitness is amping up&lt;/a&gt;. Echelon releasing a premium bike just ahead of CES 2022 also hints the company might be hoping to make a big splash at the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xo1Psa"&gt;The EX-8S isn’t &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fechelonfit.com%2Fpages%2Fechelon-ex-8s&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F16%2F22840197%2Fechelon-ex-8s-bike-peloton-curved-touchscreen-led" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available just yet&lt;/a&gt; but will retail at $2,399 along with a $34.99 monthly subscription to Echelon’s digital content. That’s a good deal more expensive than Echelon’s other bikes, especially its $497 &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FEchelon-Connect-Sport-Indoor-Cycling-Exercise-Bike-with-90-Day-Free-Premier-Membership-105-Value%2F533034706&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart-exclusive bike&lt;/a&gt; — though that only has a tablet holder. Echelon’s other connected bikes cost between $899.99 and $1,599.99. The company says pre-sales through January 15 will get a discounted price of $1,999.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Babble Royale turns Scrabble into Fortnite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pNShDZuvD9HZTSphyRXwIwZ5ILI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283572/ss_dfbfbf247467f68361989aa1eaeb1944e4d31a78.1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JxQ5az"&gt;There used to be a joke that every game was turning into a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-style battle royale, and here to make that bit a reality is &lt;em&gt;Babble Royale,&lt;/em&gt; a new Scrabble-style competitive online multiplayer game from designer Frank Lantz’s Everybody House Games (best known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/10/11/16457742/ai-paperclips-thought-experiment-game-frank-lantz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Universal Paperclips&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203463/hey-robot-smart-speaker-alexa-siri-google-assistant-web-free-quarantine"&gt;Hey Robot&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtZHVU"&gt;Despite the fact that it feels like a joke meant to clown on Fortnite, PUGB, and other last-person-standing games in the genre, &lt;em&gt;Babble Royale &lt;/em&gt;is very much a real game, currently available on Steam in early access for both PC and Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1dJpyJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Babble Royale is now live in early access! I think it's the funnest game I've ever worked on. Come see for yourself.&lt;a href="https://t.co/5vxJDAlYXD"&gt;https://t.co/5vxJDAlYXD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/N6WGBpB8AM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/N6WGBpB8AM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Frank Lantz (@flantz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/flantz/status/1471192145453215745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="emrTSK"&gt;Players parachute their beginning tile down into a grid (yes, actually), claiming a spot for themselves to start building words (as you would in Scrabble or Bananagrams) to expand outwards and eliminate other players. As you explore the map, you can spell your way onto tiles to pick up powerups or purchase additional upgrades using money gained by spelling bigger words. As time goes on, a “hot zone” will slowly creep in from the corner of the map, damaging or eliminating players from contention until only one speller reigns supreme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdHXa0"&gt;And of course, there are optional cosmetics available to purchase to customize your character (i.e., the letter you parachute in with) with different patterns or hats. Yes, seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/54GFvBDRrn4AtjvPwExAJlBGRww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23102448/ss_79f91b9d34922f7511aa1c7c0987ab9d1014a003.1920x1080.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;This is the world we live in now.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sHO4nX"&gt;I tried playing a few rounds of &lt;em&gt;Babble Royale&lt;/em&gt;, but while the concept is fun as a high-brow joke on the genre, I bounced off pretty hard on the actual gameplay. You can only play new letters off the last word that you spelled, which means that longtime Scrabble players will have to seriously think about how they play. There were also times where I just was plain stuck, walled in by existing words but unable to play any real ones of my own, leaving me to sit around until the game cleared out some of the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYqH54"&gt;But for those who like competitive word games and don’t mind taking the time to adjust to &lt;em&gt;Babble Royale’s&lt;/em&gt; new strategies and idiosyncrasies, the new title is certainly one of the cleverest spins on the concept so far. The initial launch of &lt;em&gt;Babble Royale&lt;/em&gt; is also still in “Season Zero” as an early access launch, with more features and content planned for the future, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cln7VP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1759440/Babble_Royale/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Babble Royale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is available to download for free now on Steam. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for kids</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r4jXkQ8uM8UoHOmLgQAZJSNPkZc=/0x2:2048x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149161/Kids.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Richard Parry&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Great gifts that will cultivate curiosity, creativity, and so much more &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="j0Yebj"&gt;Kids can be tricky giftees. They want toys, of course, but the sheer abundance of available options can be overwhelming, especially if you don’t know where to start. And while you could make life easier by asking your kids what they want, they’ll likely bombard you with a laundry list of items, some of which might not be realistic. Besides, there are other factors to consider, including your budget and whether a gift is age-appropriate or safe for your child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rG96i"&gt;With little time left before the holidays and shipping deadlines hanging overhead, we’ve decided to do the hard work for you. Below, we’ve compiled a list of gifts suitable for kids of all ages, ranging from tried-and-true classics like the Lite-Brite ($13) to newer additions, such as the latest Kindle Paperwhite Kids ($120), Wekapo’s Inflatable Lounger ($38), and Wing’s second-gen electric bike ($910). There are also a number of STEM toys and educational gifts for younger children, as well as a few designed to spur their creativity on paper and get them moving outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwExzX"&gt;Take a look, and see what kind of fun stuff you can gift the kids in your life this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop is selling PlayStation 5 console bundles in-store on December 17th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dNavx3OJfdavVFpChqU7EzA-Ad0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282982/vpavic_4278_20201030_0041.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MIOH2S"&gt;GameStop has announced &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fps5-store-event.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a special in-store sales event&lt;/a&gt; for the hard-to-get Sony PlayStation 5 console, taking place on December 17th. The restock event requires &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergegamestopinstoreps5&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpoweruprewards%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a subscription to GameStop’s Pro membership&lt;/a&gt; — which normally runs $14.99 per year but is currently discounted to $9.99 once added to your cart. GameStop &lt;a href="https://gamestop.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/12-17_PS5Event_StoreList"&gt;lists all its participating retail locations&lt;/a&gt; on its site, which spans over 700 stores across the US. While this event is being hosted at many locations, GameStop has indicated that quantities will be limited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkZMTo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theshortcut.com/p/exclusive-ps5-restock-at-gamestop"&gt;According to Matt Swider’s &lt;em&gt;The Shortcut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, GameStop will have around 60 disc-based PS5 bundles at participating stores. The bundles will supposedly consist of a PS5 console, &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;, a third-party DualSense charging station, and an additional Sony DualSense controller. Some stores may also include a $50 GameStop gift card. Additionally, Swider claims a similar in-store event for the Xbox Series X is expected next week on Thursday, December 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36Dqxf"&gt;Despite launching over one year ago, Sony’s PlayStation 5 is still very difficult to buy. If you have been struggling to luck out on recent online console restocks from GameStop, Best Buy, Walmart, or other vendors, this may be one of the few remaining chances to score a PS5 in time for the Christmas holiday. GameStop sells its new consoles in bundle form only, so while you should not be paying more than MSRP, you can expect to potentially pay upwards of $700 or $800 depending on what accessories are being bundled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVbhtx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 5:02PM ET, December 16th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about expected quantities, bundle contents, and an upcoming Xbox Series X restock, as detailed in &lt;/em&gt;The Shortcut&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="EWV9vd"&gt;Facebook’s parent company Meta has alerted 50,000 users of Facebook and Instagram that their accounts were spied on by commercial “surveillance-for-hire” schemes around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEjhSd"&gt;The users were targeted by seven entities and located in more than 100 countries, according to an &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/taking-action-against-surveillance-for-hire/"&gt;update posted on Meta’s news page&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1ug8q"&gt;Targets included journalists, dissidents, critics of authoritarian regimes, families of opposition, and human rights activists, the post said. The surveillance was uncovered in a monthslong investigation in which Meta identified spying groups and removed them from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="psQWhT"&gt;“These companies are part of a sprawling industry that provides intrusive software tools and surveillance services indiscriminately to any customer — regardless of who they target or the human rights abuses they might enable,” wrote Meta’s director of threat disruption, David Agranovich, and head of cyber espionage investigations, Mike Dvilyanski. “This industry ‘democratizes’ these threats, making them available to government and non-government groups that otherwise wouldn’t have these capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6mdpR"&gt;A more detailed &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Threat-Report-on-the-Surveillance-for-Hire-Industry.pdf"&gt;threat report&lt;/a&gt; released by Meta named six out of the seven companies, and listed one of the entities as unknown. Four of the seven — Cobwebs Technologies, Cognyte, Black Cube, and Bluehawk CI — are based in Israel, with the other three in China, India, and North Macedonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xu0NZD"&gt;In a statement provided to NPR, Black Cube &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/16/1064628654/facebook-bans-surveillance-firms-that-spied-on-50000-people"&gt;described itself as a “litigation support firm”&lt;/a&gt; that used investigation methods compliant with local laws in every jurisdiction in which it operated. Black Cube was previously employed by Harvey Weinstein to try to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/harvey-weinstein-black-cube-new-york-times"&gt;block publication of a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; that sparked the #MeToo movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKDhXi"&gt;“The disclosure by Facebook of actions it has taken to disrupt and remove seven private firms selling surveillance services to regimes that abuse human rights, makes it abundantly clear that more must be done to stop this mercenary marketplace,” said Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA) in a statement. “By enabling indiscriminate surveillance against journalists and political dissidents, among others, these companies pose a clear threat to human rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pdhsap"&gt;Meta’s report also referenced the Israeli spyware company NSO Group, which last month was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798917/apple-nso-group-spyware-pegasus-cybersecurity-research"&gt;sued by both Apple and Meta&lt;/a&gt; for selling spyware used to compromise iPhone and WhatsApp messages. Yesterday, Google researchers &lt;a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-into-nso-zero-click.html"&gt;published details of a “zero click” exploit&lt;/a&gt; developed by NSO Group to hack targets’ phones just by sending a message — a level of offensive capability described by the researchers as comparable to that possessed by nation state actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgeJvD"&gt;The company has already been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761565/nso-group-pegasus-spyware-entity-list-us-government-human-rights"&gt;blacklisted by the US government&lt;/a&gt; for selling software used to spy on journalists around the world. A group of lawmakers including Adam Schiff recently &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-us-lawmakers-call-sanctions-against-israels-nso-other-spyware-firms-2021-12-15/"&gt;called for the imposition of stricter sanctions&lt;/a&gt; on a group of surveillance companies, including NSO Group, that would freeze company bank accounts and bar employees from traveling to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM announces Cruise CEO Dan Ammann is stepping down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GM’s Cruise Reveals First Vehicle Made To Run Without Driver" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O_3fYM2AXHLvpbL6EwxrWpHNgYI=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283484/1195279039.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T4teru"&gt;Dan Ammann, the CEO of Cruise, the autonomous vehicle company that is a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors, is stepping down, &lt;a href="https://investor.gm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/leadership-changes-cruise"&gt;the automaker announced late Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Kyle Vogt, the co-founder of Cruise and its chief technology officer, will take over as interim CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TH4phn"&gt;Ammann is the latest CEO of an AV company to step aside as the industry struggles to meet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22423489/autonomous-vehicle-consolidation-acquisition-lyft-uber"&gt;its own over-inflated expectations&lt;/a&gt; about the future of driverless cars. Earlier this year, John Krafcik &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364317/waymo-ceo-john-krafcik-stepping-down-self-driving-cars-google-alphabet"&gt;announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Waymo&lt;/a&gt; after helping lead the company since 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x7RK2e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM didn’t provide a reason for Ammann’s departure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OGdknG"&gt;GM didn’t provide a reason for Ammann’s departure except to say he was leaving to “pursue other opportunities.” A spokesperson for Cruise declined to provide any additional comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ckW2Np"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/11/11195808/gm-cruise-automation-self-driving-acquisition"&gt;GM acquired Cruise in 2016&lt;/a&gt; to speed up its self-driving car development program. Ammann, who was then the president of GM, oversaw the acquisition and later assumed the role of CEO of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVvUbo"&gt;In 2020, he presided over the rollout of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075977/cruise-driverless-car-gm-no-steering-wheel-pedals-ev-exclusive-first-look"&gt;the Origin&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s first purpose-built autonomous vehicle. Under his leadership, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331794/cruise-acquires-voyage-self-driving-car-merger"&gt;acquired rival AV startup Voyage&lt;/a&gt; and raised enough investment to bring its valuation up to $19 billion. And earlier this year, he outlined a plan to scale up Cruise’s fleet to 1 million vehicles by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ma0ODq"&gt;But Ammann also oversaw some setbacks, most noticeably the decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707242/cruise-gm-self-driving-taxi-launch-delay-2019"&gt;delay a planned launch of a robotaxi service&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco in 2019. The company has yet to commit to a new date but has implied it will be in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o87ylB"&gt;“GM is deeply committed to its vision of zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion, and AV technology will play a critical role in realizing it,” GM said in a statement. “Under GM’s ownership to date, Cruise has seized the leadership position in commercial autonomous ridesharing and has created significant value for both GM shareholders and Cruise’s minority shareholders.”&lt;/p&gt;
