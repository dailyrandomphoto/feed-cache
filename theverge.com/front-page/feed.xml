    <title>Samsung’s 2021 TVs have dramatically better picture, thanks to Mini LED</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nz0WhE4_Ys_hbiaNEFWd36OhSg0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68627892/DSCF2812.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jxCwZ4"&gt;Samsung is today announcing its upper tier of 2021 8K and 4K HDR TVs. And like TCL and LG before it, the company is moving to a more precise backlighting system that uses Mini LED technology for improved contrast and greater picture quality than its previous full-array local dimming systems — and Samsung’s premium QLED LCD TVs were already impressive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hiEt62"&gt;The latest Mini LED advancements are being branded as “Neo QLED” and will be found in several different tiers in the 2021 lineup. There are two 8K models: the QN900A (a successor to last year’s top-tier 8K QLED with barely there bezels) and the QN800A. From there, three series of 4K TVs will get Mini LED: the QN95A, QN90A, and QN85A.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fyCkoLdTHtw2657anl_c1PKBq3w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217061/DSCF2781.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mini LED lets Samsung pack more LEDs into its premium TVs for brightness that’s “more finely controlled.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QOLZUb"&gt;(Note: All photos in this story were captured at a private briefing in New York City arranged by Samsung. Strict social distancing and sanitization precautions were in place, and masks were worn by everyone on site.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DTif6"&gt;Samsung says the LEDs in these TVs are up to 40 times smaller than those in sets with traditional full-array backlighting, where you get a few dozen “zones” that light up and dim in accordance with what’s happening on-screen. Packing more LEDs into a smaller space results in more precise backlighting that should greatly reduce blooming, which is the halo effect you can sometimes see around bright objects on a dark background on LCD TVs when the light bleeds into a different dimming zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGIQxN"&gt;While LG tossed out some numbers for its upcoming LCD TVs with Mini LED — “up to almost 30,000 tiny LEDs” and “up to 2,500 dimming zones” — Samsung isn’t being as forward about the exact number of LEDs and dimming zones it has achieved. Similar to past years, these TVs retain quantum dot expanded color range; that’s what the Q in QLED stands for, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tq-7QVKOY7dmwRW9Xa_IUK_-nVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217046/DSCF2777.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s latest TVs have a new “Game Bar” for accessing the most important settings for next-gen consoles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AZUniW"&gt;Samsung’s 2021 QLED TVs are also aiming to make life simpler for gamers who recently purchased an Xbox Series X / S or PlayStation 5. There’s a new “game bar” with quick access to settings like refresh rate, aspect ratio, and so on. All of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/24/22193437/vergecast-podcast-interview-hdmi"&gt;HDMI 2.1&lt;/a&gt; functionality you’d hope for — 4K at 120Hz, variable refresh rate, auto low latency mode, and eARC — are supported, though you’ll give up some features at the bottom of the lineup. And Samsung is bringing the ultrawide 21:9 and 32:9 ratios of its gaming monitors to the TV screen so you can get a more comprehensive view of all that’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Adtwln2y0b6zeExk3-cXdGaVtz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22216068/cwelch210104_4356_0008.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="seGWe1"&gt;Samsung is also putting a bigger emphasis on its Samsung Health software on the big screen. These latest TVs can be paired with a video camera for a new “Smart Trainer” feature that tracks you through an interactive fitness class. Here’s what Samsung says on that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OwfhIM"&gt;The Smart Trainer displays an AI trainer on the left screen, and an image of yourself on the right screen, allowing you to check your posture, count your reps, and receive real-time feedback on how you’re doing—just as if you were at an in-person workout class. The AI trainer even remembers how you like to exercise, from workout type to intensity. Finally, you’ll get feedback on your calories burned and other metrics, so you can keep track of your fitness journey. And with a new auto-sync feature that links select Samsung Smart TVs, Galaxy phones, and Galaxy watches, you can pick a workout on your phone and cast it to your TV, while your watch automatically tracks your progress — without touching a button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gVbl7U"&gt;It’s plain to see the tit for tat that Samsung is trying to play against Apple Fitness Plus, Peloton, and other services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/adPn7j1Y7lpnk9xrbVScNpnnhXc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22216071/cwelch210104_4356_0011.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ydq0ns4g3vkO8ToC3epX-kF4h3E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22216066/cwelch210104_4356_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LAva74"&gt;Pricing for all of the new TVs will be announced closer to when they start shipping in a few months, but it should be pretty comparable to the 2019 series TVs on Samsung’s store right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="46DZgK"&gt;An even more frame-like The Frame&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HpbVJwYH85AfpyVZnqqqG1ThUuk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22216067/cwelch210104_4356_0007.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IPj9Uh"&gt;The only one of Samsung’s “lifestyle” TVs being updated for CES is The Frame. Samsung has reduced the thickness; it’s now 24.9mm thick, which the company says “mirrors the depth of a traditional picture frame.” The 43-inch model can now be rotated into a portrait orientation, and Samsung says customers who subscribe to its Art Store — The Frame can be configured to display artwork when idle — will now get better AI-powered recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gS2m7j"&gt;Samsung also says “there are more bezel choices than ever, from slim, neutral, and minimalist to big, ornate, and bold.” The Frame’s bezels can be swapped in a way that, in some cases, according to the company, “you can literally frame The Frame.” As for the TV itself, you get the same QLED 4K HDR picture as before.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9tfzDh4Nji9LQgHHAvMLmai8rNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22216063/cwelch210104_4356_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PfpFzC"&gt;More sizes of MicroLED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="w2hhu1"&gt;Last month, Samsung announced that it will be making &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166062/samsung-110-inch-microled-4k-tv-announced-features"&gt;a massive 110-inch TV that uses the next-gen MicroLED technology&lt;/a&gt; that has previously been available in the company’s modular (and only-for-the-filthy-rich) display known as The Wall. Now, the company says that 99-inch and 88-inch models will join the 110-incher, bringing MicroLED to a “traditional TV form factor” for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6t5hq"&gt;Instead of requiring professional installation, you’ll just take these out of the box and mount them like any other TV. Aside from the OLED-like benefits of MicroLED — self-emissive LEDs for each pixel and no backlight required — Samsung says its Multi View feature lets you watch four sources of content simultaneously on any of these sets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Yfupw"&gt;Thing is, all of these TVs will still be silly expensive for a long time to come. So the Neo QLED TVs are what the vast majority of consumers will be eyeing in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung made a solar-charging Eco Remote for its latest TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dqLB09nyrp13SaFvkxeW2wHIOM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68627884/cwelch210104_4356_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E1pVSd"&gt;With its 2021 lineup of 4K and 8K QLED TVs, Samsung is introducing a new Eco Remote Control that the company claims will “reduce tons of plastic waste per year” and further its efforts to reduce its environmental impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMXJaO"&gt;From the front, the Eco Remote Control looks like any of Samsung’s TV clickers from recent years. But flip it around and you’ll see a long panel of solar cells that can charge the internal battery. The remote is made from 31 grams of plastic, and Samsung says 28 percent of that comes “from recycled polyethylene terephthalate.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5aecqkYhDT05KQjQatZ_Xtkdsd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22216070/cwelch210104_4356_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eazw99"&gt;Samsung estimates you’ll be able to use the Eco Remote Control for two years before its battery gives out. That’s a fairly limited life span for something that accompanies a product you’re likely to use for anywhere between five and 10 years. But the reduction in plastic waste is notable, and I guess this beats not including a remote control at all in the way phone makers are ditching chargers and headphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWmlMh"&gt;There’s a USB-C port on the bottom if you need to charge the remote faster for whatever reason. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a22mqOEL3_LD9y0AkMTE7KEa7cU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217403/Embargo_Jan_6_11am_ET_Neo_QLED_Eco_Remote.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lQwr4l"&gt;Samsung is also continuing its eco packaging efforts in 2021. “By eliminating oil-based ink and expanding eco-friendly packaging to all Lifestyle and QLED TV models, Samsung offers a sustainable solution that can upcycle up to 200,000 tons of boxes a year and turn them into pieces of home decor.” After your TV is unpacked, you can scan a QR code on its box for instructions on how to craft it into something you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; want to keep around. Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.dezeen.com/outofthebox/"&gt;partnered with &lt;em&gt;Dezeen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a competition that encouraged people to come up with clever ways of repurposing the cardboard boxes. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s capable Halo fitness tracker is 25 percent off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AXNs0i7n1pAFf1oTzOR0DwPkGbY=/0x0:3750x2500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68627583/Halo_App_and_Halo_Band.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Olo46s"&gt;If you’re feeling swept up in New Year’s resolutions for getting fit and want a device that’s going to hold you accountable to meet your goals, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PMT4T11?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s Halo tracker is $25 off its usual $100 price&lt;/a&gt;. All sizes and colors are the same price. The Halo was actually about $10 cheaper when it first launched, but this is the next-best deal. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;In case you don’t know much about this product&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a tracker that can monitor more granular metrics than most fitness devices, like the tone of your voice and a general approximation of how much overall body fat you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ka0uwT"&gt;To get all of the features Halo offers, you’ll need a subscription. You’ll get six months for free with purchase. After that, it’s $3.99 per month if you want to continue. If not, then the Halo will just track sleep, heart rate, and step tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MTim3f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10269519"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Aukey 10W wireless charger" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f7AlSCulBXx2x9Y-SUCGSAaG_90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217270/aukeywirelesscharger.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8RuHeR"&gt;Aukey is offering a limited time deal on one of its wireless charging stands that has multiple coils, simultaneously supporting a phone (oriented vertically or horizontally) and, say, a set of wireless earbuds like AirPods or Galaxy Buds Live resting around the back of it. By clipping the on-page coupon that knocks 5 percent off the cost and applying the 35 percent of extra savings (click the “1 Applicable Promotion” drop-down to redeem), &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NCDVG59?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this charger drops down in price to just over $16 before tax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGeC47"&gt;A few things worth noting are that this wireless charger doesn’t include a power brick, so you’ll have to supply your own. Also, it tops out at 10W of charging speed for most Android phones, while iPhones (aside from the iPhone 12 mini since its coil doesn’t align properly, says Aukey) that support Qi charging will charge at 7.5W, and Pixel phones and AirPods max out at 5W. Basically, get this to keep your devices topped up throughout the day, not to quickly recharge things before leaving the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSXyeC"&gt;This deal lasts until January 12th at 2:59AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="sn4vn2"&gt;The OnePlus Nord N10 5G is an affordable 5G-ready phone with a 90Hz refresh rate display that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Allison Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, could be worth the money for you. It’s available starting on Friday in the US, and on launch day, you’ll be able to get the OnePlus Buds Z wireless earbuds for free with purchase. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Foneplus-n10-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F6%2F22216753%2Famazon-halo-fitness-tracker-aukey-wireless-qi-charger-oneplus-nord-n10-5g-deal-sale#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;That’s a lot of tech for $300&lt;/a&gt; before tax. You can sign up to be notified by OnePlus directly once the phone is available for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Georgia’s runoff may have saved net neutrality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vFQv0Mx2gLmySD4_vlr1l2GZm00=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68627573/acastro_170711_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Throttling could be much harder under a Democratic Senate&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PwMfbP"&gt;Tuesday night was a good night for Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="pQLwxK"&gt;Votes are still being tallied and no one has conceded, but it seems &lt;a href="https://results.decisiondeskhq.com/"&gt;all but certain&lt;/a&gt; that Democratic candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff have won election to the US Senate, putting the chamber under 50-50 Democratic control. It’s a huge shift in what’s possible for Democrats and policymakers are already discussing policies that seemed impossible on Monday, like $2,000 direct stimulus payments or a new voting rights act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjiSkw"&gt;But while the wins will have impacts across the Democratic platform, they may have particularly strong effects on net neutrality. Before Georgia, net neutrality advocates were &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/12/03/what-to-expect-from-a-biden-fcc-on-section-230-net-neutrality-and-5g/"&gt;facing a gridlock in Congress&lt;/a&gt; and the frightening possibility that the incoming president wouldn’t be able to appoint his own FCC commissioners. But as the Senate falls back under Democratic control, the possibilities for net neutrality have expanded dramatically. Now, Democrats can push for more progressive FCC nominees that will reinstate the net neutrality rules from 2015, or even push for legislation that would write net neutrality into law. Flipping these two Senate seats could make the difference between keeping net neutrality in a permanent legal limbo and making it the law of the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HF173b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The FCC shouldn’t wait for Congress”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oAVkr6"&gt;Already, net neutrality advocates are barely containing their excitement. Reached for comment, Fight for the Future’s Evan Greer laid out a laundry list of progressive goals that can now be pursued, from overturning FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s order to implementing more aggressive privacy and connectivity policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjTTwk"&gt;“If Democrats take the Senate they should move quickly to confirm an FCC chair who will make it their first order of business to restore the Title II open Internet protections,” Greer said in a statement. “But they should also do more than that. The FCC can and should take steps to protect people’s privacy, and to ensure that everyone can afford Internet access during a time when many are working from home and sending their kids to school online.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWHwQY"&gt;In a similar vein, Public Knowledge CEO Chris Lewis focused on getting a fair hearing for bills like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304522/net-neutrality-save-the-internet-act-house-of-representatives-approval"&gt;the Save the Internet Act&lt;/a&gt;, which have largely been blocked by the Republican Senate. “The Senate has made noise about enshrining rules into law for the past two years without any action — not even a public hearing,” said Lewis. “The FCC shouldn’t wait for Congress to grow the political will to act to restore strong net neutrality rules. There is broad support for this in the country across partisan divides.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imx5II"&gt;The net neutrality fight has mostly been in a stalemate since 2017, when Pai &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/11/17439456/net-neutrality-dead-ajit-pai-fcc-internet"&gt;passed the Restoring Internet Freedom Order&lt;/a&gt;, repealing the 2015 Open Internet Order on a straight party-line vote. There were significant legal challenges to Pai’s order — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20898779/fcc-net-neutrality-court-of-appeals-decision-ruling"&gt;most notably from Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; — but the basic facts of the order remained in place. Under Pai’s rule, the FCC doesn’t have much authority to regulate practices like throttling, zero-rating, and data caps. As long as that order is in place, fighting carrier misbehavior will fall to the FTC and the states, both of which are stretched too thin to put up much of a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="owWeDv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;new legislation could write Title II rules permanently into law&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="46mhqQ"&gt;In a normal congress, a Democratic president would spell trouble for Pai’s order. When he takes office, Biden will have control over FCC appointments, which typically means Democrats would control the commission’s majority (determining the chairperson and three of the five seats on the commission). Restoring the Open Internet Order would be as simple as appointing progressive commissioners and holding a vote. But Republicans were &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-fcc-pick-fight-senate-c53a6099-7684-4994-9b5b-a83a8d22b180.html"&gt;preparing to block FCC appointments&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for concessions, effectively giving them veto power over the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJrNjU"&gt;The result was a tough choice for the Biden administration: either nominate moderate Democrats who wouldn’t repeal the Pai order or resign themselves to a gridlocked FCC without the vote to do anything at all. It was a grim choice for net neutrality advocates; either option would leave the Pai order in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVdwTl"&gt;But this morning, the state of play looks very different. With Warnock and Ossoff in the Senate, the chamber will be split 50-50, with VP-elect Kamala Harris passing the deciding vote. That will give Democrats control of crucial oversight committees and make it far easier to shepherd Democratic nominees through confirmation hearings. In short, Biden can nominate who he wants, and Senate Democrats can make sure they’re legally appointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="OBWpBi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;How much will Biden care about net neutrality?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RWcQW2"&gt;Progressive ambitions don’t stop at the FCC. A new FCC order would put net neutrality rules in place, but it could still be overturned by the next Republican president, and flipping back and forth with each administration isn’t anyone’s ideal telecom policy. The real win would be new legislation that would write Title II rules permanently into law, something that couldn’t be overturned by the next Republican FCC. House Democrats have passed bills to do just that, although they crashed as soon they hit the Republican Senate. It’s hard to say whether moderate Democrats like Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) or Joe Manchin (D-WV) would go along with such a move, and a compromise bill might end up with something much milder than full Title II protection. But for the first time, that kind of lasting legislative victory is possible, and it will be a major focus for advocates over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2iSaUI"&gt;There are still some important caveats to this victory. Democratic control of the Senate isn’t a done deal: neither Republican candidate has conceded, and it’s not settled what kind of power-sharing arrangement will emerge from the 50-50 Senate. There is still room for all kinds of obstruction, and Senate Democrats shouldn’t count chickens before they’re hatched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2ZEKdw"&gt;Most importantly, we don’t know how much the Biden administration will care about net neutrality. It was a non-issue in the campaign, crowded out by the chaos of Trump, and the president-elect hasn’t made any clear statements about where he stands on it. As soon as the election was over, right-wing analysts were &lt;a href="https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/3-reasons-why-biden-will-kill-off-net-neutrality/"&gt;predicting that Biden would abandon the fight entirely&lt;/a&gt;, finding it not worth the political costs. Progressives will keep fighting, some from inside the White House, but it is too early to know if they’ll win. Georgia has given Biden the chance to save net neutrality; now the question is whether he will take it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will spend $2 billion to try to fix affordable housing crises in three major employment hubs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w7eTCRGUpMRbuT592TZZFE-vI8U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68627424/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YtFsXU"&gt;Amazon has pledged to &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-launches-2-billion-housing-equity-fund-make-over-20000"&gt;spend more than $2 billion&lt;/a&gt; over the next five years to build tens of thousands of affordable housing units in three of the e-commerce giant’s major employment hubs, underscoring the ongoing housing crises affecting parts of the US where large, high-paying tech employers reside. Amazon’s pledge, announced on Wednesday, follows similar commitments from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948085/apple-ca-housing-crisis-pledge-2-5-billion-silicon-valley"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20927060/facebook-billion-dollar-pledge-affordable-housing-crisis-california-bay-area"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18683827/google-silicon-valley-housing-crisis-1-billion-investment-sf-bay-area"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, all of which previously promised between $1 billion and $2.5 billion each to tackle similar issues plaguing the San Francisco Bay Area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtVDt3"&gt;The parts of the US Amazon plans to invest in include Washington state’s Puget Sound region that encompasses Seattle, as well as Arlington, Virginia and Nashville, Tennessee where Amazon has opened fast-growing offices. The company employs more than 75,000 people in the Puget Sound region alone thanks to its headquarters in the state, and it has around 1,000 employees each in Virginia and Tennessee with plans to expand those workforces to more than 5,000 employees in each sector. (These numbers do not include Amazon’s much larger warehouse, seasonal, and contract workforce that push its employment figures over 1 million people &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/29/amazon-hiring-pandemic-holidays/"&gt;as of October of last year&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsB87I"&gt;Amazon’s announcement may once have included planned investment for New York City, after lawmakers cut a deal with the company in early 2019 to bring jobs to Long Island City, Queens as part of a highly publicized competition of sorts the company held to attract bids from municipalities around the country. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/15/18225560/amazon-hq2-new-york-city-queens-long-island-city"&gt;fierce backlash from local residents and criticism from politicians&lt;/a&gt;, including US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224993/amazon-hq-2-queens-new-york-backlash-pulls-drops"&gt;led Amazon to scrap its controversial NYC plans&lt;/a&gt; and instead focus on expansions of its Arlington and Nashville offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RvqppM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon’s pledge follows similar ones from Apple, Facebook, and Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="poJli2"&gt;“Amazon has a long-standing commitment to helping people in need, including the Mary’s Place family shelter we built inside our Puget Sound headquarters. The shelter now supports over 200 women and children experiencing homelessness every night,” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement. “This new $2 billion Housing Equity Fund will create or preserve 20,000 affordable homes in all three of our headquarters regions—Arlington, Puget Sound, and Nashville. It will also help local families achieve long-term stability while building strong, inclusive communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9VHmT"&gt;Amazon is spending its money mostly in the form of low-cost loans, starting with nearly $382 million to the Washington Housing Conservancy to “preserve and create up to 1,300 affordable homes on the Crystal House property in Arlington” and $185.5 million to King County Housing Authority for an additional 1,000 affordable homes in the state of Washington. Amazon plans to announce additional investments in both regions, as well as Nashville, in the coming months and years. The pledge also includes $125 million in cash grants to small businesses, nonprofits, and minority-led organizations, with the goal of helping them “build a more inclusive solution to the affordable housing crisis.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYLOxV"&gt;The unspoken reality of these large housing pledges is that tech companies often play a major role in gentrification and displacement of local communities. That’s often through a complex interplay of factors related to disproportionately high wages and unmatched benefits that allow employees to live in and around city centers despite sometimes working in more rural or suburban settings, where housing is cheaper and in less demand. And as part of its long-term strategy to help attract and retain talent, a company like Amazon has an incentive to make the urban centers and regions it turns into major employment hubs more affordable places to live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uA4wQU"&gt;One major goal is to avoid driving away employees who can’t afford to live somewhere like Seattle or, in the case of companies like Facebook and Google, in San Francisco or Silicon Valley. Another goal is to help alleviate the pressure from politicians and activists who often criticize tech companies and their workforces for doing little to give back to the communities within which they build their companies. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>More than half of Americans turned to video games during lockdown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Animal Crossing: New Horizons" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QYMgG3dKAhc7NfJnfgBot5dr21w=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68627064/Switch_ACNH_0220_Direct_OnlinePlay_SCRN_02_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X9nH4Y"&gt;With 2020 consumed almost entirely by the COVID-19 pandemic, more than half of US residents turned to video games to fill the time. According to Nielsen company SuperData’s 2020 year in review, 55 percent of people picked up video games — out of boredom, to escape the real world, to socialize — during the first phase of lockdowns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Lj9m8"&gt;The shift points to a larger one in entertainment. Movie theaters, sports, plays, and more have been largely inaccessible, if not outright dangerous to public health. Just as streaming, both of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257227/coronavirus-streamelements-arsenalgg-twitch-youtube-livestream-numbers"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21195358/streaming-netflix-disney-hbo-now-youtube-twitch-amazon-prime-video-coronavirus-broadband-network"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; variety, became a huge source of entertainment, so did games — especially for adults. According to SuperData, 66 percent of consumers from 18 to 24 played more console games, while 60 percent played more mobile titles. Unsurprisingly, buyers also tended toward digital purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4Bgqg"&gt;SuperData reports that 27 percent of people — about 1 in 4 — played games to stay in touch with each other. In 2020, games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21179238/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch-features"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; became cultural touchstones. &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185608/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-coronavirus-escape-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; hit&lt;/a&gt; of the early pandemic, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21453499/among-us-2-sequel-popular-canceled-developers-innersloth"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;had nearly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196330/among-us-half-billion-players-november"&gt;half a billion&lt;/a&gt; players in November alone. Politicians like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519505/joe-biden-animal-crossing-new-horizons-biden-hq-campaign-election"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21526164/aoc-among-us-twitch-debut-top-concurrent-viewers"&gt;Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&lt;/a&gt; capitalized on their popularity to raise awareness for the year’s presidential election. Even &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; managed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/19/22189424/pokemon-go-covid-2020-safety"&gt;adapt to the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and grow 39 percent year over year, thanks to Niantic’s updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVJmNY"&gt;As physical spaces disappeared, video games became one of the few places for people to spend time together — whether that was to enjoy virtual concerts in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, learn &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534483/minecraft-voting-rock-the-vote-election-2020"&gt;how to vote&lt;/a&gt;, or just hang out. SuperData estimates that digital games alone garnered $126.6 billion over the course of the year. The numbers may not spike this year as much as they did in 2020, but SuperData predicts “the long-term habits formed during lockdown are here to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBNThR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook ordered to pay $4.7M to Italian developer over copycat feature </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0CGYtUPzwPuuZxajZxc_nrr6YX4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68626815/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M8UyN3"&gt;Facebook has been ordered to pay €3.83 million (around $4.72 million) in damages to an Italian developer over the social network’s “Nearby” feature. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-facebook-court-idUSKBN29A1YW?taid=5ff4e4fa5b2aa00001d6a018&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Milan-based appeals court upheld a 2019 ruling saying Facebook had copied the feature from developer Business Competence’s Faround app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNbqXG"&gt;The case dates back to 2012. That year, Business Competence launched Faround which was designed to help users find Facebook friends near their location. The app quickly gained ground in the Italian market, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-lawsuit-italy-idUSKBN16D2AI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;. However, just months later, Facebook launched its own Nearby feature, which also competed with the likes of Foursquare and Yelp, and downloads of Faround reportedly plummeted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YVcMCM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The original complaint was filed in 2013&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KIYflg"&gt;The Italian software developer responded by filing a lawsuit in 2013, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-lawsuit-italy-idUSKBN16D2AI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the court issued a preliminary ruling in its favor in 2016, which was made public in 2017. Facebook agreed to discontinue the feature in Italy while it appealed the ruling, but subsequent courts have sided with Business Competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D641rN"&gt;Responding to the decision, a Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that the company had “received the court’s decision” and is “examining it carefully.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Edge history and tab sync features finally start rolling out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5KcrqrceDqYr2gGDLWy_22y1Ogw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68626711/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pW4tVu"&gt;Microsoft is finally starting to roll out history and tab sync for its Edge browser. After nearly a year since its initial release, some Microsoft Edge users now see the full web history and tab sync features available in their browsers. The roll out is gradual, but you can check to see if it’s available in your country by navigating to settings &amp;gt; profiles &amp;gt; sync and enabling “history” and “open tabs” in the options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E98nQw"&gt;Not every country has access to the additional sync features just yet, but we understand the UK is one of the first markets that will see history and tab sync initially. These new features will let Edge users sync all web pages they’ve visited to additional Windows 10 or macOS devices, or even to the mobile versions of Edge for iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/va_8QLd2392l97B3QEX_3Qr010U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217119/y6GLYpJ.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OGOYA5"&gt;You will need to head into the settings section on all devices you use Edge with to manually enable the history and open tabs features, though. This includes the mobile versions, where you’ll have to toggle open tabs and history, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dp2uov"&gt;Microsoft initially launched Edge on January 15th, 2020 without many important sync options enabled. Extensions sync arrived in May, and Microsoft originally promised history and tab sync would start rolling out in the summer. The web history and tab sync eventually started rolling out to &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/improvements-to-history-in-microsoft-edge/m-p/1896552"&gt;beta and dev channels&lt;/a&gt; of the browser in late November, and are now appearing in the stable channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXtvWQ"&gt;Microsoft continues to improve Edge on a regular basis, recently adding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507374/microsoft-edge-price-comparisons-screenshot-tool-features"&gt;really useful screenshot tool&lt;/a&gt; and a price comparisons feature. Edge will also soon be updated with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199819/microsoft-edge-vertical-tabs-feature-chromium"&gt;vertical tabs&lt;/a&gt; and new &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/use-password-monitor-to-help-protect-your-passwords-online/m-p/1487025"&gt;password breach&lt;/a&gt; notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4I6JgE"&gt;Amazon is developing a new Alexa-powered device that can track and monitor for signs of sleep apnea using radar, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-plans-a-new-sleep-apnea-device-powered-by-alexa-2021-1?international=true&amp;amp;amp;r=US&amp;amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The palm-sized device is reportedly designed to sit on a bedside table and use millimeter-wave radar to sense your breathing, keeping an eye out for interruptions associated with the apnea sleeping disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ki5cPx"&gt;The idea of using radar to monitor sleep &lt;a href="https://www.idigitalhealth.com/news/radar-monitors-sleep-accuracy-comparable-current-standards/"&gt;isn’t new&lt;/a&gt;, and at least one other high profile company has attempted to commercialize the technology. Way back in 2014 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/29/7130229/nintendo-qol-sleep-tracking-device"&gt;Nintendo announced&lt;/a&gt; a “non-wearable” device that could track sleep via radio waves. However, less than two years later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/4/10920582/nintendo-sleep-tracker-qol-possibly-canceled"&gt;Nintendo said&lt;/a&gt; it wasn’t confident the device could become a viable product, and it was never released. Last month we also saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22189219/oneplus-8t-concept-color-changing-back-motion-sensing-radar"&gt;OnePlus announce a new concept phone&lt;/a&gt; that used mmWave radar to monitor breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8OVjLj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Developed under the code name “Brahms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hyjLUx"&gt;Amazon’s project is apparently being developed under the code name “Brahms” after the German composer of &lt;em&gt;Lullaby&lt;/em&gt;, and is the work of an internal Amazon team built up over the past year. In its current form, the device reportedly resembles a “standing hexagonal pad connected to a metal wire base,” &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; notes. Along with sleep apnea, Amazon reportedly plans to use its machine-learning and cloud technology to understand other sleeping disorders beyond sleep apnea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7Hmrs"&gt;Amazon declined to comment on the existence of the project to &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;, and a spokesperson was not immediately available to respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKlyBZ"&gt;If accurate, Brahms represents Amazon’s latest push into health tech. Last year the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174145/amazon-halo-fitness-tracker-voice-buy"&gt;released its Halo fitness tracker&lt;/a&gt;, a $99.99 wearable device that scans the wearer’s body and voice and is designed to help you improve your health. Amazon stresses that Halo is “not a medical device.” The company has also launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571091/amazon-pharmacy-store-launch-home-delivery-prescription-medication"&gt;Pharmacy service&lt;/a&gt; for delivering prescription medication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yiRZ3"&gt;At this point it’s almost easier to list objects that Amazon hasn’t tried to build its voice assistant into. Over the past few years Alexa has appeared in everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;speakers&lt;/a&gt; (obviously) to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20884044/amazon-echo-loop-smart-ring-hands-on-photos-alexa"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882140/amazon-basics-microwave-alexa-2018-smart-features-price-release-date"&gt;microwaves&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, we might be able to add a sleep-tracker to that list.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s newest cordless vac automatically empties itself</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Otaqg60OcKhDy_N7C9G5E_ZG0bM=/0x257:1805x1460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68626532/2021_LG_CordZero_and_Charging_Station_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The charging stand can also store its accessories.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hvHXMq"&gt;LG’s new vacuum cleaner, the ridiculously named &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/01/newest-lg-cordzerothinq-vac-with-new-charging-station-delivers-hassle-free-cleaning-experience/"&gt;LG CordZeroThinQ A9 Kompressor Plus&lt;/a&gt;, should be a little easier to empty than most cordless vacuums. Its charging station is equipped with a “fully-automated dust removal system,” which sucks the contents of the vac’s dustbin into a dust bag as the device charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6tBYB"&gt;We’ve seen similar auto-emptying features in robot vacuum cleaners like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/6/17817220/irobot-roomba-i7-robot-vacuum-empties-itself-maps-house"&gt;iRobot Roomba i7 Plus&lt;/a&gt; before, but LG’s solution is more unique in the world of cordless stick vacuums. Samsung sells a &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/au/home-appliance-accessories/clean-station-white-vca-sae90b-sa/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Clean Station&lt;/a&gt; to work with its upright vacuum cleaner, but using it involves first detaching the vacuum’s dustbin, rather than it happening automatically during charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YNq3Fn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Honey, did you charge the LG CordZeroThinQ A9 Kompressor Plus?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kxQgIe"&gt;As someone who frequently has to reach up into the dustbin of his Dyson V10 vacuum to get all the crud out, I can see the appeal of automating the process. But for bigger jobs, like vacuuming a whole house or apartment, you’re probably going to have to empty the LG CordZeroThinQ A9 Kompressor Plus mid-clean rather than waiting to automatically empty it when it charges. Hopefully the charging station’s dust bags are big enough (and cheap enough) that it doesn’t need to be emptied too often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMJvzH"&gt;As well as emptying its dustbin, LG says the touchscreen-equipped charging stand can also house the vacuum’s six accessories and nozzles, like existing stick vacuum chargers from Dyson and Xiaomi. LG’s attachments include a 2-in-1 combination tool, a crevice tool, a pet nozzle, a power carpet nozzle, and a power mop. Included with the vacuum are two battery packs and removable washable filters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M83G0M"&gt;LG’s press release doesn’t say how much all of this is going to cost or when it’ll be available. However, it promises the LG CordZeroThinQ A9 Kompressor Plus will be on display at its virtual booth at this year’s virtual CES, so stay virtually tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
