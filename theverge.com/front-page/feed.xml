    <title>Inside the slow, strange collapse of electric delivery startup Chanje</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9maj_WB78I4NzjSd-2ig-W9bZKU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70275989/acastro_211001_4790_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How an EV startup and its charismatic CEO nearly cornered the market for electric delivery vans — until it all fell apart&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="e1WjBe"&gt;Gaia. Mother Earth. God herself. Ask the former employees of electric vehicle startup Chanje and they recall slightly different versions of what &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; CEO and founder Bryan Hansel said he saw during an ayahuasca trip in the Amazon rainforest in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwIoCi"&gt;What they know for sure is Hansel repeatedly referred to this experience as a touchstone. It was his reason for founding the startup, which was premised on importing electric delivery vans from China and selling them to companies like FedEx, Ryder, even Amazon. He also recommended employees take ayahuasca to change their perspective at difficult moments, like when some bucked against the meditation quotas — part of a sweeping, mandatory “personal and professional development” program he installed  — or when the paychecks stopped coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueBnfQ"&gt;Chanje quietly folded earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned. The Chinese company Hansel partnered with went bankrupt after its chairman sunk hundreds of millions of dollars into an unsuccessful toll road in Mongolia. Hansel spent months trying to rally investors to buy pieces of that parent company to keep Chanje alive. His effort failed, though, and so he fired the remaining Chanje employees the Friday before Memorial Day weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="75aeyz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A small startup, a big opportunity, and a lot of collateral damage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OD60td"&gt;Six of those former employees, who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on the condition of anonymity throughout the year, describe Hansel as “charismatic” and a natural pitchman, but also a “narcissist,” “manipulative,” a “snake oil salesman and a con man.” Hansel, during an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in November, said he was simply too optimistic about the financial — and geopolitical — challenges Chanje faced the last four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdEbrm"&gt;Chanje caused real collateral damage for such a small startup. It still owes many of its former employees months of back pay and promised bonuses; at least four have sued the startup. Ryder also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22337230/ryder-chanje-lawsuit-fedex-electric-vans-startup-delivery"&gt;sued for more than $3 million&lt;/a&gt; after Chanje failed to deliver most of the vans it promised to the fleet company.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Xen1I"&gt;The startup’s collapse left FedEx in the lurch, too. Chanje promised the shipping giant 1,000 electric delivery vans, but never delivered them. It also abandoned a project to build out charging infrastructure at FedEx depots across California — infrastructure that was meant to be the groundwork for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311210/fedex-carbon-neutral-2040-2-billion-electric-vehicles-planes"&gt;company’s $2 billion push to become carbon neutral&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQpYVk"&gt;FedEx is now suing Chanje in an attempt to recover some of the millions of dollars it paid for that charging infrastructure. But as Ryder has already found out, there may not be anything left — and Hansel has already moved on to his next big pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wTCcMbOEBxN3gIZOiOCgajJ95sA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070992/acastro_211001_4790_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zrb8Hv"&gt;Chanje wasn’t Bryan Hansel’s first foray into electric vehicles. In fact, the startup’s origins are more complicated than an inspirational drug trip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GD41hc"&gt;Before Chanje, Hansel worked at a company called Smith Electric Vehicles. It’s the oldest electric vehicle company in the world, founded in 1920 in the United Kingdom. Smith spent much of the 20th century building short-range electric delivery vehicles and, at one point, held the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Electric_Trucks/NwDEDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;dq=%22smith+electric%22+mister+softee&amp;amp;pg=PA135&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover"&gt;exclusive rights to make electric Mister Softee ice cream vans&lt;/a&gt; in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YY2ANf"&gt;In 2007, Smith was looking for a way to establish a presence in the United States, which was home to more big fleet companies and was starting to see much larger investments in the clean energy space. Hansel had spent years working in product development and had previously bought a company from the investment firm that owned Smith. That firm tapped Hansel to become the CEO of a new Smith US subsidiary in early 2009 — despite his lack of experience in the auto industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nBglCo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I knew nothing about electric vehicles, but it was just another product”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WOQifd"&gt;“I knew nothing about electric vehicles, but it was just another product, and I felt the timing was right,” Hansel says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8J520d"&gt;The US had become such a hot spot for early electric vehicle hype that, in March 2010, Hansel made a bold pitch: he wanted the US subsidiary to &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/2010/08/16/story6.html"&gt;buy out the parent company&lt;/a&gt; in the UK. Smith’s owners accepted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXp4sX"&gt;Smith became an American company as the world was reeling from the financial crisis. But the US government started investing in green tech companies as it tried to rescue the economy, and the Obama administration believed it found a darling in Smith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUVeet"&gt;Standing in front of a bright green-and-white Smith Electric van in &lt;a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2010/07/08/smith-electric-just-one-example-innovation-kansas-city"&gt;July 2010&lt;/a&gt;, then-President Barack Obama stumped for his administration’s decision to toss the company a $32 million Recovery Act loan. (Smith &lt;a href="http://earth2tech.com/2009/08/07/3-under-the-radar-battery-grant-winners/"&gt;also received a $10 million Department of Energy grant&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxK9km"&gt;Smith’s employees were helping the US fight through a “vicious recession” and “building the economy of America’s future,” Obama said. Investments in clean energy were going to inspire a wave of new jobs “year after year after year, decade after decade after decade, as companies like Smith, that start small, begin to expand,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ye37uL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJNvtsA2BPY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="64ZCec"&gt;Then, Obama revealed Hansel had pitched him something big: “I was just talking to your CEO, and he says he wants to open up 20 of these [factories] all across the country, so that in each region ... Smith is able to service its customers, and they’re going to have a reliable sense that Smith is always going to be there for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IeXrU"&gt;Hansel and Smith tried to ride the White House’s support to an initial public offering in late 2011. But by the time the deal was ready, the market had soured on clean tech startups. Hybrid sports car startup Fisker Automotive &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/fisker-karma-recalled-over-battery-fire-risk/"&gt;recalled its cars&lt;/a&gt; after problems with the batteries, and the Department of Energy &lt;a href="https://www.torquenews.com/1075/fisker-automotive-lays-workers-after-dept-energy-freezes-loans"&gt;froze its credit line&lt;/a&gt;. Solar car startup Aptera &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22358355/aptera-ev-three-wheeled-doe-atvm-loan-program"&gt;folded at the end of 2011&lt;/a&gt; after failing to meet the requirements for a loan from the same DOE program. Most notoriously, solar panel company Solyndra went out of business after &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-solyndra-bankruptcy/solyndra-1-2-billion-in-contracts-undercut-by-china-idUSTRE79H5YI20111018"&gt;Chinese companies flooded the market with cheaper products&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kdjEG1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hansel told Obama he wanted to open 20 Smith factories across the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BR2ndK"&gt;Smith pulled the IPO in 2012. The following year, it stopped production at the Kansas City factory and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119012512/http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/article1216484.html"&gt;abandoned plans for two other locations&lt;/a&gt; — meaning the country would never see the 20 factories Hansel had promised to Obama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rGNTU"&gt;Smith was saved in 2014 by &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/321529/smith-electric-vehicles-stirs-back-to-life-with-42-million-from-sinopoly-battery/"&gt;a $42 million investment&lt;/a&gt; from Chinese battery supplier Sinopoly, and Hansel once again tried to turn it into a public company — this time by acquiring a business that was &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119012512/http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/article1216484.html"&gt;already listed on the over-the-counter markets&lt;/a&gt; with no revenue and only one employee. But that deal ultimately fell apart, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wX2PYZ"&gt;With Smith limping, Hansel joined his daughter on a 10-day trip to the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador in early 2015. They stayed with an indigenous tribe, and while there, Hansel took ayahuasca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rp4SUU"&gt;The drug “floored him,” a person with knowledge of the excursion said. Hansel rolled in the nearby river mud until Gaia appeared, he explained to the group the next day. “[She] tells him he needs to get his shit together and start being part of the solution and stop being part of the problem,” this person said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="GJ4bYN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ayahuasca “floored him”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qZ4PjB"&gt;Hansel’s daughter &lt;a href="https://blog.pachamama.org/pachamama-alliance-corporate-partner-profile-nohm"&gt;blogged about the trip&lt;/a&gt;: a photo of her and her father, adorned with tribal face paint, sits atop the post. While there are no explicit references to ayahuasca, she quotes her father describing the experience. “One of the most important elements is the exposure to the existence of the Amazon and understanding the delicate reality of its existence, being immersed in it,” Hansel said about the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nyVlyz"&gt;Looking back now, Hansel tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it was “a transformational trip.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DbvqK"&gt;“There’s no question it changed my life forever,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szHbF7"&gt;After Hansel returned from the rainforest, he pushed to create a new electric vehicle startup to be jointly run by Smith and Five Dragons Group — the Chinese electric vehicle maker that owned Sinopoly. Five Dragons was already designing what Hansel says was the “[Tesla] Model S” in the commercial EV space in China. He felt the best opportunity was to create a new company that would primarily focus on selling FDG’s vehicle stateside. Smith agreed to do engineering work on Five Dragons’ vans so they could be legally sold in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gqxLu"&gt;“If we can have this product in the US, we win,” Hansel says he remembers thinking at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2eyNh"&gt;After cycling through a few initial names, Hansel at one point settled on “Nohm” — the given reason at the time being that “an ohm is the measure of electric resistance. Our vision is a world in which there is no resistance to positive energy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQXNXT"&gt;In 2016, Hansel would ditch Nohm for another name: Chanje. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="dLmcik"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7x2wSj"&gt;That’s when things got contentious. Smith &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087809/Smith_Second_Amended_Complaint.pdf"&gt;sued Five Dragons Group in 2016 (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, and accused Hansel of conspiring with a Five Dragons executive named Jaime Che to create Chanje as a way to rob Smith of its intellectual property. Hansel, acting as an “undisclosed agent” for Five Dragons, “improperly exploit[ed]” his role as CEO of Smith to bait the board into what was ultimately a trap, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxF1Gf"&gt;Hansel dragged his feet sourcing orders for Smith’s electric vans, which were ready to go and which Chanje was also supposed to sell, according to the suit. This cut off Smith’s only possible source of revenue and “backed [it] into a financial corner.” So Hansel and Che offered Smith a $2 million loan from Five Dragons — which, crucially, was secured by 50 percent of Smith’s stock in Chanje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BlBPnw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smith accused Hansel of acting as an “undisclosed agent” for Five Dragons&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pInwdJ"&gt;After Smith took the loan, Five Dragons demanded the Kansas City company make “deep personnel cuts,” stop development of its electric van, and close its engineering center, among other concessions. Five Dragons also refused to pay Smith for the engineering work it did on the Chinese vans. At this point, it was “apparent that the financing agreements … were a ruse designed to close the financial vice in which [Five Dragons] had placed Smith,” the company wrote in its lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjxpQa"&gt;Hansel said in an interview that the lawsuit was “literally fantasy.” Five Dragons denied the claims in court. Che told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a message that he “[did] not know what went on between Bryan and Smith but [Five Dragons] has no commercial reasons to purposely sabotage Chanje’s sales effort when we are the largest shareholder and beneficiary of any such sales.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QxkJH"&gt;Smith was never able to repay the $2 million loan. So Five Dragons foreclosed on Smith’s ownership stake in Chanje in early 2016. The suit was ultimately settled in 2018. Smith got its IP back, as well as some Five Dragons shares in exchange for completely cutting ties with Chanje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jarLko"&gt;Hansel pushed forward with Chanje. The business plan was simple: the startup would import nearly finished electric delivery vans made by Five Dragons, assemble them at a facility in the United States, and market and sell them to the myriad companies looking to go green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rii7Z3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The market for capable commercial EVs was largely nonexistent in 2016&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqhMAD"&gt;Chinese vehicles have a limited track record of success in the United States. But in 2016, Chanje was so far ahead of the curve of commercial electric vehicles — a market that Ford, General Motors, and a number of startups are only getting into &lt;em&gt;now &lt;/em&gt;— that potential customers were willing to listen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8KTpmn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are proud to add 1,000 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChanjeEnergy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ChanjeEnergy&lt;/a&gt; V8100 electric delivery vehicles to our fleet. We are purchasing 100 of the vehicles and leasing 900 from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RyderSystemInc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@RyderSystemInc&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ijEnCR"&gt;Plus, former employees say the van was good. It was longer than most vans in its class, so there was more room for cargo. It had a massive 100kWh battery pack — something Tesla had only just started offering — that was good for around 150 miles of range. It was pretty much the only van designed to be electric from the beginning; other options on the market were internal combustion vehicles retrofitted to run on batteries, which meant compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Et9kiC"&gt;Chanje came out of stealth in 2017 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/3/16598208/ryder-chanje-electric-van-rentals-new-york-california"&gt;immediately announced a deal to provide 125 vans&lt;/a&gt; to trucking and rental company Ryder. Ryder soon helped orchestrate a deal where it would buy and then lease around 900 Chanje vans to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/20/fedex-is-adding-1000-chanje-vans-to-electrify-its-fleet/"&gt;one of the biggest shipping companies in the world&lt;/a&gt;: FedEx. And FedEx agreed to purchase another 100 directly from Chanje. Behind the scenes, Chanje was talking to other Fortune 500 companies, including potential deals with Walmart and Ikea, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; learned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzI8Gk"&gt;The biggest, though, was Amazon, which was on the hunt for an electric option for its growing logistics fleet. The commerce giant was so interested in Chanje’s vans that it made real-world deliveries with them during a small trial in 2018. Hansel told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Amazon wanted to order more, but that he was unwilling to let the conglomerate skip FedEx’s place in line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LXrnzk"&gt;Amazon confirmed the trial in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; but declined to comment further. The conglomerate ultimately made a big investment in EV startup Rivian and tapped it to build a custom fleet of light-duty electric vans instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4IpbVi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chanje was courting Walmart and Ikea, and even did a small trial with Amazon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YQ1QgE"&gt;“Obviously looking back on it, [I] could have maybe played that differently,” Hansel says now. “But at the same time, we always had a confidence that we were going to be fine until things really went sideways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tg35Rm"&gt;Most of these companies didn’t have the kind of charging infrastructure that could handle a new fleet of electric vans, so Chanje planned to sell them that tech as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ac5MtV"&gt;It all made for an attractive pitch, for investors and prospective employees. When Chanje hired&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Credit Suisse in 2019 to find investors, the bank projected the startup would sell 3,500 vans in 2020 for around $377 million in revenue and as many as 28,000 vans in 2024 for $2.1 billion in revenue, according to internal documents obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Credit Suisse also projected Chanje could make $44 million providing charging infrastructure to its customers in 2020 and as much as $270 million in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0agPv"&gt;Hansel’s pitchman qualities made joining an easy decision, former employees said. “He is good at selling the story of Chanje, which, the story [was] good and the product is phenomenal,” one longtime employee explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RRSx2f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An unusual culture&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MN3XVV"&gt;But Chanje’s culture was unusual. Hansel insisted that employees participate in a personal and professional development program he had designed with his personal executive coach. Employees were told to spend 20 percent of their time working on this program. There was a curriculum based in part around “The Work” by Byron Katie, a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoop.com%2Fthe-goop-podcast%2Fending-the-war-on-self-with-byron-katie%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22822775%2Fchanje-fdg-electric-delivery-vans-investigation-amazon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;motivational speaker popular in Goop circles&lt;/a&gt;, which included required readings, mindfulness exercises, and practicing giving and receiving honest feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfSgTO"&gt;This created a split between younger employees and a few older ones who had come from the automotive world, including some who Hansel brought from Smith. Most of the former employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; say they were able to find some good in these activities. But the program was also a reason some people quit in Chanje’s early years. In fact, Hansel boasted about those departures in a &lt;a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/315295"&gt;2018 interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Entrepreneur&lt;/em&gt; magazine titled, “Everyone Quit — and This CEO Is Better Off Because of It.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7urld6"&gt;Even the employees who liked the program soured on it when Chanje’s funding started to dry up. The company started missing payrolls in 2017 and cut off deliveries to Ryder after just 22 vans, court documents show. It would quietly spend most of the next four years in survival mode, in large part because the Five Dragons Group had run into a very big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A earth globe that’s fallen out of a plastic bag, laying on the floor. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VI2VpmtrWIV4sGaxNm4WmxsjJ34=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070994/acastro_211001_4790_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9i3Qgt"&gt;In 2011, Five Dragons Group chairman and CEO Cao Zhong wanted to build a road connecting coal mines in Inner Mongolia to processing plants in northeast China. Such a road would be expensive; the project ended up costing some $2 billion, and Cao himself pledged around $100 million of his Five Dragons Group stock as collateral for a loan to help build the road. He also &lt;a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2011-01/15/content_11858547.htm"&gt;raised hundreds of millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; from Li Ka-Shing, the richest man in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HkduN"&gt;But when it opened in 2013, China was trying harder than ever to diversify away from coal. In 2015, Cao’s road-building company (which was separate from Five Dragons) &lt;a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2015/1117/ltn20151117017.pdf"&gt;admitted in Hong Kong Stock Exchange filings&lt;/a&gt; that the highway would be in an “incubation stage” where it would bleed money for the first few years. (In its &lt;a href="https://media-crtg.todayir.com/2021072917160288089868916_en.pdf"&gt;most recent annual report&lt;/a&gt;, Cao’s highway company lost nearly $200 million and said it’s evaluating ways to sell the highway.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRbMP8"&gt;Five Dragons started to struggle as the Chinese government &lt;a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2017-11-22/china-to-pump-brakes-on-electric-vehicle-subsidies-source-101174670.html"&gt;began cutting subsidies for electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, and the country’s booming economy cooled. Cao’s failing highway only increased the burden on Five Dragons. The company was losing money, defaulting on bank loan payments, and the subsidiary that built Chanje’s vans wasn’t &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3029964/li-ka-shing-files-bankruptcy-petition-against-chinese"&gt;paying employees&lt;/a&gt; and eventually stopped work at its factory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3CmCEz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Five Dragons’ chairman built a massive road for hauling coal with backing from Hong Kong’s richest man&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pXUfQO"&gt;Li, the Hong Kong billionaire, had also &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3029964/li-ka-shing-files-bankruptcy-petition-against-chinese"&gt;invested at least $50 million into Five Dragons in 2015&lt;/a&gt; after helping Cao fund the Inner Mongolia highway. But by 2019, his stake in the company was worth less than half the original amount. Cao had also &lt;a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2019/0927/2019092701393.pdf"&gt;personally guaranteed&lt;/a&gt; the bonds his highway company had sold to Li to fund that project — borrowings on which Cao’s company defaulted. So in September 2019, Li &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3029964/li-ka-shing-files-bankruptcy-petition-against-chinese"&gt;sued to put Cao into bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGucgX"&gt;Meanwhile, Cao’s one-time translator (and a young executive at Five Dragons) Jaime Che led a charge to usurp the CEO. Che convinced the Five Dragons board to remove Cao from the CEO post. The decision was voted on at Five Dragons’ annual shareholder meeting in September of that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SiPoO"&gt;“I am doing the right thing for the company, my shareholders and employees but if some people think that I am the villain. For that, I say FOOK YOU!!!” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JaimeCheHK/status/1169160589152854016"&gt;Che wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; following the meeting. “I will take the heat, I know good news will come soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pat6SH"&gt;All this turmoil at Chanje’s parent company kneecapped the startup. Beyond building the vans, Five Dragons was supposed to be Chanje’s main source of funding until it found outside investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WITLbV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“For that, I say FOOK YOU!!!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4WFGEF"&gt;Hansel repeatedly told employees that the funding problem was close to being solved, the former workers said. “[We were] told for five years that it’s coming, it’s coming, it’s around the corner, it’s next week,” one longtime employee said. “And we all believed him.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xf422S"&gt;That is, until the paychecks stopped coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBFenE"&gt;After skipping a few payrolls in 2017, Chanje made a habit of it in 2018 and 2019. At one point, employees weren’t paid for at least two months, multiple former workers told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNv9XH"&gt;In 2019, Chanje’s employees came together for one of their usual all-hands meetings. They sat down on the polished concrete floor of the warehouse Hansel had leased around the corner from SpaceX’s headquarters. The CEO began the way meetings usually did: by having an employee lead a group meditation. The workers closed their eyes, breathed deeply. They were told to imagine a beam going through their bodies in order to discover where they may be holding tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUkgVU"&gt;At least one employee had enough, though. When the meditation ended, they asked Hansel outright: what was going on with the company’s funding, and when would they get paid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTXuco"&gt;Instead of answering, Hansel said God had come to him in a dream the previous night, and she gave him permission to share his trip in the Amazon, according to employees who were at the meeting. He told a meandering story about taking ayahuasca and seeing a plastic bag on the ground — only to later realize it was a leaf. This experience inspired him to help save the planet, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PzyWxD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t know how all of us didn’t quit right then and there” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GoTnNG"&gt;Then, he preached one of the axioms of his personal development program. The problem wasn’t that they weren’t getting paid, it was that they were angry about not being paid, he said. You can choose to be happy if you want, he told them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAipcz"&gt;“Honestly, looking back, I don’t know how all of us didn’t quit right then and there,” one of the former employees said. “But even though he said those things … he still just had a way of making everybody in the room feel connected and wanting to stay together to see this thing through.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcfEbR"&gt;Hansel told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he and his leadership team “told people to leave” as things got rough. “We were very, very up front about [how] this is not normal, this is not acceptable,” he said, regarding missing paychecks. “We are making, as leadership, the choice to [stay]. We’re not asking you to do the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihPYvi"&gt;Looking back, Hansel says he and his leadership team were “extraordinarily transparent.” But, he said, “the consistent feedback that I have received and I think I have grown from is: ‘you’re too optimistic.’ I communicated what I believed to be the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="3w6s8X"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FcaCo8"&gt;Dream missives from God couldn’t shore up Chanje’s bottom line. Potential customers were bottlenecked behind the FedEx deal, which the startup couldn’t fulfill. That made investors wary, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QFkB9"&gt;The bigger problem was China. Investors “loved the story, loved the customers, loved the team, loved the culture — loved everything,” Hansel said. But they would not do a deal with Five Dragons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuSRk6"&gt;From this point on, employees said it was a struggle just to keep the lights on. In addition to skipping paychecks, Chanje’s leadership team stopped paying employees’ health insurance more than once. Some employees paid for the company’s internet and electric bills out of pocket. Hiring bonuses were never paid out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5zhe9b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Paychecks were skipped, employees covered company bills&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S1DLtq"&gt;Hansel even promised a $5,000 “hardship bonus” to workers for missing payroll. That, too, was never paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lrtdZ"&gt;Meanwhile, Hansel hired his daughter and gave her control of the employee development program. She closely tracked which employees completed their tasks through an online portal and chided those who didn’t in meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7RrAF"&gt;“We were required to count our meditations, and if we didn’t do [that], it did affect our pay and our bonuses,” one former employee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwJTm3"&gt;Through all this, most employees stayed with Chanje. A big reason, some say, was that Hansel simply convinced them to — even as family and friends tried to tell them otherwise. Part of that was how Hansel wielded Chanje’s development program, one said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlNO7k"&gt;“It’s a way to get people to do things and do things well, and frankly it worked, it really turned around how I behaved at work, how I took in other people’s feedback,” the former employee said. “[But] if you use it to hinder the truth, it is a way to manipulate people, to [get them to] continue doing things that you ask of them while slogging through a bunch of shit like not being paid for almost three months at a time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HjFg0N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hansel found a white knight in early 2020 — and then the pandemic hit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c1sRTi"&gt;Hansel was able to keep most of Chanje’s employees around long enough to find a white knight in early 2020. J. Streicher, a 100-year-old Wall Street investment firm, signed &lt;a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2020/0320/2020032000059.pdf"&gt;a letter of intent&lt;/a&gt; to essentially buy out Chanje from Five Dragons Group for $260 million, with a $100 million payout to Five Dragons if Chanje were to go public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuDxef"&gt;The novel coronavirus sunk those plans. J. Streicher &lt;a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2020/0703/2020070302478.pdf"&gt;backed out&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62zVgA"&gt;Five Dragons was left with more than $100 million in loans that were past due, including many backed by the company’s ownership stake of Chanje. Shortly after J. Streicher walked away from the table, Five Dragons’ biggest creditor — a state-owned merchant bank — petitioned for bankruptcy in Bermuda, where the holding company was registered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLPkG7"&gt;In the bankruptcy process, court-appointed liquidators determined some of those loans that were ostensibly from three different lenders actually all had ties to Che’s mother, a powerful investor in Hong Kong. The state-owned bank accused Che of “underhandedly siphon[ing] away Company assets into the clutches of [his] mother.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8hKah"&gt;The judge in Bermuda agreed. She decided in July 2020 (&lt;a href="https://www.gov.bm/sites/default/files/Final%20Ruling%20-%202020%20No.%20118%20civ.%20In%20the%20Matter%20of%20FDG%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Limited%20-%20with%20citation.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) that Che had conspired to stiff Five Dragons’ many unsecured creditors in favor of his mother’s companies, which were receiving interest payments on the loans. The judge essentially reset the process. Five Dragons remained in bankruptcy, and bids were solicited for the remains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lUnywg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Five Dragons wound up in bankruptcy in Bermuda&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HxiqwI"&gt;(Che, in a message to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, said he told the Five Dragons board his mother was a large shareholder of one of the lenders but that she had “no control” over that company. He also said the Chairman’s actions put the company in a position where it had no choice but to borrow money at high interest rates and that he abstained from voting on the loan.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6s4A0"&gt;Ten years after he successfully bought out Smith’s parent company, Hansel was one of the first in line to buy up pieces of Five Dragons in an attempt to save Chanje. He was in talks with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) run by Magnetar — a hedge fund that was &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/all-the-magnetar-trade-how-one-hedge-fund-helped-keep-the-housing-bubble"&gt;at the center of the mortgage crisis&lt;/a&gt; that caused the 2008 recession. The idea was for Magnetar to back him and then merge Chanje with the SPAC to take it public, according to former employees and court and stock exchange filings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqN4Pj"&gt;Meanwhile, Chanje was still working to build the charging infrastructure for FedEx in 2021. Chanje installed chargers at around half of the promised 42 depots in California, employees said, though it sourced the hardware and construction work from two California subcontractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wrT5Qn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hansel also worked with a hedge fund to merge Chanje with a SPAC&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QnnJfW"&gt;FedEx was paying Chanje millions of dollars to do this work, though two former employees said Hansel didn’t use all of that money to fund the charging stations. In fact, Chanje stiffed the subcontractors and instead used at least some of the FedEx money to keep the lights on. They’re not sure where the rest went. (Hansel said Chanje “had a real margin in that project” and that the startup was using those earnings to pay bills.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNKwZD"&gt;Those who weren’t working on the charging project were left to their own devices; some stopped coming into the office. Hansel continued to promise that a SPAC merger was coming that would save Chanje, but the deal with Magnetar fell apart. On the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, Hansel called the few dozen remaining Chanje employees together for their weekly team meeting. He fired them all on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/To7hzz_YF9Uo0I9yyd9QrrLgAGU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098169/132350237_3624957337541216_1097191523676046122_n.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Chanje&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="jMLvE2"&gt;Chanje never initially responded to Ryder’s lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Florida in March 2021. It was only after the court started the process in June to issue a default judgement in favor of Ryder — which is owed nearly $4 million — that lawyers for the startup filed any paperwork with the court. They haven’t followed up, though, and so Ryder has again asked the court to issue a default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11Dj3u"&gt;FedEx sued Chanje in Los Angeles Superior Court in July (&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097169/1803791194_1_126___1_.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) to try and recover the nearly $4 million it says it’s owed. In the complaint, FedEx says it had to pay those contractors — BTC Power and MaxGen — more than $3 million; the contractors had placed liens on four FedEx facilities after getting stiffed by Chanje. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvoBwL"&gt;FedEx also claims some of the chargers Chanje installed are broken and already need repairs. It, too, is seeking a default judgement. In the meantime, as it seeks to fulfill its $2 billion promise, this year the company &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2021/09/28/brightdrop-completes-first-of-500-electric-fedex-vans-adds-smaller-ev410-for-2023/?sh=4c752597616c"&gt;ordered vans from GM’s new electric delivery vehicle outfit, BrightDrop&lt;/a&gt;. Both Ryder and FedEx declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jum47L"&gt;In China and Bermuda, Five Dragons Group is still in the process of restructuring. It has until January 2022 to figure out a solution or be delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. (A Shanghai-based asset management firm submitted a restructuring plan in September that the state-owned bank is now considering, according to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKUTQYfxgf8"&gt;a recent hearing&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KMIstU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FedEx and Ryder are each owed millions of dollars&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRabNu"&gt;At least four employees who filed complaints with California’s Labor Commission since early 2020 seeking back have subsequently sued Chanje in Los Angeles Superior Court to try and force the company to pay up. That includes Joerg Sommer, the former chief operating officer, who was owed more than $300,000 (&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097193/1785356105_1_5_.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLP1VO"&gt;Bryan Hansel, meanwhile, has started a new company with his daughter called “&lt;a href="https://www.cohd.co/about-the-team"&gt;Cohd&lt;/a&gt;” to sell the personal and professional development plan he implemented at Chanje to other companies. Buyers can get “full access” to a “learning portal” with weekly assignments, personal reflection, and feedback logs. In return, Cohd says customers can expect things like “increased financial results,” “enhanced accountability,” and “reduced employee downtime.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yP72ib"&gt;Cohd also offers workshops and speaking engagements. But the most involved offering touted on Cohd’s website appears to be leading “offsite programming.” With those, Cohd promises to “prepare and lead multi-day offsite” trips focused on “team development” and “personal development.” Cohd’s site doesn’t mention any potential destinations, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="gHutJJ"&gt;In his bio section of the site, Hansel describes his career in very broad terms. He mentions that, at one point, he “realized that as the CEO, he was responsible and was forced to look into the mirror for a change.” Under a headshot of him straining a smile sits a quote that is as much a platitude as it may be a warning: “Every CEO gets the exact organization they deserve.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYxNqA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Silicon Valley enabled Theranos to run wild</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gmvbCyTIiicJzEiL9zy01_oLVa0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70275916/VRG_VFE_Theranos_Trial_01_Textless.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZyI7ok"&gt;As the trial of Elizabeth Holmes comes to a close, many questions have surfaced about what — or who — enabled Theranos to rise to such heights. As charismatic and ambitious as Holmes was, none of her success would have been possible without the nearly $945 million in funds she received from notable investors like &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/health/theranos-investors-murdoch-devos-walmart.html"&gt;Rupert Murdoch or the Walton family&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXxrfj"&gt;It’s not unusual for investors to blindly place their money into companies with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/04/technology/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-investors-diligence.html"&gt;little to no knowledge of their technology&lt;/a&gt;. But when those companies end up on trial for more fraud charges than you can count on two hands, &lt;em&gt;who is to blame&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngt9Ld"&gt;In the first episode of a three-part series, we look into the culture surrounding venture capital investors in Silicon Valley and what role they may have played in enabling the very fraud that Holmes allegedly conducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEfk4W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the shipping deadlines to get your holiday gifts there on time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aw456J1zZrHifnF8zE6TpmLavmE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70275842/acastro_191108_3782_blackfriday_guidebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vcXPim"&gt;The same thing happens every year. Things get busy with work, school, and life in general until you’re suddenly up against the clock as you race your gifts to your local post office, FedEx store, or UPS store. We’ve all been there — and this year is looking the same for me, personally — but we want to offer a little bit of help, so you can plan around the upcoming shipping deadlines and avoid some holiday stress, if at all possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsV0wO"&gt;Below, we’ve rounded up the domestic shipping deadlines for various retailers and shipment carriers to ensure that your package arrives before Christmas or Kwanzaa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uhVHob"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Still need gift ideas? Check out the Verge’s 2021 Holiday Gift Guide","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="ZQseMs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ups.com/us/en/support/shipping-support/shipping-services/holiday-shipping-schedule.page?WT.srch=1&amp;amp;WT.mc_id=ds_gclid:Cj0KCQiAnuGNBhCPARIsACbnLzqtCqPqWeheqGqzLa6SgsU3WgKdy8Wp5Zlg99EePdrc46yVeFMtR5QaAgYiEALw_wcB:dscid:71700000031307143:searchterm:ups&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAnuGNBhCPARIsACbnLzqtCqPqWeheqGqzLa6SgsU3WgKdy8Wp5Zlg99EePdrc46yVeFMtR5QaAgYiEALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"&gt;UPS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HvJvev"&gt;You have until Thursday, December 23rd, to ship via Next Day Air and have your package arrive on Christmas Eve, December 24th. Wednesday, December 22nd, is the last day to ship via 2nd Day Air if you want your package to arrive on Christmas Eve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TwCe4t"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fedex.com%2Fen-us%2Fholiday%2Flast-days-to-ship.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F15%2F22833986%2Fups-usps-fedex-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target-shipping-deadlines-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;FedEx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="niT2lx"&gt;FedEx’s Same Day shipping can get your package where it needs to on Christmas Eve, December 24th. If you ship it by Wednesday, December 22nd, you can opt for the 2Day shipping method. If you manage to get it to FedEx on December 21st, you can go the Express Saver route and (hopefully) pay a reasonable fee for shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YUTyhs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usps.com/holiday/holiday-shipping-dates.htm"&gt;USPS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Rfw2Ck"&gt;December 23rd is the final day to send packages (and have them arrive by Christmas Eve) through USPS via its Priority Mail Express service.

&lt;li id="mq4ZTc"&gt;December 21st is the cutoff date in most areas for home delivery of large items, but there are exceptions. The earliest delivery date available will be shown when you check out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R6mOaE"&gt;For select items, you can check out before Thursday night, December 23rd, to get your deliveries by December 24th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L58hlD"&gt;In select areas, December 24th is the cutoff for same-day delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="h5YFWb"&gt;Lastly, since Best Buy stores are closed on Christmas Day, December 24th is the cutoff date for in-store pickup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="GZYdWo"&gt;Best Buy’s shipment arrival dates may vary depending on the kind of item that you’re getting. Major appliances also may take longer to be delivered at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="StbHDt"&gt;Pickup time slots for local stores are available to book through December 24th, pending availability. You can view them in the Walmart app, or adjust your time slot at checkout. Walmart will reserve your order for four days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rNf5bj"&gt;Finally, if you want to pick up your order at a local store on December 24th, you should place said order by December 23rd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qnBu1p"&gt;Like Amazon, the arrival date of your package may vary depending on whether Walmart is shipping your item or a third-party seller is. If it’s the latter, it may ship more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

Eligible orders should be placed by December 21st.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MEXgkj"&gt;Most orders over $35 are eligible for free standard shipping, even without a RedCard, and estimated to take three to five business days. These should be placed by December 17th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UiUZht"&gt;Target also offers same-day shipments from its retail stores with a service called &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shipt.com%2Ftarget%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F15%2F22833986%2Fups-usps-fedex-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target-shipping-deadlines-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shipt&lt;/a&gt;. A subscription to Shipt includes unlimited deliveries on orders above $35 for $99 per year. Alternatively, you can pay for same-day shipping with Shipt on a per-order basis through Target’s site. Shipping fees may vary depending on your location and contents of the order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UYIrfN"&gt;In-stock items at your local Target can be ordered for pickup and ready in two hours. It helps to choose your desired location as “My store” in the top left of Target’s page, so each product listing automatically indicates if the item can be ready for pickup there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6RKHDw"&gt;Target stores will be open on Christmas Eve, though it’s best to get pickup orders and same-day shipping orders in by December 23rd to be on the safe side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="dnkvnQ"&gt;Similar to Walmart and Amazon, be aware if an item from Target’s site is shipped or sold by a third party, as that can have longer lead times. Product listings usually spell out your options for pickup, same-day delivery, and standard shipping — complete with estimated availability times — before you add to your cart.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is getting NFTs, including one that lets you become an in-game ‘metahuman’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pvFBVY5FH3sz_OLSZzRsE_wcuyw=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70275738/ss_3b56a4aea69f1d49d4871eeb1913f460f067a138.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can become an NPC in &lt;/em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&lt;em&gt; thanks to NFTs.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: GSC Game World&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ePxS0Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl &lt;/em&gt;is one of the bigger releases of 2022, and for better or worse, it’s going to feature one of the biggest tech trends going into next year: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;non-fungible tokens (or NFTs)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41POOm"&gt;GSC Game World, which is developing the game, has announced the “S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Metaverse,” which will “use blockchain technology to let the community own a piece of &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2.&lt;/em&gt;” That includes the opportunity to become the “first-ever metahuman,” which GSC Game World appears to define as a non-player character rendered in very high detail. (Though a spokesperson confirmed a metahuman won’t be made with Epic Games’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276265/epic-games-digital-human-creator-unreal-engine-realistic-human-faces"&gt;MetaHuman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382757/epic-games-unreal-engine-metahuman-creator-early-access"&gt;Creator&lt;/a&gt; tool). GSC Game World is partnering with &lt;a href="https://dmarket.com/"&gt;NFT platform DMarket&lt;/a&gt; on the new items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsb0pV"&gt;To become a “metahuman,” players will be able to bid for an NFT offering that prize as part of an auction taking place in January 2022. Whoever “owns” the NFT to become an NPC in the game will be able to buy and sell it up until a specific claim date after the auction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RraGGU"&gt;For whoever does end up with the NFT, here’s how the process of becoming an NPC in the game will work, GSC Game World CEO Evgeniy Grygorovych told me in an emailed statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="J7LAmx"&gt;The idea of the related NFT is to give the right to recreate its owner’s identity within the game through one of the NPCs. The person will need to come to our studio for a detailed scanning procedure and after that, we will have everything to make this person appear in the game world as one of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Jx9RMt"&gt;(You can get a brief look at how GSC Game World scans people into the game &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI2nsbKdaoU&amp;amp;t=202s"&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSSg77"&gt;GSC Game World also plans to release other NFTs in addition to the metahuman one, though the company declined to specify what they might be when we asked. Its NFT drops “won’t influence the gameplay itself or give in-game advantages over other players,” according to a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DmgyR"&gt;Despite trepidation from many about NFTs (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829383/matrix-nft-keanu-reeves-interview-carrie-ann-moss"&gt;including Keanu Reeves&lt;/a&gt;), game makers are beginning to explore the concept in earnest. The announcement of &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&lt;/em&gt; NFTs arrives just over a week after the &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisofts-nft-announcement-has-been-intensely-disliked-1848182203"&gt;widely panned&lt;/a&gt; news that Ubisoft would be bringing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822410/ubisoft-nfts-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-breakpoint"&gt;NFT gear to &lt;em&gt;Ghost Recon: Breakpoint&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (Some Ubisoft developers have raised questions internally about the company’s NFT initiative, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-devs-don-t-understand-company-s-nft-push-eithe-1848215633"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.) And Peter Molyneux, known for his work on games like &lt;em&gt;Populous,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Black And Whit&lt;/em&gt;e&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Fable, &lt;/em&gt;is making &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22832188/peter-molyneux-22cans-gala-nft-blockchain-business-simulator-game-interview"&gt;a business simulator&lt;/a&gt; where players buy an NFT and try to earn a new digital currency called LegacyCoin.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Halo View review: the Fitbit clone no one asked for</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It didn’t have to be like this&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="TX5zrt"&gt;The Amazon Halo View looks like a Fitbit and acts like a Fitbit, and if that’s all it did, that would’ve been fine. But despite all appearances, this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a Fitbit. To stand apart from the crowd, Amazon added a few exclusive features to its Halo platform with some admittedly impressive technology. However, instead of a straightforward, budget fitness tracker, Amazon created a baffling device that doesn’t quite know what it’s supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwcGfc"&gt;The Halo View is actually Amazon’s second foray into fitness trackers. The first was last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Halo Band&lt;/a&gt;, a screenless bracelet reminiscent of the Whoop tracker. With the View, a color OLED touchscreen was added so you can check your stats at a glance, and microphones were removed. While the microphone’s been nixed, you get the typical accelerometer and optical heart rate monitor, on top of a blood oxygen (SpO2) sensor. Like with other basic trackers, you won’t find anything fancy here, so don’t expect detailed activity tracking, an always-on display, or contactless payments. Battery life is an estimated seven days, which is about what I got with multiple daily syncs and roughly three hours of recorded exercise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sr5KqN"&gt;With this tracker, what you see is what you get. There’s no Amazon branding anywhere on the Halo View, and from a distance, you could easily mistake it for a Fitbit or one of Xiaomi’s Mi Bands. During the week I tested the View, I lost count of how many times people pointed to my wrist and asked, “Oh, which Fitbit is that?” On the plus side, it’s incredibly lightweight and comfortable enough for sleep tracking. However, while it survived multiple showers, I wouldn’t call it especially durable. While cleaning my apartment, the band caught on a hanger, and the strap just popped off. The swappable band mechanism is secure for everyday life, but a strong tug is enough to rip it off your wrist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EFlXm1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10919851"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lt2HXW"&gt;On the wrist, you can’t do much beyond the basics. Of course, you can see the time, and there are a few simple watch faces to choose from. You can swipe through to check your daily stats, start a workout, set timers and alarms, and tweak device settings. That’s about it. Notifications are also limited. While you can get alerts for texts and reminders to move, you won’t get any for calls or push notifications from apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IPdlR"&gt;Because the hardware is so simple, most of Amazon’s special sauce is in the Halo companion app. On top of standard features like tracking activity and sleep, you can also track body fat, tone, and movement health. This is where things start to go off the rails. I’m not sure why Amazon decided to open this can of worms, but the body fat and tone features feel like they were plucked out of my nightmares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="Y5Gzly"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Scientific validation aside, the body fat scan tool is the creepiest thing I’ve ever tested as a wearables reviewer. It erased about seven years of therapy in a second&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mL6Cr0"&gt;The body fat scan involves you taking four pictures from an unflattering angle in your skivvies. That’s then turned into a 3D model of your body that you can rotate. It’ll also spit out your estimated body fat percentage and show where you fall in the range of other people matching your demographics. Also, there’s a slider that lets you visualize what you might look like at higher and lower body fat percentages ranging from 13 percent to 50 percent. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538610/amazon-halo-body-fat-percentage-accurate-study"&gt;claims this feature is clinically validated&lt;/a&gt; to be twice as accurate as at-home smart scales and outperformed DXA, the clinical gold standard. The &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.10.21258595v1.full.pdf"&gt;study Amazon sent me&lt;/a&gt;, while impressive, does state in tiny print up top that the study had not been peer-reviewed and that the copyright holder is both the author and funder. This is par for the course for gadgets that claim to have scientific backing but should be taken with a sizable grain of salt. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Amazon Halo app’s Tone feature" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RBWiauwPVAu55STo1f7ki8-hztg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076148/akrales_211207_4912_0167.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tone feature is unsettling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5aaekU"&gt;Scientific validation aside, the body fat scan tool is the creepiest thing I’ve ever tested as a wearables reviewer. It erased about seven years of therapy in a second. It said I had a body fat percentage of 36 percent, which was “too high” compared to other women in my age group. That’s similar to what I get on other bioelectric impedance devices but counter to everything my doctor told me at my last physical. (I got a clean bill of health, my bloodwork was great, and I was told I didn’t need to lose weight.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fomcG"&gt;Of course, I trust my doctor more than any fitness band, but it’s easy to see how this feature could demoralize anyone just getting started or trigger more serious conditions like body dysmorphia. Amazon does include educational context about body fat, BMI, and how body fat changes slowly over weeks. But for many people, body fat is an emotional metric, and it’s easier to obsess over a 3D model of you with a six-pack than read the health literature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37PhYZ"&gt;Then there’s privacy. When you try the scan for the first time, Amazon prompts you into opting in or out of cloud backups. It says that images are processed in the Amazon cloud and then deleted by default so long as you opt out of backups. You can also delete images and measurements from your phone manually from the settings menu. While I appreciate Amazon being upfront about privacy, I still felt uneasy. Bottom line: even if no one ever sees these images, I don’t feel the “benefits” of the feature outweigh how crappy it made me feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Fitbit Charge 5 on top of the Amazon Halo View" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/27OH_j0332zzSHtUZtxPtCnoEcg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076145/akrales_211207_4912_0057.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fitbit Charge 5 (top) doesn’t look all that different from the Halo View.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FqnqCM"&gt;It’d be one thing if there was just one creepy feature. But there’s also Tone — a feature that analyzes your voice so you can “see how others hear you.” This was included with the original Halo Band, which monitored your speech on-device and faced &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/10/amazon-halo-band-review/"&gt;a fair share&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazon-halo-band-review-a-bizarre-fitness-tracker-no-o-1846038943"&gt;of criticism&lt;/a&gt; when that launched. The View no longer has microphones, so you actively have to choose to use the feature on your phone. During setup, you’ll be asked to read several passages in a neutral tone. Once that’s all done, you can proceed to let Amazon tone police your conversations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBZhND"&gt;It was deeply unsettling to watch the AI tell me in real-time that I sounded “sad,” “discouraged,” and “shy” — which was accurate given how uncomfortable I felt. During a conversation with a friend, the algorithm marked me as sounding positive. I was not. The vast majority was my friend ranting and raving about how much she hated this feature while I nodded my head. Another thing — Amazon says the feature should only analyze my voice, but at times, it seemed to track my friend’s tone and not mine. That could’ve been the background noise, latency, or poor signal, but it was disconcerting, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="2SQVuy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But for many people, body fat is an emotional metric, and it’s easier to obsess over a 3D model of you with a six-pack than read the health literature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KzxUU7"&gt;After I was done testing, my friend asked me, “Who would actually want this?” The only scenario I could come up with was practicing for a presentation or speech. Otherwise, I can’t imagine why anyone would whip out their phone to get tone policed. Not only would you have to get consent from everyone present, but you could get the same feedback from recording a video of yourself or just &lt;em&gt;asking&lt;/em&gt; the people closest to you. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Amazon Halo View on a person’s wrist" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H_UbKN8CZFVEfodtgVwyN3d4VDA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076141/akrales_211207_4912_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can do the most basic tasks from your wrist, but not much more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ydph2D"&gt;It’s easy to dunk on Amazon for being unnecessarily weird with Halo, but there are some things it does well. The highlight is the Movement health feature. You use your phone to record about five minutes of basic exercises like lunges and squats. After, you’ll see a breakdown of how stable or mobile your trunk, hips, lower body, and shoulders are. Depending on your results, you’ll get recommendations for exercises to strengthen those areas. It reminds me of Apple’s Walking Steadiness feature, which alerts you when your mobility (or lack thereof) puts you at risk of a major fall and exercises to improve stability. However, Amazon’s version is more actionable and proactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YED15E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was deeply unsettling to watch the AI tell me in real-time that I sounded “sad,” “discouraged,” and “shy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dsaHDb"&gt;Amazon also gets credit for cramming educational content into every nook and cranny of the app. I may not be fond of some of these features, but at least there were explainer articles and videos to help me understand them. But again, Amazon could’ve done a better job organizing this content. The app itself feels cluttered, and I often felt like I was getting sucked into a rabbit hole while trying to find one feature or explainer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEGsa2"&gt;I also appreciated that Halo focuses on how many minutes of moderate activity you get each week instead of an arbitrary step count or calorie burn goal. Like Fitbit’s Active Zone Minutes metric, depending on your activity levels and heart rate, you get a certain amount of points that add up to 150. (That’s a commonly used baseline from the American Heart Association and other health institutions.) It’s a more holistic approach that allows for greater flexibility, especially for beginners. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Photo of the Halo View’s sensors and band" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PvohQzjHcRxjrGLOOE0-D2BMvcw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076146/akrales_211207_4912_0090.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sensor array is simple, and you can see why the strap might pop off if you tug too hard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1dIMCo"&gt;While I understand Amazon wanting to be beginner-friendly, I’m a little baffled at how bare-bones workout tracking is. This is the only tracker in recent memory that &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; track distance or pace for running and walking. There’s literally no GPS data, not even via a tethered connection to your phone. Instead, you’re limited to steps and calories burned — two useless metrics for measuring progress. You do see your heart rate averages, as well as minutes spent in light, moderate, or intense activity. This is alright if you’re trying to be more active, but it’s not at all helpful if you’re training for an event or want to see how far you’ve come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgkLEo"&gt;Then there’s Halo Fitness, Amazon’s library of instructor-led workout videos. In a nutshell, it’s the store brand version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt;. It gets the job done, and it’ll appeal to people turned off by insufferably peppy or chatty trainers. In early 2022, you should be able to see your metrics on screen as well. I tried a core and strength workout — they were fine. However, I wish Amazon did a better job organizing the workouts. It doesn’t mean anything when you tag a core workout as “All levels” but describe it as “athletic.” The result was me thinking I’d picked a moderately difficult workout. Instead, I ended up falling on my face when trying a more advanced plank variation. Another strength workout was done at the speed of light, with barely any time to check my form, switch dumbbells, or rest between sets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the sleep tracking screen in the Halo app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JNa_B72dE5MebzwoHmXHYlfb0Bk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076147/akrales_211207_4912_0116.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sleep tracking is adequate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lC5w9C"&gt;Sleep tracking is also satisfactory. Amazon isn’t reinventing the wheel here, but you get a daily sleep score, a graph that tracks your sleep stages, and other metrics like body temperature. Accuracy is hard to measure outside a clinical setting, but my Halo data largely corresponded to what I got on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22789248/oura-ring-3-review-sleep-tracker-fitness-tracker"&gt;the latest Oura Ring&lt;/a&gt; I wore while testing. It wasn’t perfect. Once or twice, the View didn’t catch when I was actually awake, snarfing down a midnight snack. The two devices also didn’t always agree on how long it took me to fall asleep. However, different companies use different algorithms, and the View held up against one of the best sleep trackers out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81NlcP"&gt;At $79.99, it’s also the most affordable tracker that offers this number of features. After the first year, a monthly Halo subscription is $3.99, which is still much cheaper than Fitbit Premium, Apple Fitness Plus, and many other fitness apps. There’s no doubt you get a lot for the price, but if you want a simple tracker, you can always turn to a Mi Band, Fitbit Inspire 2 (which you can find frequently on sale), or one of Amazfit’s myriad trackers. None of those will ask you to take pictures of yourself in your undies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="UTKAEz"&gt;Altogether, this feels like a tracker with an identity crisis. Half of its health features are arguably terrible for your mental well-being. They feel more like an Amazon tech showcase than tools to really help people. The other half is thoughtfully built out. On the one hand, Amazon clearly put a lot of effort into catering to those just starting out on their fitness journey. At the same time, it’s missing some basic metrics from workouts, Halo Fitness is tough to navigate, and I’d be shocked if a beginner felt at all encouraged by the 3D body fat models. The tragedy is Amazon could’ve easily built a simple, affordable tracker and left it at that. Instead, it had to get weird about it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Analogue Pocket will soon let you save Game Boy Camera photos to an SD card</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Egug3hOUbc0m5sNAvJFcU5Krb5k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70275244/vpavic_211129_4897_0030.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Analogue Pocket.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gDHJZh"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review"&gt;Analogue Pocket&lt;/a&gt;, a modern handheld console that can play old Game Boy cartridges, already supports Nintendo’s classic 1998 Game Boy Camera accessory. But with an upcoming firmware update, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-analogue-pocket-has-game-boy-camera-fans-taken-care-1848215523"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that you’ll be able to actually do something with the low-resolution, grayscale, and yet utterly cool photographs it takes. Namely: transfer them to a microSD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNA3Hb"&gt;Since the Game Boy Camera cartridge itself only stores 30 photos, it’s important to have a way to export them if you don’t want to constantly curate your collection. Back in the day, Nintendo’s official solution was a small thermal printer accessory called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Printer"&gt;Game Boy Printer&lt;/a&gt; which could attach to the handheld via its link port. But given its reliance on proprietary 38mm thermal paper, this obviously isn’t a great long-term solution. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Game Boy" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IqfxLkHubHy11-IbXAzSazPdeLk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16035802/vpavic_190412_3333_0181.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Game Boy Camera, plugged into an original Game Boy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tHbw1F"&gt;As a result, over the years there have been &lt;a href="https://gameboymaniac.com/how-to-tranfer-photos-from-the-game-boy-camera-to-your-computer/"&gt;various third-party and homebrew solutions&lt;/a&gt; that have emerged. There’s this &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/you-can-connect-your-game-boy-camera-to-modern-printers-1841973018"&gt;$20 adapter&lt;/a&gt; for connecting the camera to a modern printer for example, and in September &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/custom-adapter-makes-it-easy-to-wirelessly-transfer-gam-1847258029"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; also reported&lt;/a&gt; on a Raspberry Pi project that could extract photos from the Camera and make them wirelessly accessible from a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BzoQOl"&gt;But Analogue’s solution is the most seamless yet — provided you’re able to actually get your hands on its excellent handheld console. &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; notes that there’s currently no firm release date for the 1.1 firmware update, which will enable the microSD card transfers. But when it releases, it should be available to download from Analogue’s site &lt;a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/pocket/firmware"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft to make Windows Terminal the default Windows 11 command line experience</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-lUiZ_MlZbPS6vKhf6R45Kfiwm4=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70275148/maxresdefault.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="arXCEf"&gt;Microsoft is planning to make its Windows Terminal the default command line experience in Windows 11 next year. While Windows 11 currently supports setting Windows Terminal as default, the default terminal emulator has always been the Windows Console Host. Microsoft hasn’t ever officially supported replacing this console host, meaning that command prompt and PowerShell always open in Windows Console Host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0y6v1"&gt;“Over the course of 2022, we are planning to make Windows Terminal the default experience on Windows 11 devices,” &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-as-your-default-command-line-experience/"&gt;explains Kayla Cinnamon&lt;/a&gt;, a program manager for Windows Terminal at Microsoft. “We will start with the Windows Insider Program and start moving through rings until we reach everyone on Windows 11.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vARhiq"&gt;While this change won’t affect most Windows users, developers will soon see Windows Terminal if they attempt to launch the Command Prompt. It’s a change that modernizes the overall Windows console environment, particularly as Microsoft has put a lot of effort into making Windows Terminal a solid home for developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YE0iIe"&gt;Windows Terminal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/22/18701365/microsoft-windows-terminal-10-download-store-features"&gt;first appeared in Windows 10&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18527870/microsoft-windows-terminal-command-line-tool"&gt;surprise announcement&lt;/a&gt; at Microsoft’s annual Build developers conference that year. The Windows Terminal app includes multiple tab support, alongside themes, customization, and support for full GPU-based text rendering and emoji. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alexa’s latest celebrity voice is Santa Claus himself</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jzHjNb4CK-h1YeRQH7XtLWTRNDI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70275104/dseifert_201020_4247_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OAPfS8"&gt;Amazon has introduced a new novelty voice for Alexa this festive season: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Santa-holiday-personality-for-Alexa/dp/B09CV7JL3L/ref=sr_1_15?brr=1&amp;amp;qid=1639502650&amp;amp;rd=1&amp;amp;s=digital-skills&amp;amp;sr=1-15&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Santa Claus&lt;/a&gt;. After enabling the skill with the command “Alexa, enable ‘Hey Santa,’” you can ask St. Nick to sing songs, crack jokes, tell stories, or just respond to typical Alexa commands like setting timers or playing music in his more festive voice. Judging by the customer reviews left on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Santa-holiday-personality-for-Alexa/dp/B09CV7JL3L/ref=sr_1_15?brr=1&amp;amp;qid=1639502650&amp;amp;rd=1&amp;amp;s=digital-skills&amp;amp;sr=1-15&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Alexa skill’s Amazon page&lt;/a&gt;, the feature appears to have been released earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fg5afh"&gt;There are of course several Christmas-themed questions to ask Santa. Asking “Hey Santa, am I naughty or nice?” will prompt a series of questions to work out whether you’re getting presents or coal on the big day, and the big man will also happily tell you about his reindeer or favorite food when asked. Just preface a command with “Hey Santa” and Alexa will respond in the new voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0nDl7w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Alexa, enable ‘Hey Santa’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuUvtf"&gt;I was most surprised by just how many typical Alexa commands the Santa voice is able to handle. It’ll happily recite Pi to over a dozen decimal places when asked, and can also play music from Spotify (trust me, hearing Santa say “This is Slipknot from Spotify” is hilarious). There are limits — Santa will happily flip a virtual coin but he won’t roll a virtual dice, for example — but it’s easy enough to repeat a command for Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JdkLmY"&gt;Amazon is no stranger to re-skinning Alexa with new voices, and has previously drawn upon celebrities like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21013145/amazon-echo-alexa-samuel-l-jackson-celebrity-voice-now-available-price"&gt;Samuel L. Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22579880/alexa-celebrity-voices-shaquille-oneal-melissa-mccarthy"&gt;Shaq, and Melissa McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;. Santa has also &lt;a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/kids-can-personal-message-santa-20994515"&gt;previously appeared in a more limited capacity&lt;/a&gt;. But unlike Alexa’s celebrity voices, Alexa’s Santa skill is available free of charge. Just say “Alexa, enable ‘Hey Santa’” to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OcQEJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mdT9x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo’s Find N is an impressive first folding phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ZzSQzXdM8-wFdPii7o44wIryOU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70275102/IMG_1126.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uTXtZn"&gt;After teasing its first folding phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825716/oppo-find-n-foldable-inno-day-2021"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, Oppo is revealing the Find N in full today. Oppo’s chief product officer Pete Lau told reporters in a briefing that the company has been working on this phone since 2018, with the final Find N the result of six generations of internal development. I can believe it — I’ve been using it since last week, and it’s a surprisingly impressive and refined product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVj84z"&gt;The Find N features a similar design to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, with a large, squarish folding OLED panel on the inside and a smaller screen on the outside that can be used when the phone is closed. The 120Hz inner display is 7.1 inches diagonal and has a slightly landscape 9:8.4 aspect ratio, unlike the Z Fold display, which is taller when unfolded. This means you don’t have to rotate the phone 90 degrees (with the fold horizontal) to watch videos at their largest size. There are dual stereo speakers located at the bottom of the phone, too, which further improves the experience of quickly opening the phone up to watch a video.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m-nndZxBUp20mF0mJ7FCF9phG3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098015/IMG_1128.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Find N’s hinge lets the phone stay unfolded between 50 and 120 degrees.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JoK22U"&gt;The screen looks great. Lau confirmed that it’s a Samsung-made panel, but says Oppo has heavily customized it and holds its own patents. The screen is protected by UTG (ultra-thin glass) and Oppo rates it for 200,000 folds, the same as Samsung. The crease in the panel is wider but much less visible than in the Galaxy Z Fold 3 because it wraps around a unique teardrop-shaped hinge that Lau says is also heavily patented and costs $100 to build alone. Another benefit of this design is that the phone folds shut without leaving a gap between the two halves of the display. You can feel the crease under your finger, but it’s difficult to see in regular use from all but the widest of viewing angles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Yp2CI"&gt;The outer screen is much more like a regular smartphone than the Z Fold’s. At 5.49 inches with an aspect ratio of 2:1, it’s actually very usable — if it weren’t for the folded device being twice as thick as a regular phone, it’d feel like the compact Android flagship that no-one else is making. The hinge does make for a larger bezel on the left side of the screen, of course, but it’s not intrusive. My biggest complaint about the outer screen is that it’s only 60Hz, which wouldn’t necessarily be a problem but feels jarring when the bigger, much smoother inner screen is right there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dkm5lU786QVPT2JBjJ87YUqRewc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098016/IMG_1130.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Find N’s outer display works pretty much like a regular phone, albeit quite a small one.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J3Hw5a"&gt;The rest of the Find N’s spec sheet is what you’d expect from a 2021 Android flagship. There’s a Snapdragon 888 processor and up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The main camera is 50 megapixels, using the same Sony IMX766 sensor from the OnePlus 9 Pro and Oppo Find X3 Pro, and is joined by a 16-megapixel ultrawide and a 13-megapixel 2x telephoto. The battery is 4,500mAh and can be charged at 33W with a SuperVOOC cable or 15W wirelessly. There’s also 10W reverse wireless charging and standard Qi support. A fingerprint sensor is located in the power button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OStCPU"&gt;Oppo isn’t quite as ambitious as Samsung with its custom software for multitasking, but there are a few gestures that help make the most of the bigger screen. You can pinch with four fingers to collapse a full-screen app into a smaller floating column, or split the screen in half with a two-finger swipe down. Oppo has also customized many of its own apps with features designed for the folding screen — for example, if you prop it open at an angle, the music app can display lyrics on the top half. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y3bCiHdLkmMLZJgsQj5XCWP8jFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098017/IMG_1127.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Find N’s back panel curves similarly to the Find X3 Pro.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8iBTGO"&gt;One obvious concern is durability, and it’s one that I can’t speak to after having had such a short time with the Find N. But I can speak to the design, and I think Oppo has a winner here. The Find N is sleek and easy to use whether it’s open or closed — it strikes the balance between both configurations better than any other foldable phone to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lx0hET"&gt;I would say that the Find N should have Samsung worried, but unfortunately Oppo is only going to sell it in China, a country where Samsung phones have almost no presence. It’ll go on sale from December 23rd for a surprisingly low price of 7,699 yuan (about $1,200) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. 8,999 yuan (about $1,400) gets you a 12GB/512GB model. For comparison, the iPhone 13 Pro Max starts at 8,999 yuan in China, so while the Find N isn’t exactly cheap it’s well within mainstream flagship phone territory. The Galaxy Z Fold 3, meanwhile, starts at $1,799 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="KgT0I3"&gt;Google employees who haven’t been vaccinated could be put on forced leave and then let go from the company if they fail to follow its COVID-19 rules, according to an internal memo &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/google-employees-to-lose-pay-if-dont-comply-with-vaccination-policy.html"&gt;obtained by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. The policy will reportedly affect employees that would have fallen under the jurisdiction of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666508/biden-vaccine-mandate-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;President Biden’s vaccine mandate&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/08/politics/senate-resolution-opposing-biden-vaccine-mandate/index.html"&gt;currently facing challenges&lt;/a&gt; in the Senate and court system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxs9o0"&gt;According to the memo, Google gave its employees until December 3rd to upload proof of vaccination or receive approval for a medical or religious exemption. The company says that anyone who doesn’t do either of those things by January 13th will be placed on a 30-day paid administrative leave. If they’re still not in compliance after the 30 days, they could face unpaid leave for up to six months and then be terminated, according to CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouH4ey"&gt;Google isn’t denying the policy. Google spokesperson Lora Lee Erickson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CXp9yb"&gt;As we’ve stated before, our vaccination requirements are one of the most important ways we can keep our workforce safe and keep our services running. We’re committed to doing everything possible to help our employees who can get vaccinated do so, and firmly stand behind our vaccination policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Csz1Hn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Anyone returning to Google’s offices will have to be vaccinated or have an exemption&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PAT36R"&gt;The CNBC report points out that there may be some options for unvaccinated employees — while the company expects the president’s mandate to apply to mostly everyone, employees can look for positions that aren’t covered by it, presumably ones outside of an office. If they find one (or already have one) they’d also have to be able to do the job remotely. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598316/google-vaccination-requirement-return-offices-covid-19-delta-variant"&gt;requires in-office employees to be vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly saying that frequent testing isn’t an acceptable alternative. There is also the option to request an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sr42Cd"&gt;Though the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814879/google-return-to-office-covid-omicron-hybrid-work-plans-2022"&gt;hasn’t determined when employees&lt;/a&gt; will have to come back to the office following the emergence of the omicron variant, it does expect that much of its workforce will be doing at least some work-in person. However, CNBC says that even remote workers will need to be vaccinated if they fall under the mandate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BA0dc"&gt;Both pay and vaccination requirements have been hot-button issues inside the company — during a company all-hands, executives fielded a question about whether Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828132/google-employee-wages-inflation-2021-record-profits"&gt;plans to raise wages to match inflation&lt;/a&gt; (the company said it didn’t plan to do so). &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/23/google-employees-sign-manifesto-against-widened-vaccine-mandate.html"&gt;CNBC also reported last month&lt;/a&gt; that an anti-vaccine mandate manifesto, signed by hundreds of employees, was shared within Google. &lt;/p&gt;
