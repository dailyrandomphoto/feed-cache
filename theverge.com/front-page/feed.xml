  &lt;p id="kFBmGr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 18th, 2021 2:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338157/playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-restocks-walmart-time-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is restocking both the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition%2F493824815&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; today at 3PM ET, while supplies last. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="J7uq4A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Walmart will have PS5 and Xbox Series X restocks available today","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338157/playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-restocks-walmart-time-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KMrzmx"&gt;The PlayStation 5 has been quite challenging to find ever since its launch in November. And when it is available, sales have been, for the most part, limited to online-only, with stock selling out almost instantly. Despite this, we here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; are dedicated to helping you keep track of when and where the PS5 is available in the hopes you can get another shot at buying Sony’s next-gen console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qD3Drq"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy either the PS5 (with a disc drive) or the PS5 Digital Edition, as well as any bundles that are not price surged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAoRYi"&gt;Keep in mind that due to the high demand of this console, supply will not last long, with inventory selling out typically less than an hour after being made available. Nevertheless, we’ll do our best to keep this article updated with the latest in-stock alerts and tell you when the most recent restock was available at the retailers selling the console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ca5R3n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"},{"title":"How the PS5’s DualSense controller makes games like Fortnite and NBA 2K21 better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Spcnqk"&gt;Where can I buy a PS5 right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JG5DCV"&gt;Due to the pandemic, most retailers, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734517183541536443#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-console%2F-%2FA-81114596&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, will only sell the console online until further notice. We see restocks happening multiple times in the week from various retailers; most notably, we have seen frequent restocks recently appear at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053639217049019#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5%2F11108140.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in particular. If you are looking for a bundle, retailers like Antonline and Newegg are likely to sell PS5 bundles instead of the actual console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjSIu6"&gt;We have noticed that restocks for the console are more likely to happen later in the week as opposed to earlier in the week. Additionally, places like Newegg are combatting the demand for this console by doing a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fproduct-shuffle%3Fnm_mc%3DAFC-RAN-COM%26cm_mmc%3DAFC-RAN-COM%26utm_medium%3Daffiliates%26utm_source%3Dafc-Vox%2BMedia%26AFFID%3D3430747%26AFFNAME%3DVox%2BMedia%26ACRID%3D1%26ASUBID%3Dverge%26ASID%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.theverge.com%252F%26ranMID%3D44583%26ranEAID%3D3430747%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-XXgkPukHSHvtb9QuMXSZWQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg Shuffle&lt;/a&gt;, which randomly selects winners interested in buying sought-after products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V99T63"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="7oDuAk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yaigG6Zpq6Ebg4PHlmyTd-pJL2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990376/vpavic_4261_20201023_0104.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every PS5 comes with one DualSense controller, but you can use the DualShock 4 controller, but it is only limited to when you’re playing PS4 games on the next-gen console. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o3N05Q"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the PS5?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i98dsO"&gt;The PS5 includes all the basic things you need to get started (minus the games, of course). However, you might want to consider picking up additional accessories to ensure you get the most out of your brand-new console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UsvWd"&gt;First, there’s the controller. Every new PS5 includes one &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6C75Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DualSense&lt;/a&gt; controller. But there are a few benefits to owning at least one additional controller, such as if you plan to play local co-op games with a friend or family member. Or, if you are like me and want to keep playing your game but don’t want to be tethered to the charging cable, a second control lets you continue playing while the other one charges. Normally, $70, we have &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/sony-sony-ps5-dual-sense-white-sony-dual-sense-wireless" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seen the controller go down as low as $60&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MF1y0f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PwJaY2"&gt;The PS5 HD Camera is a neat accessory for people interested in using their PS5 to live-stream video games or broadcast their gameplay with friends.  It includes dual 1080p lenses and allows you to remove the background of your camera’s feed and replace it with something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XqsPQY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562900"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YyqMlw"&gt;I strongly recommend subscribing to &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; if you have not already done so; outside of taking advantage of some online gaming functionalities, PlayStation Plus provides a ton of additional incentives, most notably PS5 owners have access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital library of some of the most impactful titles to release on the PS4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SPQIiW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vVuP0t"&gt;The PS5 comes with a 825GB of available storage right now and unfortunately, there’s no way to expand the fast internal storage currently. Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;reportedly expanding the options for more SSD storage&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to store some older PS4 titles on your console so you don’t use your limited SSD storage, I strongly advise &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Playstation-Portable-External-STGD4000400/dp/B076826S5R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buying an external hard drive&lt;/a&gt; to store those titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8ULn9w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562978"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to use your Echo with two Amazon accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J0mZ6eWJ7upYWgPnGe5ZXB2b-cM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68988905/dseifert_181011_3006_1135.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZlEnVo"&gt;If you’ve got an Alexa device in your home, like an Echo smart speaker, anyone in your home can use it. But there are certain disadvantages to having it associated with only one account. Mainly, it means that everyone is pretty much sharing the same account.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrmptJ"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;nodeId=GX3EC6SJYEPVNJKS&amp;amp;qid=1616090965&amp;amp;sr=1-2"&gt;create what Amazon calls a “household.”&lt;/a&gt; That means that there can be two adult accounts on the device. On an Echo, that means it can display photos and allow notifications (for example, for a to-do list) from both accounts. Creating a household also permits one member of the household to make a purchase using the other’s account, which can be useful if one person has a Prime account. (You can add a code if you’d rather not allow the other household member to make purchases.) And outside of an Alexa device, having a household lets you share digital content such as ebooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udaPSZ"&gt;There are a few limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDXQTD"&gt;First, you can only &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201628040"&gt;add one other adult (or teenager) to a household account&lt;/a&gt;. You can add up to four teens age 13–17 (who can shop on their own with parents approving the purchases). You can also add four children age 12 and under via the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/home"&gt;Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; plan, which costs $4.99 a month (or $2.99 a month for Prime members) for a single child and $9.99 a month (or $6.99 a month for Prime members) for up to four children. Also, don’t confuse this with Amazon Household, the service attached to a general Amazon account, which allows two adults, up to four teens, and up to four child profiles to share an account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWnUOP"&gt;Here’s how to add someone to your household:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Szr82P"&gt;Go to the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/myh/households?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Household&lt;/a&gt; page on the Amazon website. (You can no longer add a household member using the Amazon app.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6BqmZC"&gt;Select “Add Adult” (or “Add a Teen” or “Add a Child”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on “Add Adult” to add someone to your household" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S_yrL0Gev_Nr4jMWYVAqtjt_j48=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380118/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_11.41.03_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on “Add Adult” to add someone to your household.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="90v0a5"&gt;Add the name and email of the adult you want to share the account with. They will be invited to join your Amazon Household. (A teen will also get an invite; you will need to create a child’s profile yourself.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your new Household member will be send an email" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_VYnqEWFOrz_vMSCwYcIjJznUy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380119/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_11.41.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your new household member will be sent an email.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2AAaTj"&gt;Once that’s done, to go from one account to another, you just have to say, “Alexa, switch accounts.” (If you’ve lost track of whose account you’re using, you can say, “Alexa, identify account.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MEu8CJ"&gt;Remove a second account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SqX96n"&gt;What if you no longer want the other adult on your account? (Breakups do happen.) You can easily remove them from your household:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="U8Hj3k"&gt;Go to the same “Manage your Household” page on the Amazon site. On the left, you’ll see icons representing you and the other member of your household.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BByErR"&gt;You can either select “Leave” to leave the household yourself or “Remove” to remove somebody from your household. Be aware that any adult leaving or removed from a household won’t be able to join another for 180 days (in other words, six months). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To remove a Household member, go to the “Manage Your Household” page" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SOoPNwxB-dVkvDyHOkEyddE9mrA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380196/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_12.01.27_PM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To remove a household member, go to the “Manage Your Household” page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D0iezK"&gt;That 180-day restriction could be a problem if, for example, you’re simply trying to transfer a household member to a different account or if you’ve accidentally removed somebody. In either case, it’s a good idea to contact &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/contact-us/ref=hp_gt_comp_cu"&gt;Amazon customer support via chat or phone&lt;/a&gt;. According to a customer service rep I chatted with, Amazon can remove a household member without imposing the 180-day ban if requested. And if you’ve already removed one, it can reset the account so that you can add another before the six-month period is up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSDfwI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 18th, 2021, 2:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on November 19th, 2019, and has been updated to accommodate changes in Amazon’s Household plan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing letting you watch YouTube videos right from a tweet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IL59lRqy4HDmmpBmmv5olUettGg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68988808/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJmY3p"&gt;Twitter is testing a way to let you watch YouTube videos right from your timeline. Typically, when someone includes a YouTube link in a tweet, clicking that link sends you to YouTube, which can be frustrating if you didn’t want to leave Twitter to watch the video. This new feature, which is in testing today on iOS, means you won’t be sent away from Twitter, which will make it easier to watch a video and then keep on scrolling if you so choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfBmko"&gt;Twitter shared how the feature works &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1372592575849189381"&gt;in a GIF&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wn3Xrw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting today on iOS, we’re testing a way to watch YouTube videos directly in your Home timeline, without leaving the conversation on Twitter. &lt;a href="https://t.co/V4qzMJMEBs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/V4qzMJMEBs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1372592575849189381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mrJuHw"&gt;The test will be available to “a very small group of users” in Canada, the US, Japan, and Saudi Arabia, Twitter said in a statement shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; after we first published this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rA80x"&gt;“The current test on iOS will be a four-week experiment,” a Twitter spokesperson said. We plan to take a look at the results and will scale accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4bRVr"&gt;This new test arrives alongside two others announced last week for iOS and Android that are intended to improve sharing and viewing media on the social network. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;One test&lt;/a&gt; adds a “what you see is what you get” image preview in the tweet composer, meaning images appear in your timeline as they do when you’re drafting a tweet. The company is also testing ways to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1369680674672807940"&gt;upload and view 4K images&lt;/a&gt; on mobile. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="MDr2JX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 18th, 2021 2:19PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338157/playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-restocks-walmart-time-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; plans to restock both the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=VergeXboxSeriesXSRestocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-S%2F606518560&amp;amp;subid1=VergeXboxSeriesXSRestocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Series S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; today at 2:30PM ET, while supplies last. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uEhwA5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Walmart will have PS5 and Xbox Series X restocks available today","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338157/playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-restocks-walmart-time-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eQ3cRD"&gt;Microsoft’s next-gen gaming consoles, the Xbox Series X and Series S, came out in November, but buying one even now has been challenging due to the pandemic. If you have a hard time keeping up with restocks on where to buy either console, don’t worry. We are here to help you keep tabs and better your chances of securing either next-gen Xbox console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkhtST"&gt;Keep in mind that due to the high demand of this console, supply will not last long, with inventory selling out typically less than an hour after being made available. Nevertheless, we’ll do our best to keep this article updated with the latest in-stock alerts and tell you when the most recent restock was available at the retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3eON2"&gt;We will also note any opportunities to buy either Xbox console through the Xbox All Access Plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EJuT6Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Spcnqk"&gt;Where can I buy an Xbox Series X / Series S right now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="HcJ9BE"&gt;Due to the pandemic, most retailers, including Best Buy and Target, will only sell the console online until further notice. We see restocks happening multiple times throughout a week from various retailers; most notably, we have seen frequent restocks recently appear at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734069351763648754#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-series-x%2FB224744V.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fconfigure%2F8wj714n3rbtl%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3D0wLgH49VWzI%26ranSiteID%3D0wLgH49VWzI-USOUgSpZ9qCTjz66YpabUw%26epi%3D0wLgH49VWzI-USOUgSpZ9qCTjz66YpabUw%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2000142_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xpri0km1gajjy00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%25280wLgH49VWzI-USOUgSpZ9qCTjz66YpabUw%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xpri0km1gajjy00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=VergeXboxSeriesXSRestocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, in particular. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qN6oHa"&gt;The Xbox Series S costs $300 and is currently the most affordable ninth-generation home gaming console. It is smaller, less powerful, and lacks a disc drive, limiting you to only playing digital games. The $500 Xbox Series X serves as Microsoft’s flagship gaming console, including a disc drive and more powerful hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cB7Zs4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="THxZFV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o3N05Q"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Xbox Series X / Series S? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="W5MxWn"&gt;Whether you purchase the most affordable next-gen console (the Xbox Series S) or Microsoft’s most powerful gaming console to date (Series X), they share many accessories that will help you get the most out of your experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I206y0"&gt;If you plan to share this console and play local co-op games with family or friends, the purchase of an additional controller is a must. Normally $60, the new Xbox controller does get discounted sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="arsXD4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vBlyA0"&gt;If you are planning to subscribe to both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Live-Gold-Membership-Digital/dp/B002VBWIP6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Live Gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Membership-Digital/dp/B07HRDSTZ4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt;, I recommend consolidating those separate purchases and subscribing to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;. It combines both services into one package, while also providing additional access to Game Pass for PC and access to Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kFcOAU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="STmdtT"&gt;When it comes to additional storage, both consoles are rather limited: 512GB on the Series S, 1TB on the Series X. You can buy an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SSD expansion card that only comes in 1TB&lt;/a&gt;, but it is very expensive, costing $220.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTSdyQ"&gt;There is a solution that can alleviate this until additional SSD options are made available — specifically, using an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Xbox-Special/dp/B072LX7WLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;external hard drive&lt;/a&gt;. Ideally, I would suggest buying an external hard drive if you plan to play some older games so you don’t use up your limited SSD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LKeRlK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="FLyqG6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>A new Life is Strange is coming in September, and the original is being remastered</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_QEsN-L4O8v0WgudtfcToPOABnc=/0x138:3840x2698/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68988454/LiS_TrueColors_KeyArt.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="84Ug4P"&gt;During today’s Square Enix Presents live stream, the company announced the next main entry in the &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange &lt;/em&gt;series, called &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt;, will arrive on September 10th, 2021 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and Stadia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3lYIa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life is Strange: True Colors is &lt;/em&gt;developed by Deck Nine, a studio that previously worked on &lt;em&gt;Before the Storm&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange: True Colors,&lt;/em&gt; players control Alex Chen, an Asian American woman who has a supernatural ability to “experience, absorb, and manipulate” the strong emotions other people experience. The story will focus on Alex as she tries to embrace her power to figure out the mystery surrounding her brother’s death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e5qLg7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All episodes for ‘Life is Strange: True Colors’ will be available at launch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xYaqbK"&gt;Unlike previous games in the series, all episodes for &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; will be available at launch, meaning you can play the full game on launch day or use chapter breaks to tackle one episode at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20NTAq"&gt;Additionally, Square Enix announced the &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange Remastered Collection&lt;/em&gt;: a compilation that includes enhanced versions of the original &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; and its prequel, &lt;em&gt;Before the Storm&lt;/em&gt;. The remastered collection will feature remastered visuals and improved character animations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhX4fY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life is Strange Remastered Collection&lt;/em&gt; has no release date yet, but Square Enix is aiming to release the game sometime this fall on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Stadia. Those who purchase &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange: True Colors&lt;/em&gt;’ Ultimate Edition will receive a copy of the &lt;em&gt;Remastered Collection&lt;/em&gt;, but the game will also be available as a standalone purchase. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can watch all of The Office for free on Peacock for one week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NBC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sp5VWZ"&gt;NBCUniversal is making all of &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nbcuniversal.com/newsroom"&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; on Peacock for one week, starting today, March 18th, in celebration of the show’s 16th anniversary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJSoh9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; has streamed exclusively on Peacock since January 1st after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174856/the-office-netflix-peacock-streaming"&gt;leaving Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, where it was one of the most-watched shows on any streaming service.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Usually, Peacock offers the first two seasons of &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; for free with ads and seasons 3-9 through Peacock’s $4.99 per month tier with ads or the $9.99 per month tier without ads. But for one week, you can watch any episode of &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; for free with no ads at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ady6Sm"&gt;I actually just tried Peacock for the first time to check out the promotion. I made a Peacock account, found &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, watched a couple minutes of the pilot and then jumped to an episode in season 8. It all worked great, and I didn’t hit any ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XVgJ70"&gt;If you’ve been missing &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; since its move to Netflix but haven’t wanted to pay for Peacock or deal with ads, now’s the time to catch up on some of your favorite episodes while it’s free on NBCUniversal’s streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL6MPo"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook shows off how you’ll use its neural wristbands with AR glasses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cY7CP3xWEXZ96hHAhTQ1XbO4Xdk=/0x0:600x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68988251/Visual_3.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kty54B"&gt;Facebook has offered a glimpse inside its plans for a new augmented reality interface, based on technology from CTRL-Labs, the startup it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20881032/facebook-ctrl-labs-acquisition-neural-interface-armband-ar-vr-deal"&gt;acquired in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. In a video, it shows off wristbands that use electromyography (EMG) to translate subtle neural signals into actions — like typing, swiping, or playing games like an archery simulator. The bands also offer haptic feedback, creating a system that’s more responsive than basic hand tracking options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xQ2RD"&gt;Facebook Reality Labs &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/inside-facebook-reality-labs-wrist-based-interaction-for-the-next-computing-platform/"&gt;published a blog post&lt;/a&gt; detailing its work on a prototype of the wristbands. At its simplest, the bands would track basic gestures Facebook calls “clicks,” which are supposed to be reliable and easy to execute. They’re a little bit like the all-purpose Microsoft HoloLens &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/operator-gestures-hl2"&gt;“air tap” gesture&lt;/a&gt; but tracked with the nerve signals that run along your arms, rather than visual sensors mounted on a headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6H6q0B"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=314&amp;amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTechAtFacebook%2Fvideos%2F1146186389155473%2F&amp;amp;show_text=false&amp;amp;width=560" width="560" height="314" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QfXcOx"&gt;The bands can theoretically do a lot more, though. For instance, they could track the nerve signals your brain sends to your fingers while you’re typing, so you can type on a virtual keyboard without physical buttons. And unlike a normal keyboard, the bands can slowly adapt to the way you type — so they can “learn” the ways your fingers move when you’re making common typos, then automatically correct for them and capture what you probably meant to type instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQ9lnV"&gt;This would be a huge change in how most people interact with computers, but conceptually, it’s not actually a major update to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/6/17433516/ctrl-labs-brain-computer-interface-armband-hands-on-preview"&gt;how CTRL-Labs described its work&lt;/a&gt; years ago. In fact, the ultimate possibilities for EMG wristbands are much more mind-bending: eventually, you could perform the same typing-style gestures by &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; about moving your hands instead of actually moving them. Facebook wants to further streamline user interactions by relying on artificial intelligence and augmented reality glasses, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;announced it was working on&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sQYUuv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook is experimenting with different haptic feedback prototypes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OCGMAl"&gt;Even in their simpler iterations, these controllers would offer an interface that you could wear all the time instead of picking up and holding, like the current Oculus Touch VR controllers. The effect could be similar to smaller &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/mudra-band-ces-2021-041411145.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFEITOdCbzc3jOTbXSWqhIMoqC7ca6oAByvZ71mKIv-jgLGrK4DU4r4WtKhLG3K4hfoUONSaOUVNfQfLmJaiYnBMeS4j_Nxq2bosa3R6dnv8owHvckb8_0Rh3CRVN2-Aq6avcMJFFpMLcGkFz-K-mfT-FWIzN6jQmi7Ex606wCJv"&gt;startup offerings like the Mudra Band&lt;/a&gt;, which senses gestures via an Apple Watch band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3uNd9"&gt;One major new addition is haptics. Facebook says it’s been implementing various prototypes that could give you subtle feedback using different methods. One, the “Bellowband,” has eight pneumatic bellows placed around each wrist. These can be inflated or deflated in patterns that produce distinct sensations. Another is “Tasbi,” which uses vibrating actuators and a “novel wrist squeeze mechanism.” When they’re paired with visual feedback from an AR headset, they can offer a lot of information through a simple and intuitive interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rASJ4"&gt;Facebook insists that although the band reads neural signals, “this is not akin to mind reading.” Here’s how it explains the concept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kGZv28"&gt;You have many thoughts and you choose to act on only some of them. When that happens, your brain sends signals to your hands and fingers telling them to move in specific ways in order to perform actions like typing and swiping. This is about decoding those signals at the wrist — the actions you’ve already decided to perform — and translating them into digital commands for your device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="q1ydhz"&gt;CTRL-Labs has still characterized this technology as a brain-computer interface, but it’s a sharp contrast with technologies like Elon Musk’s Neuralink — which reads neural activity directly from the brain through an implant. Implants have unique uses, particularly for people with paralysis or amputated limbs, whose bodies simply can’t send nervous signals to a wristband. But Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319737/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vr-ar-face-sensors"&gt;recently criticized implants&lt;/a&gt; as a near-term consumer technology, saying that “we don’t think that people are going to want to get their head drilled open in order to use virtual or augmented reality.” Wristbands also don’t have quite the same privacy scare factor as something that reads your thoughts at the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHZg4b"&gt;That said, the bands will almost certainly be collecting a lot of data. That might include incredibly fine variations in typing patterns; overall levels of bodily tension; and any biometric information captured by fitness tracking sensors, augmented reality glasses, and other tech that could be integrated with the bands. (Facebook Reality Labs notes that it has a “neuroethics program” examining the privacy, security, and safety implications of AR and neural interface tech.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aa9oYG"&gt;Like most wearable technology, EMG bands offer an intimate look at how our bodies are moving — and while it’s not quite as creepy-sounding as a band that reads your thoughts, it still requires a lot of trust.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine website builds on a swine flu tool </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mJdcZoYZdIyZrG1HVECidsYZDjo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68987956/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eQrWJn"&gt;The federal COVID-19 vaccine-finding website President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22326335/biden-white-house-covid-19-vaccine-federal-website"&gt;promised last week&lt;/a&gt; will be an expansion of &lt;a href="https://vaccinefinder.org/"&gt;VaccineFinder&lt;/a&gt;, a website first created during the 2009 swine flu outbreaks to help people locate vaccine providers. On or before May 1st, the website should include information on every COVID-19 vaccine administration site in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3V24uC"&gt;“It’s going to be an improved, federal version of VaccineFinder,” says John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children’s Hospital and founder of VaccineFinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rar73q"&gt;Over the past decade, VaccineFinder compiled information from around the country, showing people where they could find flu shots and other routine vaccines. It runs out of Boston Children’s Hospital in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BzvZzC"&gt;It has been a part of the CDC’s COVID-19 vaccination plans since last fall. The back-end system is how the agency tracks the number of doses available at every pharmacy, clinic, hospital, or pop-up site administering vaccines. “Every COVID vaccine provider has had to register with us,” Brownstein says. Sites are asked to report the doses on hand every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUCJg9"&gt;“The platform itself is collecting data on daily inventory, all the different providers, and then feeding that information back to CDC,” he says. “This is one node in that whole flow of information.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-QVp56EmZ5SUBGPeewWSN_mEXZQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380055/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_11.18.35_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of VaccineFinder showing vaccine availability at pharmacies in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D0s7EM"&gt;At the end of February, it &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/24/cdc-vaccinefinder-covid19-locations/"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; a public-facing map showing vaccine stock at just under 30,000 providers across the country. It covers every pharmacy in the country giving vaccinations as part of the federal retail pharmacy program and additional locations in a handful of states, including Alaska, Indiana, Iowa, and Tennessee. Features directing people to non-COVID-19 vaccines are now offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j89Qum"&gt;Information from VaccineFinder is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334609/apple-maps-facebook-google-covid-19-vaccine-locations"&gt;also now integrated&lt;/a&gt; into Apple Maps and Facebook’s COVID Information Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zqoo6m"&gt;Over the next few weeks, more providers in more states will flip their vaccine supply information over to the public side of VaccineFinder. “That’s a state decision, of when they want to go public. You want to make sure the timing is right,” Brownstein says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwGs7a"&gt;The team is also working to integrate appointment availability, not just vaccine supply, into the tool. Right now, visitors to the site will see if a location has vaccines in stock and which type of vaccine it has. That doesn’t necessarily mean a site has available appointments for those in-stock doses — people have to click out to the location’s own website to check that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2Hbkg"&gt;It’s not clear yet if and how people will be able to make appointments directly&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;on the site, instead of having to click out to a site’s own scheduler. “We’re still working through exactly what that would look like,” Brownstein says. “Even right now, the feedback we’re getting has been overwhelmingly positive because it gives people a navigation tool, and a jumping-off point to book an appointment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6G2A3z"&gt;The team is also working to improve the site’s accessibility, Brownstein says. They recently partnered with Univision to make it available in Spanish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YkTCzp"&gt;The absence of centralized resources to help people track&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;COVID-19 vaccine availability has been a clear gap through the first few months of the US vaccination campaign. In most states, people eligible for vaccination have to bounce around between multiple registration websites for various sites to find open slots. Volunteers built makeshift aggregators in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment"&gt;places like New York City&lt;/a&gt; to fill the gap. It has been great to see that innovation, and those tools have been useful solutions, Brownstein says. One benefit to VaccineFinder, he says, is that it has direct access to supply data from vaccination sites. “But we’re happy that there’s an ecosystem.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcdtTX"&gt;Over the past year, state and federal governments have announced multiple tech solutions to various pandemic-related challenges. Many didn’t live up to the promises. In March 2020, former President Donald Trump announced plans for a nationwide testing website &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197026/trump-coronavirus-testing-website-plan-google-covid-19"&gt;that didn’t exist&lt;/a&gt;. The website never materialized. A data system to help the states schedule and administer vaccine appointments was abandoned by many after it proved to be &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/30/1017086/cdc-44-million-vaccine-data-vams-problems/"&gt;unreliable and buggy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Or87Mz"&gt;When launching a new tool, there’s always the worry that something might go wrong, Brownstein says. But because VaccineFinder has existed for years and is scaling gradually; he’s confident that it’ll work out. “We’ve already been rolling out this tool, it’s growing its user base, and the feedback has been positive — so we’re optimistic.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQfJep"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart will have PS5 and Xbox Series X restocks available today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y43Cj26fUgCDXrnNwVBv36Pr3xQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68987932/vpavic_4261_20201023_0068.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Due2Rh"&gt;If you want another shot at trying to buy either an Xbox Series X or a PlayStation 5, you’re in luck. A Walmart spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the retailer will be restocking the consoles online today, March 18th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hp1rKY"&gt;Walmart plans to have inventory for the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition%2F493824815&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-S%2F606518560&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt; gaming consoles, with prices ranging from $300 to $500 depending on the model you purchase. The retailer told me that restocks for Xbox Series X / S will begin at 2:30PM ET, while PS5s will be up for purchase beginning at 3PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vgmvmR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nHGLDC"&gt;For those looking to buy a next-gen Xbox console, you may want to consider picking up some other accessories to get the most out of your console. An &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF248LD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;additional controller&lt;/a&gt; is likely a good purchase. And unlike the PS5, you can purchase a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB SSD expansion&lt;/a&gt; to add to the Xbox’s base storage (512GB on the Series S, 1TB on the X), though it is not cheap. If you are having trouble deciding on what games to buy, you can always buy a subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you access to a slew of digital games and access to Xbox Live Gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7jDvaI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6H8DPb"&gt;If you plan to buy a PS5 console, there are a few additional items you should pick up to get the most out of your new console. I recommend picking up a second &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6C75Y?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=5&amp;amp;imprToken=6ebc230d-4687-1a1b-5f1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22059750%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt;, which is necessary for any in-person multiplayer action. I suggest that early adopters also subscribe to &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22059750%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;ued=https://www.eneba.com/us/psn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you a few perks, such as free games every month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>5 widescreen videos to watch instead of the 4:3 Snyder Cut of Justice League</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZsGt7QkRczjDMHh9F1VvD6DhMVA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68987901/bananatv_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TbJ2CM"&gt;Zack Snyder’s cut of &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt; is finally available to stream on HBO Max, and while the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22334362/zack-snyder-justice-league-fandom-release-cut-star-wars-twitter"&gt;rabid fans who helped make it happen&lt;/a&gt; may have been prepared for its 4:3 format, many people were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337756/snyder-cut-aspect-ratio-justice-league-hbo-max-warning"&gt;a little stunned when they pressed play today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GnF0V"&gt;Listen, I was a fan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/28/7457291/the-wire-hd-screenshot-comparisons"&gt;of &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I get it. Artistic vision and all that. But a 4:3 aspect ratio simply clashes with most modern devices. So I’ve rounded up five videos that take full advantage of most widescreen-optimized phones, tablets, and TVs. Use them as a palate cleanser when you finish the Snyder Cut or as a visual release valve when you inevitably pause the four-hour-long version of &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;. The world is your banana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="vB6F2j"&gt;1. This video of the Banana orbiting the Earth at the same distance as the International Space Station&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id="KKsB3c"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/paMantiqs54?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NzSqQA"&gt;This video is a few years old, but like all good internet detritus, it was picked up by the undertow of the World Wide Web and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/page_eco/status/1372175858174062594"&gt;resurfaced this week&lt;/a&gt;. It visualizes a simple premise: what if the Banana was the same distance as the ISS? As Obi-Wan Kenobi famously said, “That’s no moon.” Sure isn’t, Obi-wan. And we know that because we can see the Banana in beautiful high-definition widescreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="zMj86k"&gt;2. This documentary about the frailty of the environment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id="9w4TFP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/paMantiqs54?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HMmm80"&gt;The Anthropocene has done terrible things to the environment, certainly, but we’d &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; be in for it if a Banana the size of North America was orbiting a mere 250 miles above the Earth. This doc expertly uses the widescreen format to help viewers imagine the abject terror they might experience as they look up in awe at the Banana while tsunami sirens blare in the distance. It also really shines on OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="Rfv853"&gt;3. This art-house film about a child losing his banana&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id="YEzCSl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/paMantiqs54?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F14PFX"&gt;They say loss is nothing but change, and that change is nature’s delight. I say don’t diminish someone’s personal grief, regardless of age. Be sure to watch this one on a backlit screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="2GN7mX"&gt;4. This 90-second spot from the Ad Council about how bananas are, botanically, a &lt;a href="https://recipes.howstuffworks.com/bananas-are-berries.htm"&gt;berry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id="83hH05"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/paMantiqs54?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BdHVCo"&gt;Wait, I’m sorry, what? A berry? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2fTeQ"&gt;I mean...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVsn5q"&gt;Look, I’m not going to argue with a Banana this big. Just, like... wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="ySwXm9"&gt;5. And for those who still need their DC Universe fix, this gritty reboot of &lt;em&gt;Superman&lt;/em&gt;, in which the Banana orbits the Earth at a great enough speed to turn back time, thereby erasing humanity from existence.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id="c6LpKK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/paMantiqs54?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kc4YiT"&gt;The wind noise really does it for me if I’m being honest.&lt;/p&gt;
