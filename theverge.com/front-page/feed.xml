    <title>This YouTube channel is using AI to gloriously remaster classic game cutscenes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dTuHf0AOKlKVkX7HK_wVw2NDgy4=/234x0:2766x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69631065/yuna_dance_ffx.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tk4E9K"&gt;Twenty years ago, when photorealistic games were still just a faraway dream, companies like Square sent our imaginations soaring &lt;em&gt;before &lt;/em&gt;we played, with big-budget intros and cutscenes. Long before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/23/16176894/blizzard-overwatch-animated-short-rise-and-shine-mei-arctic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; normalized the practice&lt;/a&gt; of releasing Pixar-quality animated shorts for each new character, Blizzard’s &lt;em&gt;Diablo II &lt;/em&gt;and Capcom’s &lt;em&gt;Onimusha 3&lt;/em&gt; put us in the demon slaying mood with incredible mini-movies stretching to six minutes each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PV4Iv"&gt;But if you dare try watching these classics on a modern 4K TV or even a 1080p monitor, they’ll look like a pixelated mess. That’s where &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC33rC3GO1UZFAkMcCCwjyWg"&gt;a YouTube channel named Upscale&lt;/a&gt; and machine learning comes in — making them look nearly as good as they did on your old CRT. Or perhaps even better. It just depends how well the game’s art style works with the AI algorithms bringing it back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2erHNs"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; intros, for instance, look incredible. I scanned around, and I’m willing to call these the definitive versions currently in existence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AfHVgB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OtMliCS80ZU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Rr0GNe"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QOxDW8RqFvc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2prPHn"&gt;You &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to check out the hair in &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;’s intro. It left me in awe, and the video includes a before-and-after comparison, too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lkmxy0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pg_FL37jn04?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vCN6Ts"&gt;Here’s the legendary six-minute &lt;em&gt;Onimusha 3&lt;/em&gt; opening cinematic at 4K 60 fps. It’s not perfect, but it’s the best I’ve ever seen it. More than good enough to share with people who need to understand this piece of gaming history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hHUsnQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVo0l2ASMrY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lA02WA"&gt;And here’s 1999’s &lt;em&gt;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver &lt;/em&gt;in 8K. Can you believe this is a PS1 game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wRvNfV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wq-ObzoPjA0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OylN7w"&gt;Upscale can’t quite seem to nail &lt;em&gt;Chrono Cross&lt;/em&gt;, I’m afraid, but its second or third stab at &lt;em&gt;Chrono Trigger &lt;/em&gt;looks pretty amazing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gl2Kja"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KZvmvlCtbhM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="4Dxhlv"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/noximJJuF6w?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FHFmbk"&gt;And I’m not particularly fond of Upscale’s attempt at &lt;em&gt;Dirge of Cerberus&lt;/em&gt;. Thankfully a handful of other YouTube channels are also trying these machine learning techniques, and I think &lt;em&gt;The Gaming Restoration&lt;/em&gt; nailed it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ADEYzf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTFQ14eTKuk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1sBdf"&gt;These enhancements are all made possible through a piece of software called Topaz Video Enhance AI, aka Topaz Gigapixel, and we’ve written a bit about it before — it’s the same generated adversarial network technique &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18311287/ai-upscaling-algorithms-video-games-mods-modding-esrgan-gigapixel"&gt;some modders are using to upscale the graphics of playable games themselves&lt;/a&gt;, now applied to their cutscenes as well. For $299, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18311287/ai-upscaling-algorithms-video-games-mods-modding-esrgan-gigapixel"&gt;the company will sell you an app&lt;/a&gt; that can spit out videos like these in a handful of hours, depending on your PC’s GPU, how long, and how high a resolution you need. I know, because I took it for a spin with a handful of anime music videos and game trailers myself, and was impressed just how easy it could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ay9jR"&gt;The important thing to know, though, is the images the computer spits out aren’t necessarily “truth” — it can invent details that aren’t there, or smudge ones that are, in the sometimes-inappropriate pursuit of clarity. I found 4K videos would sometimes look better than 8K, and you really have to pick the right algorithm for the content you’re trying to upscale and compare quick previews before you commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqFTID"&gt;Here’s two different algorithms trying to enhance the same scene in &lt;em&gt;Gundam Wing, &lt;/em&gt;so you can see what I mean. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6eMLO05cC98bgmnxLLgWcUnJIw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22739857/gundam_wing_ahq.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Topaz’s “high quality” setting gets rid of the intentional blur / bokeh and flattens the image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aC0WAAIZUvTNf1MAmMOjMNYSQsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22739856/gundam_wing_aaa.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A lower quality “aliased and moire” setting does a more faithful job at the expense of clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mT5zPT"&gt;To be clear, these are &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; enhanced images, but one is arguably wrong: this is an ethereal, dream-like sequence where the background is supposed to be soft and blurred, not sharp and flat. Of course, the algorithm doesn’t know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qVel0"&gt;If you’d like to see a couple examples where I tried to enhance some old content myself, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/-SRnlI4Mmqc"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/PAjkqRNc00k"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and make sure to change your YouTube quality setting. &lt;em&gt;ExtremeTech&lt;/em&gt;’s Joel Hruska also has a great series &lt;a href="https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/314653-remastering-deep-space-nine"&gt;about trying to remaster &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUS5xe"&gt;Truth be told, I’ve hesitated to write about Upscale for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, because I figured lawyers would shut it down any minute, or Upscale’s creators would get bored and stop posting. But I’ve been waiting and watching for nearly a year, and it hasn’t gone away yet. If you’re a big video game industry executive, would you perhaps consider &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;firing ze copyright missiles? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODzICC"&gt;At least until you’ve done a better job of remastering these cutscenes yourself, I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MLB will try encrypted transmitters and bone conduction to stop sign stealing </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BdtFXHcxZOCY5gqGSZtVty2akCw=/26x0:725x466/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69630711/mlb_test_bone_conduction.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2mFDhG"&gt;Baseball has a sign stealing problem — or at least, a technological one, seeing how reading another team’s pitches &lt;a href="https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2019/11/12/20961911/houston-astros-sign-stealing-cameras-mlb"&gt;is technically legal&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2017/9/5/16257450/red-sox-apple-watch-cheating-yankees-stealing-signs"&gt;using Apple Watches&lt;/a&gt; or telephoto cameras and then &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros_sign_stealing_scandal"&gt;suspiciously banging on trash cans&lt;/a&gt; is very much not. But soon the MLB may try fighting fire with fire: on August 3rd, it plans to begin testing an encrypted wireless communication device that replaces the traditional flash of fingers with button taps, &lt;a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/31869009/mlb-test-electronic-device-catchers-give-signals-pitchers"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;ESPN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NTB0m"&gt;The device, from a startup called PitchCom, will be tested in the Low-A West minor league first. As you’d expect from something that’s relaying extremely basic signals, it’s not a particularly complicated piece of kit: one wristband transmitter for the catcher with nine buttons to signal “desired pitch and location,” which sends an encrypted audio signal to receivers that can squeeze into a pitcher’s cap and a catcher’s helmet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vthbrD"&gt;The receivers use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/24/13383616/bone-conduction-headphones-best-pair-aftershokz"&gt;bone-conduction technology&lt;/a&gt;, so they don’t necessarily need to be up against an ear, and might theoretically be harder to eavesdrop on. (Bone conduction stimulates bones in your head instead of emitting audible sound.) That said, it sounds like introducing the tech may come with other risks. Here’s a list of restrictions as cited by &lt;em&gt;ESPN&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YJ4Ujf"&gt;Players found to be wearing a receiver while batting will be ejected; only the active catcher, and no other players or coaches, is allowed to use the transmitter; a backup transmitter is provided, but it must remain in the carrying case during games; and if players and coaches need to confer because of an issue with the device, they can notify the umpires and not be charged a mound visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QbBfcJ"&gt;MLB seems optimistic about the idea so far. “The PitchCom devices were tested in side-sessions during major league spring training, and the feedback from players, coaches, and front office staff was extremely positive,” reads part of an internal memo &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/minor-league-to-experiment-with-electronic-catchers-signals/2021/07/23/5ebd28b0-ec0e-11eb-a2ba-3be31d349258_story.html"&gt;obtained by the Associated Press.&lt;/a&gt; “Based on those preliminary results, we are optimistic that these devices have the potential to be a viable long-term option to reduce sign-stealing risk and improve pace of play, particularly with runners on second base.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/doWN6HtHnVKZH0Cl6LATjBsbNmM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22739716/crayons_fcc_promystic.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: FCC OET&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qw3ScG"&gt;I wasn’t able to find records for a startup named PitchCom, but one of its founders, a Craig Filicetti, appears to be the same one &lt;a href="https://promystic.com/"&gt;who sells “ProMystic” wireless tech for magicians and mentalists&lt;/a&gt;, such as a box of crayons that can wirelessly send a signal corresponding to the crayon that someone removes. ESPN cites Craig Filicetti and John Hankins as co-owners of Pitchcom, and two men by those names formed a “JHCF, LLC” in November 2020. Both ProMystic and JHCF have a Scottsdale, Arizona address in common.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pentagon says DJI drones still pose a threat, disavowing its own earlier report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T-VIqtyzzEElicY--QTI7jQBVeY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69375023/vpavic_042029_4003_0162.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VViqYH"&gt;After months of government bans on DJI drones, with lawmakers questioning whether the company was sending information to the Chinese government, the Pentagon has admitted that the drones being used might actually be safe (&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/556370-pentagon-report-clears-use-of-drones-made-by-top-chinese-manufacturer?rl=1"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), with a report saying that &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-technology-government-and-politics-business-5854cf8b5eccd03f85d5eba2aef10a22"&gt;two “Government Edition” DJI drones&lt;/a&gt; are “recommended for use by government entities.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cC19E5"&gt;However, on July 23rd, the Department of Defense &lt;a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2706082/department-statement-on-dji-systems/"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; on the report, saying that its release was “unauthorized,” and reiterating its position that DJI’s drones “pose potential threats to national security.” (&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pentagon-says-reports-da-jiang-innovations-systems-approved-by-us-government-are-2021-07-23/"&gt;via Reuters&lt;/a&gt;) It says that its policy around the drones is unchanged, and that there is an investigation into how the “inaccurate and uncoordinated” report was released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2I7cC"&gt;Last year, the Department of the Interior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113533/us-interior-department-chinese-drone-ban-grounding-security-dji"&gt;grounded all its drones&lt;/a&gt;, citing concerns of potential spying by the Chinese government, and the Department of Commerce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;put DJI on its Entity List&lt;/a&gt; after the company allegedly provided the Chinese government with surveillance tech for its Uyghur Muslim detention camps. That second claim wasn’t addressed at all by the Pentagon’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qo7cn4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The report isn’t necessarily an all-clear for DJI’s relationship with the government&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WZK8gA"&gt;But, according to &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;, the Pentagon’s (unauthorized) report said that it didn’t find any malicious code when it analyzed two drone models. The Department of Homeland Security previously &lt;a href="https://www.auvsi.org/sites/default/files/DHS%20report.pdf"&gt;ran tests on the DJI Mavic Pro and Matrice 600 Pro in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and didn’t find evidence of data being sent places it shouldn’t, and a new administration has seemingly come to a similar conclusion today. Another report &lt;a href="https://www.precisionhawk.com/blog/unmanned-aerial-intelligence-technology-center-of-excellence-conducts-risk-assessment-of-drone-technology"&gt;that looked at three DJI drones&lt;/a&gt;, including the Government Editions of the aforementioned drones, came to the same conclusion in early 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nApNCS"&gt;The Pentagon’s report wasn’t an all-clear for DJI’s relationship with the US government, even before the DOD’s statement on July 23rd. As of &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/06/01/2021-11304/addition-of-entities-revision-of-entries-and-removal-of-entity-from-the-entity-list-and-revision-of"&gt;June 1st’s revision&lt;/a&gt;, DJI is still on the Entity List, which prevents US companies from selling any of their technology for DJI to use, and the Pentagon’s report comes as Congress is &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-technology-government-and-politics-business-5854cf8b5eccd03f85d5eba2aef10a22"&gt;considering a law&lt;/a&gt; that would ban the government from buying Chinese drones for five whole years, starting in 2023. They’d have to rely on other approved drones from companies in the US and France instead; as restrictions have been placed on DJI, others have made drones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21376917/drone-us-government-approved-dod-diu-uas-blue-china"&gt;with hefty price tags&lt;/a&gt; to fill the government’s needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EmAFe"&gt;We’re also talking about pretty old DJI drones that have gotten the all-clear; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/4/13508560/dji-mavic-pro-drone-review-price"&gt;we reviewed the consumer model of DJI’s Mavic Pro in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and the company’s offered many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22384692/dji-mavic-air-2s-drone-2021-review"&gt;far more competitive models&lt;/a&gt; since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSFRAr"&gt;None of the government scrutiny keeps you from buying a DJI drone. Despite all the accusations, DJI has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22193660/us-government-dji-drone-entity-list-export-ban-effects"&gt;still been able&lt;/a&gt; to continue creating and selling its consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEQVE7"&gt;Lawmakers are still trying to decide what to do about other Chinese products perceived to be a security risk as well: while the Department of Defense &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454292/xiaomi-blacklist-removed-communist-chinese-military-company"&gt;has rolled back the designation&lt;/a&gt; of Xiaomi as a “Communist Chinese military company”, the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274575/huawei-fcc-lawsuit-national-security-ban-broadband-rollout"&gt;seems like it still intends&lt;/a&gt; to keep a ban on Huawei products from being used in US infrastructure. The government has been so worried about equipment from Chinese companies like ZTE and Huawei acting as part of its network infrastructure that it’s even considered removing the parts already in use. Last September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21422939/huawei-zte-us-phone-networks-fcc-congress-reimbursement-cost"&gt;the FCC estimated it would cost $1.8 billion&lt;/a&gt; to “rip and replace” Chinese telecom equipment currently embedded in US networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWK12e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 25th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect that the Department of Defense has released a statement, calling the release of the Pentagon’s original report “unauthorized” and “inaccurate.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Doctor Who’s 13th season is a single story, and here’s the first trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5GLFxH0x7VMAE82glz255hmowPg=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69630360/doctor_who_season_13.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PB0vgO"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who &lt;/em&gt;to do something it hasn’t done in the modern era — dedicate an entire season to a single story. That’s the word from showrunner Chris Chibnall in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzDthngLyDU"&gt;a new &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; panel&lt;/a&gt; at the online-only San Diego Comic-Con today. Oh, and did I mention we’re getting our very first fleeting glimpse at Series 13 in a teaser trailer? Hit that video play button above to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOFKlP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.doctorwho.tv/news/?article=doctor-who-series-thirteen-begins-filming"&gt;We’d learned last year&lt;/a&gt; that the new season would just be eight episodes long, but Chibnall says it pushed the BBC to go big: “The big thing that we’re going to be doing this year is it’s all one story, so every episode is one chapter in a bigger story,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCXO6J"&gt;More:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3oFNZN"&gt;There were two ways you could go: we’re just going to do lots of tiny episodes in one room with no monsters, or we could throw down the gauntlet and go “we’re going to do the biggest story we’ve ever done, we’re going to go all kinds of different places, we’re going to have all kinds of characters and monsters, and it’s all going to be part of a bigger whole.” I think it’s definitely the most ambitious thing we’ve done since we’ve been on the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UolBjx"&gt;While many previous seasons of &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who &lt;/em&gt;slowly introduce a mystery and then resolve it by the end (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Wolf"&gt;“Bad Wolf,”&lt;/a&gt; the crack in the wall, and so on), this sounds a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrcEPz"&gt;Want to watch the panel yourself? It’s free and features stars Jodie Whittaker (The Doctor), Mandip Gill (Yas), and new cast members John Bishop and Jacob Anderson too! (Anderson played Grey Worm in &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones, &lt;/em&gt;if you’re wondering why he looks familiar.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1mXSA"&gt;Here you go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hSoDcf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QzDthngLyDU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4mYt5Y"&gt;Don’t expect any spoilers, though: “We pick it up with the Doctor and Yas who’ve been traveling together for some time, we come and meet them mid-adventure, and they stumble across some man named Dan Lewis, that’s all I’m going to tell you,” says Chibnall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="804gKp"&gt;The show actually teased Dan Lewis, Bishop’s character, during the holiday special on January 1st:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1LwZvy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hlNIbyS3bsA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MZ2oHl"&gt;Whittaker’s only hint for Whovians: she’s most looking forward to “some incredible interactions with old monsters,” too. We don’t have a release date for Series 13 yet, just that it’ll be out later this year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750546/hbo-max-doctor-who-exclusive-streaming-the-office-luther-top-gear-att-warnermedia"&gt;likely exclusively streaming on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; and BBC America in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Banned brand Aukey is still selling earbuds on Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UjAJLvtD_xo9pL848lAjvWoyGXQ=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69630141/aukey_key_series.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zMGP3E"&gt;When Amazon started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow"&gt;cracking down on mobile electronics companies&lt;/a&gt; with shady reviewer programs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"&gt;Aukey and Mpow were the first to get whacked&lt;/a&gt; — and yet Aukey is still selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=key+series&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss"&gt;at least three sets of wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; at the giant online retailer, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9cJh0"&gt;Two weeks ago, I pointed out to Amazon PR that both Aukey and Mpow had seemingly found a way around their bans. Mpow had an “xMpow MFly” set of wireless Bluetooth headphones, and Aukey was selling several different sets under its “Key Series” sub-brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOj7u7"&gt;I’ve been watching their product pages ever since, and today I noticed that &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-xMpow-Bluetooth-Earphones-Headphones/dp/B0924DCSYS?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=7&amp;amp;imprToken=30bd6f5a-5100-ccc2-9ce&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22331571%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the xMpow MFly has disappeared&lt;/a&gt;. But Key Series is alive and well with three products. Aukey appears to be paying Amazon extra to promote them in search, too, as you can see from their “sponsored” disclaimers:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6lwWvAlLczXmTI2wDyT2iCQLKCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22739467/key_series_sponsored.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aukey is paying to promote two of its wireless earbud sets at Amazon despite being thrown off the platform two months ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c9S9R1"&gt;There’s no question that these are Aukey products. You can see the Aukey brand printed on top of the charging case for those EP-N7 earbuds above. Aukey introduced the brand &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aukey-expands-into-premium-audio-with-key-series-300859685.html"&gt;with an official press release&lt;/a&gt; in May 2019, and at least two Key Series products, including these T-10 wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AukeyOfficial/search?query=key%20series"&gt;have YouTube videos on the Aukey channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzuYzS"&gt;It’s vaguely possible that Key Series was spun off, or that these Amazon listings are run by a reseller, though. The Key Series website contains no official references to Aukey, but it does have one mention of a Primtech Limited based in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eJAncC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon-first gadget brands Aukey and Mpow are suddenly, suspiciously disappearing","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"},{"title":"Amazon confirms it removed RavPower, a popular phone battery and charger brand ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536976/amazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon"},{"title":"Another Amazon-first gadget brand has suspiciously vanished: Choetech","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kArOcy"&gt;But it also seems that Key Series had additional products on Amazon that did disappear. Similar to other electronics companies that were booted from Amazon, there are several blank spots &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/97D0F472-35CA-4D44-AA5B-6C48E9EA6459"&gt;on the brand’s Amazon seller page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQxzYp"&gt;Related: I’m still collecting photos of your inserts from Amazon packages, whether they’re suspicious or not. They’ll help me with a future story. If you haven’t already, could you send me pictures of them at sean@theverge.com? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Steam Deck has an ‘optional built-in FPS limiter’ for better battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XsExetckOa06N0-Dw-9yH_i1Nr8=/0x0:1612x1075/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69629946/steam_deck_004.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q63Wmo"&gt;When Valve and &lt;em&gt;IGN &lt;/em&gt;revealed last Thursday &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22589033/valve-steam-deck-pc-screen-performance-target-30hz-gameplay-upgradeable-ssd"&gt;that the new Steam Deck handheld will target 30Hz gameplay&lt;/a&gt;, not everyone was impressed with that low bar — but Valve’s Pierre-Loup Griffais has taken to Twitter to clarify his original comment, and reveal a new feature of the portable console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVQBzT"&gt;First, he says 30 fps is more of a minimum bar than anything else:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KBYpcCItfAxhF48_evd9d5rjMNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22739341/steam_deck_30_fps_clarify.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1419087956535513093" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;@Plagman2 (Twitter)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="obs0EW"&gt;“The ‘30 FPS target’ refers to the floor of what we consider playable in our performance testing; games we’ve tested and shown have consistently met and exceeded that bar so far,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woZ5NN"&gt;In other words, when Griffais &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3HnDR7A8yE"&gt;said in that IGN video interview&lt;/a&gt; that “We haven’t really found something that we could throw at this device that it couldn’t handle,” you shouldn’t take it to mean that every modern game runs at 60 fps. Expect less.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SQrMm0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Valve’s gaming handheld is called the Steam Deck and it’s shipping in December","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"},{"title":"Why the Steam Deck won’t&amp;amp;nbsp;flop&amp;amp;nbsp;like Valve’s Steam Machines","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22579747/valve-steam-deck-steam-machines-editorial"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QvW5pN"&gt;Intriguingly, a 30 fps mode will be something you can proactively turn on to get more battery life, too. “There will also be an optional built-in FPS limiter to fine-tune perf vs. battery life,” he writes. The company’s already said you can play &lt;em&gt;Portal 2 &lt;/em&gt;for up to six hours at 30fps, compared to four hours normally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoXT9E"&gt;Will it be a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; 30 fps mode, though? That’s TBD. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/digitalfoundry/status/1419294155994456073"&gt;In the replies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry’s &lt;/em&gt;Richard Leadbetter says Valve confirmed to him that the Steam Deck doesn’t have a variable-refresh-rate (VRR) screen, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/digitalfoundry/status/1419294962655576066"&gt;and eludes to the idea&lt;/a&gt; that V-sync might wind up creating some nasty frame pacing issues if you try to lock games to 30Hz on the Deck’s screen. (&lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt; would know; it's &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2014-frame-rate-vs-frame-pacing"&gt;covered the issue&lt;/a&gt; many times across PC and console. &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sekiro &lt;/em&gt;developer From Software is &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2019-sekiro-shadows-die-twice-performance-analysis"&gt;notorious for inconsistent frame-pacing&lt;/a&gt;, for example.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WHcVUH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A 30fps setting will be fine for demanding games, but with v-sync active please ensure that a new frame is synchronised with every other screen refresh (typical on consoles) to ensure consistency. 30fps capped but delivered unevenly at 16.7ms/33.3ms/50ms is not a great experience&lt;/p&gt;— Digital Foundry (@digitalfoundry) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/digitalfoundry/status/1419294962655576066?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5TCLyK"&gt;Griffais hasn’t replied yet. We’ll see! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Dune, Star Trek: Prodigy, The Last Duel, Blade Runner: Black Lotus, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4f31d_9ILJbUQFMS7A7YY2I2F34=/253x0:1536x855/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69627924/dune_3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Zendaya and Timothee Chalamet in Dune | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idLGrJh8ybg&amp;amp;t=6s&amp;amp;ab_channel=Legendary" target="_blank"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AQYeNw"&gt;Happy Saturday! Posting the trailers roundup a day early this weekend since I’ll be on vacation starting Sunday (and shout out to the reader who said he preferred when we did the roundup on Saturdays, you got your wish at least for this weekend). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YadSHT"&gt;The internet (or at least the little corner I inhabit) seemed divided into camps this week: people who really like the Apple TV Plus show &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; and people who... don’t. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0la5DBtOVNI&amp;amp;ab_channel=8O8X"&gt;OK to not like things&lt;/a&gt;! I had a longer rant prepared about how the effort to look cool online seems so exhausting but really, who cares, &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; has returned for season two and it’s still a lovely, warm-hearted show about a bunch of very likeable weirdos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A1ofot"&gt;We ended up with a very sci-fi themed roundup this week which was not by design, but happened thanks to several new releases coming out during Comic-Con @ Home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9TWzBA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/idLGrJh8ybg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aD1fMP"&gt;Dune &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3wSgyU"&gt;Beautiful people looking wistfully at each other across sweeping landscapes as the wind tousles their hair— the first few seconds of the &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; trailer almost feel like a perfume commercial. But then we get down to brass tacks and the trailer... pretty much tells you the movie’s entire plot, as my colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587655/dune-new-trailer-hbo-max-warner-bros-sandworm"&gt;Chaim Gartenberg noted in a first look&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, the sandworm makes an appearance. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the much-awaited and oft-delayed &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, starring Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Stellan Skarsgård, Zendaya, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, and Javier Bardem, comes to HBO Max and theaters on October 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uqEUI3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/987jSJZQxTs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vQqAvf"&gt;Star Trek: Prodigy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rUY9YI"&gt;In this new 10-episode series, a group of young aliens steals an abandoned Starfleet vessel called the USS Protostar, and are slowly trained in the ways of the Federation by a hologram version of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Voyager’d &lt;/em&gt;Captain Janeway (with Kate Mulgrew voicing the character she played on the series). &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Prodigy c&lt;/em&gt;omes to Paramount Plus this fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="TFCbWe"&gt;Star Trek: Lower Decks &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hlWVBq"&gt;The popular animated series that pokes fun at &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; lore returns for a second season, following the support crew of the USS Cerritos as they work aboard Starfleet’s least important ship. &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Lower Decks&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/star-trek-lower-decks-renewed-season-three-paramount-season-2-teaser-1234727912/"&gt;already been renewed&lt;/a&gt; for a third season, and while last season took a few episodes to get its footing, the show ended up on a lot of “best of 2020” lists. Season two of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Lower Decks&lt;/em&gt; also debuts on Paramount Plus this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wiiT3o"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id="A0klgq"&gt;The Last Duel &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WzpT9z"&gt;Based on a true story (and a book by Eric Jager), &lt;em&gt;The Last Duel&lt;/em&gt; tells the 14th-century tale of the last judicial trial by combat in France. Jodie Comer (looking very different from &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7016936/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk1"&gt;Eve&lt;/a&gt;) plays Marguerite de Carrouges, wife of knight Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon). She accuses Jacques LeGris (Adam Driver) of rape, which he denies. King Charles VI (Ben Affleck),  grants permission for them to settle things with a duel that will determine who is telling the truth. Oh and if her husband loses the duel, Marguerite gets burned at the stake for bearing false witness. Ridley Scott directed &lt;em&gt;The Last Duel&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters October 15th. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="KGHxFm"&gt;Blade Runner: Black Lotus &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4hrY00"&gt;This is the first trailer for this anime series, just revealed at Comic-Con. &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner: Black Lotus &lt;/em&gt;is set in Los Angeles in 2032— so roughly halfway between the Harrison Ford &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYhJ7Mf2Oxs&amp;amp;ab_channel=WarnerBros.Entertainment"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; movie and the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCcx85zbxz4&amp;amp;ab_channel=WarnerBros.Pictures"&gt;Ryan Gosling sequel&lt;/a&gt;. A replicant named Elle (Jessica Henwick in the English-language version and Arisa Shida in the Japanese-language version) aka Black Lotus, has special powers and is being chased by some scary people. Directed by Shinji Aramaki and Kenji Kamiyama, the English version of &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner: Black Lotus &lt;/em&gt;comes to Adult Swim and the Japanese version comes to Crunchyroll this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5dkEUI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tU9NhwYKCLM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kXwnoE"&gt;UFO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0cce1f"&gt;JJ Abrams is executive producer on this four-part documentary series that according to Showtime will explore “unsettling theories of a subject that recently reached national headlines,” namely a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html"&gt;2017 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; about a secret UFO program at the Department of Defense. &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt; debuts on Showtime August 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sHYXa6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNb51OwYO6M?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YTsnz2"&gt;Bonus: Doctor Who &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nKdTr4"&gt;Good luck deciphering any details from this teaser trailer, which manages to repeat itself within the course of a single minute — or does it? Perhaps repetition is the point and it’s trying to tell us something about a time loop. Either way, it’s our first look at &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt;’s thirteenth season and Jodie Whittaker’s latest outing, and showrunner Chris Chibnall &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/25/22593232/doctor-who-series-13-teaser-trailer-story"&gt;says its eight episodes will serve as chapters of a single story&lt;/a&gt; this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEkckx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, July 25th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Doctor Who.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood’s IPO roadshow answered questions I wasn’t asking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KVjJ3R1stBLgtxdaAVx0ZNEXCcU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69627752/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DoOOJs"&gt;“What’s your favorite planet?” is a real question that Robinhood execs really picked to answer during the Q&amp;amp;A section of its retail investor roadshow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lj2TJB"&gt;“Definitely Pluto,” says long-haired CEO Vlad Tenev. He is having a good time. He goes on to explain that there will be a great view of Venus tonight after sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FJc0dQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first meme IPO&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I7CkXc"&gt;Many of the questions the management picked have been lackluster; asked if Robinhood will add a customer support line, Tenev cheerily explains there already is one. Another question is wasted on whether the stock will pay dividends — anyone who &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021013986/robinhoods-1a1.htm"&gt;read the prospectus&lt;/a&gt; knows the answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjNXJJ"&gt;I am watching this roadshow — my first, and the first, I suspect, of many who are watching — because Robinhood plans to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/technology/robinhood-ipo.html"&gt;sell as much as a third of its IPO&lt;/a&gt; to its users. The roadshow is part of a plan to put retail investors on an “equal footing” (per the prospectus) with institutional investors. At the top of the presentation, I’m told that this is basically the same set of materials institutional investors get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdA2Rp"&gt;And why am I spending my Saturday on this? Well, it’s going to be the first meme IPO. And if this works, other companies may choose to boost the proportion of their shares they allocate to retail investors, says Pitchbook’s Robert Le, a senior analyst. Most IPOs allocate only 1 percent to 3 percent of their shares to retail investors, he says. If Robinhood ends its first day of trading higher than where it started, other companies may follow in its footsteps. However, if the stock trends down, institutional investors may steer clear of IPOs that include a large chunk of retail traders, Le says in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDTiK9"&gt;Robinhood hasn’t offered its investors IPO access before, and that concerns David Erickson, who was co-head of global equity capital markets at Barclays until he retired in 2013. (He is now a lecturer at &lt;a href="https://fnce.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/davider/"&gt;Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;.) “They don’t have the best internal controls,” Erickson says in an interview, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21163048/robinhood-outages-major-2-days-leap-year-investing"&gt;pointing to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market"&gt;Robinhood’s history&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388447/robinhood-app-dogecoin-rally-failed-trades"&gt;of outages&lt;/a&gt;. “For a company supposed to be in the business of keeping your money secure, they aren’t necessarily doing a good job of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eupHew"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There were real, substantive questions eventually&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ykfcso"&gt;During the roadshow, Tenev, his cofounder Baiju Bhatt — who is also rocking some lustrous locks  — and CFO Jason Warnick appear to be in an expensive and uncomfortable facsimile of a living room. They are seated on a white couch, with random wooden slats behind them; plants hang from the slats. In front of them, there are small wooden tables. Bhatt and Warnick are clearly reading from teleprompters. Many speakers featured on the call wore a pin of Robinhood’s feather logo — but not Tenev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLSpNt"&gt;There were real, substantive questions eventually. Though Robinhood doesn’t give a timeline, it is apparently working on creating wallets for its cryptocurrency users, allowing them to transfer in their crypto from elsewhere. Eventually there will be a beta, but because it’s impossible to recover cryptocurrency if it’s been handled wrong, Robinhood is proceeding slowly, Tenev says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3Ule2"&gt;And as for payment for order flow, which makes up 81 percent of the first quarter revenue in 2021, Robinhood plans to work with regulators to answer concerns. This sounds suspiciously like Robinhood is planning to lobby — and it may also explain the&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/robinhood-hires-ex-regulators-to-help-address-compliance-issues?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt; former SEC employees hired at Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;. As for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;angry meme stock customers&lt;/a&gt; that might leave? Tenev dodges the question. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419159/robinhood-dogecoin-outage-crypto-trading-crash"&gt;Outages&lt;/a&gt;? Well, Robinhood says it’s investing resources to create redundancies so they won’t keep happening. (We’ll see!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esPCRu"&gt;The most interesting remarks are saved for the end. First, Robinhood is considering IRAs and Roth IRAs, two types of retirement accounts, as products it may offer. (Whether people want to save for retirement on their&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-07-02/robinhood-ipo-filing-is-a-lesson-in-meme-finance-kqmkzfxc"&gt; fun gambling app&lt;/a&gt; is an open question, but sure!) Second,  Robinhood thinks that retail investors are in the market to stay; it’s working to diversify by building out Robinhood Gold, its paid product, as well as cash management, more cryptocurrency offerings and fully paid securities lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRszvA"&gt;There is one notable omission in the roadshow. Despite its lovey-dovey mission statement about democratizing finance, the founders’ Class B stock gets 10 votes per share, while IPO investors’ Class A stock gets just one vote per share. Erickson, the Wharton lecturer, doesn’t like that, either. “This one bothers me like WeWork bothered me,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM, Cruise suing to stop Ford from using the name ‘BlueCruise’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gHy1hBQijfmfdYI27WuMciJCPns=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69627021/acastro_200406_1777_ford_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;GM is suing Ford over the BlueCruise name for its hands-free driving system | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2D5VZi"&gt;General Motors has filed a lawsuit to try to prevent Ford from using the name “BlueCruise” for the hands-free driving feature it announced earlier this year. First reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2021/07/24/gm-sues-ford-claiming-trademark-infringement-over-bluecruise-hands-free-name/8079309002/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detroit Free Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, GM claims the name is too close Super Cruise, the name of is own hands-free driving technology introduced in 2017, and to its autonomous vehicle subsidiary Cruise. GM is suing Ford for trademark infringement and unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1JoMT"&gt;In the lawsuit filed Friday, GM said in that the companies had been involved in “protracted discussions” over the name but were unable to resolve the matter. “Ford knew exactly what it was doing,” GM alleges in its complaint, adding that if Ford “wanted to adopt a new, unique brand, it easily could have done so without using the word ‘Cruise.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ6AWb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383460/ford-bluecruise-hands-free-adas-f150-mustang-mache"&gt;Ford announced BlueCruise as the name&lt;/a&gt; for its hands-free driver assist system in April, and said it would begin pushing the feature via an over-the-air software updates to select vehicles later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HyCP9"&gt;GM didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday. The company told the &lt;em&gt;Free Press&lt;/em&gt; that it would have preferred to resolve the situation amicably but was “left with no choice but to vigorously defend our brands and protect the equity our products and technology have earned over several years in the market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMfy1J"&gt;A Ford spokesperson called GM’s Cruise claim “meritless and frivolous,” in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying that cruise control is a well-known term. “Every automaker offers it, and ‘cruise’ is common shorthand for the capability. That’s why BlueCruise was chosen as the name for the Blue Oval’s next evolution of Ford’s Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control,” the spokesperson added (the “Blue Oval” refers to Ford’s logo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmcSQ9"&gt;Indeed, there are several other automakers who use the word “cruise” to describe their hands-free driving features, including Hyundai’s Smart Cruise Control, and BMW’s Active Cruise Control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4skXp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New job posting shows Amazon seeking a digital currency and blockchain expert</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T219TlBo7rGI4aDkXuKMG4f93EA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69626712/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon may be testing the cryptocurrency waters | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GNPvkV"&gt;Amazon is hiring a digital currency and blockchain product lead for its payments team, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1644513/digital-currency-and-blockchain-product-lead"&gt;new job listing&lt;/a&gt;. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-cryptocurrency-seeks-new-blockchain-leader-customers-payments-ecommerce-2021-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the ecommerce giant is looking for an “experienced product leader to develop Amazon’s Digital Currency and Blockchain strategy and product roadmap.” The listing, which Amazon has confirmed is legitimate, continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="E2ZC8R"&gt;You will leverage your domain expertise in Blockchain, Distributed Ledger, Central Bank Digital Currencies and Cryptocurrency to develop the case for the capabilities which should be developed, drive overall vision and product strategy, and gain leadership buy-in and investment for new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="F8Fxv7"&gt;Amazon.com doesn’t accept cryptocurrency as payment, but a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that the company was “inspired by the innovation happening in the cryptocurrency space and are exploring what this could look like on Amazon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZP2RrZ"&gt;Amazon’s cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already has a &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/"&gt;managed blockchain&lt;/a&gt; service. But CEO Andy Jassy said in 2017 when he was head of the AWS division that the company was “watching” the space  but that Amazon didn’t see “a lot of practical use cases for blockchain that are much broader than using a distributed ledger,” &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/aws-not-buying-into-the-blockchain-hype/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; at the time. That would appear to be changing if this new listing is any indication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koPjir"&gt;Apple posted a &lt;a href="https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200247094/business-development-manager-alternative-payments?team=MKTG"&gt;similar listing&lt;/a&gt; in May for a business development manager for “alternative payments,” and among the key qualifications for the role was five years of experience “working in or with alternative payment providers, such as digital wallets, BNPL, Fast Payments, cryptocurrency and etc.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpTjDj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6K9zQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
