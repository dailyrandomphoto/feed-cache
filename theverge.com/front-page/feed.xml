    <title>What exactly is the Jodorowsky’s Dune crypto collective trying to make, anyway?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dune script bible" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iIK9gx0CDZNJjmauNF7PW69dfeg=/0x40:1066x751/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70400950/FJKO3wxXoAMGhVE.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/TheSpiceDAO/status/1482404318347153413" target="_blank"&gt;Spice DAO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9gmQnq"&gt;Last year, a collective of cryptocurrency fans &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/amansethi/spicedao-dunedao-soby"&gt;pooled millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; to buy a copy of the story bible for director Alejandro Jodorowsky’s legendary never-made adaptation of the novel &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;. After winning a November auction, the group &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@spicedao/spice-dao-is-being-unlocked-514a8de9ef29"&gt;voted last week&lt;/a&gt; on a direction for the project and got &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/cryptobros-spend-millions-rare-jodorowsky-dune-book-copyright-analysis?utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1642424689-1"&gt;promptly roasted online&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly not understanding what they’d bought. Their plans included an animated series inspired by Jodorowsky’s &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, and as any good collector likely knows, buying a commemorative copy of a script or storyboard doesn’t give you the right to shoot your own version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0CtzB"&gt;The actual situation seems more ambiguous than some critics are suggesting. The &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;story bible’s owners, known as Spice DAO (short for “decentralized autonomous organization”), appear perfectly aware they don’t own &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;itself&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Instead, they’re committing to an original series “inspired by” the book. The whole scheme might help illustrate why art can’t be reduced to a neat series of copyright licenses — rather than simply showing that &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/turns-out-the-crypto-bros-who-bought-jodorowskys-dune-b-1848371833?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;amp;utm_content=gizmodo"&gt;“crypto bros aren’t sure how rights work.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68mRZh"&gt;That said, a lot of them probably aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rBbX8Q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We won the auction for €2.66M. Now our mission is to:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Make the book public (to the extent permitted by law) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Produce an original animated limited series inspired by the book and sell it to a streaming service&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Support derivative projects from the community &lt;a href="https://t.co/g4QnF6YZBp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/g4QnF6YZBp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spice DAO ( , ) (@TheSpiceDAO) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheSpiceDAO/status/1482404318347153413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 15, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gKimRM"&gt;Spice DAO outlined its future plans in an &lt;a href="https://snapshot.org/#/dunedao.eth/proposal/0x2038fc240d0e85c496cc692d0001fb159d6f613b546392aa96e49a3b752ced0d"&gt;inaugural governance proposal&lt;/a&gt; that was approved by 95 percent of token-holding voters. In addition to electing a four-person core management team, it commits the DAO to a set of four goals between January and March of 2022: “gain physical custody of Jodorowsky’s Dune book by arranging shipping and storage,” scan every page of the book, hire a social media agency, and “present a film treatment and budget by Roble Ridge Productions for the original animated limited series inspired by the book for a community vote.” (The series was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheSpiceDAO/status/1474063388368064512"&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt; in December.) On Twitter, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheSpiceDAO/status/1482404318347153413"&gt;Spice DAO noted&lt;/a&gt; that it planned to “sell it to a streaming service” in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OLldo1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Buying Dune’s script doesn’t give you the copyright — but it earns you lots of publicity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UqR5NP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/turns-out-the-crypto-bros-who-bought-jodorowskys-dune-b-1848371833?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;amp;utm_content=gizmodo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/cryptobros-spend-millions-rare-jodorowsky-dune-book-copyright-analysis?utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1642424689-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Next Web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and some &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/garybrannan/status/1482866885989478411"&gt;Twitter critics&lt;/a&gt; have interpreted this as Spice DAO believing that they’ve acquired the rights to “make their own &lt;em&gt;Dune.&lt;/em&gt;” But as &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; notes, the group has &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@spicedao/spice-dao-next-steps-187ebd3e5600"&gt;acknowledged they don’t own&lt;/a&gt; the intellectual property behind &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, and the term “original” typically refers to something that’s not officially part of an existing IP franchise. In other words, it sounds like the script team wants to follow in the footsteps of Jodorowsky, who reworked several of his additions to Frank Herbert’s &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; novel into an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22764087/taika-waititi-alejandro-jodorowsky-the-incal-comic-graphic-novel-movie"&gt;original comic series called &lt;em&gt;The Incal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As Spice DAO has put it, “while we do not own the IP to Frank Herbert’s masterpiece, we are uniquely positioned with the opportunity to create our own addition to the genre as an homage to the giants who came before us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KEDtu"&gt;Spice DAO obviously wouldn’t need to own a copy of the &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; bible to make a &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;-like series that wasn’t explicitly derived from Jodorowsky’s work. But I haven’t seen public statements indicating that the central parties involved believe otherwise. From the outside, the auction purchase looks plausibly like a publicity and funding strategy, not a botched attempt to buy a copyright. After all, anybody can write a script indirectly inspired by Jodorowsky’s &lt;em&gt;Dune — &lt;/em&gt;if you want &lt;em&gt;yours&lt;/em&gt; to get noticed, hooking up with a group of fans to purchase a rare collector’s item isn’t a bad gambit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmWivi"&gt;It’s unfortunately hard to tell how many people backing Spice DAO are on the same page about what they’re funding. &lt;a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/the-anime-dune-dao-learns-about-copyright"&gt;Ryan Broderick’s &lt;em&gt;Garbage Day&lt;/em&gt; newsletter, for instance, outlines&lt;/a&gt; some significant confusion around voting, copyright, and what “adapting” the script should mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twE4bJ"&gt;And the DAO itself is fairly reticent to clarify what it’s making. I reached out via Twitter to ask whether the governance proposal referred to a series that was explicitly based on &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; or one that was indirectly inspired by it — and if it was the latter, whether it would still be advertised as “inspired by Jodorowsky’s &lt;em&gt;Dune.” &lt;/em&gt;(This would almost certainly antagonize the various parties who own the &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; franchise, even if the underlying series wasn’t infringing on their copyright.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22lHPn"&gt;“Why would we share with you before we share with community?”, the Twitter account responded. A followup message wasn’t answered, so it remains unclear whether the account was simply declining to comment, or whether Spice DAO community members haven’t been told definitively whether they’re getting a &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; series or simply a &lt;em&gt;Dune-&lt;/em&gt;flavored series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NNKcI"&gt;There’s a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22785051/nft-collectibles-intellectual-property-decentralized-disney"&gt;real confusion over crypto and copyright&lt;/a&gt;, and a lot of projects are legitimately bad at explaining what crypto “ownership” gets you. You should also probably keep your expectations in check for a Spice DAO series. Making an animated miniseries is a somewhat tougher deliverable than mailing a book, and the DAO is arguably glossing over a lot of real legal challenges it would face even with an original script. A lot of intellectual property law is about might, not right — so if a bigger studio wants to shut down something that looks and sounds too much like &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, even a careful and competent team could face a long court battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KN0bVn"&gt;But lots of creative projects start with artists building on a favorite book or movie, whether or not they use systems like a DAO. Let’s not encourage the all-too-common assumption that people can only do this if they buy permission — even if the people we’re talking about are crypto bros.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Over 30 Activision Blizzard employees have ‘exited’ since July, WSJ reports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sptEMZa8N0DB4UIEPEB8eKIPej0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70400383/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G3FMiG"&gt;37 Activision Blizzard employees have reportedly “exited” the company since July of last year as part of the company’s attempt to crack down on issues surrounding sexual harassment, according to internal documents obtained by the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-blizzard-pushes-out-dozens-of-employees-over-workplace-misconduct-11642428001"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;). Activision Blizzard spokesperson Helaine Klasky also told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that 44 individuals were disciplined in connection with workplace misconduct allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6EIB47"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kotick reportedly didn’t want to release this information for fear of making the situation seem worse&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4IPZTV"&gt;These numbers likely include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735413/activision-blizzard-employee-terminations-harassment-discrimination"&gt;the more than 20 workers that exited the company&lt;/a&gt; in October, along with around 20 workers who the company reprimanded at the time. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; also notes that Activision Blizzard collected around 700 employee complaints describing concerns about workplace misconduct. Activision Blizzard was reportedly set to release a report summarizing the results of its ongoing investigation towards the end of last year, but &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reports that CEO Bobby Kotick refused, saying it would amplify the company’s issues and make them seem worse than they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oq0K0V"&gt;“Across Activision Blizzard, our team is working tirelessly so that every employee feels safe, equal, heard and empowered,” Activision Blizzard spokesperson Rich George told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Whether a comment about culture, an incident or suggested improvements, every single report that the company receives matters, and we have significantly increased the resources available to ensure that we can quickly and thoroughly look into each one.” George also confirmed that the company has completed reviews of over 90 percent of employee reports since July, and describes Kotick’s alleged refusal to release this information as “inaccurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcOBFl"&gt;Last July, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) sued Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; for promoting a culture of “constant sexual harassment.” Since then, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602655/activision-blizzard-employees-accusations-allegations-lawsuit"&gt;numerous employees have come forward&lt;/a&gt; with their own experiences with sexual misconduct at the company, alleging that management was aware of and potentially encouraged the behavior. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697341/us-eeoc-sues-activision-blizzard-sexual-harassment-discrimination"&gt;reached an $18 million settlement with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&lt;/a&gt; in September, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/7/22872861/california-dfeh-appeals-decision-activision-blizzard-settlement-eeoc"&gt;DFEH has recently appealed the judge’s decision that prevents it from intervening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57bfCi"&gt;Kotick has also been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;personally accused of abusive behavior&lt;/a&gt; in November, and despite this, the company’s board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785776/activision-blizzard-board-statement-ceo-bobby-kotick"&gt;still expressed confidence in his leadership&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789679/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-employees-petition-removal"&gt;over 1,500 employees signed a petition&lt;/a&gt; to remove Kotick as CEO, who only said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/21/22795286/activision-ceo-bobby-kotick-is-not-resigning-yet"&gt;he would consider stepping down&lt;/a&gt; if the company’s toxic work culture couldn’t be fixed “with speed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGqCWv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Casey Wasserman is on the board of directors for Activision Blizzard as well as the board of directors of Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqy6hX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 17th 4:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a statement and additional context received from an Activision Blizzard spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Awesome Games Done Quick speedrun raises $3.4 million for charity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OivbpHwkOax-2tfsEO7FyeKMYQ4=/90x0:2790x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70399971/awesome_games_done_quick_charity_stream.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Mitchriz speedruns Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice while blindfolded at AGDQ 2022. | Screenshot: Games Done Quick via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQeeRBtQgzE" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6epKJd"&gt;Games Done Quick has raised $3.4 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation at its annual video game speedrunning event, Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ), the most money ever raised at a single Games Done Quick event (via &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/awesome-games-done-quick-2022-sets-a-new-record-by-raising-over-34-million-for-charity-agdq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUodx5"&gt;The organization, which holds two flagship speedrunning events for charity every year, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GamesDoneQuick/status/1482609194263990275?s=20"&gt;announced its success on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the most money Games Done Quick has ever raised, and also the &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/awesome-games-done-quick-2022-agdq-1-million-record/"&gt;fastest the organization has ever reached $1 million in donations&lt;/a&gt;. As noted on &lt;a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/event/AGDQ2022"&gt;AGDQ’s tracker&lt;/a&gt;, the event showcased a total of 149 speedruns and received 49,482 donations from 28,073 different people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFR9Vd"&gt;AGDQ 2022 was livestreamed on Twitch from January 9th to January 16th and featured some of the world’s most talented speedrunners who broke some records of their own. InsertLogic completed &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8oAAqwJjwI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kena: Bridge of Spirits&lt;/em&gt; in 28:35&lt;/a&gt;, ShadowthePast ran &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Fa0xZoqcXs4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Webbed&lt;/em&gt; in 17:21&lt;/a&gt;, and Jaxler beat &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8sDx2IG5PU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pumpkin Jack&lt;/em&gt; in 53:17&lt;/a&gt;, all shattering previous world records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ETjJEi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;While we are already well on our way in the Sekiro blindfolded run, we still cannot get over this Burning Bull fight. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AGDQ2022?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AGDQ2022&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/R5NQasxo6Q"&gt;pic.twitter.com/R5NQasxo6Q&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Games Done Quick (@GamesDoneQuick) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GamesDoneQuick/status/1482513904144195586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 16, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BD8b9E"&gt;In a particularly high-profile stunt, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/FQeeRBtQgzE"&gt;Mitchriz ran through the notoriously difficult &lt;em&gt;Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;em&gt;blindfolded,&lt;/em&gt; completing the game using only auditory cues in just over two hours. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22601910/sekiro-blindfolded-speedrun-twitch"&gt;This isn’t Mitchriz’s first attempt&lt;/a&gt; at completing the game while blindfolded; he &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/g4EZvXfwDD0"&gt;beat the game in a little under two hours&lt;/a&gt; during a livestream in December. Chinese speedrunner, Just Blind, holds the record for the &lt;a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1T44y1E7tV?p"&gt;fastest &lt;em&gt;Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice&lt;/em&gt; speedrun at 1:42&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdJopV"&gt;The next Games Done Quick fundraising event, &lt;a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/framefatales"&gt;Frost Fatales&lt;/a&gt;, is set to take place from February 27th to March 5th. It’s an all-women speedrunning event that will raise money for the Malala Fund, a charity that aims to give young girls across the world access to education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bW3YRa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 17th 12:25PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to clarify that Games Done Quick holds two flagship events each year, in addition to other events in between.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spain will regulate influencers promoting cryptocurrency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G2RVxISKC2y7-3vsZ7D4votimck=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70399920/jbareham_180313_1777_bitcoin_cryptocurrency_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OcrZ1H"&gt;Spain has announced new rules for how social media influencers and others can advertise cryptocurrency assets, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/spain-moves-rein-crypto-asset-advertising-2022-01-17/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Starting next month, the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) will require people and companies to notify it at least 10 days before running campaigns for crypto assets. The rules apply to influencers with more than 100,000 subscribers who are paid to promote cryptocurrency — a practice that’s drawn criticism and even lawsuits worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ahl50g"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, crypto advertisers will need to release the content of their upcoming campaigns to the CNMV, and they must include warnings about the risks of what they’re selling. The rules are designed to let the CNMV monitor the marketing ecosystem around crypto assets and make sure audiences are aware of risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87uTT6"&gt;The CNMV has previously used social media to throw cold water on crypto hype. In November it &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/25/soccer-star-andres-iniesta-warned-by-spanish-regulator-after-promoting-binance/"&gt;replied to a tweet&lt;/a&gt; from professional soccer player Andrés Iniesta after he enthusiastically promoted the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, warning him that “cryptoassets, being unregulated products, carry some significant risks.” (It was unclear whether Iniesta had been paid for his promotion.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kF9NdI"&gt;Cryptocurrency and social media advertising are both areas with significant regulatory ambiguity, and the combination has sometimes proven troublesome. Earlier this month, a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/kim-kardashian-sued-for-promoting-alleged-cryptocurrenc-1848339180"&gt;proposed class action suit targeted&lt;/a&gt; Kim Kardashian, boxer Floyd Mayweather, and others for promoting the currency EthereumMax — raising its price dramatically before the asset crashed into near worthlessness. The CNMV’s new rules won’t stop influencers from telling their followers about cryptocurrency, but they’ll let the agency keep closer tabs on what exactly is being offered.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>For veteran Final Fantasy XIV fans Endwalker has been a loving thank you note</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KgXqVJoAMKm2PsnvxtzzdTblyXw=/117x0:1383x844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70399844/969a2549f365bd156803bcd048118ec7.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3QQkLU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; signifies the end of an era. One story, started nine years ago, has ended with a stunning and heartwarming conclusion, while the promise of a new adventure awaits on the horizon. But &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t merely mark the end of the Hydaelyn / Zodiark saga. For a few diehard players, &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; also provides a final coda for the game &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; was before it was rebooted into &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrY20d"&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV Online&lt;/em&gt; — colloquially known as “1.0” — had a rough release. &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-online-review/1900-6280901/#comments-block-32433528"&gt;Reviews at the time&lt;/a&gt; said the game “lacked character, cohesion, and joy” and lamented its every feature from the UI to the storytelling. The one thing Tatjana Vejnovic remembers of 1.0 was “[h]ow un-fucking-playable it was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Er4w9T"&gt;“Everything loaded in super slow, and it was laggy as all hell,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQwUYY"&gt;Lag was one of the foremost complaints of 1.0 players. While the game was visually impressive for the time, the developers sacrificed performance for aesthetics. During 2014’s Game Developers Conference, Naoki Yoshida, game director of &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1020796/Behind-the-Realm"&gt;talked about&lt;/a&gt; some of the things that went wrong with 1.0, &lt;a href="https://archive.fo/ouXRb"&gt;citing specifically&lt;/a&gt; Square Enix’s overreliance on delivering a pretty game at the cost of performance and content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KXskTa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Everything loaded in super slow, and it was laggy as all hell.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FT4DGX"&gt;Jake Dehlinger recalled being very disappointed in 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zwrTYu"&gt;“I spent my middle school years playing &lt;em&gt;FFXI &lt;/em&gt;with my friend (shout out to Raphiell!), and we planned to play &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt; together,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The experience was super underwhelming, and I didn’t last very long playing it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOmmWn"&gt;Dylan Fitzgerald remembered his time more fondly recalling some of the interesting bits of the game’s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyu5zu"&gt;“Did you know failing to affix materia to a piece of gear used to blow up the entire item? Or that conjurer at one point had fire, blizzard, and thunder spells in addition to the earth, wind, and water they have now? While it was obviously a mess, I did still have a lot of fun with 1.0, in no small part to the community that stuck around after most people jumped ship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8hhLR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV 1.0&lt;/em&gt; released in September 2010 and lasted two years before Square Enix killed the game &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/YgEg8kXmifo"&gt;in a fiery conflagration&lt;/a&gt;, thereby setting the stage for its phoenix-like rise from the ashes. Yoshida said in his GDC talk that Square Enix kept the name &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; in order to regain the trust of fans, and while some elements of 1.0 were carried forward, &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt; is essentially a totally different game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZXSqF"&gt;The battle system was revamped, and more classic &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; jobs were added. The main story quest was significantly improved, and graphical updates were more balanced. The game was and is still relentlessly pretty, but your system won’t chug when loading a flower pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxpf9D"&gt;“ARR was a success in my mind,” Dehlinger said. “It made me feel like I had a game where the story actually mattered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6kGE8"&gt;Though 1.0 ended with Square Enix literally blowing up the world, &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s story still took time to acknowledge the journey 1.0 players made from those rough early days to now. Veteran players noticed and respected &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s homages to 1.0, including one that is a direct, almost shot-for-shot remake of a 1.0 intro quest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vjvdXy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cqjqne1I-94?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ucOsqa"&gt;“I think they pulled off the ending as elegantly as they could for something with such a troubled start that had been going on for so long,” Fitzgerald said. “I absolutely felt a sense of closure by the time all was said and done, and &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; inspired me to finally get my character’s legacy mark tattooed on my own body.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpuZRQ"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=legacy+mark+ffxiv&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS916US916&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjr6drRiLL1AhWyKX0KHacSB90Q_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;amp;biw=1920&amp;amp;bih=872&amp;amp;dpr=1"&gt;Legacy marks&lt;/a&gt; were a special in-game cosmetic given to players who subscribed during 1.0 and subscribed again to &lt;em&gt;ARR&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tbvgi0"&gt;In Yoshida’s GDC talk, he said that one of the key takeaways from 1.0 was to “never forget your roots.” &lt;em&gt;FFXIV &lt;/em&gt;1.0 shut down in 2012, and there have been several expansions between the &lt;em&gt;ARR&lt;/em&gt; reboot and now, but you can still see the roots of 1.0 embedded in &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;. “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/h542YbZuwkQ"&gt;Answers&lt;/a&gt;,” the song that so neatly summarizes &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s plot, was written by Nobuo Uematsu for 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBTeQZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSysIC"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt;’s team never forgets characters and storylines,” Dehlinger said. “Watching &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; bring back and tie up so much story in such a beautiful way left me extremely satisfied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFcI4c"&gt;It’s rare that a video game can pull itself out of a terminal velocity tailspin. &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; 1.0 was so bad that Yoshida said in his GDC presentation that it hindered Japanese MMO development. It would have perhaps been easier or even expected for 1.0 to die the death it did without remark. But&lt;em&gt; Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; is a game with a long memory in a space where it seems like sequels and spinoffs, video game or otherwise, don’t like to acknowledge where they came from. Though &lt;em&gt;ARR&lt;/em&gt; and the subsequent expansions are games that dramatically changed the trajectory of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;’s legacy, 1.0 laid the foundation on which all of what fans love about &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt; now sits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vjpwh5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s favorite tools to stay organized</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The overflow pile includes review devices, sensors, and an Echo Show 8." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PkaaKd3aW8ozCd3TwpPug41zjMg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70399675/dseifert_20210415_4535_0017.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J6gNu7"&gt;Life these days can be very complicated, and many of us — I’d guess that most of us — are constantly looking for the best method to keep our lives in order. What do you need on your grocery list? When is that work project due, and who is working on it with you? A friend wants to do a movie-watching session, but is that the same day you promised your parents to help clean the garage? Which bills are due, and can you afford to pay them all? Where is that article about which masks to wear? And on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wlJzbE"&gt;So we decided to start off 2022 by asking the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; what they use to keep track of all their appointments / tasks / projects / workflows. And it turned out that they use a variety of different apps or some fairly old-fashioned paper-and-pen solutions — or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpXCGN"&gt;If you’re finding that this year is turning out to be a confusing one, and you need a way to try to keep your life and your sanity in order, here are some methods that we use. We hope they are helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="S8hqYA"&gt;A notebook&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Leuchtturm 1917 notebooks" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tDcCdoEi0zQFbeSmKBRjfg67w7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23169716/notebook_classic.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Leuchtturm&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leuchtturm1917 notebooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0yN1tn"&gt;Get a notebook. You do not need tech for this. In fact, keeping track of yourself is much easier if you aren’t using tech designed for someone else. You know why? Only you operate your brain. You are much more likely to design a system you will use than someone else is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYELgk"&gt;You will need a pencil or a pen. You can get wild and buy markers and a ruler. Personally, I like markers because I like &lt;em&gt;color&lt;/em&gt;, but this is your notebook, so you should follow your heart. Now you are going to experiment. Are you a monster who operates her life through jerry-rigged to-do lists? Great. Make some to-do lists. Do you want to track stuff using Bullet Journal layouts? Great. Do that. Do you just want to write down your feelings before you talk to someone about them? Brainstorm on a task? Whatever? Great news! There is a blank piece of paper, &lt;em&gt;and it can be whatever you want it to be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8QA4T"&gt;You do not need to buy an expensive notebook, though I like them because they make me feel fancy, and &lt;a href="https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/notebooks/?filters%5B17847%5D%5B%5D=9901&amp;amp;filters%5B17846%5D%5B%5D=19294"&gt;the paper is nice to touch&lt;/a&gt;. Still, my oldest notebooks are cheapo, nasty spiral-bound ruled paper I bought at the drugstore for under a dollar. The point is not the tools you are using. The point is that you are using something &lt;em&gt;that works for your own brain.&lt;/em&gt; Glad we had this talk. — &lt;em&gt;Elizabeth Lopatto, deputy editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vrdtKh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10978638" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uRT3DH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/personal"&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Notion" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fd--oCjbxaXC1MAZozBXIRdN4bE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23167344/Screen_Shot_2022_01_13_at_5.26.52_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mG3jvW"&gt;I’ve always had a not-so-great memory, and as a result, throughout most of my career, I’ve gone through I-don’t-know how many different apps for keeping track of what I have to do. I need something I can consult to track projects, remind myself of who owes me an article, which articles I promised to write or edit, what how-tos I swore I would take on next, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVSyHp"&gt;As a result, while I appreciate (and sometimes use) simple note-taking apps such as &lt;a href="https://keep.google.com/"&gt;Google Keep&lt;/a&gt; or reminders such as &lt;a href="https://ticktick.com/"&gt;TickTick&lt;/a&gt;, I love experimenting with more complex task managers. (Remind me sometime to rant about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecco_Pro"&gt;Ecco Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a wonderfully flexible outliner / database back in the ’90s that was eventually acquired by another company and immediately abandoned, dammit.) Currently, my go-to for trying to maintain all my various projects is Notion. I’m sure I haven’t learned 50 percent of the various ways one can use it. But it lets me nest pages inside pages inside pages; create outlines and to-do lists and on-the-fly notes; and, most importantly, add reminders and links so that I don’t let important things drop under my radar.&lt;em&gt; — Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gPHPgn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://todoist.com/app"&gt;Todoist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Todoist" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TUTQltDCaa4p2vPPKEKRya_8hec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23167233/chrome_extension_2x.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Doist&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Todoist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sWaNTH"&gt;Todoist — namely, the Chrome plug-in — has been my ride-or-die daily organizational app for years now. The free version that I use is very basic but does exactly what I need it to: allow me to add items to my daily checklist and cross them off as I get things done. The “crossing things off when I’m done” is essential because I am an elder millennial, and I require affirmation that I’m doing things right. Favorite features in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eM9VqT"&gt;Drag and drop tasks from one day to another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WssLA6"&gt;The ability to add a website as a task for stuff I want to read later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GYqY1M"&gt;Priority flags that you can add to tasks and then ignore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="377PQ3"&gt;Move a task to tomorrow’s list with one click&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="L6nJ0k"&gt;It doesn’t do everything — I need a separate tool for long-term planning — but it is a lifesaver for daily priorities. And I swear it used to display a pleasant little sunset graphic when you emptied your checklist for the day, which was very gratifying. It doesn’t do that anymore, and I miss it. &lt;em&gt;— Allison Johnson, reviewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aPIHvY"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reminders/id1108187841"&gt;Apple’s Reminders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ticktick.com/"&gt;TickTick&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Reminders" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/adV1uKOmELLlYelzCzeEtDy4dhA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23167239/Screen_Shot_2022_01_13_at_4.46.21_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reminders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VovlY4"&gt;I use two apps to keep track of my to-dos: Apple’s Reminders app for personal tasks and TickTick for work tasks. I like Reminders because it integrates well across Apple’s device ecosystem (which I am in), and it allows my wife and I to easily make shared reminders if needed. I like TickTick for work because it’s easy to add tasks and because it sits unobtrusively in my menu bar. Keeping tasks across two different apps isn’t the most efficient process, but it helps me keep a better separation between personal and work stuff. &lt;em&gt;— Jay Peters, news writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gkdXQl"&gt;Fountain pens&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lamy Safari fountain pen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5wKGsrp6XBqrmoiM_R5wq-lTg1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23167246/LamySafariPen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lamy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lamy Safari fountain pen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vqcOe8"&gt;I have to piggyback off Liz a little because I’ve tried digital solutions to organize myself, yet I often come back to pen and paper. I’m more focused when taking a moment to jot something down, whether it’s making a to-do list and outline in my notebook or creating a down-to-the-minute morning routine on an index card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTFB71"&gt;I channel my obsessively geeky tendencies into my choice of writing instrument. I got into fountain pens years ago, and I’ve picked up a bunch that I love using. They motivate me to take personal notes, get organized, and plan out my day — because I just like writing with these pens, even when it’s only a few words and a checkbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xg6UNy"&gt;Find yourself something you like to write with, whether it be a fancy (or affordable) fountain pen, a quirky gel pen bought off AliExpress that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aliexpress.com%2Fitem%2F4000325642482.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22882328%2Forganization-tools-todo-notes-journals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;looks like a cute bear&lt;/a&gt; (I have this, too), or a cheap ballpoint that just feels right to you. Fountain pens can be finicky, but they make everything very purposeful.

&lt;p id="LyBshh"&gt;I’m usually not as organized as I would like to be. But outside of jotting essential to-do’s and must-buy groceries on sticky notes, my other line of defense from getting overwhelmed by the flailing tentacles of life is an Android widget called Stuff. It’s a free to-do list app that lets you denote tasks for today, tomorrow, or sometime down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knyH3A"&gt;I like it more than other to-do list apps that I’ve tried because it’s actually a widget, so it can live front-and-center on your screen if you want it to. Also, it doesn’t require an account, nor does it have ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1atWC"&gt;Stuff is fairly limited in terms of customization, but you can pay $2 as an in-app purchase for more features, like the ability to rename the categories (I happen to like the default ones) or change the color of the bullet points that appear next to each line item, as well as more under-the-hood details of the widget itself. You can round its corners, change its background color, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7y939"&gt;I still find myself bouncing off using it (more of a “me” problem than this widget), but when I’m trying to get focused, I turn to Stuff. &lt;em&gt;— Cameron Faulkner, reviewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five Star 3 notebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iIpi16"&gt;I use a combination of things, but like a few other people on this list, this simple &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1237061/2092?subId1=TheVergeFavoriteTools11222&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Ffive-star-3-subject-college-ruled-spiral-notebook-colors-may-vary%2F-%2FA-14045827"&gt;$4.79 Five Star notebook&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite tool. Although I don’t adhere to it religiously, I like the bullet journal approach, so I manually number each page and add a separate index sheet in one of the notebook’s folders to easily find what I need by categories I’m constantly creating. I like color, so I use a few markers and pens, but nothing too fancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3urSa"&gt;For me, the simpler and cheaper the notebook, the better, because I find I feel less guilty about using it not just to write out my to-do list but also to plan, brainstorm, quickly jot down notes, journal, add my grocery shopping lists, and more. I find I just can’t do all of that when I have a high-end or exceptionally beautiful notebook. Don’t get me wrong — I have a collection of stunning journals that look like art, but I rarely use them because I know it’ll be expensive to buy another. When I do actually use them, I almost feel this kind of pressure to make my entries as organized, attractive, and as Pinterest-worthy possible — while never actually getting anything done (true story). &lt;em&gt;— Sheena Vasani, commerce writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lVxaGT"&gt;I basically run my life out of OmniFocus. Work tasks, home tasks, they all go into the same app, laden with tags and metadata like a defer (read: “don’t bug me about this until”) date, due date, and project. The app lets me change views if I only want to see personal tasks or work tasks, or it’ll let me get the big-picture view of everything I’ve got coming up and everything I’ve been putting off from the Forecast view. It can be a bit fiddly with managing projects and folders, but now that I’ve got a system set up, it feels like I can do almost anything when it comes to organizing and displaying my tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGwYEa"&gt;I mean, I don’t. I pretty much explained everything I do in the first two sentences. But the point is that I could — and yes, I realize that my use of OmniFocus is like someone insisting they need an F-650 box truck to move a plastic table made for children. (Seriously, I’m getting jealous of my co-workers who are happy with $5 notebooks or free apps, especially since I’ll probably be dropping anywhere from $50 to $100 to upgrade to OmniFocus 4 when it comes out.) But none of the other apps I’ve tried have mapped so perfectly onto how my brain categorizes tasks, and I love using it so much that it (and Overcast) are basically what made me switch from Android to iOS. I’ve got no plans to change task management systems anytime soon. &lt;em&gt;— Mitchell Clark, news writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="1hehIk"&gt;Like many of my colleagues, I use a hybrid of apps and notebooks. However, there’s a clear line between work and personal tasks. Work tasks get apps, personal tasks are analog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QMkuo"&gt;For personal stuff, I’ve been a &lt;a href="https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/notebooks/?filters%5B17847%5D%5B%5D=9901&amp;amp;filters%5B17846%5D%5B%5D=19294"&gt;Leuchtturm1917&lt;/a&gt; fan for many years, but recently, I’m trying out this &lt;a href="https://notebooktherapy.com/collections/bullet-journal/products/tsuki-winter-wishes-limited-edition-bullet-journal?variant=39545906004083"&gt;cute bullet journal&lt;/a&gt; from NotebookTherapy. Don’t get me started on how much I’ve spent on Japanese and Korean pens, markers, and highlighters. Basically, if it’s at &lt;a href="https://www.jetpens.com/"&gt;JetPens&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop.mochithings.com/"&gt;MochiThings&lt;/a&gt;, I have probably spent too much of my money on it. (Can you tell I was the dork with color-coded notes in school?) It’s just a soothing way to process all the big picture things going on in my life and break them down into more digestible pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8x31v"&gt;But as a tech reviewer, my entire working life is digital, and I need to be able to switch between my phone and laptop. That’s why I also like Todoist — it’s got a mobile app, Chrome extension, integrates with my email client, the works. I also use &lt;a href="https://dayoneapp.com/"&gt;Day One&lt;/a&gt; as a scratchpad for drafts I’m struggling with and 3AM shower thoughts alike. Otter.ai is essential for recording briefings. On days I really can’t focus, I like to use &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/be-focused-focus-timer/id973134470?mt=12"&gt;Be Focused&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically a Pomodoro timer. &lt;em&gt;— Victoria Song, reviewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stickies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OEEu4a"&gt;I have been using Apple’s macOS Stickies app on my work computers for as long as I can remember. This is the primary way I organize my thoughts throughout the workday, and I use the app for just about everything. I make lists of assignments and ongoing stories, ordered by deadline or urgency; I transcribe specific times at which I want to revisit a quote during interviews and live events; I write myself reminders for things that I know I’ll later forget; and I keep tabs on specific threads I want to follow up on when time allows. This very blurb was drafted in Stickies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgNix1"&gt;To be clear, this isn’t the only way I organize my life. I use Asana for long-term projects, physical notebooks and a day planner for note-taking and personal planning, as well as tools like the Slack reminders feature (which I use &lt;em&gt;exhaustively&lt;/em&gt;). But Stickies are tremendously useful for day-to-day list-making and scrawling down stray thoughts. And the Notes app simply won’t do — that’s for things like groceries and errands!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFzFEo"&gt;I’m sure there’s a better way to hack your productivity, but this one’s worked for me for years. If you don’t mind your desktop image being obscured by a rainbow of translucent windows packed with lists and blocks of text, I recommend this (admittedly chaotic) method of workflow management. &lt;em&gt;—  Catie Keck, reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XzVOMV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/notes/welcome/mac"&gt;Apple Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JRRTy9"&gt;Don’t @ me. It’s just so easy! Right there at my fingertips on my laptop and my phone! Apple’s built-in Notes app has delightfully few features. Really the only one that I use is the checklist feature that allows you to make lists with empty bubbles next to them, and nothing is more satisfying than clicking to check off one of those bad boys once you’ve finished your task. Notes allows you to bold and italicize, too, which I do every once in a while if I’m feeling wild. Plus, you can search your Notes. You can’t command+F an analog notebook! Notes syncs across all of your iOS devices if you want it to, but I don’t. Mine are kept separate. My laptop notes are for work, my phone notes are for personal tasks, and my iPad notes are for random musings and journaling in times when my analog diary is out of reach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5Q6PM"&gt;Taylor Swift uses the Notes app to jot down lyrics whenever inspiration strikes, and since she’s one of the most prolific humans on this earth, that should be all the convincing you need. &lt;em&gt;— Jackie McDermott, associate producer, Decoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roomba j7 Plus vs. Jet Bot AI Plus: can these robot vacuums pass the poop test?</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Home robots are getting smarter&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="2VHGgf"&gt;Robot vacuums have come a long way since the days I used to babysit my original Roomba (circa 2006), following it around to make sure it didn’t thrash around on a threshold or ignore the miniature lighthouses and trundle unseeingly into a no-go zone. Back then, my biggest issue was coming home to a robot vacuum that had gone about 10 minutes into its cleanup route and been derailed by a shoe, sock, or dress-up wig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XmbBw"&gt;Fast forward a decade or so, and robot vacuum manufacturers claim they’ve cracked it. Using improved sensors combined with artificial intelligence, the latest crop of bots can now see and recognize everyday household objects and nimbly navigate around them to carry on their merry way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibEpsN"&gt;But is this feature worth splashing out on a top-of-the-line bot for? I put two of the newest to the test — &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Roomba-Self-Emptying-Robot-Vacuum/dp/B094NYHTMF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iRobot’s Roomba j7&lt;/a&gt; ($650 for the vacuum, $850 for the j7 Plus version with the auto-empty base) and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Recognition-Intelligent-Touchless-Navigation/dp/B0912TLG7T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Jet Bot AI Plus&lt;/a&gt; ($1,300 for the bot and base, you can’t buy it separately) — to see if they lived up to their lofty promises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="106DTr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10974596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="XKCU06"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10974616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WfRxPu"&gt;The main advantage of this flagship feature is you don’t have to tidy up before the robot runs. I’m not convinced this is as big a selling point as some other advances, like self-emptying or smart mapping. Floors can’t really be cleaned if they’re still littered with clutter. But if it means the bot won’t get tripped up by that stray cable you didn’t know was sitting under the couch or the pair of shoes your significant other carelessly discarded in its path, then there’s some benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Shy0Kh"&gt;The other perk for pet owners is that one of those common household objects the bots will avoid is poop. Yep, if you have a pup who often poops in the living room, iRobot promises its newest vacuum won’t smear the crap all over the place thanks to iRobot’s PrecisionVision Navigation technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="c6CQRw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The only robot that actually went over the fake poop was the Roomba&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YJIfMJ"&gt;If it fails, then the iRobot Pet Owner Official Promise (P.O.O.P for short) kicks in, and they’ll send you a new one (only in the first year, though, and no word on who will come and clean up the catastrophe). It will also avoid phone cords, power cables, shoes, and socks, with more objects on their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKcUTk"&gt;Samsung’s Jet Bot AI Plus doesn’t come with the same promise, but its AI-powered 3D Object Recognition technology is backed by an Intel processor and is programmed to discern turds and other common clutter. Plus, you can have it check in on your dog throughout the day using the vacuum’s built-in HD camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yPFa5hih-0y97RJOZjKnS3gUyF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163834/vtuohy_220110_4963_0018.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Roomba j7 Plus and Samsung JetBot AI Plus both come with charging docks that can auto-empty the robot’s dustbin. These can hold two to three months of debris before being replaced, depending on use. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="3TW8Mr"&gt;All the features&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="J8gpMS"&gt;As high-end robot vacuums, both models have all the features you’d expect: smart mapping to ensure every nook and cranny is reached, voice assistant compatibility so you can imperiously command your robot army of one (even say which room to head to), scheduling and location-based automations, strong cleaning performance, the ability to add virtual no-go zones (and physical ones if you prefer), and a self-emptying dock, so you rarely have to get your hands dirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErdoY0"&gt;Both robots have an upgrade to intelligent mapping that includes furniture and appliances. This is handy as it means you can tell the robot to go “clean in front of the fridge.” (The Roomba works with the Alexa and Google voice assistants and the Samsung with both of those plus Bixby). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXhc4f"&gt;The Jet Bot AI Plus can automatically identify appliances, adding them to the map in the app (which is the SmartThings app). You can edit and add if it gets it wrong (oddly, it never spotted my giant Samsung refrigerator). The Roomba lets you add Clean Zones into the map in its iRobot app and label them as “counter,” “dining room table,” or “couch” (the AI should suggest them over time, iRobot tells us, but that hadn’t happened in my six weeks of testing). The Roomba also lets you create multiple maps for other floors, the Jet Bot only has one map. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="iyhiRX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Samsung Jet Bot AI Plus was clearly inspired by a galaxy far, far away&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q90Y2N"&gt;The Roomba has smart connections that can tell the robot to run when you leave, including the options to link it to the closing of your MyQ smart garage door controller or locking of your August lock. You can also use IFTTT or Alexa Routines to set up location-based prompts for the robot to get busy while you’re gone. Samsung offers this feature through SmartThings’ Automations. The app is a little challenging to navigate as it’s an entire smart home ecosystem, not just an app to run your robot, but it does include a wide variety of automation options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcjW4E"&gt;Neither bot doubles as a mop, but Roomba has a mopping robot that can share maps with the vacuum and which you can program to pop out and mop after the vacuum is done. Samsung also has a robot mop, but there are no linked features yet. In my experience, stand-alone mop bots are better. Most robot vacs that also mop put most of their power into vacuuming, and the mopping portion is more about ineffectually dragging a wet towel over your floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3PWqOd9yUZMyhZjQ-57XYGeaQ0o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23168877/Samsung_JetBot_App.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jet Bot is controlled through the SmartThings app. The map shows the layout of the test space, including furniture and appliances it thinks are there. It also pops up an image of any obstacle in the cleaning report. You can also view the robot’s camera feed here. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XqkjJW"&gt;Samsung does have another trick up its sleeve to justify that eye-wateringly high price tag (it’s one of the most expensive robot vacuums you can buy). It doubles as a mobile security camera — think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692048/ring-always-home-cam-drone-amazon-price-release-date-specs"&gt;Ring’s Always Home Cam &lt;/a&gt;without the hazard of flying and with the bonus that you can actually buy it (we’re still waiting on that Ring drone). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AI7adm"&gt;Both robots have cameras built-in for navigation purposes, but with the Jet Bot AI Plus, you can use its onboard lens as a home monitoring device. Which is actually really fun, although of minimal use beyond tracking your pet (which it can also do — although only dogs, no kitties) or monitoring someone sneaking around your house. Because of its height, it’s limited in what it can see (so you can’t use it to check the stove is on), and there’s no zoom, plus it can’t do stairs. But you can schedule it to patrol on the hour (using the SmartThings app) and look for motion, as well as choose up to five “spots” on the robot’s map to go surveil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bl0GZ6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can rebuild your Roomba, if needed, making it an investment that should last&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YEC01U"&gt;A pet monitoring feature is a separate option using the free SmartThings Pet add-on in the app. This lets you set a schedule for the Jet Bot AI Plus to patrol around and look specifically for your pet. It will report back if it doesn’t find him or her. If it does see them, it pops up a notification and records a quick video. In my testing, this was pretty spotty. It only ever went into two rooms, stubbornly refusing to check out the living room, where the pet was sitting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLmQIe"&gt;You can manually control the robot through the app to go find your furry bundle, all the while muttering the phrase, “I am not a helicopter pet parent. I am not a helicopter pet parent.” Live streaming and 10-second video clips are free, and you can upgrade to 60-second clips for $8 a month or $80 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sp6BFzgxLQaUQdhcS9gzrM0YzHw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163829/vtuohy_211029_4963_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Roomba j7 has a polished look, and its Clean Base has a more contemporary design, with a ribbed, matte black plastic, and a faux leather pull tab for accessing the bin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="E933Di"&gt;Design decisions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="DUX5Tw"&gt;Both robots boast unique designs. The Samsung Jet Bot AI Plus was clearly inspired by a galaxy far, far away, and if you’ve always wanted a sleek-looking storm-trooper-like robot (vacuum) in your home, here it is. It’s also a beast — weighing about 10 pounds and measuring 5.5 inches at its tallest point (which is when the little LiDAR sensor pops up). This means it won’t get under that mid-century mod couch easily. However, its tank-like wheels will surmount nearly any obstacle (except perhaps rug tassels). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2w3qiO"&gt;The Roomba is much more compact. At just 3.5 inches tall, it got under all my furniture with no issues. While the Jet Bot has a squared-off front end that tapers down as low as 2 inches, allowing it to get into places like along kitchen cabinets, the Roomba still has it beat on versatility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ytr2AE"&gt;The Roomba’s bin/dock is also much shorter and squatter than most (including the Samsung’s, which is taller and narrower). Not short enough to live under a couch or bed, but certainly less obtrusive (it also now holds an extra bag, which is helpful). Speaking of bags, you’ll need to replace them every two to three months and Roomba’s cost $20 for three, with Samsung’s being more expensive at $40 for a five-pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8JUaWgJgNumkWkdo3yIdrRR_HhM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163824/vtuohy_210921_4963_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Jet Bot AI Plus is a sleek, all-white affair with a robot-like LED eye that glows, indicating what state the vacuum is in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MKIyDw"&gt;On-device controls vary, too — with the Samsung offering two buttons, one to start, stop and pause a run, and one to send it home. Plus, a glowing LED strip at the front gives you an indication of what it’s doing (it glows blue if it’s in patrol mode) and adds to that Star Wars vibe. The Samsung will also chatter away to you about its daily life almost incessantly. “Thank you for helping me” is one of its cutesiest phrases, but if it gets stuck or runs into a problem, it will keep talking until you rescue it. Not ideal if you like to run it at night. Thankfully, this feature can be turned off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnTE8u"&gt;The Roomba has been stripped down to just one button that will start, stop and pause a clean with a tap or long-press to send it home. A spinning LED ring around the button also informs you what it’s doing — white for cleaning, red for low battery, and blue when it’s thinking about stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRZDyg"&gt;Unfortunately, the powers-that-be have done away with the spot clean button. So you can’t just plop it down and press one button when your kid knocks the Cheerios box over. Neither robot has this feature, found on most other robot vacuums. Instead, you have to use the app to “spot clean” — which is fiddly at best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
&lt;div id="qzcoqR"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Samsung JetBot AI meets dog poop_audio|105543" data-volume-uuid="47b822307" data-volume-id="105543" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="true" id="volume-placement-990" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Testing the Samsung Jet Bot AI Plus with fake dog poop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="SiV0EO"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Roomba J7 VS dog poop_audio|105542" data-volume-uuid="52d4be874" data-volume-id="105542" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="true" id="volume-placement-642" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Testing the Roomba j7 with fake dog poop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="IoLrQF"&gt;How about that poop?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="cm50ge"&gt;But back to that signature feature. How well do these robots avoid the everyday detritus of life? Overall, excellently. Both navigated most obstacles I put in their path — from shoes to cables to socks and other cruft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOqku9"&gt;The main difference in my testing was how it avoided an object. Both bots reacted reliably about 90 percent of the time to things that could derail them. But the Samsung always got up close and personal with the item before moving on; the Roomba would get closer to some than others — seemingly having a better idea of exactly what it was approaching. (The Roomba also has a small, white LED light that turns on when it’s navigating to help it see objects. You can’t turn this light off.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXsMab"&gt;This was particularly true with dog poop. If poop was spotted it would do a rather dramatic about-turn or swift reversal and give the said excrement a decently wide berth. On the other hand, the Samsung would maneuver around it, trying to clean everywhere but the spot it sits on. This meant it got way too close and would probably take a small souvenir with it as it brushed up against it. (Our test poop was made from play putty, much less squishy than the real thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7fgCqD7jHhpNKPHnpHmkTyS8Bg4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23168886/Roomba_J7_app.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iRobot app controls the Roomba. It maps the space, and then you manually add clean zones (such as the kitchen counter). When it encounters an obstacle, it takes a photo for you to review. Or it will cancel the run if it thinks it can’t get around it safely.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cd3X8f"&gt;The Roomba also impressed me over Samsung in terms of how it used its intelligence. They both take pictures of the objects it finds (yes, including poop) and but the Roomba gives you the option to automatically create a keep-out zone in the app, so it doesn’t go there again (which worked excellently for a lounge chair whose skinny legs repeatedly trip up every floor bot I’ve tested). Or, if it’s just a temporary problem, you can mark it as so. It will even go back after and clean just the places it missed — once you’ve tidied up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBJn5n"&gt;The Samsung robot flags objects on the map, shows an image, and offers up a guess as to what it was (there are three recurring options — sock / towel, cup / plate, and electrical cord). But beyond that, it doesn’t do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="89yCxR"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Roomba j7 vs dog poop doesn_t end well|105541" data-volume-uuid="74b281d47" data-volume-id="105541" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="true" id="volume-placement-638" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The one time in our testing that the Roomba failed the ultimate test.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NCxFdr"&gt;However, when it came to the ultimate test — poop — in the repeated trials I put them through, the only robot that actually went over the fake poop was the Roomba. Granted, it only failed once out of about a dozen tests, but once is all it takes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="OoF4yX"&gt;Peak performance &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="cy6ofC"&gt;Both these bots delivered in terms of seamless, methodical navigation that covered the majority of the space while sucking up most of the debris from my hardwood floors. The Roomba edged the Samsung as its side brush meant it reached the dirt along the edges better (the Jet Bot doesn’t have a side brush, but its square shape lets it get closer to edges), and it is the more powerful, picking up some smaller debris the Samsung missed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKJp3x"&gt;But the Roomba is a bruiser. Even with a new feature, “Sight Touch,” that supposedly more gently navigates and encounters obstacles than previous generation Roombas, the j7 took out a piece of (styrofoam) quarter-round trim from my baseboard. On the other hand, the Jet Bot is almost too cautious, not getting close enough to some objects to clean properly around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQcJuo"&gt;Each robot can suck harder when it goes over non-plush carpet (neither cope well with high-pile, a common issue with robot vacs). In testing, both performed well, with the Roomba edging the Samsung on dog hair, likely thanks to its two rubber brushes that oscillate in opposite directions, whereas the Samsung has just one large bristle brush. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KAon7O_SAR71poIu0uz8o9C44P8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163822/vtuohy_210921_4963_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung vac ditches wheels for tank-like treads that are impressive at getting over things (but not so good for going under).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JyMalS"&gt;The Roomba was also more reliable at navigating thresholds, just barreling over them immediately, whereas the Jet Bot AI Plus had to check them out for a minute or two, approaching and backing away before deciding it was safe to proceed. With its tank-like treads instead of wheels, however, it sailed right over.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDpXYw"&gt;Speaking of suction — this isn’t iRobot’s most powerful sucker; that award goes to the more expensive top dog in the lineup, the $1,099 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Automatic-Disposal-Connected-Anti-Allergen/dp/B07QXM2V6X?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Roomba s9 Plus&lt;/a&gt; (including the dock/bin). iRobot does not release suction power stats but says that the j7 is 10 times stronger than its entry-level Roomba 600, whereas the s9 is 40 times stronger. The j7 is just fine for regular dirt and debris, and even if you have more challenging tasks (copious kitty litter, for example), it’s hard to recommend the $250 upgrade to the s9, as you don’t get the obstacle navigation features. In my testing of the s9, it routinely fell prey to socks and charging cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1QJfuG8VegQiacijNdeUiIMt5Mg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163827/vtuohy_211029_4963_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Roomba has smaller wheels than the JetBot, but it still managed high thresholds. It uses a side brush and two rubber brushes for sucking up dirt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8LO59O"&gt;Both vacuums are reasonably loud, and Roomba only has one setting (you can choose from three different “cleaning behaviors,” but they apparently all suck the same). Samsung has two suction levels, max and low — at the max level, both hit 73 decibels in my testing. And both sound like jet engines taking off when they empty their bins. The Jet Bot was the more reliable at emptying its bin, never once getting clogged, whereas I had to pull some clogs consisting of long fibers and hair out of the Roomba once or twice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="faxXLs"&gt;Where things diverge significantly is battery life — the Roomba can go an impressive 1 hour and 45 minutes on one charge, whereas the Jet Bot tops out at an hour on full power. Both will go back to the base, recharge, and resume, but the Jet Bot took almost twice as long to clean our entire downstairs living area as the Roomba because it had to recharge in the middle while the Roomba could do the whole space in one go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VK2auE"&gt;My other gripe with the Samsung is that it gets easily confused. If you pick it up while it’s running a job, it resets and forgets what it’s doing. It also occasionally would just stop mid-job and say there was a problem with its LiDAR sensor and to turn it off and on again. That would fix it, but it did this often enough for it to be really irritating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B802tAJW7pILwPy0hrjqxhqlP3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163823/vtuohy_210921_4963_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Jet Bot’s LiDAR and camera pop out of a tall cylinder at the back of the robot when it’s moving.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ATlZSjHsJumKucq5ieGtDSsoFXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163828/vtuohy_211029_4963_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Roomba j7 has a camera right up front with an LED light that illuminates while it’s working.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="dsVnqJ"&gt;Are they worth it?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="aIYloL"&gt;Ultimately, the object navigation alone is probably not worth the price premium here. It’s not going to kill you to just tidy up a bit, is it? If you care about the home / pet monitoring feature, the Samsung gets more attractive, but its cleaning prowess just isn’t as good as the Roomba’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqZKGr"&gt;There are other robots that offer home monitoring cameras (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Objection-Recognition-Advanced-Programming-Efficiency/dp/B086214HTZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ecovacs Deebot T8 AIVI&lt;/a&gt; has a built-in camera and costs almost $1,000 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Auto-Empty-Automatically-Hands-Free-Cleaning-Accessory/dp/B08GHV4YFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with a self-emptying dock&lt;/a&gt;), but the Samsung SmartThings smart home ecosystem gives the Jet Bot the edge. And it has more advanced pet monitoring features (it will even play music to your pet to keep them calm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLFufN"&gt;If you are looking for the best clean for your buck and really want to avoid the possibility that the robot won’t finish its run because of a stray piece of clutter, the Roomba j7 is the one to go with here. I also like how repairable Roombas are. While parts are expensive, they are available, and you can basically rebuild your bot if needed, making this investment one that should last a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qUftrj"&gt;Personally, I’m looking forward to the day that robot vacs sprout arms and actually remove the crap before they clean. And it may not be that far off. Samsung already has &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/get-a-glimpse-of-the-next-generation-innovations-on-display-at-samsungs-technology-showcase"&gt;arm-wielding bots&lt;/a&gt; for the kitchen, and Colin Angle, CEO of iRobot, tells me, “The home understanding and object recognition that today helps a Roomba do its job better will be the foundation for the next class of home robots that may, one day, have arms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xwmk6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to pick a new monitor for working from home</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Gig4NRsEPFeWiWELbj3BOLWlyY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70380094/VRG_ILL_4947_How_to_pick_a_new_monitor.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Samar Haddad / Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You now interact with coworkers through a flat rectangle — let’s get you a larger, better one&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="wGPX49"&gt;The shift to remote work has sent millions scrambling to improve their home office. There are many ways to do this, but the most important upgrade is the most obvious: the monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSkgqT"&gt;A monitor is key. You’ll use it hour after hour, day after day, year after year. Monitors even have the audacity to resist obsolescence, so the monitor you buy today might be the one you’re still using in a decade. (My editor and I both have decade-old Dell U2412 monitors that are still going strong.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90T38A"&gt;It’s an important decision, but not a difficult one, as there are dozens of great monitors to choose from. This guide will help you pick the best for your home office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lAypjJ"&gt;The sweet spot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UAHB2f"&gt;I’ve reviewed monitors and laptop displays for over a decade. While different monitors suit different owners, I believe the &lt;em&gt;ideal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;home office monitor has a 27-inch screen and 4K resolution. It uses an IPS panel, reaches a brightness of at least 250 nits, and can display 99 percent of the sRGB color gamut. Around back you’ll find a USB-C port that can deliver enough power to charge a laptop, along with HDMI and DisplayPort, plus an ergonomic stand that can adjust for height and attaches to a VESA mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EEg3lHG7XgzIvGr8zuzCeOUU9No=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161216/lg_ultrafine_27_inch.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;For $550, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fmonitors%2Flg-27up850-w-uhd-monitor%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22877788%2Fbest-monitor-work-from-home-screen-choice-4k-qhd-refresh-rate-ultrawide" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s 27UP850-W&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a 27-inch 4K IPS monitor that can also provide 96W of power to a USB-C connected laptop. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gDDTkS"&gt;Finding a monitor that ticks most of these boxes won’t be too difficult. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fmonitors%2Flg-27up850-w-uhd-monitor&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22877788%2Fbest-monitor-work-from-home-screen-choice-4k-qhd-refresh-rate-ultrawide" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s UltraFine line&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100009682-12839518?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fmonitors%2Far%2F8141%2F25-27%3FappliedRefinements%3D24271%2C43205%2C40619%2C19973" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell’s USB-C hub monitors&lt;/a&gt;, BenQ’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/BenQ-PD2720U-Thunderbolt-Reproduction-Professionals/dp/B07N4M92P1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PD2720U&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/BenQ-PD2725U-Thunderbolt-Mac-Ready-Accurate/dp/B0918QXTGN?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PD2725U&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=Verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-u28-4k-hdr-monitor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP’s U28&lt;/a&gt; can check them all. Only the price may be higher than you hope; snagging any of the above will cost at least $450. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwQwzH"&gt;But like I said, different monitors suit different owners. These monitors are ideal for work, but they’re expensive. They also lack features you’ll crave when it’s time to clock out and fire up a round of &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;. This guide will help you navigate the monitor world’s many caveats and find one that’s a fit for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vI4kHK"&gt;Size: 27-inch is best for most&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iiJpVl"&gt;A monitor’s most important trait is its most basic: the size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcjDKI"&gt;Most standard-width monitors come in one of three sizes: 24-inch, 27-inch, and 32-inch. Bigger is not necessarily better. A large display may look more impressive, but I find it uncomfortable when placed close to my eyes. There are also practical considerations like perceived pixel density. A big monitor will look fuzzier than a smaller monitor of the same resolution unless you move it further away — which isn’t always an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYLzYk"&gt;That’s why a 27-inch monitor is my go-to recommendation. It’s large enough to look impressive on a typical home office desk but isn’t excessive. In my experience, 32-inch monitors should be reserved for unusually large and deep desks, or corner setups where it’s possible to position the display around four feet away from your face. This is especially true for 32-inch monitors with a resolution below 4K, which look grainy to me at a distance of three feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t9XBWjLFFLhrg0E8lTn-K88eV6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161224/e1be7ffa_52fb_4a42_9454_64f151c20698.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BF4CZSV/?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP 24mh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a decent entry-level 24-inch 1080p monitor for $175. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P9Fuwg"&gt;For the same reasons, 24-inch monitors work better if you have a small, slim desk (say, around 24 inches deep or less) or otherwise bring the monitor closer to your face. A 24-inch monitor may sound small, but it’ll look reasonably large because it’s so close. They’re also a great way to save money. You can buy a decent all-around monitor &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BF4CZSV/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;like the HP 24mh&lt;/a&gt; for less than $200. It won’t wow you, but it works in a pinch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qT8Q1a"&gt;You can be creative with size if you mount a VESA-compatible monitor to an arm, as this will let you move it to your preference (including the proper ergonomic height). If you’re just doing it to move a large monitor farther away, though, give it a second thought. Why spend more for a larger monitor, and a monitor arm to position it farther away, instead of buying a smaller display to start? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7XdTt"&gt;If you’re looking to stretch more screen across your field of view for multitasking, you might consider an ultrawide monitor instead. There, I think the choice is clear: go for a 34-incher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAwLT4"&gt;Smaller models lack vertical space. A 29-inch ultrawide &lt;a href="http://www.displaywars.com/29-inch-21x9-vs-24-inch-16x9"&gt;has less vertical display space than a 24-inch widescreen&lt;/a&gt;. Larger models generally have the opposite problem. Many are too big for a typical home office desk, not only because of their screen size, but because of the large stands used to stabilize them (some are several feet wide). You might need to rearrange your desk around a 38-inch or 43-inch monitor or add a top-tier monitor arm to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnfeQk"&gt;What about super-ultrawides, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;like the 49-inch Samsung Odyssey G9 series&lt;/a&gt;? These monitors can offer a commanding view and are a good alternative to a double or triple monitor setup but, like big ultrawides, you’ll need to build your setup around it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;You might need to rearrange your entire desk around a super-ultrawide like the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Odyssey G9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eXO4Nl"&gt;Resolution: 4K is great, 1440p is practical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7heyE7"&gt;Resolution is key. A higher resolution means more pixels, and more pixels means a sharper, crisper image. More pixels also adds flexibility. You can use scaling features in Windows and MacOS to increase content size for readability, or crank it down to show more content at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LPxN1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4K resolution&lt;/strong&gt; (3,840 x 2,160) looks fantastic and is widely available on 27-inch and 32-inch displays. It’s not that expensive, either. Budget 4K 27-inch monitors like &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=Verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-27-4k-uhd-monitor-s2721qs%2Fapd%2F210-axlg%2Fmonitors-monitor-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Dell S2721QS&lt;/a&gt; can get you 4K for $350 or less.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8AJmp_FpuoWrmUpNum1lOFE7lWk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161240/dell_s2721qs.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-27-4k-uhd-monitor-s2721qs/apd/210-axlg/monitors-monitor-accessories" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dell S2721QS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a solid budget pick for a 27-inch 4K IPS monitor at under $350. A USB-C version costs a good bit more.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5lrhOK"&gt;With that said, settling for &lt;strong&gt;1440p (2,560 x 1,440)&lt;/strong&gt; can save money. It’s a bit disappointing on a 32-inch display, unless you move it far away, but it’s workable. A 27-inch 1440p display can look reasonably sharp and is a good choice if you personally don’t care about having the sharpest picture possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7eFOt"&gt;You should probably avoid &lt;strong&gt;1080p (1,920 x 1,080)&lt;/strong&gt; in a 27-inch or 32-inch monitor, however. It will look grainy and pixelated. Small fonts and interface elements (such as buttons) can become difficult to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Vqort"&gt;Twenty-four-inch monitors are a different story; 4K is rare, and 1440p is often the premium option. In fact, most monitors of this size are 1080p. It’s not ideal but it’s acceptable, as decreasing size increases pixel density. A 24-inch 1080p monitor is noticeably sharper than a 27-inch 1080p monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sU3Oi5"&gt;Want a 34-inch ultrawide? Look for 3,440 x 1,440 resolution. This leads to a pixel density nearly identical to a 27-inch 1440p monitor (about 109 pixels per inch). A handful of super-budget ultrawides use 2,560 x 1,080 resolution which, like 1080p on a large monitor, isn’t pleasant. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/21/16804850/lg-hdr-5k-ultrawide-monitor-ces-specs"&gt;LG’s 5K Ultrawide line&lt;/a&gt; is the sole option if you want 4K-equivalent pixel density in a 34-inch ultrawide, but you’ll typically pay $1,500 or more. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0892MHG9H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s well-reviewed 38-inch with 3,840 x 1,600 resolution&lt;/a&gt; costs even more at $1,600 and, though it might offer more screen, is equal in pixel density to a 3,440 x 1,440 ultrawide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTbpHk"&gt;Super-ultrawides also don’t offer much choice. All 49-inch super-ultrawides I’m aware of use the same 5,120 x 1,440 resolution which, again, roughly equals the pixel density of a 1440p 27-inch display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4iOM4R"&gt;Connectivity: USB-C is excellent but expensive &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BgYTLi"&gt;Most monitors have HDMI and DisplayPort. There’s no great reason to prefer one over the other for remote work. The huge majority of monitors sold today offer both, so the port you use will likely come down to what’s available on your PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yXUJwca70nDbgIfTLAQ98BHSdg4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161266/lg_monitor_connections.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This LG monitor has four video inputs, from top left to bottom left: Thunderbolt / USB-C, DisplayPort, and a pair of HDMIs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lIL7K9"&gt;What about HDMI 2.1? It’s not necessary for remote work, and productivity monitors with HDMI 2.1 aren’t yet a thing. Be warned that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22833233/hdmi-2-1-fake-marketing-brand-frl-vrr-allm-bandwidth"&gt;HDMI 2.1 could get messy in 2022 due to the standard’s lax certification&lt;/a&gt;. It’s key only if you want to connect a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X game console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUIXtw"&gt;If you’ve got extra cash to spend, the galaxy-brain move is to ignore HDMI and DisplayPort entirely and leap to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/usb-c"&gt;USB-C&lt;/a&gt; and/or Thunderbolt. USB-C and Thunderbolt are great because they allow a single-cable solution for modern laptops that support the standard. You can plug in the laptop and charge it from the monitor while sending video to the monitor simultaneously. The best USB-C monitors even act as a hub with multiple extra ports like USB-A, USB-C, and ethernet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q8ScKeVeijxOihxafdrXZjLz7iI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161289/dell_hub_monitor_27_inch.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The underside of this 27-inch Dell USB-C Hub Monitor is bristling with connectivity, much of it accessible via a single USB-C cable that also provides 90W of charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c8MGb1"&gt;Just make sure you check the fine print. Look for USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and Power Delivery, or Thunderbolt with Power Delivery (the standard has DisplayPort baked in). Those sorts of USB-C ports aren’t exactly uncommon on laptops: even the modest ThinkPad E545 I bought a few years back includes them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFZlY2"&gt;But you’ll also need to make sure the monitor you buy provides enough electricity. Power Delivery currently maxes out at 100 watts, so even the most powerful monitors can’t fully power laptops like a top-spec Razer Blade or high-end MacBook Pro 16, but a monitor that delivers 60 watts or even 45 watts might be enough if you have a thin-and-light laptop like a Dell XPS 13 or MacBook Air. The higher the better, but if the USB-C monitor doesn’t deliver as much power as your laptop’s power brick, your battery might only charge when it’s idle or even powered off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5youF"&gt;USB-C monitors are also expensive. The benefits often add several hundred dollars to the price when compared to an otherwise similar monitor that lacks USB-C. It’s worth the money, though: in 2019, I purchased a Viewsonic VG2455-2K for a sweet one-cable connection to USB-C capable laptops, and find it ideal for swiftly connecting my laptop to a larger screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0U3Lel"&gt;Ergonomics: The height has it &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ox8h7l"&gt;Any monitor worth your attention will have a stand that at least adjusts for height, usually along a range from 100 to 150 millimeters. Sure, you can stack it on books or buy a plastic riser, but that’s added hassle and clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CC5Gs6"&gt;Many monitors also adjust for tilt and swivel, and some pivot 90 degrees into portrait orientation. That can be particularly handy when a monitor is used as a second display. For example, you could swivel a monitor to directly face you while doing detailed work, like editing a photo, and swing it away when it’s just displaying Slack or Discord. Tilt is similar but on the vertical axis, and especially handy if you have a standing desk, as you may need to tilt the monitor up while the desk is standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cao8nRaGJLy_0rHQwAXJSPJI-L0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161307/fully_jarvis_monitor_arm.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fully&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fjarvis-monitor-arm.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22877788%2Fbest-monitor-work-from-home-screen-choice-4k-qhd-refresh-rate-ultrawide" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;$129 Fully Jarvis Monitor Arm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a well-reviewed arm with a 15-year warranty.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yrkdaa"&gt;But if your monitor doesn’t have enough range of motion, or you want to free up space on your desk, you could instead add a VESA-compatible monitor arm to get it off the ground. Look for monitors with a 100mm x 100mm VESA spacing pattern. This is an extremely common feature found in all but the most affordable monitors, and you only need to worry about the 100mm spacing pattern. Others exist, but are relevant to other types of displays (like televisions). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mabdrf"&gt;A monitor arm is rarely a necessity, but it’s great for multi-monitor setups that place secondary displays around and above your main monitor, or for positioning an especially large and bulky monitor. Unfortunately, monitor arms can also be a bit expensive. A basic monitor arm off Amazon can run $30 to $50, but I’ve been burnt on their quality in the past. A good arm like those from Jarvis or Ergotron will start around $130. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bJ6Ic"&gt;Larger, heavier monitors will need a beefier, more expensive arm: &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ergotron.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fproduct-details%2F45-647%23%3Fcolor%3Dwhite&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22877788%2Fbest-monitor-work-from-home-screen-choice-4k-qhd-refresh-rate-ultrawide" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the model Ergotron recommends&lt;/a&gt; for the 49-inch Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is currently $379 (and, at the time I wrote this, sold out!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N4eOu0"&gt;Color accuracy and gamut&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6vzW0r"&gt;Color accuracy is critical to image quality. An inaccurate monitor will look unnatural, flat, and dull, with strange swings in quality depending on what you’re viewing and the precise colors that are inaccurate (it’s common for monitors to be less accurate in blue or cyan than other colors, for example). A monitor with terrible color will disappoint you every time you sit down to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0v7qBg"&gt;The good news? Accuracy is low-key the greatest advancement in monitors over the last decade. Noticeably inaccurate displays were common when I began testing monitors well over a decade ago. Today, most midrange monitors have reasonable accuracy straight out of the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aq61gYhXRcpliCv8GgXSKn5VR7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161335/Datacolor_SpyderX_5_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Datacolor&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;If color is key for work, you probably already know you can buy a calibration tool like &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Datacolor-SpyderX-Pro-Calibration-Photographers/dp/B07M6KPJ9K?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;this $160 Spyder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6qnFAV"&gt;Still, there is a difference between midrange and premium monitors. Those who want great color accuracy should look for a “factory calibrated” monitor, which typically includes a calibration report in the box. This doesn’t guarantee color accuracy is perfect, but it at least shows the company put the monitor through an extra layer of quality assurance. Also check reviewers to see if the monitor lives up to its claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkYFhz"&gt;Color gamut, which describes the spectrum of colors a monitor can display, is also good enough on most monitors. The majority of content on a computer targets a color gamut called sRGB. Modern monitors display at least 95 percent of this gamut, and many display it all. Other gamuts also exist. DCI-P3 is the most advertised, though you may see Rec.709 or Adobe RGB as well. These gamuts are important if your work requires them, though if that’s the case, I’m guessing you know that. As with color accuracy, buyers concerned about gamut should read reviews to verify a monitor lives up to its claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OZjl76"&gt;Brightness and HDR: 250 nits or bust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kdrkF0"&gt;Odds are your home office has some form of light control, whether it’s shades or simply a room that’s naturally a bit dim. The ideal brightness will vary based on the lighting in your home office, but a monitor’s brightness rarely needs to exceed 200 nits. In fact, most monitor calibration tools (like a SpyderX Elite I use) have a built-in luminance sensor used to recommend a brightness based on ambient light. I’ve never seen it recommend more than 200 nits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJbR8D"&gt;That’s not a big ask, but budget monitors can’t always manage it, so be careful if you’re shopping on a tight budget. Manufacturers also tend to choose a best-case scenario when quoting brightness, so the listed brightness may not always be available. Buy a monitor that promises a maximum brightness of at least 250 nits (aka cd/m2). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRd08W"&gt;Why would you want a brighter monitor? Well, if you’re viewing SDR content, there’s no particular reason (aside from using a monitor in a very, very bright room which, though rare, does happen). Viewing SDR content at a high brightness (say, 300 nits or more) might look nice at a glance, but can cause image quality issues like disappointing dark levels and reduced overall contrast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Wy9en"&gt;High Dynamic Range, aka HDR, is a different story. This standard supports a way higher range of luminosity than SDR. HDR10, the most common standard, technically allows for a peak brightness up to 10,000 nits. Brightness does matter for HDR because the content includes additional luminance data that only HDR-compatible displays can show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-8J1DXnEoyBKjQj7zI4HAhBeZco=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161359/display_hdr.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are looking for an HDR monitor, DisplayHDR certification labels could help, but know that “peak luminance” means “a tiny region on screen can get that bright,” and DisplayHDR 400 is barely HDR at all. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i6nGwE"&gt;However, HDR is a bit of a minefield on the PC and can be counterproductive for work. Turning on HDR in Windows will often block a number of monitor controls you may need, including brightness, color gamut, and color temperature settings. The resulting image can appear eye-searingly bright and you’ll have less leeway to adjust it to your preferences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHzZxH"&gt;Also, most content viewed in Windows or MacOS is not designed for HDR. You can still view it, but the result will be less accurate than if you stuck with SDR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wA1sJ"&gt;Entertainment and gaming is where HDR redeems itself. Most streaming platforms now offer a method for viewing HDR content on a PC and many new 3D games include HDR support. Windows 11 even has an auto-HDR feature that can add HDR to games that don’t officially support it. This makes HDR a nice addition to a monitor that you’ll use for work and play — though I’d recommend leaving HDR off until you clock out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ViS8Xv"&gt;Panel type: IPS rules the office&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LdNhyo"&gt;Nearly all monitors sold today use an LCD panel based on one of three technologies: twisted nematic (TN), in-plane switching (IPS), and vertical alignment (VA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfnpKQ"&gt;The least expensive monitors often use a TN panel. Avoid them. TN panel monitors will display an image, but that’s about it. They look achingly dull next to IPS and have astoundingly bad viewing angles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vfYHTG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10972881"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5P315m"&gt;A majority of monitors use IPS. Monitors based on IPS have very accurate color and can support a wide color gamut at a reasonable price. IPS struggles with dark scenes, however, because it can’t achieve a convincing shade of black. This is the dreaded “IPS glow” you may have heard of, which can look unappealing when watching movies or playing games. However, gamers still enjoy IPS monitors because some IPS panels have low response times and very high refresh rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lgp0Oc"&gt;What about VA? This panel type has the best contrast ratio and dark scene performance of the three, which makes VA a great go-to choice for entertainment and gaming. This is especially true of high-quality, modern VA panels, which have mostly solved the color accuracy and motion smearing issues of some past VA monitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8cy3S"&gt;The choice between IPS and VA has no clear answer, as both have their perks. When it comes to work, though, you may find the choice is made for you. A huge majority of productivity monitors use an IPS panel. VA is an option, but you’ll want to lean your search toward gaming monitors if you crave the high contrast a quality VA panel can provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fTKjWK"&gt;Refresh rate: Higher is better, but there’s a compromise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="a8tZWb"&gt;AMD and Nvidia have successfully convinced gamers that a 360Hz monitor is ideal. But what if your day includes more Excel than &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt;? You might still see some benefits from a refresh rate higher than the traditional 60Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvLvLB"&gt;Gaming is often &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;reason to buy a monitor with an enhanced refresh rate. Higher refresh rates lead to smoother, more fluid motion and reduces input lag. That said, the benefits of refresh rate are not restricted to games. Higher rates make motion feel more fluid on the desktop as well, which is why Apple’s newest MacBook Pro 14 and 16, and many Windows laptops, now offer a refresh rate of 120Hz or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKoTfK"&gt;I feel it’s nice to have, but far down on the list of features you need to consider. Also, you probably shouldn’t pay extra for a 75Hz monitor — it’s not much gain over 60Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGvD6q"&gt;High-refresh gaming displays aren’t especially expensive, with 24-inch, 144Hz models sold for as little as $200. But you’ll typically trade something away for refresh rate: that $200 monitor might use an iffy TN panel (rather than IPS or VA) or feature a low resolution. It’s possible to snag a 4K display for a reasonable sum, or one with a high refresh rate, but going for 4K at 144Hz means looking at monitors that cost as much as big televisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFBvhd"&gt;Also, USB-C with Power Delivery is rarely found in gaming monitors, and I haven’t seen a USB-C gaming monitor that doubles as a USB-C hub. That could be an issue if your work setup involves a lot of wired peripherals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x9XJnN"&gt;Mini LED and OLED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gPsTP7"&gt;Nearly all monitors sold today use an LCD panel with an LED backlight behind it, a tried-and-true setup that has existed for decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMwskl"&gt;Mini LED adds a twist. The fundamentals remain similar, but the backlight is divided into hundreds of zones that can turn on and off independently. This allows extra brightness but also convincing contrast in shadowy scenes. Mini LED is also outstanding for HDR movies and games, where its class-leading brightness provides an edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ko6WMo"&gt;OLED? It flips the table, using an array of organic elements that create their own light. This provides pixel-level lighting control for truly unparalleled contrast you have to see to believe. OLED is also susceptible to burn-in, though there are ways to mitigate it from affecting a display prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We tried a 48-inch OLED TV as a monitor this past year &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;with mixed results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ho3Efk"&gt;Neither of these are necessary for working from home, and you’ll likely have to spend thousands to snag a monitor with either tech. Alternatively, you could buy a television with Mini LED or OLED technology, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv"&gt;but televisions still have their downsides as monitors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZspQlB"&gt;If you demand the very best from a monitor, however, I recommend Mini LED. OLED’s burn-in worries are legitimate on the PC which, compared to a television, will display static images more frequently. Mini LED can’t match OLED’s contrast, but it’s still a major upgrade over a backlit LCD screen. There’s also the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865220/sony-a95k-qd-oled-qdoled-4k-tv-announced-features-explainer"&gt;emerging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855531/alienware-curved-34-inch-qd-oled-samsung-gaming-monitor-specs"&gt;category&lt;/a&gt; of quantum dot OLED (QD-OLED) screens, but manufacturers haven’t announced prices for those yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WGugUM"&gt;What about monitors with built-in webcams?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0qMFfY"&gt;Do not buy a monitor with a built-in webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1YHiM"&gt;Webcams are small, easy to move, and can be used with multiple devices. Attaching a webcam to a monitor removes these perks. It also means you can’t upgrade your webcam in the future; you’ll have to replace the entire monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BH1Uyy"&gt;Our webcam guide has several recommendations. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652783/best-webcam-camera"&gt;Most are less than $100&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon reverses decision to ban Visa credit cards in the UK over fees</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5vY4gi"&gt;Amazon says it will continue to accept payment in the UK from Visa credit cards, reversing a decision to ban the cards that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22786966/amazon-visa-credit-card-ban-alternatives-fees"&gt;announced last November&lt;/a&gt; and due to kick in this week on Wednesday, January 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjWQn1"&gt;In an email to customers, Amazon said it was “working closely on a potential solution that will enable customers to continue using their Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk.” The company did not say what the solution was or how long it might be in place, but added that “should we make any changes related to Visa credit cards, we will give you advance notice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5P5yYf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Visa raised interchange fees five-fold after the UK left the EU&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pl1lPT"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22786966/amazon-visa-credit-card-ban-alternatives-fees"&gt;original decision&lt;/a&gt; to ban Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk arose from a dispute over payment fees levied by card issuers. The European Union sets limits on these particular fees, but when the UK left the EU it gave issuers free rein to increase them. Visa &lt;a href="https://thepaypers.com/online-payments/visa-raises-interchange-fees-for-uk-based-cardholders--1247923"&gt;raised its interchange fees&lt;/a&gt; from 0.3 percent to 1.5 percent, which evidently annoyed Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmEBRL"&gt;Although it’s not clear what deal has been brokered between Amazon and Visa and who it favors, it was Visa’s &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/visa-stock-tumbles-amazon-plans-stop-accepting-its-u-k-issued-credit-cards/"&gt;stock that dropped&lt;/a&gt; after the ban was initially announced. As &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/amazon-drops-date-to-stop-accepting-visa-credit-cards-for-uk-payments-12518264"&gt;per &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Visa said in a statement: “Amazon customers can continue to use Visa cards on Amazon.co.uk after 19 January while we work closely together to reach an agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft lets you follow YouTube creators in Edge browser test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fn78VxzmVwXFqnwZtUPpDWLxsF4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70399206/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DAfS61"&gt;Microsoft has started testing some deeper YouTube integration in its Edge browser. The latest Canary developer builds of Edge include a new “followable web” feature that lets you easily follow your favorite content creators on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EiL86G"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge/comments/rz71jh/edge_canary_now_lets_you_follow_some_of_your/"&gt;Reddit user Leopeva64 spotted&lt;/a&gt; a new YouTube follow button that appears in the address bar of YouTube pages. Following creators will add them to a feed that’s part of the Collections feature in Edge. The feature is clearly in the early preview stages, and it doesn’t support all YouTube content creators just yet. The feed that’s created in Collections lets you see recent posts from creators that you follow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PoVZ9FMhXwl0bYfS5SmQUDUnK_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23174192/edgefollowing.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new web following feature in Edge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NrwDMG"&gt;This deeper integration with YouTube will likely extend to other parts of the web, too. Microsoft’s Edge followable web feature looks similar to Google’s &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/05/an-experiment-in-helping-users-and-web.html?m=1"&gt;experimental feature in Chrome&lt;/a&gt; that lets people follow blogs and creators to get the latest content when it’s published. This is essentially an extension of RSS inside Chrome, and it includes a follow button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olz5SS"&gt;Microsoft is only trialing this new Edge feature with a limited number of Edge Canary testers, as part of what the company calls “controlled rollouts.” The software giant hasn’t officially detailed its plans for the followable web feature in Edge, but we’re expecting to hear more about this modern RSS feed in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
