    <title>Beats discontinues several products including Powerbeats, Solo Pro, and Beats EP</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of the Beats Solo Pro headphones, the best on-ear noise-canceling headphones, worn on a woman’s head." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jVsz3mMneUJzVdHI2qbOw_hTvuQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70076809/cwelch_191024_3759_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Solo Pro on-ear headphones are being discontinued despite being newer than models that will remain available.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cLa8X1"&gt;On the same day that it announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple"&gt;the new $200 Fit Pro earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are receiving universal praise in early reviews, Apple’s Beats brand is thinning out the rest of its product lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fivAfY"&gt;As noticed by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/apple-discontinues-beats-headphones/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company has quietly discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21181088/beats-powerbeats-4-2020-review-wireless-earbuds-fitness-specs-price"&gt;Powerbeats&lt;/a&gt;, noise-canceling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931329/beats-solo-pro-review-noise-canceling-on-ear-wireless-headphones-features-price"&gt;Solo Pro&lt;/a&gt; headphones, and entry-level Beats EP headphones. All three products are no longer available directly from Apple, and while stock may remain at third-party retailers, they’ll be gone once current inventory is sold through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMUy9U"&gt;A Beats spokesperson confirmed the news, but declined to go into detail on why these specific products have gotten the axe. It’s reasonable to speculate that their sales came in well below the company’s more established hits. Clearly the Powerbeats, introduced fairly recently in March 2020, couldn’t match the demand of the true wireless Powerbeats Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qo71RhuJ3vhEbGQPiXsqxOl6ix4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19808862/DSCF5798.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wired Powerbeats are also discontinued as of today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LUqNiU"&gt;And in the case of headphones, over-ear mainstays like the Solo 3 and Studio 3 are still sticking around, while the on-ear Solo Pros — released &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; both of those pairs — are the first to be discontinued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9S0Xkd"&gt;With these changes, &lt;a href="https://www.beatsbydre.com/products"&gt;according to Beats’ website&lt;/a&gt;, its product family now consists of the just-launched Fit Pro earbuds, Powerbeats Pro, Solo3, Studio3, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;Beats Flex neckbuds&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the line. Aside from earbuds and headphones, the company also continues to sell its Pill Plus Bluetooth speaker. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Chinese version of Fortnite is shutting down in mid-November</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Fortnite logo is seen on a..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YhUBc5eiV85vTmMDK05f9mjJ1PE=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70076714/1232034451.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IfIzKm"&gt;Epic Games, the developer behind &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, is shutting down the battle royale in China in mid-November (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/fortnite-china-is-shutting-its-servers-on-nov-15/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). A translated post on &lt;a href="https://fn.qq.com/webplat/info/news_version3/10021/34544/34546/m20913/202110/903484.shtml"&gt;Fortnite’s website&lt;/a&gt; reveals that the “test” of the game “has come to an end.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9W4Hu"&gt;The post says users will no longer be able to sign up or download &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; starting Monday. On November 15th, Epic Games will shut down &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s servers completely and bar users from logging in. The notice thanks players for “boarding the bus” and participating in the game. Epic didn’t provide any additional information on why it decided to close out the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bLaLar"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic Games doesn’t provide any additional information on why it decided to close out the game&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0vu0xi"&gt;However, it may have something to do with China’s new gaming restriction for kids — as of August, children under the age of 18 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648107/china-curbs-gaming-addiction-3-hours-each-week-spiritual-opium"&gt;can only play video games three hours per week&lt;/a&gt;. State-backed media also referred to online games as “spiritual opium,” further highlighting China’s skepticism towards gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrjOMQ"&gt;This is nothing new — &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/business/china-video-game-ban-young.html"&gt;China banned kids from gaming between 10PM and 8AM&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and also limited children’s screen time to 90 minutes on weekdays. Chinese technology giant Tencent even launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22567029/tencent-china-facial-recognition-honor-of-kings-game-for-peace"&gt;a facial recognition system that catches kids gaming past curfew&lt;/a&gt;. China’s new three-hour rule means that the country’s restrictions are only getting tighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDa1vu"&gt;In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2142991/tencent-launches-fortnite-china"&gt;Epic Games partnered with Tencent to release &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in China&lt;/a&gt;, but it had to undergo some heavy modification before it was made widely available. A &lt;a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Fortnite:_China"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; China wiki&lt;/a&gt; page reveals just how different the game is from what American players know. For example, Chinese law prevents the depiction of skulls, changing the appearance of a number of skull-related cosmetic items. The wiki also notes that players were given prompts to go study if they played longer than 90 minutes on weekdays.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ecobee acquired by generator company Generac for $770 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9uLhC9nOscMjZbWJVpEishKwC4g=/0x23:815x566/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70076587/ecobee_thermostat_new_glass.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An Ecobee smart thermostat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LVJJGj"&gt;Toronto-based smart home thermostat startup &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-ca%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases%2Fgenerac-to-acquire-ecobee-inc%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F1%2F22758128%2Fecobee-acquired-generator-company-generac-smart-home-thermostat" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ecobee is being acquired by Generac&lt;/a&gt; Holdings for $770 million, the companies announced Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApWQaB"&gt;The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Ecobee CEO and founder Stuart Lombard told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that he will stay on as CEO, and the company will operate as a subsidiary of Generac. It has no plans to move out of its Toronto office and has plans to “significantly” grow the office later this year, Lombard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ay8EpS"&gt;Ecobee was founded in 2007 and has expanded from the smart thermostats it’s known for, adding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221291/ecobee-smartcamera-haven-security-platorm-smart-home-price-specs-features"&gt;voice-controlled home security camera&lt;/a&gt; that doubles as a home security system to its lineup. Generac, based in Waukesha, Wisconsin, was founded in 1959 and makes backup residential and commercial power generators — the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; recently &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/business/generac-climate-change-generators.html"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; Generac accounted for 75 percent of home generator sales in the US. Last month, the &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opening-generac-hub-trenton-celebrated-235300356.html"&gt;company opened a new plant&lt;/a&gt; in Trenton, South Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HqvwvF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ecobee has competition in the smart thermostat space from established brands like Google and Amazon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sELlHj"&gt;But Ecobee hasn’t released a new thermostat since 2019 and has lots of competitors in the smart thermostat space. They include established brands such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"&gt;Google’s Nest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703744/honeywell-home-t9-thermostat-review-remote-sensors-price-specs-features"&gt;Honeywell (owned by Resideo)&lt;/a&gt; that are now undercutting it in price and newcomer behemoths like Amazon that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692248/amazon-smart-thermostat-price-ambient-computer-alexa-preorder"&gt;just announced a $60 smart thermostat&lt;/a&gt;. Ecobee’s advantage has long been flexibility with various smart home platforms, but it hasn’t had the resources available to its larger competitors. Last year, it postponed plans for a smart lighting line and &lt;a href="https://betakit.com/ecobee-lays-off-10-of-staff-cancels-new-product-line-in-covid-19-market/"&gt;laid off 10 percent of its staff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBclaP"&gt;Generac, meanwhile, has bought several smaller companies over the past year and a half, acquiring Pika Energy, Enbala Power Technologies, and Neurio Technologies and &lt;a href="https://www.pv-tech.org/generac-reshuffles-executive-team-for-energy-storage-arm/"&gt;combining them into an energy storage division.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtmjEr"&gt;Aaron Jagdfeld, president and CEO of Generac, said in a statement that Ecobee represented an important addition to its residential energy technology offerings. “The ability to combine Ecobee’s cutting-edge technologies with Generac’s power generation, energy storage and energy management devices will allow us to create a clean, efficient, and reliable home energy ecosystem that will not only save homeowners money, but also help grid operators meet the challenges of an electrical grid under enormous stress by providing solutions to better balance supply and demand.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chris Pratt, the voice of Mario, will also be voicing Garfield</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Los Angeles Premiere Of Amazon’s “The Tomorrow War” - Arrivals" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KiSR4XnQX0Yt6WG4LGFzExwtqWQ=/0x111:3989x2770/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70076486/1326376580.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2XsbwW"&gt;Chris Pratt’s next big role has been revealed: he’ll voice Garfield in a new animated film based on the famous comic strip cat, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/chris-pratt-garfield-animated-feature-1235039314/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWxSLJ"&gt;Pratt does have big shoes (paws?) to fill, as he’ll be following Bill Murray’s take on Garfield from &lt;em&gt;Garfield: The Movie&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties. &lt;/em&gt;Additional details on the new movie are light, though, and we still don’t know exactly when we’ll be able to hear Pratt as Garfield scarf down some lasagna. &lt;em&gt;THR&lt;/em&gt; does report that &lt;em&gt;Garfield&lt;/em&gt; creator Jim Davis will serve as an executive producer, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzyLKW"&gt;The surprising revelation that Pratt will play Garfield follows &lt;em&gt;another &lt;/em&gt;huge Pratt Cast(ing): Nintendo announced in September that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690607/chris-pratt-mario-nintendo-illumination-animated-movie-december-2022-release-date-cast"&gt;Pratt will voice Mario&lt;/a&gt; in the Mario movie debuting December 2022. Nintendo also shared that movie would star Charlie Day as Luigi, Jack Black as Bowser, and &lt;em&gt;Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong,&lt;/em&gt; so here’s hoping that the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Garfield&lt;/em&gt; movie has a similarly wild cast. (&lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; newsroom suggests Tom Holland as Odie.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla starts selling home charger that works with other EVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cYSNfKH-MqzpbONzRtr2Bh1aZPs=/1x0:2404x1602/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70076379/tesla_j1772.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fTje9I"&gt;Tesla has launched a new at-home wall charger that works with other electric vehicles, as &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/01/tesla-launches-new-home-charger-that-works-j1772-all-electric-cars/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The new Level 2 wall charger was quietly added to the company’s online store on the same day it started allowing non-Tesla EVs to charge at Supercharger stations in the Netherlands — the first step in a much larger plan to open up access to Tesla’s charging network around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4Pgo5"&gt;The new charger uses a standard J1772 connector, not Tesla’s proprietary one, meaning it should work fine with other electric vehicles in North America. It’s competitively priced, too, at $415 (though it has to be installed by a professional electrician). Tesla says it can charge at up to 9.6kW and is designed for both indoor or outdoor installation. It’s basically a reworked version of the “Gen 2” Tesla home charger, though, meaning it won’t have some of the more advanced features (like Wi-Fi) found on the Gen 3 version Tesla currently sells to its owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Uu7xd"&gt;Tesla has led the way in electric vehicles for years, and the new wall charger (and the opening of the Supercharger network) shows the company is ready to take advantage of the many new EVs that are on sale or close to it. While it probably won’t make Tesla a ton of money like its main automotive business, there could be good opportunity here. While many legacy automakers sell their own branded home chargers, the third-party market for home chargers is full of mostly unrecognizable brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmlEBX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is bringing car crash detection to the iPhone, says the Wall Street Journal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Belkin Car Vent Mount Pro with Magsafe in a Ford F-150 with an iPhone 12 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gvjPnk_oVRLSndddN19JbOyAtOo=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70076352/DSC_9414.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;“Have you experienced an accident?” | Nilay Patel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dlAKCX"&gt;Apple is reportedly working on a new iPhone and Apple Watch feature that detects if you’re in a car crash and dials 911 automatically. The current plan is to roll out such a feature next year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-wants-iphones-to-detect-car-crashes-auto-dial-911-11635768001"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBhkve"&gt;Google’s Personal Safety app on Pixel phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892875/google-pixel-personal-safety-app-car-crash-detection"&gt;already includes&lt;/a&gt; a feature to call for help when it detects car crashes, just like connected car services in modern vehicles do, including GM’s OnStar, Subaru’s Starlink, and Fiat Chrysler’s Uconnect. Many cars on the road today are not equipped with any connectivity features, so getting crash detection on an iPhone too means more drivers can get the help they need in an accident as long as they have one in their pocket or mounted to their dash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5w2iN"&gt;The rise of unsafe smartphone usage in cars made way for integration systems like CarPlay and Android Auto, the former appearing in &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/29/apple-carplay-massive-success-paves-way-for-automotive-entry.html"&gt;nearly 80 percent of new vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, according to Apple. Building a new crash detection feature into the iPhone alongside CarPlay could bolster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714265/apple-carplay-ironheart-vision-car-settings-climate-seat-radio"&gt;Apple’s rumored “IronHeart” project&lt;/a&gt; to connect its phone with car settings in the same way HomeKit controls smart speakers and lighting. Targeting the annual &lt;a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/oct/1006-investor.html"&gt;$2 billion revenue stream&lt;/a&gt; that GM brings in with OnStar with the built-in features would be a very Apple thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gz1Kc2"&gt;While Apple’s accident detection &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/18/17129440/emergency-sos-iphone-apple-watch-accident"&gt;hasn’t always worked as intended&lt;/a&gt; in the past, the company has had many years to &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/device-analytics/"&gt;collect data and analytics&lt;/a&gt; on willing iOS and watchOS users. It remains to be seen how accurately Apple will be able to detect car crashes, let alone people falling. Speaking from personal experience, I took a tumble from a scooter in February 2020 wearing an Apple Watch Series 4, and the device was ready to call emergency services until I tapped the “I’m OK” button. But after a more recent trip-and-fall incident, my Apple Watch Series 7 did not offer assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon lifts mask mandates for vaccinated warehouse employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DorCkQZ_w0aKiUmS-MTbCZvLBl4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70076244/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zYHYlj"&gt;Amazon is lifting its mask mandate for fully vaccinated warehouse workers in the US (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/amazon-lifts-mask-mandate-for-fully-vaccinated-warehouse-workers.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company reportedly sent out a notice to operations employees, stating that vaccinated workers are no longer required to wear masks starting November 2nd. Masks will still be required if state or local laws mandate them, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ifiLFn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon will continue to evaluate its COVID-19 safety measures&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HkMh1d"&gt;“Vaccines are universally available across the US, and vaccination rates continue to rise, which enables the ability to return to our previous mask policy,” the notice reads (via &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;). An Amazon spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the company will be lifting its mask mandates for vaccinated employees and emphasized that Amazon will continue to evaluate its COVID-19 safety measures, adjusting its guidelines with advice from public health officials and medical experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8COEp"&gt;In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613542/amazon-warehouse-mask-mandate"&gt;Amazon reinstated its mask mandate policy&lt;/a&gt; for both vaccinated and unvaccinated employees in response to an uptick in COVID-19 cases. This came shortly after &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/19/amazon-says-vaccinated-workers-can-ditch-masks-starting-next-week.html"&gt;Amazon stopped requiring facial coverings for vaccinated workers&lt;/a&gt; in May. It appears that Amazon is slowly relaxing its safety guidelines for workers as vaccines become available to nearly everyone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22734765/fda-covid-vaccine-5-11-year-old-approve"&gt;including children&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22584386/amazon-end-onsite-covid-19-testing-us-warehouses"&gt;discontinued its onsite COVID-19 testing&lt;/a&gt; in July, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611439/amazon-office-employees-postpone-back-to-work-january-2022"&gt;corporate workers will return to the office in early 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US Treasury says stablecoins should be regulated like banks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ay8YmDoA_-IsHt6ZgilHHS2IHCk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70076240/acastro_170726_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RbMeje"&gt;The US Treasury Department is urging Congress to pass legislation that would require stablecoins to be issued by banks subject to federal banking laws in a &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; (.pdf) from the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, a panel headed by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6K485l"&gt;The report recommends legislation that would guard against stablecoin runs, address concerns about payment system risk, and address additional concerns about systemic risk and economic concentration of power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xlSy3"&gt;A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency typically backed by a fiat currency like the US dollar or the Euro, though it may also be backed by a basket of investments; the “stable” part comes from how the coin is pegged to its backing. Stablecoins are used mainly as payment vehicles and don’t fluctuate wildly in value — or at least, they’re not supposed to. The new report says the market cap for the most popular stablecoins has grown by more than 500 percent over the past year, to $127 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00DImh"&gt;“The rapid growth of stablecoins increases the urgency of this work,” the Treasury Department said in &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0456"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lCacdd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Tether controversy, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vUKi9U"&gt;In the report, the working group lays out some of the risks that it says stablecoins could present to the economy or to individual crypto investors. A number of scenarios could lead to a “run” on stablecoins, where holders tried to redeem them en masse because they’re worried about the currency’s viability. For instance, If a stablecoin issuer didn’t honor a request to redeem it, or if users lost confidence in the stablecoin issuer’s ability to redeem them, this could lead to a run. “Runs could spread contagiously from one stablecoin to another, or to other types of financial institutions that are believed to have a similar risk profile,” the report states, and could pose risks to the broader financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGfJi6"&gt;The solution? Only banks should issue stablecoins. Plus, anyone providing custodial cryptocurrency wallets should be “subject to appropriate federal oversight.” Failure to act would place a lot of people at risk, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUN2jx"&gt;If Congress doesn’t act, the working group recommended that the Treasury Department’s &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/fsoc"&gt;Financial Stability Oversight Council&lt;/a&gt; take steps to designate some stablecoin activities as systemic risks, which could subject them to further federal scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XM767c"&gt;In October, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728253/tether-41-million-misleading-statements-fiat-currency-bitfinex-cftc"&gt;(CFTC) fined the issuer of the Tether stablecoin $41 million&lt;/a&gt; for making misleading statements between June 2016 and February 2019, falsely claiming its stablecoins were fully backed by fiat currencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqeZe1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch’s new Animals livestream category may give you that fuzzy feeling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CeLYm9iJNXl46lisRhykmdn2IDc=/0x0:2028x1352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70076101/Screen_Shot_2021_11_01_at_12.57.18.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M6kbj6"&gt;Twitch is giving streamers who focus on furry friends a place to group their streams with its new &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Animals%2C%20Aquariums%2C%20and%20Zoos"&gt;Animals, Aquariums, and Zoos category&lt;/a&gt;, which may just end up being the greatest page on the internet. The &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/11/01/animal-week-is-very-good-yes-it-is/?utm_referrer=https://t.co/"&gt;company says&lt;/a&gt; that the category, launched as part of its Animal Week, is meant to bring together a bunch of streams from zoos, conservation projects, and animal owners that had been spread out over the site, making it easier for people to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHuI8X"&gt;If you’re looking for something relaxing, the category makes it pretty easy to find. As I write this, the category’s page features a &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/wolfconservationcenter"&gt;New York wolf conservancy’s den livestream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/marinemammalrescue"&gt;video from an otter enclosure&lt;/a&gt;, and a stream from the Monterey Bay Aquarium &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/montereyaq"&gt;that features a beautiful oceanside view&lt;/a&gt; (though at the moment it’s more ASMR than animal). There’s also a stream that promises to feature squirrels eating during the day and raccoons eating at night. What I’m saying is that if my browser locked onto this page and wouldn’t let me do anything else on the internet, I don’t think I’d mind one bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ye3JQP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Please internet: do not overfeed the ducks or overstimulate the turtles.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="muw7eK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/11/01/animal-week-is-very-good-yes-it-is/?utm_referrer=https://t.co/"&gt;In its announcement post&lt;/a&gt;, Twitch says that some creators even have interactive animal streams — a farm that livestreams its ducks will let you feed them if you donate bits (a Twitch virtual token), and a turtle streamer will let you change the lights, according to the company. Hopefully there’s some limit on how often the lights and music can be changed, or how much duck food will be given out over a certain period. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PBWkfFNgjPoBWf8hJquwyYL_b2U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977377/Screen_Shot_2021_11_01_at_13.05.52.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Livestream: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.twitch.tv/marinemammalrescue" target="_blank"&gt;MarineMammalRescue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, let me watch the water ferrets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3364Ax"&gt;Hopefully, having a dedicated category will help bring more attention to organizations working on conservation and to creators who are encouraging their audiences to donate to those causes (while rewarding them with endless Animal Content™). There’s been a lot of bad news around Twitch recently, between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712250/twitch-hack-leak-data-streamer-revenue-steam-competitor"&gt;a hack that leaked its source code&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650578/twitch-streamers-walkout-protest-hate-raids"&gt;hateful raids against marginalized streamers&lt;/a&gt;, but hopefully the platform will be able to keep this one corner of the internet a pleasant place — we could really use some more of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fahAi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook verified a fan page posing as Elon Musk</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iRZmeqltur1Y8BtOyqPo3Pp8F8A=/35x0:875x560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70075819/Screen_Shot_2021_11_01_at_11.10.57_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the fan page verified as Elon Musk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aDcqSQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElonMuskoffici"&gt;A Facebook fan page for Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; with 153,000 followers has been verified as the official page representing the Tesla Technoking — in violation of Facebook’s own rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hs9FT9"&gt;To be clear, the page isn’t&lt;em&gt; pretending&lt;/em&gt; it’s Musk; it &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElonMuskoffici/about_details"&gt;openly states&lt;/a&gt; that it’s a fan page in its About section (emphasis ours):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XdKsQi"&gt;Musk owns a Tesla Roadster car 0001 (the first one off the production line) from Tesla Motors, a company in which he is an early investor. The Roadster is a battery electric sportscar with a 220 mile range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vNS90"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a fanpage, uploading tweets etc from him&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BALMNiWjSt8SNj0UUxMzIjP5DTA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977005/Screen_Shot_2021_11_01_at_11.10.57_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here is the page’s description, which states it’s a fan page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5IxROW"&gt;There are only 10 posts on the page, with the earliest dating from October 21st. One is a photo of Musk, one is a notification that the page updated its profile picture to be one featuring Musk, and the others look to be reposts of recent tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QSBPB"&gt;The page didn’t start as a fan page for Elon Musk. The &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElonMuskoffici/about_profile_transparency"&gt;Page Transparency&lt;/a&gt; tab — which shows some history of the page, who it is managed by, and whether it runs ads — says the page was created on July 28th, 2019 to represent a “Kizito Gavin,” which is the reversed name of &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gavin+kizito&amp;amp;sxsrf=AOaemvLL_yUSow0dBngTpDo-xCxLByLbUQ:1635794566290&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=nws&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiN6LHQ8ffzAhUCIjQIHRKJDxMQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;amp;biw=1824&amp;amp;bih=860&amp;amp;dpr=1.58"&gt;soccer player Gavin Kizito&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67PMQq"&gt;The page has since changed its name six times, all in 2021, most recently changing to Elon Musk twice (somehow) on October 17th. The Page Transparency section also says that the people who manage the page are based in Egypt. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163805/elon-musk-texas-moved-california-tesla-spacex"&gt;Musk lives in Texas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sVtwWgPbGruz8ne3XvUQc-eb9Z4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977015/Screen_Shot_2021_11_01_at_11.36.04_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The page started as one for Kizito Gavin, but now apparently is the official one for Elon Musk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zrsxSh"&gt;Also maybe worth noting: the URL for the page cuts off the end of the word “official” — &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElonMuskoffici"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/ElonMuskoffici&lt;/a&gt; — which doesn’t seem very official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HoUEq5"&gt;It’s unclear when the page was verified. Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1288173394636262"&gt;verification rules&lt;/a&gt; state that the company has “confirmed that the Page or profile is the authentic presence of the public figure or brand it represents.” To be verified on Facebook, you have to fill out &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/295038365360854"&gt;a form&lt;/a&gt; that requires, among other things, that the submitter share official identification in the form of a driver’s license, passport, national identification card, tax filing, recent utility bill, or articles of incorporation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OupVAn"&gt;Verification is a challenge for big social media platforms. Twitter has also struggled with the problem. It paused its verification program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16628290/twitter-jason-kessler-charlottesville-verification"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt; and relaunched it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22435770/twitter-public-verification-program-launch-2021-pronouns-profile"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The relaunch has been somewhat bumpy, though, and the company admitted in July that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575025/twitter-verified-fake-accounts-botnet-researcher"&gt;it mistakenly verified&lt;/a&gt; a small number of fake accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYbQuG"&gt;Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
