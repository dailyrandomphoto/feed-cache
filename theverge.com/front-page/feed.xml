    <title>Real-life Mario Kart looks amazing from the perspective of a self-flying Skydio drone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mario Kart in real life thanks to CG and a self-flying drone: a chain chomp appears to be attacking this riding lawnmower." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AtwGcK6OlTy7jFBjra6ZYsO2HXA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267044/mow_rio_kart_mario_idea.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="21uHhy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt; in real life is a commonly shared dream, one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/8/5484916/mario-kart-in-real-life-is-real-weird"&gt;doesn’t typically live up to your imagination&lt;/a&gt; — but we’re definitely not giving up. Recently, Nintendo launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514758/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;an official $100 R/C car with mixed-reality tracks&lt;/a&gt; and and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"&gt;full-on AR ride at Japan’s Super Nintendo World&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLei4z"&gt;Now, independent filmmaker Ian Padgham &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/origiful/status/1391775241366560771"&gt;has come up&lt;/a&gt; with another must-try idea: riding a lawnmower on a closed course, from the perspective of a self-flying drone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Mario Kart in real life thanks to CG and a self-flying drone: a chain chomp appears to be attacking this riding lawnmower." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E2xgKF58qU55-QyFS_a8-h40iFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505901/mow_rio_kart_mario_idea.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ian Padgham&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes please.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mI6UhK"&gt;Not that he’s actually &lt;em&gt;playing a game &lt;/em&gt;in this awesome video, mind: Padgham just set his Skydio drone to film a normal video of him riding around, and then he added a lot of CG in post. “The footage itself was already pretty stable so I was able to just take it in After Effects and Cinema 4D and do tracking and make a topo map of the property,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Then it was just a matter of coming up with ideas, making assets and characters, and putting it all together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FmcH0k"&gt;But to quote &lt;em&gt;The Six Million Dollar Man&lt;/em&gt;, we have the technology! Savvy programmers could &lt;em&gt;totally &lt;/em&gt;pair a headset with a self-flying drone and make this game for real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="e7J4nH"&gt;As I explained in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21009994/skydio-2-review-self-flying-autonomous-drone-camera-crash-proof-price"&gt;our Skydio 2 review,&lt;/a&gt; the company’s technology has come to the point where I implicitly trust it to follow me without crashing. You don’t need to worry about controlling this kind of drone at all — you’d only need to worry about steering the lawnmower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zcgXuj"&gt;We’ve already seen that you can make real-life feel like a third-person video game &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/review-i-had-an-out-of-body-experience-because-of-this-1684014999"&gt;by pairing a drone with an FPV headset&lt;/a&gt; and flying it behind your body while walking around. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OhWngj"&gt;Mixed-reality headsets like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18235460/microsoft-hololens-2-price-specs-mixed-reality-ar-vr-business-work-features-mwc-2019"&gt;Microsoft Hololens&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309466/pokemon-go-hololens-prototype-microsoft-ignite-niantic"&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22308883/microsoft-mesh-virtual-reality-augmented-reality-hololens-vr-headsets-features"&gt;convincingly&lt;/a&gt; overlaid CG on top of the real world in real-time (though admittedly only across a narrow field of view). They could certainly turn reality into &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt; from a drone’s perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SPkP1o"&gt;Drones like the Skydio 2 have a surprising amount&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;of processing power inside these days, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ldqAHD"&gt;The world has absolutely built go-karts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/8/5484916/mario-kart-in-real-life-is-real-weird"&gt;that can artificially slow themselves down&lt;/a&gt; when hit by a virtual turtle shell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="8g9oT4"&gt;We just haven’t put them all together yet. Speaking of which, Skydio — when can we expect an FPV headset from you? It’s right up there with “build a smaller folding drone that easily fits in a messenger bag” when it comes to no-brainer moves.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hans Zimmer isn’t the only composer that can make tech sounds, you know</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix - Live Performances: Day Three" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ytwFtMwd_pZ00I8iEgVlcT52i34=/0x0:4002x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69266452/1170199302.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Suhaimi Abdullah/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bsLpJu"&gt;Today I learned that Hans Zimmer, known for his brilliant scores for movies such as &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Lion King, &lt;/em&gt;has &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0331949EN/bmw-m-gmbh-and-hans-zimmer-co-develop-the-emotionally-engaging-driving-sound-for-electrified-bmw-m"&gt;also composed driving sounds for BMW&lt;/a&gt;. And they’re actually pretty good! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7zJwy"&gt;You can hear one coming to the company’s M version of its electric BMW i4 cars &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yNpeuQFfSlE"&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yNpeuQFfSlE?t=90"&gt;and jump to 1:30&lt;/a&gt; if you just want to hear the sound).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KMVtYY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yNpeuQFfSlE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Byehga"&gt;And you can hear the driving sound that Zimmer composed for the BMW Vision M NEXT concept car in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81wHqxnWeHQ"&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VE1in2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/81wHqxnWeHQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h9gq9M"&gt;These are cool, but they got &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff wondering — what other composers should create sounds for cars? So we compiled just a few of our favorite composers into one list, and some ideas about what their car noises might sound like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wTRpRR"&gt;John Williams (&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;E.T.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt;): bombastic and inspirational&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BswWXt"&gt;Danny Elfman (&lt;em&gt;The Nightmare Before Christmas, Men in Black, The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; theme song): spritely vrooming, possibly with a horn section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AB6ZAJ"&gt;Clint Mansell (&lt;em&gt;The Fountain, Black Swan, Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt;): intense, overwhelming, and somehow brings me to tears&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dxddCD"&gt;Nobuo Uematsu (known for his many compositions to the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; series): gets me hyped to defeat some bad guys (after I am finished driving, of course)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FHUHBl"&gt;Trent Reznor (of the band Nine Inch Nails, and composer for &lt;em&gt;The Social Network&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Soul &lt;/em&gt;[alongside Atticus Ross]): ambient, creeping dread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vOBqrD"&gt;Yoko Kanno (&lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop, Vision of Escaflowne&lt;/em&gt;): perky, humorous, yet somehow as perfectly matched to the vehicle as a seatbelt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ImeTqH"&gt;Please, car-makers: have more composers create drive sounds. I just gave you some excellent candidates you can consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9tuv9"&gt;In fact, tech industry in general, please hire them to make other sounds, too — you don’t always have ask to Zimmer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366371/netflix-sound-hans-zimmer-theaters-tadum-twenty-thousand-hertz-podcast-sound-design"&gt;make&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22373999/hans-zimmer-oppo-find-x3-pro-ringtone-sounds-alarm"&gt;things&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic and Apple are now fighting over a naked banana</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortnite" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lNdLJPQSqJo2rjPBXZ9IgS5cIq4=/0x0:1352x901/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69266448/Fortnite_20200221130836.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rcoquR"&gt;As the trial for &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; entered its second week, both parties took a break from antitrust law to argue over whether bananas should wear clothes in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBa6N7"&gt;The banana in question is Peely, a humanoid fruit avatar from Epic’s game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, as you may remember, is at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;the center of the huge lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; between Apple and Epic. The trial’s sixth day began with testimony from Matthew Weissinger, Epic’s VP of marketing. And Apple used its cross-examination to offer the court an exhaustive tutorial on &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, beginning with its title screen and one of its skins. Hence the banana:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8c9EI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; We have in front of us a new set of images, and what is this screen showing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBv9zJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; This is your matchmaking lobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHgS33"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; And we have a large yellow banana here, don’t we? In a tuxedo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yumHw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. That is Peely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bj22g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; And that’s Peely, did you say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRq4aC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJyvjd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; And in fact, in the tuxedo, he’s known as Agent Peely, correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyNyik"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHbsrk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; We thought it better to go with the suit than the naked banana, since we are in federal court this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="MxYsLF"&gt;Peely’s &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/even-apple-knows-fortnites-peely-is-a-monster-1846860238?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;amp;utm_content=kotaku"&gt;nightmarish existence&lt;/a&gt; is barely related to Apple’s case. And the “naked banana” comment would probably have passed for a throwaway joke, but for one very important fact: Apple slammed Epic last week by claiming that it hosted porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GyoLNt"&gt;On Friday, an Apple attorney &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5"&gt;went after indie storefront Itch.io&lt;/a&gt;, which Epic lets users install through the Epic Games Store. The attorney noted that Itch.io included “so-called adult games” whose descriptions were “not appropriate for us to speak in federal courts,” calling them “both offensive and sexualized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IposXU"&gt;Epic Games Store manager Steven Allison defended Itch.io, but the exchange may have stung Epic. Or at least, that’s the best explanation I can imagine for what happened two hours later — when Epic’s attorney decided to revisit Peely during her own questioning of Weissinger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3LA2Yx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epic attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; A little bit of a digression. We talked about Peely? Our banana? Remember that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpltRh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGD6uA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; And there might have been an implication that to show Peely without a suit would have been inappropriate. Do you recall that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrFwda"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaZwfn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; Is there anything inappropriate about Peely without a suit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAlVPW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; No, there is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31doiF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; If we could just put on the screen a picture of Peely — is there anything inappropriate about Peely without clothes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hlMm3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weissinger:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s just a banana, ma’am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rso1D4"&gt;This does, somewhat astonishingly, relate to the core issues in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple.&lt;/em&gt; Epic is suing to make Apple open up iOS to alternative app stores like the Epic Games Store. Apple claims this would expose users to malicious and low-quality apps. It used Itch.io to paint Epic as a sloppy guardian of its users’ safety, and Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers seemed to take Apple’s concern at least somewhat seriously. It’s unclear whether Rogers actually thought there was a graphically naked banana-person in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, but Epic’s attorney clearly didn’t want to take that chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2FXFTR"&gt;But the Peely exchange still epitomized just how rambling and off-topic some of today’s testimony felt. Apple’s tutorial was clearly aimed at showing that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;is mostly a game and not an “experience” or “metaverse” — encouraging the judge to weigh the App Store’s game-related policies against similar rules on consoles, rather than scrutinizing the whole iOS ecosystem. Still, the result felt like a college freshman padding an English essay with a blow-by-blow plot summary — or in this case, a blow-by-blow description of how to complete a skydiving challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVWnjH"&gt;And despite Apple and Epic’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5"&gt;often very funny debate&lt;/a&gt; over the definition of a game, the case will probably hinge on drier-sounding questions like those discussed by Epic’s first expert witness, the economist David Evans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zkyo08"&gt;Evans argued that Apple is running an unfair single-brand monopoly: basically, it sells pricey devices that lock users into an ecosystem with no reasonable alternatives for getting certain apps, beyond tossing their phone or tablet and spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on a new one. Developers can offer cheaper in-app purchases on the web or a different platform, but Apple won’t let iOS apps direct users to these savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfE9wV"&gt;Judge Rogers asked some skeptical questions about Evans’ testimony, and Epic will almost certainly try to hammer his points harder. Hopefully, both parties will let Peely slip — but who knows, maybe the banana clothing issue will remain a split in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s asteroid-punching spacecraft begins its trek back home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-QVFMIAb5UWD52VyjCaeh7pwLUw=/0x171:1024x854/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69266049/2048x2048__1024x1024_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Bennu asteroid, captured by NASA’s Osiris-REx spacecraft | NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RdewQA"&gt;The NASA spacecraft that snatched a sample of rocks from the distant Bennu asteroid last year fired up a suite of thrusters on Monday and committed to its two-year journey back home. The maneuver kicks the minivan-sized spacecraft, dubbed Osiris-REx, onto a winding cosmic path around the Sun and toward Earth’s orbit. When it returns to Earth in 2023, it’ll toss a capsule packed with asteroid samples through the atmosphere somewhere over Utah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5jL3KB"&gt;The spacecraft’s Asteroid Departure Maneuver (ADM) was no sweat for the Osiris-REx team, but it marked a significant step towards the return of the first pristine cache of asteroid samples in NASA’s history. Spacecraft engineers inside a Lockheed Martin center in Littleton, Colorado confirmed the seven-minute thruster firing began at 4PM ET Monday and celebrated success shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbaBwO"&gt;“All stations, the ADM burn has completed. We had a nominal ADM burn, and we’re bringing our samples home!” declared Navigation Team Chief Pete Antreasian, prompting applause inside the control room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNYcCq"&gt;Osiris-REx launched from Florida in 2016 to journey over 100 million miles to Bennu, an acorn-shaped asteroid named after a mythological Egyptian deity that symbolized the world’s creation. Scientists hope Bennu, an ancient remnant from the earliest days of the solar system, will hold clues to the origins of life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="A9BIiA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new chapter in NASA’s Osiris-REx mission&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1PkPK"&gt;Last year, Osiris-REx entered Bennu’s orbit, becoming the first US spacecraft to circle an asteroid. It gradually approached the space rock’s surface and extended an 11-foot robotic arm with a showerhead-shaped collection device on the end. In a dramatic event that lasted only a few seconds, the sampling head touched down on Bennu’s surface and emitted a blast of pressurized gas strong enough to kick up rocks and asteroid debris to catch them in the sampling head’s container. Bennu’s surface was surprisingly soft, and the touch-and-go maneuver splashed up more rocks than scientists expected. The asteroid scoop was so hearty — collecting about two ounces — that rocks jammed the sampling container door open.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Osiris-REx’s sampling arm plucks a sample from the Bennu asteroid on October 20th, 2020.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hWqz2k"&gt;But engineers managed to close up the rock suitcase and stow it safely inside the spacecraft’s capsule. Osiris-REx stayed in Bennu’s neighborhood for a few more months to bask in the cloud of asteroid dust it punched up, and to study the crater it left on the asteroid’s surface. Now, it’s finally on its way home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvSLxX"&gt;“It’s a new chapter in the mission,” says Osiris-REx project scientist Jason Dworkin, who maintains the scientific integrity of the sampling mission, serving as the operational glue between the spacecraft engineering team and the teams of scientists eagerly awaiting the asteroid samples. “I’ve been waiting a long time to get this sample to the laboratory,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I started in 2004. My daughter was in diapers, and now she’s graduating from high school.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VYF5B5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is really the finality — we’re done at Bennu, we aren’t going back”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Buy2Qy"&gt;The first thruster burn on Monday was precisely timed to put Osiris-REx in Earth’s path two and a half years from now, a little over 6,000 miles from the surface. The spacecraft will orbit the Sun twice along the way, using its thrusters to intricately nudge itself closer and closer to Earth and tallying 1.4 billion miles total in its return expedition. “This is really the finality — we’re done at Bennu, we aren’t going back,” says Sandy Freund, Lockheed Martin’s Osiris-REx Mission Operations Program Manager. “There’s a little bit of sadness, in that we’ve gotten to know this asteroid, we’ve learned so much. But then there’s that excitement of what we’re going to learn when these samples are here on Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwbhnF"&gt;The spacecraft will eject its dishwasher-sized asteroid sample capsule and send it careening through Earth’s atmosphere for a landing at the Utah Test and Training Range on September 24th, 2023. Osiris-REx will stay in space. If it manages to save enough fuel during its years-long return from Bennu, NASA might assign it a new mission to another asteroid sometime in the future, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-osiris-rex-spacecraft-heads-for-earth-with-asteroid-sample"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i4ctLf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That means every decision I make has the weight of history on it”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ejwWRz"&gt;As soon as it touches down in Utah, NASA teams will carefully transport the capsule and its precious cargo to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, where the agency’s Moon rocks currently live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDBGRw"&gt;Only 25 percent of the Bennu material will be used for immediate inspection by scientists around the world. The other 75 percent will be stored for future scientists, some of whom haven’t been born. The researchers hope later generations can explore the samples using technologies that haven’t yet been invented — an apt way to anticipate innovation and prolong the scientific value of rare cosmic rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9UrAo"&gt;“That means every decision I make has the weight of history on it,” Dworkin says. “So I want to make sure that I arm all future scientists with the best tools I can, so they can use the samples as best as possible. That’s one of the things that a project scientist does — they help enable more science to be done than they can personally do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2pLQ8"&gt;“I look forward to in 50 years, or longer, maybe your readers, or your readers’ children or grandchildren, may be inspired to ask new questions with new techniques on these old samples,” he says. “It would be thrilling.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next PlayStation VR will be 4K and include eye-tracking, according to UploadVR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SAxi156pf5EoeonFtxBNSWVNLv0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69266023/vpavic_4278_20201030_0301.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8sgXPO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/psvr-playstation-4k-eye/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; has some exciting rumors&lt;/a&gt; about what Sony will be including on the next-gen VR &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296998/sony-ps5-next-gen-vr-headset-virtual-reality-features"&gt;headset it’s announced for the PS5&lt;/a&gt;: it’ll apparently include 4K resolution, eye-tracking, and a vibration motor in the headset for haptic feedback (to complement the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337700/sony-new-ps5-playstation-5-vr-controllers-features"&gt;controllers with haptic triggers&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFw0OB"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;, the new headset should have a total resolution of 4000 x 2040, giving each eye 2000 x 2040 pixels. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/5/13167954/playstation-vr-review-ps4-psvr-virtual-reality-headset-controllers"&gt;The original PlayStation VR &lt;/a&gt;had a resolution of 960 x 1080 pixels per eye, for comparison, so this would be nearly double in each direction. The Oculus Quest 2 has 1832 x 1920 pixels per eye, slightly less than Sony’s headset is rumored to have — in both cases, the high resolution can help to avoid the “screen-door effect” that can often keep VR headsets from providing a clear image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAUMEf"&gt;It is worth noting, though, that unlike the Quest 2, Sony had previously announced the PlayStation headset will still be wired, using a single cable to connect to the PS5 system. It’ll be a USB-C cable, according to &lt;em&gt;UploadVR, &lt;/em&gt;which shouldn’t come as a surprise given that Sony conspicuously placed one on the front of the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9BDH8v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Eye-tracking and foveated rendering&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYw9Bq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR &lt;/em&gt;also has interesting information about how the PlayStation VR successor will fill its additional pixels. Its sources say that the headset will track the users’ eyes so it can do &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/22/12260430/nvidia-foveated-rendering-vr-graphics-smi-eye-tracking-siggraph"&gt;foveated rendering&lt;/a&gt;, where the image will only be fully sharp where you’re looking, and be blurrier in your peripheral vision. This simulates how your eyes actually perceive the world and lets the computer (or in this case, console) work more efficiently by not having to fully render things at high resolution that you aren’t looking at anyhow. There are, of course, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18655871/htc-vive-pro-eye-vr-headset-eye-tracking-price-release-us-canada"&gt;other neat things you can do&lt;/a&gt; with eye-tracking (including creating more lifelike player avatars), but it’s currently unclear what Sony plans to do along those lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxI2M9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; also claims that the next-gen headset will use inside-out tracking, which would certainly be an upgrade from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/5/13167954/playstation-vr-review-ps4-psvr-virtual-reality-headset-controllers"&gt;re-purposed PlayStation Move system&lt;/a&gt; of the original, which required a fixed camera that could only properly track your head and hands if you held a pair of glowing sticks in a fairly small area between you and the console. Inside-out tracking typically uses cameras mounted on the outside of the headset itself to figure out where you are inside a room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l73x4H"&gt;If these rumors turn out to be true, it sounds like it could be a promising accessory for those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428322/sony-ps5-supply-constraints-2022-hiroki-totoki"&gt;lucky enough to get their hands on a PS5&lt;/a&gt;. While it’d be nice to see a cable-free Quest 2 competitor, it’s hard to blame Sony for focusing on something that will compliment its console. Personally, I’m already sold, and am starting to set aside some pennies (okay, more realistically, twenties).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3iHRz5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; the rumored resolution for the headset is 4000 x 2040, is nearly double the original in each direction. UploadVR’s original story had a typo pegging the resolution to 4000 x 2080, which has also been corrected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqzQBu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA clears Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for kids ages 12 to 15</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="VACCINATION SITE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VduHHJbkPTZ-ZOuWl1NMIkdpCwM=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69265613/1232407398.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Caroline Brehman/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UER19F"&gt;The Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine can now be administered to 12- to 15-year-olds, the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use"&gt;Food and Drug Administration announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, the shot was authorized for people 16 years of age and older. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBKN8c"&gt;The companies asked the FDA to expand the authorization to include the new ages in early April, just after they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359883/covid-vaccine-pfizer-adolescents-effective"&gt;released data&lt;/a&gt; showing that their vaccine was highly effective for that group. All of the 12- to 15-year-olds given the two-dose vaccine in a small study generated strong antibody response with no serious side effects, and none developed COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nH89KN"&gt;Later this week, a committee from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/agenda-archive/agenda-2021-05-12-508.pdf"&gt;will meet to make recommendations&lt;/a&gt; on how the vaccine should be rolled out to this age group.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9CxxH"&gt;The United States will likely need to vaccinate kids and teenagers to reach herd immunity and end the pandemic — the expanded authorization is another step toward &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/29/opinion/covid-vaccines-kids.html"&gt;that goal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sNrEp8"&gt;“Having a vaccine authorized for a younger population is a critical step in continuing to lessen the immense public health burden caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8Vmw4"&gt;Although kids are less likely to get seriously sick from COVID-19 than adults, they can still catch the virus and suffer &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/health/covid-children-inflammatory-syndrome.html"&gt;long-term symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. If they’re infected with the virus, they can also pass it along to others, so vaccinating kids is a way to stop them from getting family members or others sick. Approximately 1.5 million people in the US between the ages of 11 and 17 have gotten COVID-19 since March 2020.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkSzpp"&gt;Pfizer and BioNTech also have studies in progress testing their COVID-19 vaccine in younger age groups, starting with infants six months old. Moderna, which has a COVID-19 vaccine authorized for people 18 years and older, is testing its shot in children and adolescents aged six months through 17 years old. Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson has plans for similar studies, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQJs17"&gt;&lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;152,819,904 people&lt;/a&gt; in the US have received at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IVwbUt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The cybersecurity ‘pandemic’ that led to the Colonial Pipeline disaster</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cyberattack Forces Shutdown Of Major U.S. Fuel Pipeline" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_H8k-NJH70ZUZn3tnpDN5ru-6Lo=/0x0:5808x3872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69265848/1317302232.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;WOODBRIDGE, NEW JERSEY - MAY 10: Fuel holding tanks are seen at Colonial Pipeline’s Linden Junction Tank Farm on May 10, 2021 in Woodbridge, New Jersey. Alpharetta, Georgia-based Colonial Pipeline, which has the largest fuel pipeline, was forced to shut down its oil and gas pipeline system on Friday after a ransomware attack that has slowed down the transportation of oil in the eastern U.S. | Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hmwO8w"&gt;The cyberattack that forced the Colonial Pipeline offline is just one failure to address existing weaknesses and an escalating “ransomware pandemic,” experts tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That leaves the nation’s energy infrastructure especially vulnerable, even though there are basic steps that could have been taken to prevent the crisis that’s unfolding now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ar8FDS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Yet another example of what is really a ransomware pandemic”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cz4dIz"&gt;“Honestly, I think for anyone who’s been tracking ransomware closely, this really shouldn’t be a surprise,” says Philip Reiner, CEO of the nonprofit Institute for Security and Technology. “This is yet another example of what is really a ransomware pandemic that needs to be addressed at the highest level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tri4o6"&gt;An escalating threat from bad actors, like the criminal group &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/08/cyber-attack-colonial-pipeline/"&gt;DarkSide&lt;/a&gt; that’s believed to be behind the attack on Colonial Pipeline, is coinciding with more potential weak points in the energy sector’s cyber infrastructure. Reiner says ransomware poses growing risks to critical infrastructure beyond energy, including health care and financial systems. Hackers have targeted tech, too. A subcontractor for Apple was hit with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396283/apple-schematics-leak-ransomware-quanta-supplier-leak"&gt;$50 million ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt; just last month. But the energy sector seems particularly vulnerable to all kinds of cyber threats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grXK4D"&gt;“This is the kind of thing that keeps folks like us awake at night,” says Tucker Bailey, a partner and cybersecurity expert at consultancy McKinsey &amp;amp; Company. “We’ve known that the [vulnerabilities] have been there for a while.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMyxVF"&gt;Almost half of all the East Coast’s fuel typically travels through the Colonial Pipeline, which has been shuttered since May 7th. The pipeline company’s IT system fell victim to ransomware, a type of cyber attack in which hackers demand payment to bring systems back online. DarkSide also stole data from the company and threatened to publish it online, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-09/colonial-hackers-stole-data-thursday-ahead-of-pipeline-shutdown?sref=ylv224K8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1u6zK"&gt;The frequency and severity of attacks against utility systems is on the rise, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.naruc.org/about-naruc/press-releases/new-nrri-cyber-paper-helps-regulators-better-understand-threats-and-cybersecurity-technologies/"&gt;National Regulatory Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;. Fifty-six percent of utility professionals surveyed by &lt;a href="https://assets.new.siemens.com/siemens/assets/api/uuid:35089d45-e1c2-4b8b-b4e9-7ce8cae81eaa/version:1600101948/siemens-cybersecurity.pdf"&gt;Siemens&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 said they had experienced at least one attack over the previous year that led to an outage or a loss of private information. More than a third of the &lt;a href="https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&amp;amp;did=819640"&gt;796 “cyber incidents”&lt;/a&gt; reported to the Department of Homeland Security between 2013 and 2015 took place in the energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XEzA4"&gt;A collision of a couple key factors could drive those numbers up. First, there are more state actors, cybercriminals, and hacktivists targeting critical infrastructure, according to experts. Second, an increasingly digital power sector opens up more opportunities for hackers to attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQCBu9"&gt;“As everything is becoming more computerized, the controls for our critical infrastructure are also more computerized and steps need to be taken to ensure that they are protected from cyber attacks,” says Leslie Gordon, acting director for homeland security and justice at the watchdog Government Accountability Office (GAO). She says what happened to Colonial Pipeline is “an example of a failure to protect critical infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oc2kIG"&gt;Companies are regularly failing to practice even basic security hygiene, which leaves critical infrastructure open to attack. Good security hygiene can include relatively simple things like requiring multi-factor authentication, having response plans ready, and keeping backup systems in place. With Colonial Pipeline, failing to keep its network segmented — so that bad actors can’t easily hop from one piece of the system to the next — was a big problem that shows a lack of cyber hygiene, according to Reiner. Colonial’s IT system was attacked, but that was connected to the company’s operating system, so it shut that down, too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="JfHwb1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“One of the greatest causes of cyber crime”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BQeZ1Q"&gt;“One of the things we see here is another example of basic steps not being taken in order to secure your systems,” Reiner says. “Cyber hygiene, or the lack thereof, is really one of the greatest causes of cyber crime. It’s not so much that these guys are so good. It’s just people leave very basic things undone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcTzA1"&gt;President Joe Biden is expected to announce an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/09/us/politics/biden-cyberattack-response.html"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; that could require contractors the federal government works with to take those kinds of safety measures, and last month, the administration launched a 100-day &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-administration-takes-bold-action-protect-electricity-operations-increasing-cyber-0"&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; to tackle “increasing cyber threats” to the US electric system. It includes working with utilities to build up their capacity to stop, detect, and respond to attacks. The Department of Energy also &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-cybersecurity-programs-enhancing-safety-and-resilience-us-energy-sector"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; new research programs in March to make the energy sector more resilient to hazards, both physical and cyber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hifmI"&gt;But a workforce shortage is another lingering problem for the energy sector that could jeopardize those plans. There’s an estimated shortage of 498,480 cybersecurity workers in the US, a 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/cybersecurity-workforce-shortage-continues-to-grow/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; found. The Transportation Security Administration, which oversees pipeline security, is short on inspectors and lacks a strategic workforce development plan to help it “carry out its pipeline security responsibilities,” a 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-19-48.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the GAO found. Three years after the agency recommended that the TSA fill that gap, the GAO says that has yet to happen (although the TSA reports that it’s in the middle of completing a workforce plan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f99psy"&gt;Until these basic problems are solved, the threat of cyberattacks will loom large over the energy system and other critical infrastructure. And while the attacks are virtual, the consequences can be quickly felt on the ground. The longer the Colonial Pipeline stays out of commission, the bigger the risk of gas stations, jet fuel, and even home heating oil running dry. The pipeline company did not respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by time of publication but said in a &lt;a href="https://www.colpipe.com/news/press-releases/media-statement-colonial-pipeline-system-disruption"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that it’s bringing parts of its pipeline online in stages — with hopes that most operations will be restored by the end of the week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="RjqAct"&gt;Here are a few screenshots from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/AUKEY/AUKEY/page/B4F70606-6B67-46A0-BD18-938B37E59982"&gt;Aukey’s Amazon page&lt;/a&gt;, taken shortly after 12PM ET on Monday. Aukey is a major seller of chargers, portable batteries, and more, but its Amazon page has a whole lot of blank product boxes and products listed as “currently unavailable.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/czfHWNcZoohsOdyHJDl8MvFFZ9c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504162/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.09.15_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A section of Aukey’s largely empty Amazon page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9qrCJIc1ZyxTG34prrBjCXVxUwg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504190/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.17.42_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only two Aukey cables listed here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AuCTV57vSyxvixZNzugxD-kt07Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504192/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.17.57_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many Aukey products are “currently unavailable.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="clTRut"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=aukey&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss"&gt;And if I search “Aukey” on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, the top results are for two massage guns, a home oven, and a keyboard — not chargers or cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTd3c0"&gt;Mpow, another big seller known for headphones, car mounts, and more, similarly has an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Mpow/page/77AF42AF-B598-48DD-AA53-3386F4E24647?ref_=ast_bln"&gt;Amazon page filled with “currently unavailable” listings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IL1qkKShAAfIFy5_AsuAiWW5t-k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504283/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.46.45_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A section of Mpow’s Amazon page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F11zcr"&gt;It’s not clear why Aukey’s and Mpow’s listings have disappeared. Their disappearance is particularly weird when I can see that listings from other big sellers in the accessories space, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/D24FDA17-DECF-46BB-AF47-AF4647D2B1F8?ingress=0&amp;amp;visitId=302e230f-dd66-4bf8-911f-8f7c1c2e1df8"&gt;Anker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Belkin/Belkin/page/2995B430-5393-4D60-8CDE-EE1F10036867"&gt;Belkin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/RAVPower/RAVPower/page/15E5B6FA-77BA-4AAD-953D-891C2FD80553"&gt;RAVPower&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Satechi/Satechi/page/4B138353-DD30-49D8-9A92-659E1326A9E8"&gt;Satechi&lt;/a&gt;, appear to be working as normal as of Monday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1VG9v"&gt;Aukey and Mpow have not responded to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDWPeI"&gt;Amazon would not confirm or deny whether it had removed these items — but it did provide a statement in response to our question that at least suggests these companies may have had some funny business going on: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xTs3w8"&gt;We work hard to build a great experience for our customers and sellers and take action to protect them from those that threaten their experience in our store. We have systems and processes to detect suspicious behavior and we have teams that investigate and take action quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ewkn0w"&gt;We have long-standing policies to protect the integrity of our store, including product authenticity, genuine reviews, and products meeting the expectations of our customers. We take swift action against those that violate them, including suspending or removing selling privileges. We take this responsibility seriously, monitor our decision accuracy and maintain a high bar. We have an appeals process where sellers can explain how they will prevent the violation from happening in the future or let us know if they believe they were compliant. Our teams are based in our Seattle headquarters and around the globe in order to provide sellers with 24/7 support via email, phone, and chat in more than 15 languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="W8MVMQ"&gt;Amazon is rife with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21423429/amazon-top-reviewers-uk-fraud"&gt;scams&lt;/a&gt;, and the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302114/amazon-counterfeit-crimes-unit-knockoffs-store-online-investigators"&gt;puts a lot of resources&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317617/amazon-counterfeit-products-marketplace-sellers-names-addresses-transparency"&gt;into fighting them&lt;/a&gt; — Amazon &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-publishes-comprehensive-brand-protection-report"&gt;just today&lt;/a&gt; revealed that it blocked more than 10 billion suspected bad listings before they were ever published in 2020, for example. Aukey and Mpow aren’t exactly small third-party sellers, though, which make their disappearing listings even more mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeRVaz"&gt;Last week, an unconfirmed report from &lt;a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/blog/amazon-reviews-leak-report/"&gt;antivirus review website &lt;em&gt;SafetyDetectives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; apparently revealed how some Amazon vendors figured out a quiet way to solicit and pay for fake five-star reviews — something that’s obviously against Amazon’s rules. While it’s not clear if the missing listings are connected in any way to the report — which does not name vendors who may be participating in the practice — we found &lt;a href="https://medium.com/the-shadow/my-experience-with-amazons-manipulated-review-farm-30ddd74263a8"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.winchestersun.com/2020/07/10/koutoulas-amazons-fake-user-review-problem/"&gt;accounts&lt;/a&gt; describing how Mpow used review-soliciting tactics similar what was uncovered in &lt;em&gt;SafetyDetectives&lt;/em&gt;’ article, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/corbindavenport/status/1391838929360457743"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; journalist Corbin Davenport said&lt;/a&gt; that an Aukey standing desk he’s reviewing included a message offering $100 in exchange for an “honest review.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6Xoxg5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I'm currently reviewing a standing desk from Aukey, and it came with this note offering $100 for an "honest review," which is against Amazon's seller rules.

    <title>Walmart’s in-house Android TV device might only cost $30</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PjF4YkNS0GtxdIC_PMAoqYDJnac=/0x0:2250x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69265663/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_12.43.56_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M4oOQ0"&gt;Walmart appears to be getting into the streaming devices with the Onn Android TV UHD Streaming Device, according to &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fonn-Android-TV-UHD-Streaming-Device%2F636597403%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_U8Ox5dwMNxyORY7wUx0Mo3chUkBxOaQdw0f2240%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_1914133%26clickid%3DU8Ox5dwMNxyORY7wUx0Mo3chUkBxOaQdw0f2240%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D566719%26campaign_id%3D9383%26irgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_3IU3SsT35xyLUbdwUx0Mo36dUkBx-x3ZR3zQQg0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_2091438%26clickid%3D3IU3SsT35xyLUbdwUx0Mo36dUkBx-x3ZR3zQQg0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new listing&lt;/a&gt; on its website (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/06/walmart-android-tv-streamer-listing-4k/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company’s new streaming box (in this case, really more of a flattened cube) is currently listed for $29.88 but is also “out of stock” — which could be due to the fact it hasn’t been officially announced yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uupTuB"&gt;According to Walmart’s page, the Onn Android TV UHD Streaming Device can, unsurprisingly, stream in 4K and play “Dolby audio” — although there are no other specifics shared. The small device runs Android TV, connects to a TV over HDMI, and comes with what looks like a Google Assistant-enabled remote with dedicated buttons for YouTube, Netflix, Disney Plus, and HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CsH4YaJEGPY-HKSFNemSjLnj8CE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505104/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_12.43.22_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Walmart&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart’s streaming device is a fairly unassuming black square.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vh4pDu"&gt;Design-wise, as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes, Walmart’s streaming device shares a lot of similarities with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004376/google-adt-3-android-tv-10-update-set-top-hdmi-2-1"&gt;Google’s developer device, the ADT-3&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with Walmart’s electronics brand, “onn,” slapped on top. The remote that accompanies the Onn also seems to be using a new Google design &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/25/google-tv-remotes-2021-gallery/"&gt;that’s been rumored&lt;/a&gt; to come with a host of new Google TV products in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3yKVupwfzrCZ3FS5w5Ecq6FeZic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505101/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_12.44.08_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Walmart&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Onn Android TV UHD Streaming Device has more dedicated streaming service buttons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cRkUt4"&gt;Walmart has been in a multiyear &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/3/17630604/amazon-walmart-competition-tech-partnerships-grocery-delivery"&gt;competition with Amazon&lt;/a&gt; over basically all forms of shopping online and off, so muscling into the streaming device market with what’s essentially a Fire Stick competitor shouldn’t be surprising. For Walmart, the streaming space has standardized and streamlined enough that it’s probably comparatively easy to come out with a cheap streaming cube, stock it in thousands of stores, and let customers do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lppr8r"&gt;It’s hard to not put Walmart’s device in the context of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22425753/tivo-stream-4k-dongle-android-tv-no-more-jon-kirchner"&gt;TiVo’s apparent exit&lt;/a&gt; from the streaming device space. Streaming sticks and boxes are increasingly becoming a game for big companies who can reach the scale and low costs that smaller companies can’t keep up with. They also tend to have a better handle on software — for Xperi, the TiVo brand’s current owner, Google integrating universal search aped the big feature that differentiated it from the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a312Z2"&gt;The TiVo Stream 4K launched for $70, only to later drop to $39 in what seems like a bid to compete with the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;$50 Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16587340/roku-streaming-stick-plus-2017-4k-hdr-review-price-relase"&gt;$40 Roku Streaming Stick Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review"&gt;$50 Fire Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;. Assuming $30 is the Onn Android TV UHD Streaming Device’s actual price and it’s actually worth using, Walmart may be poised to start yet another race to the bottom. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony now lets you use the DualSense pad to play PS5 on your nearby Mac, iPhone, iPad, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xn7yKyzSC-ZnTSHtZKmvKXzkscw=/0x212:2200x1679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69265140/20210510_Sean_Hollister_Verge_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TtiSeS"&gt;It’s a little-known fact that you can sling a PS5 or PS4 to another room of your house, streaming your games to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/1/11138016/playstation-4-remote-play-pc-mac-feature"&gt;Mac or Windows PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20902406/sony-ps4-firmware-update-remote-play-android"&gt;iOS or Android device&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556803/sony-ps5-remote-play-ps4-app-streaming-games"&gt;or even an old PS4&lt;/a&gt; with Sony’s PS Remote Play app. But until recently, you could only remotely control your shiny new PlayStation 5 with the old DualShock 4 gamepad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dloisn"&gt;That’s now changing, as Sony has just announced the PS5’s new DualShock controller is supported &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pair-dualsense-controller-bluetooth/"&gt;across every Apple platform running the latest operating system&lt;/a&gt;, including iPhones, iPads, iPod touches, and Apple TVs running 14.5 and Macs running macOS Big Sur 11.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZlGGmR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Remote Play is now available using the DualSense wireless controller to play compatible games on a range of Apple devices. Full details: &lt;a href="https://t.co/4fpa77oFqx"&gt;https://t.co/4fpa77oFqx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Z2BlehDLjO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Z2BlehDLjO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1391822847924973579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RGsa9D"&gt;I just gave it a quick try myself with an iPhone 12 mini and a recent iPad Pro, and I have some thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUleMM"&gt;The good news: if the only controller you own is a DualSense controller, it totally works — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21547303/sony-ps5-dualsense-adaptive-triggers-haptics-teardown-featuresver"&gt;your awesome adaptive triggers&lt;/a&gt; come along for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEuqyp"&gt;Here is some bad news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0ogOnp"&gt;There’s no haptic feedback. Absolutely zero. It feels extremely weird.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="izZOmp"&gt;Each time you want to switch devices (to your iPhone or back to your PS5), you’ll have to manually pair your DualSense again. That was true of previous pads as well, but I was hoping they’d fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QMN2GW"&gt;The built-in microphone, headphone jack, and speaker don’t work. The speaker is a serious loss — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;games like&lt;em&gt; Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;use it in combination with haptic feedback to add some serious immersion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HV1yCY"&gt;The streaming quality, as always, will depend heavily on your home wireless network. Give it a try, though; it’s free! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="o5EbHy"&gt;You’ll have to decide whether these things defeat the purpose of pairing a DualSense with an Apple device. As far as I’m concerned, I’ll keep my DualSense hooked up to the PS5 where it can actually help me sense things, and use a DualShock 4 (or third-party pad) when I want to stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sM77R2"&gt;It’s also more ammunition for the argument that we should be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352382/sony-ps5-playstation-4-controllers-new-ps4-support-games"&gt;play PS5 games on our PS5 with a PS4 pad&lt;/a&gt;. This is the second time Sony has shown that limitation is totally arbitrary: first when it allowed us to &lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/you-can-play-ps5-games-with-a-dualshock-4-if-you-use-remote-play/'"&gt;control PS5 games with the PS4 controller over Remote Play&lt;/a&gt; to start, and now again with this signal that the DualSense’s sensing abilities are optional when streaming games over a network.&lt;/p&gt;
