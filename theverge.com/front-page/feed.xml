    <title>Oscars 2021: how to watch the Academy Awards online</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dm8G5B"&gt;The 93rd Academy Awards (also known as the Oscars) will broadcast tonight, April 25th. This ceremony will recognize the films and their associated talent in a particularly strange and difficult year for the industry, which has been forced to adapt to some big changes during the pandemic. Cinemas weren’t where most people saw newly-released movies. Instead, many of those films were pushed faster than ever to digital distribution platforms like Vudu, Apple TV, and Google TV for purchase or rental. Some were even made available simultaneously with the theatrical release, like some Warner Bros. films on &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=HowToWatchOscars2021"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dh2iIE"&gt;This year’s Oscars are happening later in the year than usual, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/15/21291946/academy-awards-oscars-ceremony-delayed-eligibility-dates-change"&gt;apparently to make room for more movies&lt;/a&gt;, since the pandemic dried up the release schedule. In addition, this year’s ceremony marks the first time that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240422/oscars-streaming-theaters-rules-2021-netflix-digital-release-academy"&gt;some streaming-only movies&lt;/a&gt; will qualify for an Oscar award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQJRmr"&gt;Despite all that, we’re here to tell you how to watch the show that celebrates the movies of the year and the people who helped make them possible. First, we’ll dig into when and how you can watch the stream, then we’ll dig into the nominations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HFbpoY"&gt;WHO’S HOSTING THE OSCARS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i8H1vZ"&gt;In 2019, the Academy Awards were host-less for the first time in 30 years, and this year will be the same. Instead of relying on a single host, there will be a cast of presenters, including Angela Bassett, Halle Berry, Bong Joon Ho, Don Cheadle, Steven Yeun, Bryan Cranston, Laura Dern, Harrison Ford, Regina King, Marlee Matlin, Rita Morena, Joaquin Phoenix, Brad Pitt, Reese Witherspoon, Renée Zellweger, and Zendaya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KMEWdh"&gt;WHAT TIME DO THE OSCARS START?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jh8GOV"&gt;ABC is handling the televised stream, which starts at 8PM ET / 5PM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dBjgLu"&gt;HOW DO I WATCH THE ACADEMY AWARDS ONLINE?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ioZcHO"&gt;ABC is accessible for free in the US via an over-the-air antenna, but otherwise, you’ll have to be a subscriber to a service to gain access to the awards show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMbovt"&gt;You can watch it on the ABC channel on cable or satellite, or you can watch through your browser by &lt;a href="http://abc.com/watch-live"&gt;logging in to ABC’s site&lt;/a&gt; with your cable or satellite credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqer38"&gt;Alternatively, several streaming services offer ABC with a subscription. Availability varies by region, but most people who subscribe to YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, Sling TV, and FuboTV should have access. And if you only want to watch for this one night, you’ll be happy to know that all of these services offer free trials of varying lengths (though all require credit card information to sign up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="G0Icxh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;offerid=852731.37&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;u1=VergeOscars2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hulu with Live TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c9WD9u"&gt;&lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/intro/"&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TYj5yb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/http://sling.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sling TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7VeSpx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fubo.tv/welcome?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fubo.tv%2Fstream%2Foscars-on-abc%2F%3Firad%3D1043433%26irmp%3D482924%26subId1%3DVerge&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;FuboTV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="XiaNFG"&gt;Finally, if you can wait until May 2nd, that’s when ABC will make the Oscars free to watch on its site without requiring a log-in, &lt;a href="https://support.abc.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057911871-Can-I-watch-The-Oscars-awards-ceremony-on-demand-"&gt;according to its FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mo6IaJ"&gt;HOW DO I WATCH THE CEREMONY OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="I4c9qy"&gt;ABC hasn’t updated its list of international partners that will broadcast the Oscars, though &lt;a href="https://www.oscars.org/news/93rd-oscarsr-all-star-cast-revealed"&gt;its site says&lt;/a&gt; that the Oscars will be televised live in more than 225 countries and territories worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="roAhtL"&gt;WHAT ARE THE OSCAR NOMINATIONS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xBiHwr"&gt;Our sister site &lt;em&gt;Polygon &lt;/em&gt;has put together a comprehensive post that has all of the 2021 nominations. You can &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/22325242/oscar-nominations-2021-list"&gt;check that out right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With Batman: Zero Point, Fortnite’s lore makes a lot more sense</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fSonHD0SicbP_GCoiwFa0NfBt38=/0x1320:3089x3379/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69183355/BMFNZP_Cv1__FINAL_MAIN_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFvpna"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comics have never been bigger: with Marvel TV shows, DC movies, and indie adaptations growing by the day, comic books have never been more prominent in pop culture. This biweekly Verge column recommends comic series new and old, whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPzUSO"&gt;I’ve played a lot of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; over the years, but I’ve never really thought about the internal lives of the many characters that inhabit the battle royale island. I was always too busy seeking shelter and supplies or exploring whatever big event was happening at the time. But now that I’ve read &lt;em&gt;Zero Point&lt;/em&gt;, a crossover between Batman and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, I can’t stop thinking about what’s actually happening to them as they fight to the death over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fjlf48"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it?&lt;/strong&gt; Z&lt;em&gt;ero Point &lt;/em&gt;is a new six-issue series — the first is available now — that attempts to make sense of the convoluted world of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. At the outset, a mysterious crack appears in Gotham’s skies, and Batman heads out to investigate. He spots Harley Quinn by the disturbance and is eventually pulled into it against his will. As you can probably guess, on the other side of the rift is the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="m6A5T0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10462338"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JkFGvO"&gt;Batman immediately notices some strange things about this unknown place. He seems to be suffering from some form of amnesia; aside from some muscle memory — i.e., the ability to fight and use gadgets — he can’t remember anything about who he is. He also can’t talk, and for some reason, everyone is trying to kill each other. At one point, he posits a possible explanation: “I’ve gone mad.” It isn’t until he sees Catwoman that his memory is jostled just a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjoufY"&gt;The issue ends without much resolution, but it poses a lot of questions I’ve never really considered much before. Why &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; the characters talk? And is there a reason everyone is actually trying to kill each other? The developers at Epic Games have steadily been building out the lore of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; through in-game events and other means, even tying in some of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;the many licensed characters that have been added&lt;/a&gt;. But the comic goes in a different direction. Reading it is like seeing what goes through Batman’s head in the middle of a battle royale match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ziurb2"&gt;It’s completely weird and utterly fascinating — and I’m very curious where it’s headed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpNCNd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s it by? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zero Point&lt;/em&gt; is written by Christos Gage, with art by Nelson Faro DeCastro, Reilly Brown, and John Kalisz. Donald Mustard — the chief creative officer at Epic — is listed as a story consultant. (He also apparently made &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldMustard/status/1385013506961858563"&gt;a variant cover&lt;/a&gt; for the second issue.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0Xy8G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I read it?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Zero Point&lt;/em&gt; is available both in physical and digital forms, but there are some small complications. If you grab either a physical issue or read through DC Universe Infinite, you’ll get some bonus in-game items via a code; for issue one, that means a Harley Quinn &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; character. However, if you pick up an issue via Comixology, you won’t get a code, just the book. Issue 1 is available now, with subsequent issues coming on May 4th, May 18th, June 1st, June 15th, and July 6th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Social media platforms become triage centers as India struggles with a COVID-19 surge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Family members of Covid-19 infected patients stand in a queue with empty oxygen cylinders outside the oxygen filling center in New Delhi on Friday." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B0Y7Q7YN60RlC247Zc_metkeebs=/14x0:2986x1981/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69183314/1232488568.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1kmP1W"&gt;Doctors, hospital owners, journalists, and other Twitter users in India have been tweeting and amplifying pleas for oxygen supplies on social platforms out of desperation, as new coronavirus cases and deaths there hit record highs. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-56841381"&gt;Oxygen supplies are at critical low levels&lt;/a&gt; in India, and some hospitals are overwhelmed with patients suffering from COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pR7xWJ"&gt;Using hashtags like #CovidSOS and #COVIDEmergency2021, many in India are seeking ICU beds, oxygen, and plasma, and others have tried to direct those in need to suppliers. &lt;a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/Hr4LlyNHLiuETGzmdVgpsR?fbclid=IwAR0ahsmXkoHIPgxyzBmG6kf7E9HNeVNtLVAI6MtGsxwQz4Ug7-mWDgzThgU"&gt;Groups on WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/humankindglobal"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; have been inundated with posts from people in need of ICU beds, oxygen, and other supplies, as organizations like HumanKind Global try to track down leads to help them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CDXbDh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Oxygen supply to last only half an hour now, more than 200 lives are at stake. We lost 20 people amid an oxygen shortage last night: DK Baluja, Jaipur Golden Hospital&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CovidSOS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CovidSOS&lt;/a&gt; Call from A Delhi Hospital &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVIDEmergency2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#COVIDEmergency2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/htE5HNgoze"&gt;https://t.co/htE5HNgoze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Hemant Rajaura (@hemantrajora_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hemantrajora_/status/1385823190455263233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YCQAyr"&gt;“Not only there is lack of oxygen supply for those who can’t get medical aid in a hospital, the hospitals too are scurrying for oxygen,” journalist Abhishek Baxi wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Over the past several days, Baxi said, pleas for oxygen supplies on Twitter have increased “because they’ve not had any response from the authorities. There are updates on news channels about X hospital left with only few hours of oxygen or Y hospital optimizing supply to patients because they’ve got only 2 hours of oxygen supply left. These hospitals, their hands tied, have requested patients to go elsewhere – something not possible in a city where all hospitals are bursting at the seams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KUOxU"&gt;On Saturday, 20 patients died in a hospital in New Delhi due to depleted oxygen supply, the &lt;a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/20-patient-die-at-delhi-s-jaipur-golden-hospital-due-to-oxygen-shortage-101619241779360.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvAgUF"&gt;India is reeling from a second wave of COVID-19 cases. According to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus resource center, India reported &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/india"&gt;349,691 new cases on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, a new record. The country reported 2,767 deaths from COVID-19 on Saturday, also a new record. Less than 1.6 percent of the country’s population has been fully vaccinated, the Johns Hopkins data show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Esdr2e"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-deaths.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported &lt;/a&gt;that the situation may be even more dire than the numbers suggest, with officials in India downplaying or overlooking COVID-19 deaths. And at the Indian government’s demand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;Twitter censored more than 50 posts&lt;/a&gt; critical of the government’s handling of the latest coronavirus surge, so the tweets were not visible within India. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The isolation of grief in the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CmKaVyf01WghYfte60lezM1UW_A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69183241/acastro_210422_4549_griefIsolation_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The pandemic separates us when we need people most&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Vtv0uG"&gt;Many people adopted a pet during the COVID-19 pandemic. My wife and I just lost one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFTbVm"&gt;Gouda, our eight-and-a-half-year-old exotic shorthair cat, died on April 16th. We rushed him to the hospital the previous morning after he spent another night vomiting. The doctors weren’t sure what was wrong, but, over the course of 24 hours, signs pointed to fatal kidney disease. We made the difficult choice to euthanize him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byhG2M"&gt;The events would have been horrible under any circumstances. But I found that the forced isolation of the pandemic made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202122/coronavirus-grief-mourning-isolation-funeral-die-alone"&gt;grieving a lost family member&lt;/a&gt; even more challenging than I could have possibly imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KW3Uli"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We were stranded in pods of sadness&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s3ylOP"&gt;My wife and I spent the majority of the 24 hours inside a Zipcar parked outside the animal hospital. Due to safety regulations, we couldn’t wait in the lobby, so we — and all of the other families worried about their pets — waited alone in our cars. Despite being feet away from each other, we were all worlds apart, stranded in pods of sadness made of metal and glass. Once, we watched as a woman handed off her cat to the veterinary staff, got back in her car, and broke down sobbing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TC2n68"&gt;We spent hours staring blankly at the tall hedges in front of our car. My wife’s iPhone was a lifeline and a curse. With each passing second, we desperately hoped for a call, but each time the phone finally rang, the news was worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRpbJA"&gt;As we attempted to sleep in the Zipcar overnight, the phone was perched on the dashboard. I stared at it in between fits of sleep, dreading when it would ring. We could never talk to the vets in person, meaning we couldn’t see body language, facial expressions, eye contact — nonverbal cues that would have helped us make the most difficult decision of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8iG8Uz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Our masks filled with snot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cr4jo7"&gt;When we went in to see Gouda for our final goodbye, we sat in a dimly lit room on a soft couch. Our masks constantly filled up with snot. From the other side of the room, the staff told us we couldn’t be with Gouda when he died. There would be no easy way to be six feet apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3UhCy"&gt;The only time we were close to another human being is when they handed Gouda to us, wrapped in a blanket, cone around his neck, and drugged out of his mind. As soon as we were alone with him, we ripped off our masks so we could kiss him one last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8uY69"&gt;We got the last phone call on the ride home from the hospital. Gouda had died peacefully. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlElFN"&gt;Right after, my wife and I realized we didn’t want to be home, but we had nowhere else to go. We’re not vaccinated from COVID-19 yet, so we can’t see our family or friends in person to find solace. We couldn’t escape our empty studio apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5AbA3"&gt;Out of habit, we opened the front door gingerly. Every day for more than eight and a half years, Gouda had always greeted us, sometimes throwing his whole body against the door in his excitement to see us. But he wasn’t there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jvZ4l"&gt;Instead, we saw his food bowl, his scratching post, his toys. Our apartment had been the one place we had felt truly safe during the pandemic, but it was now filled with reminders of our missing family member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSUkaU"&gt;So we began to clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="m1RiFr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We had to face this part of the grief as just the two of us&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uyJS6g"&gt;Usually, getting rid of things comes easily to my wife and me. We have internalized much of what Marie Kondo writes about in &lt;em&gt;The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up&lt;/em&gt;. But this was different. It was harder than any cleaning we had done before &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; the things we got rid of were the reminders of our missing family member. We couldn’t fully move on if we kept them, but that didn’t make it easy to let them go. And because of the pandemic, we couldn’t ask others to come over and help. We had to face this part of the grief as just the two of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvIt1L"&gt;I will never know how grieving this death would have been different if we weren’t still in the pandemic. I do think it made the worst moments even worse. It trapped us in our car. It kept us from him in the hospital. It separated us from our families. It locked us in our home with the memories of our lost family member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwBATZ"&gt;And yet, the pandemic forces us to face our grief head-on. My wife and I are healing, slowly. We spend the day crying and remembering. We say one nice thing about Gouda before bed. Because we are vulnerable with each other, I don’t feel like I’m bottling up any feelings, so my mind doesn’t race, and I can go to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CPNOsB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I thanked every one of Gouda’s things&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QpRPDX"&gt;Kondo recommends thanking objects that you remove from your house to acknowledge the role they played in your life. I did that for every one of Gouda’s things. “Thank you, scratching post,” I said. “Thank you, plastic Easter egg. Thank you, food placemat.” I even thanked his litter box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhsbvP"&gt;Thanking Gouda’s things may sound trivial. But it was one of the few rituals left to me during the pandemic, when so much has been taken away, and it helped me recognize everything that Gouda gave to me. He taught me responsibility, caring for and feeding him every day. He taught me how to play, crouching just out of sight around the bed so that he could spring toward me. He taught me about love, snuggled above my head on my pillow in the middle of the night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="a5y06w"&gt;Thank you, Gouda.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit faces lawsuit for failing to remove child sexual abuse material</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W_229QKPAWFPxKemCKsNgHl4pw8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69182835/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SOr9NM"&gt;A woman &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.818322/gov.uscourts.cacd.818322.1.0.pdf"&gt;has sued Reddit&lt;/a&gt; for allowing an ex-boyfriend to repeatedly post pornographic images of her as a 16-year-old. The lawsuit applies controversial measures &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17223720/trump-signs-fosta-sesta-sex-trafficking-section-230-law"&gt;instituted in 2018 under FOSTA-SESTA&lt;/a&gt; to a site that’s drawn particular criticism for child sexualization. The resulting case will test the limits of platforms’ legal shields amid ongoing efforts to pare back the law behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vmdkj"&gt;The woman, identified under the pseudonym Jane Doe, argues that “Reddit knowingly benefits from lax enforcement of its content polices, including for child pornography.” She claims that in 2019, an abusive ex-boyfriend posted sexual photos and videos that he’d taken without her knowledge or consent. But when she alerted Reddit moderators, they could wait “several days” before removing the content, while Reddit administrators allowed the man to keep posting and create a new account when his old account was banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S9duwY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Footage allegedly spread on the ‘darkest and most disturbing’ corners of Reddit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XmyyQH"&gt;“Because Reddit refused to help, it fell to Jane Doe to monitor no less than 36 subreddits — that she knows of — which Reddit allowed her ex-boyfriend to repeatedly use to repeatedly post child pornography,” the complaint reads. “Reddit’s refusal to act has meant that for the past several years Jane Doe has been forced to log on to Reddit and spend hours looking through some of its darkest and most disturbing subreddits so that she can locate the posts of her underage self and then fight with Reddit to have them removed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOIFWY"&gt;The woman is seeking a class action suit representing anyone who had similar photos or videos posted on Reddit while they were under 18 years of age. She’s accusing Reddit of distributing child pornography, failing to report child sexual abuse material, and violating the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. It’s unclear whether the ex-boyfriend — who would be fully liable for posting the images — has been sued or criminally charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mk4obF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Reddit has itself admitted that it is aware of the presence of child pornography’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4ESYay"&gt;The complaint cites FOSTA-SESTA, an amendment to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, as a central element of the lawsuit. Section 230 provides a broad legal shield for “interactive computer services” like Reddit, limiting their liability if users post illegal content. But the 2018 FOSTA-SESTA bill removed protections for sex trafficking-related material. The lawsuit apparently argues Jane Doe’s case meets that definition because Reddit’s advertising revenue turned the video into a “commercial sex act.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lg89jp"&gt;The lawsuit argues that Reddit knew its site was a hub for illegal photos and videos, based on news coverage and tips from users themselves, and it should have done more to protect victims. “Reddit has itself admitted that it is aware of the presence of child pornography on its website,” the complaint reads. Among other questionable content, it lists several now-removed subreddits with titles referencing “jailbait,” including &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/1py6tb/the_closing_of_rjailbait/"&gt;an infamous forum&lt;/a&gt; that was removed in 2011 after media controversy. (That subreddit did not allow nude images, but it encouraged sexually suggestive ones.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1XkiD"&gt;Reddit denies that it condoned abuse. “Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) has no place on the Reddit platform. We actively maintain policies and procedures that don’t just follow the law, but go above and beyond it,” a Reddit spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We deploy both automated tools and human intelligence to proactively detect and prevent the dissemination of CSAM material. When we find such material, we purge it and permanently ban the user from accessing Reddit. We also take the steps required under law to report the relevant user(s) and preserve any necessary user data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KPPHbG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reddit banned sexualized images of children in 2012&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eoXpag"&gt;Reddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/pmj7f/a_necessary_change_in_policy/"&gt;banned child sexualization&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, saying that interpreting “vague and debated legal guidelines” over what counted as illegal child pornography risked pulling Reddit into a “legal quagmire.” But the suit alleges that Reddit fails to enforce its guidelines, particularly because it outsources moderation to unpaid volunteers who manage individual subreddits. “Reddit’s internal security has been compromised by its choice to rely on unpaid moderators, which fail to enforce the standards that are supposed to protect Reddit users and others,” it says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4Umlp"&gt;FOSTA-SESTA had immediate and damaging repercussions for sex workers, who — thanks to US laws that conflate consensual sex work with trafficking — faced a broad online crackdown. Meanwhile, anti-trafficking lawsuits relying on FOSTA-SESTA have appeared more gradually, and their results have been less clear. Facebook is &lt;a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/facebook-asks-texas-high-court-to-toss-claims-of-sex-trafficking-victims/"&gt;currently embroiled&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181008/17533740793/facebook-whose-support-made-fosta-law-now-sued-facilitating-sex-trafficking-under-fosta.shtml"&gt;long-running&lt;/a&gt; Texas case claiming the site allowed traffickers to recruit victims. University of Notre Dame law professor Alex Yelderman &lt;a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2020/01/new-civil-fosta-lawsuits-push-expansive-legal-theories-against-unexpected-defendants-guest-blog-post.htm"&gt;wrote about some other early cases&lt;/a&gt; in January of 2020, including complaints targeting online marketplace Craigslist and email marketing company MailChimp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4zIwak"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FOSTA-SESTA was aimed at escort sites&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iHVkx2"&gt;FOSTA-SESTA was aimed at taking down escort sites like Backpage, which hosted ads for illegal sexual services. (Notably, Backpage’s operators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/7/13206388/backpage-com-ceo-arrested-for-sex-trafficking"&gt;were arrested&lt;/a&gt; before FOSTA-SESTA became law.) But this lawsuit covers a very different and less directly trafficking-related situation: a site failing to remove nonconsensual pornography involving a minor. The firm behind the case, Susman Godfrey LLP, &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.811224/gov.uscourts.cacd.811224.1.0.pdf"&gt;used a similar argument&lt;/a&gt; against porn giant MindGeek in February — saying video site Pornhub violated trafficking laws by hosting underage sexual content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U70zaw"&gt;If courts don’t agree that sharing the images constitutes trafficking, Section 230 would likely protect Reddit from civil liability. Section 230 doesn’t protect sites from federal charges, including ones related to child sexual exploitation, but there’s no indication Reddit is in danger of criminal prosecution in connection with this incident. And there is no FOSTA-SESTA-style carveout exempting child sexual abuse material from Section 230 civil protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iV5ZH5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Section 230 doesn’t have a carveout for civil child sexual abuse suits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SBLXuL"&gt;Some lawmakers have pushed for broader limits to Section 230. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21311464/earn-it-act-section-230-child-abuse-imagery-facebook-youtube-lindsey-graham"&gt;The EARN IT Act&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, would make services potentially liable for child sexual abuse material unless they hewed to a set of best practices. But its open-ended language alarmed privacy advocates who saw it as a potential attack on encryption, and it hasn’t proceeded to a vote on the House or Senate floor. Changing (or repealing) Section 230 could also drag sites and apps into protracted court battles over moderation decisions, particularly smaller services without the legal resources of tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4ej8Q"&gt;Much of the debate over Section 230 has focused on Facebook, Alphabet, and other massive Silicon Valley companies. Suits like this one highlight FOSTA-SESTA’s potential impact on mid-sized web services. They also, however, highlight harmful failures in services like Reddit — whose &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/reddit-powermods-war"&gt;hybrid moderation system&lt;/a&gt; has created gaps that abusers can easily exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pentagon reportedly gave a small company control of its IP addresses to find security issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xR1PIxlhh-qJVOxe9RqLbmL7pO0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69181429/acastro_170621_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8KX7F2"&gt;As part of an apparent effort to find holes in its network, the US Department of Defense has given a tiny Florida company control over about 175 million of its IP addresses, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/24/pentagon-internet-address-mystery/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5rQmG"&gt;Global Resource Systems began managing the IP addresses on January 20th, part of what a Pentagon spokesperson told the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; was a “pilot effort” to “identify potential vulnerabilities” and “prevent unauthorized use of DoD IP address space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmSbrd"&gt;The Department of Defense still owns the IP addresses. Global Resource Systems was founded in September, according to the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, which was not able to find any other federal contracts for the company or any public-facing website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rzgw5h"&gt;The initiative is apparently being run by a group within the Pentagon called Defense Digital Service, which solves problems and does technology experiments for the military. The group reports directly to the secretary of defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jo9brl"&gt;What exactly Global Resource Systems has been tasked with doing for the DoD isn’t known, but the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; found it sent a “fire hose of internet traffic” at the DoD IP addresses. One security expert speculated that it may give the DoD information about how attackers operate online, and any possibly misconfigurations that need to be repaired. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Someone deciphered the Ted Lasso shortbread recipe from Apple’s Spring Loaded event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="27th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F2cbUx1T-EnEoNzr1RiJ88xhlik=/251x0:3491x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69181353/1310836738.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by 27th Annual SAG Awards/Getty Images for WarnerMedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5eVII"&gt;During Tuesday’s Spring Loaded event, Apple announced (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;among other things&lt;/a&gt;) that the second season of its runaway hit show &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;drop on July 23rd&lt;/a&gt;. This is extremely good news for fans of the show (including myself) who have missed the earnest football coach with the impossibly sunny outlook on life, which provided a bit of a respite during the coronavirus pandemic last summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2J6Vb"&gt;At the very end of Spring Loaded, however, there was a &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso-&lt;/em&gt;related Easter egg: a graphic of a little box with the text “Ted Lasso’s Secret Shortbread (Makes about one box).” The recipe itself was barely visible. But eagle-eyed developer David Smith was &lt;a href="https://www.david-smith.org/blog/2021/04/21/breadcrumbs/"&gt;able to read the text&lt;/a&gt;, and Googled it, only to find it matched a &lt;a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020851-bittersweet-brownie-shortbread"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; recipe&lt;/a&gt; for shortbread (albeit a slightly different recipe than Ted’s). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hrfXiPQ_-Js1hcJQjeb3_RwTaik=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22467320/ted_lasso_recipe.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n8hFOz"&gt;He blogged about it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dqJMbm"&gt;Looking closely at the fractional letters visible I’m pretty confident that this first line reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d05zAA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 1/2 cups / 340 grams cold unsalted butter cut into 1/2 inch pieces plus more for greasing pan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iTr3K"&gt;This is definitely a recipe for shortbread, I mean what else would need that much butter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="H8tYXH"&gt;That really is a lot of goddamned butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zM5Icz"&gt;For those who don’t watch the show (and why the heck not?), the shortbread cookies are a key part of the plot. Ted is trying to win over Rebecca, the owner of the English football team he’s suddenly coaching, and presents her with a small pink box that has the shortbread inside (we later discover that Ted has been baking the shortbread himself, not purchasing them, because that’s Ted for ya).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePLF2l"&gt;Rebecca enjoys them. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/35uz58gexTwque1gn5aIUIqCxOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22467315/ted_lasso_cookies.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dy44AH"&gt;There are not many pure, good things on the internet anymore (she said as she wrote for an internet news site haha &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; I did not mean &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, we are great), but a little sleuthing to uncover a shortbread recipe from the best show on streaming reminds me of those innocent days gone by. Like &lt;a href="https://ted-lasso.fandom.com/wiki/Believe"&gt;Ted reminds us&lt;/a&gt;: you just have to believe.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk is hosting Saturday Night Live and no this is not a joke</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elon Musk Awarded With Axel Springer Award In Berlin" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AtZ6HZTro1wxHYfwdUuns_AI3oM=/0x0:2157x1438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69181091/1229893040.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Hannibal Hanschke-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Acvs7t"&gt;Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, will be hosting &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; on May 8th, the official &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1386033593772826624?s=21"&gt;tweeted &lt;/a&gt;Saturday. The musical guest will be Miley Cyrus. Musk is known for his— how shall we put this — quirky sense of humor on Twitter, his preferred method of social media communication, but it’s not totally clear whether he’s actually funny enough to sustain a 90-minute hosting gig on the late-night comedy show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KpH6x6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;    &lt;a href="https://t.co/WyTGhSsSVg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WyTGhSsSVg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1386033593772826624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o4tHbM"&gt;Musk has made many notable media appearances over the years— there was that time he &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/01/tech/elon-musk-joe-rogan"&gt;smoked weed on Joe Rogan’s podcast&lt;/a&gt;, and he had a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfiRd4Y5z_g&amp;amp;ab_channel=ShortClips"&gt;cameo in &lt;em&gt;Iron Man 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (he even had a line for his debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe). He also played himself on an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;, titled “&lt;a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Musk_Who_Fell_to_Earth"&gt;The Musk Who Fell to Earth&lt;/a&gt;,” and on the now-retired show &lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGR5HP3KSBk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Bang Theory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and its spinoff &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jAlPQau5Hc&amp;amp;ab_channel=HouseofGamers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Young Sheldon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When he appeared on the Stephen Colbert show, the host&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV6hP9wpMW8&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheLateShowwithStephenColbert"&gt; likened him to Lex Luthor&lt;/a&gt; (which, all things considered, he probably enjoyed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyJ794"&gt;So he’s not totally without some show biz chops. How willing he’ll be to parody his — unique— public persona, well, we’ll have to wait a few weeks to find out. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this saga of McDonald’s ice cream machines and why they’re out of order all the time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="McDonald’s Same-Store Sales Top Estimates as Declines Abate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EgKJgvfBho7BoLU0BzmsIlVHuaU=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69180993/462010750.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sCitTa"&gt;If you’ve ever tried to get ice cream at a McDonald’s restaurant, there’s a better-than-average chance you were stymied in your quest for soft-serve goodness by an out-of-order ice cream machine. A &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/they-hacked-mcdonalds-ice-cream-makers-started-cold-war/"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery of the McDonald’s ice cream machines, why they have a secret repair menu that most McDonald’s workers don’t have access to, and one couple’s attempts to hack the machines for the greater good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="4gcX0p"&gt;...after years of studying this complex machine and its many ways of failing, O’Sullivan remains most outraged at this notion: That the food-equipment giant Taylor sells the McFlurry-squirting devices to McDonald’s restaurant owners for about $18,000 each, and yet it keeps the machines’ inner workings secret from them. What’s more, Taylor maintains a network of approved distributors that charge franchisees thousands of dollars a year for pricey maintenance contracts, with technicians on call to come and tap that secret passcode into the devices sitting on their counters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="iWiX7L"&gt;It’s weird to consider that a company the size of McDonald’s would be hampered by what is mainly a right-to-repair issue. The restaurants have to use Taylor’s repair techs, and the machines themselves tend to be fragile and temperamental, according to franchisees bound to use the machines by agreements with McDonald’s. So Jeremy O’Sullivan and Melissa Nelson created a device that would hack into the machines and provide diagnostic info, including access to the secret menu. They called it Kytch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6BL50x"&gt;One franchisee, who asked that WIRED not identify him for fear of retribution from McDonald’s, told me that the ice cream machine at one of his restaurants had been down practically every week due to a mysterious failure during its pasteurization cycle. He’d scrutinized the assembly of the machine again and again, to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqzCZW"&gt;Installing Kytch revealed almost instantly that an overeager employee was putting too much mix in one of the machine’s hoppers. Today he wakes up every morning at 5:30, picks up his phone, and confirms that all his machines have passed their treacherous heat treatment. Another franchisee’s technician told me that, despite Kytch nearly doubling its prices over the past two years and adding a $250 activation fee, it still saves their owner “easily thousands of dollars a month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JIYBC0"&gt;I’m not going to spoil the plot twists, but suffice to say that &lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;reporter Andy Greenberg tells the tale of the ice cream machines and the well-intentioned hackers almost like a spy thriller; I was half-expecting a Jason Bourne-like hero to come in and set everything right. Go read this fascinating deep dive into the wonky ice cream machines that even &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/McDonalds/status/1293189912913743877?s=20"&gt;McDonald’s itself jokes about&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zbdabt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
