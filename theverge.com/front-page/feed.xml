    <title>Mobile app helps people manage their blood pressure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hello Heart app and blood pressure monitor." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0RPsJe2n6F_S_U_Ut7IHg1i13GM=/0x0:880x587/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999648/Monitor_mock1_with_phone_overlapping.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Hello Heart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vsr8mg"&gt;People with high blood pressure who used a smartphone app and at-home monitor were able to drive down their blood pressure, &lt;a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.27008?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=101521"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; showed. The program, called Hello Heart, lets people track their blood pressure, weight, and physical activity and offers tips on how to manage blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JbURGh"&gt;Around half of adults in the United States have high blood pressure, but only around a quarter of those people have the condition under control. It can be a tricky condition to manage, particularly if people are only getting measurements taken in the doctor’s office — where it can be higher (from the stress of a doctor’s visit) or lower (through a condition called masked hypertension) than it is at home. But it can be dangerous and puts people at risk for heart disease and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtplHK"&gt;Digital health approaches to managing blood pressure, which give people resources to track the condition at home, are appealing to doctors and researchers because they could be widely distributed. The Hello Heart program includes a blood pressure monitor that automatically sends readings directly to an app. The app monitors trends and automatically gives users strategies to improve their blood pressure with things like diet and exercise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8KmBm"&gt;After one year using the program, over 85 percent of people with stage two hypertension, a condition that puts people at risk for heart disease, had reductions in their systolic pressure — which measures the amount of force blood puts on artery walls while the heart is squeezing. They stayed at lower levels over the course of three years, according to the study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5BAbR"&gt;The app was also effective for people with less serious conditions: around half of people with elevated blood pressure had reductions after a year, as did around 70 percent of people with stage one hypertension. People who signed into the app more frequently saw greater impacts and tended to have lower blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIY82X"&gt;This analysis of the Hello Heart program included over 28,000 participants. People who had certain employer-based health insurance plans and a diagnosis for high blood pressure were asked if they wanted to participate. They ranged in age from 43 to 58, and most lived in areas with higher socioeconomic status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JjOy7"&gt;Most notably, the study tracked participants for up to three years — the authors said they believe it's the first long-term study of a digital blood pressure management program. Following participants over an extended period of time helps researchers check that the impact of a program like this isn’t just short-lived and can help people manage their blood pressure in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T40xeG"&gt;“This is the first peer-reviewed, published study reporting the long-term experience of a digital health application for blood pressure management,” said study author Alexis Beatty, a cardiologist and associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxd9yr"&gt;Hello Heart is currently only available through employer wellness programs — it’s offered by some companies as part of their health benefits. People who don’t work for a company offering Hello Heart aren’t able to use it, but it’s still possible to &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings/monitoring-your-blood-pressure-at-home"&gt;monitor blood pressure at home&lt;/a&gt; without an app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seq7js"&gt;Despite the promising results, the authors note that the people who used the program were middle-aged and that the vast majority weren’t low-income. It’s hard to say if the app would work as well in groups of people more likely to have serious complications with blood pressure, like&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;older people or people who didn’t have health insurance, they wrote in the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmhchB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now order the new Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis controllers for Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R56AKlVhZWOudvESqo3NBJvRqAY=/4x0:1597x1062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999507/switch64genesiscontrollers.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J4iihA"&gt;To faithfully play the Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis games coming to Nintendo Switch Online, you’re going to want the original controllers. Nintendo has posted pages for both the revised &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-64-controller.html"&gt;Nintendo 64&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/sega-genesis-control-pad.html"&gt;Genesis controllers&lt;/a&gt;, and you can buy one right now if you’re a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3zPP3"&gt;Each one costs $49.99 and includes USB-C charging. In the case of the N64 controller, it includes built-in rumble for games that support it, like &lt;em&gt;Star Fox 64&lt;/em&gt;. Both controllers are set to ship on October 25th, and Nintendo is limiting account holders to four of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gD6vp"&gt;Nintendo Switch Online is the paid service that nets you cloud save backups and access to &lt;em&gt;Tetris 99&lt;/em&gt;, retro SNES and NES games, and other content. The cost of that membership is going to go up for people who want access to N64 and Genesis games. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728113/nintendo-switch-online-plus-expansion-pack-price-n64-genesis-animal-crossing"&gt;My colleague Chaim Gartenberg has all of the pricing details for you here.&lt;/a&gt; Though, you don’t need to purchase these controllers to be able to play the new games being added to the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing is getting a big update and paid DLC on November 5th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_B8gibp0z-dPWhUopCPjoIosbw8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999505/20211015_ACNH_Update_scrn_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brewster is back.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EmIqrT"&gt;Nintendo just wrapped up a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6LdBAbT1Xw"&gt;huge Direct presentation&lt;/a&gt; focused on new content coming to &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons,&lt;/em&gt; including the game’s major 2.0 update and a significant paid DLC expansion. Both will be available on November 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGYVHu"&gt;Let’s start first with the free update, which brings back a lot of familiar faces for longtime &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; fans. You’ll be able to visit Brewster in his coffee shop, The Roost, Kapp’n will be able to whisk you away to mysterious islands (while serenading you along the way), Katrina the fortune-teller will appear on Harv’s Island, and the odd, noise-making Gyroids have returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMWhvS"&gt;There are also some great new features for people who have already sunk hours (or hundreds of hours) into &lt;em&gt;New Horizons.&lt;/em&gt; There are new house exterior options, storage expansions, hairstyles, KK Slider songs, things you can buy with Nook Miles, and even a pro camera app for the NookPhone that lets you take photos from a new perspective. Perhaps one of the most significant updates is that you’ll be able to cook food using ingredients that you grow, meaning you can set the table for a fun (virtual) dinner with your friends. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/anBFN7QURGPPI_lkIbKEsVi07Jg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929423/20211015_ACNH_Update_scrn_009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make some food for your friends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VWWUoD"&gt;But for players who want to do even more in &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, Nintendo is also releasing a paid expansion, &lt;em&gt;Happy Home Paradise&lt;/em&gt;. In the DLC, you’ll travel to an archipelago of islands and help visitors build the paradise home of their dreams on a resort. For example, if a bear wants a house with plush bears, you’ll be able to place the furniture they want in the house but also decorate it however you want to try and make the paradise home that matches what they’re looking for. You’ll also be able to decorate the resort itself. And as part of the DLC, you’ll eventually gain new house decorating techniques, like partitions, that you can bring back to your home on your main island. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T28rGIKU1AK6NeBd0YChdbN3glU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929425/20211015_ACNH_HHP_scrn_006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Decorate a vacation home in &lt;/em&gt;New Horizons&lt;em&gt;’ upcoming DLC.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YNtenS"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Happy Home Paradise&lt;/em&gt; DLC will cost $24.99, and you can preorder it starting October 29th. It will also be included as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728113/nintendo-switch-online-plus-expansion-pack-price-n64-genesis-animal-crossing"&gt;the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription&lt;/a&gt;, which launches on October 25th and will cost $49.99 for one person for 12 months or $79.99 for a family membership for 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toJmkU"&gt;Nintendo also announced that the &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; Series 5 amiibo cards will launch on November 5th. Each pack will cost $5.99 and comes with six cards each.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku Streaming Stick 4K review: keeping it simple, now with Dolby Vision</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Now with Dolby Vision and slightly faster performance&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZdvB02"&gt;Roku has replaced its Streaming Stick Plus, long one of the top recommendations for an affordable 4K streaming player, with the new Streaming Stick 4K. The name is different, but the hardware looks practically identical on the outside — not that design has any significance in this case. Like its predecessor, the 2021 model plugs into an HDMI port behind your TV and is forever hidden away from everyone watching entertainment on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nD9QRp"&gt;What’s more important are its upgraded capabilities: the new device is faster, offers improved Wi-Fi performance, and adds support for Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. (The older stick was released before Vision settled into must-have status.) And it costs the same $49.99 as before. You can also buy the Streaming Stick 4K Plus, which bundles the same exact hardware with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22391174/roku-voice-remote-pro-review-features-price"&gt;Roku’s Voice Remote Pro&lt;/a&gt; that I reviewed (and liked) a few months ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m76TAR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10808854"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dlMFlD"&gt;But aside from quicker boot-up times and apps loading a hair faster, nothing about the experience of &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; this Roku feels any different. It’s the same simplistic Roku software that has helped the company amass an enormous active user base and stay neck and neck with Amazon as the leading streaming platforms. Roku continues to refrain from overhauling its familiar grid-of-apps homescreen, instead focusing on smaller tweaks and new sections like “Featured Free” that highlight free-to-stream content — mostly to the benefit of the company’s own ad-supported Roku Channel. But the comprehensive universal search, which prioritizes free content and your existing subscriptions over paid options, remains as excellent as ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWcijC"&gt;The Streaming Stick 4K looks very similar to the Stick Plus. Whereas that device was mostly glossy, this one is all matte black plastic except for the “Roku” lettering. (Does any of this even matter when you’ll never see the thing after plugging it in?) They’re mostly the same size — the newer stick is just barely thinner — and there’s still a MicroUSB port for plugging in the power cable. The included USB power cord also houses a long-range Wi-Fi receiver, so you’ll definitely want to use that instead of another USB cable you might have laying around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6WlJ1ZK_rt4tMAYhlWrKhvXJ26U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929116/IMG_0032.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roku’s Streaming Stick 4K will compete against Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nzIumX"&gt;With the standard Streaming Stick 4K, Roku includes its regular voice remote with shortcut buttons for Netflix, Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus, and Hulu. There’s no headphone jack on this base remote; you’ll need the Voice Remote Pro for that and other features like hands-free voice commands, a rechargeable battery, and built-in remote finder. But this one covers all the essentials and has basic TV controls for power and volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpxECh"&gt;There’s a lot of hand-holding during the initial setup of a Roku device, the bulk of which actually happens through a web browser and not the device itself. After activating the Streaming Stick 4K with an email link, I was asked which of the top streaming apps I wanted to be installed, and Roku also presents additional app recommendations based on categories (free movies, live, news, comedy, sports, etc.) in which I signaled interest. That’s all well and good, but before everything was done, there’s also a screen with info about over 20 free trials for streaming services. Many of these were for subscriptions handled directly by The Roku Channel. That’s where things started feeling a little spammy, but soon after, I was dropped into the same-as-ever app grid homescreen. When it does come time to log into streaming apps on the Roku, you can now use voice dictation to enter your email and password. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8MjsK9ykEJLVbluqwKcfn_ZRf6Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929121/Screen_Shot_2021_10_14_at_12.31.09_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roku makes streaming app suggestions based on your selections at setup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="p4V1cp"&gt;From a powered-off state, Roku says the Streaming Stick 4K boots up 30 percent faster than the previous model. I can’t say that’s something I often pay attention to on most streaming gadgets, but the software definitely loaded up swiftly. There’s a more powerful quad-core processor in the new stick, but the company isn’t really making any big claims about it speeding up everyday navigation and responsiveness. Combined with the Stick 4K’s improved Wi-Fi reception — the long-range receiver can now pull down speeds up to twice as fast as before — apps worked smoothly and streams got started without any delays. But whereas Amazon recently brought Wi-Fi 6 to its similarly priced Fire TV Stick 4K Max, the Roku is still on Wi-Fi 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hnqN15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10808858"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rpubll"&gt;Dolby Vision is the main reason to upgrade to the Streaming Stick Plus from an older Roku model. There’s now a vast selection of content using the HDR format across popular streaming services like Netflix, Disney Plus, Vudu (which is now Roku’s default rental store), and others. And the Streaming Stick 4K played it all back without any problems — not that I’d expect otherwise. HDR10 Plus is more of a factor if you have a Samsung TV and it’s still more limited in content selection. During my time with the unit so far, I didn’t run into any overheating issues that the Streaming Stick Plus could occasionally be susceptible to. Also remember that Roku’s players now support Apple’s AirPlay 2, making it easy to play content to the device from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kCuhHj1o2L0R8snbZLenL0jrk9A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929123/IMG_0034.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both devices offer Dolby Vision HDR at a low cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6mX2Jg"&gt;But at the end of the day, this is a slightly faster Roku (with more robust Wi-Fi) that’s now up to speed on HDR formats. So the reasons for buying it are the same as any other Roku: there’s the extremely simple user interface, and you’re getting a wide selection of apps without any obvious content holes. And you’re paying an appealingly low price for all of it, though not everyone is a fan of &lt;a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/roku-streaming-sticks/"&gt;Roku’s level of data collection and sharing with advertisers&lt;/a&gt;, which helps keep the price of these devices so low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="IJ8l7b"&gt;By now you probably know which streaming platform you favor the most: Roku’s the easiest to use but lacks any substantial smart home controls, Fire TV offers a ton of value (and Alexa) for similarly low prices, Google TV has the best recommendations, Apple TV has the most reliable performance, and products like the Nvidia Shield add gaming and the freedom to tinker with software. The Roku Streaming Stick 4K is a very safe evolution of one of the company’s bestselling products, and it delivers on the improvements that were needed like Dolby Vision. If your Roku is feeling sluggish or can’t get the most from your new 4K HDR TV, it’s a fine time to upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 15’s new Focus modes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dpkQp-pUcc5TNGEA14QrcPezeJA=/0x0:700x467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999461/ios15_iphone12_pro_settings_focus_crop__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EUGjjn"&gt;These days, it is way too easy to be pulled from your work by notifications and other distractions. In order to help you keep your attention where you want it, Apple has added new Focus features to iOS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1bBad"&gt;The idea is to keep you “in the moment” by filtering out apps or notifications that you don’t want popping up during specific times. The nice thing is that you can create different profiles to keep you from being disturbed, depending on whether you’re at home, at work, getting ready for bed, driving, or for any other activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h134kI"&gt;When you first start to set Focus up, it can seem a little daunting. There are a lot of choices, and a lot of ways you can tweak it. In fact, it may take a while before you get the combination of settings that works best for your lifestyle. But in the end, it will be worth it — it will mean that you won’t be sidelined during times you need to concentrate, and you won’t be bothered by irrelevant notifications when you’ve got other activities in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on Focus, and you’ll see all your various profiles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ho2e9P"&gt;Begin to focus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eF8B9R"&gt;You access Focus mode via your Control Center (swipe down from the upper right corner). You’ll see the Focus button with a moon icon next to it. If you tap the icon, then the main Do Not Disturb profile will be active. If you tap anywhere else in the button, you’ll see a selection of other profiles that you can activate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQRtvY"&gt;Tap on the three dots to the right of each button, and you can set the length of time you want that Focus profile to be active. Or you can tap the Settings button to tweak the settings for that Focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWvVZu"&gt;But perhaps the best way to start is to go to Settings &amp;gt; Focus, where you can set up all the various Focus profiles you are planning to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="V15dui"&gt;Set up your profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2FOIon"&gt;When you first open the Focus page in your settings, you’ll see a list of several profiles, starting with the basic Do Not Disturb and then going on to Personal, Sleep, and Work. If you tap on the plus sign in the upper right corner of the screen, you’ll find the others, including Driving, Fitness, Gaming, Mindfulness, and Readings. If none of those suit, you  can create a custom profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnxcpV"&gt;In addition, there is a toggle that lets you can share the profiles across your various Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzsXlc"&gt;We’ll look at some of the profiles in a moment, but let’s start by tapping on Do Not Disturb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The main Focus page lets you set up a variety of profiles." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hqdOC1YwPCOLESS0988eW6n5CQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929013/IMG_42A19892FE43_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The main Focus page lets you set up a variety of profiles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The initial Do Not Disturb profile offers a basic template." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZPj2xJKtdw0Ss8ckp20CEX2-DS4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929035/IMG_917D02D42034_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The initial Do Not Disturb profile offers a basic template.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FIYrZd"&gt;Do Not Disturb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="21ARpr"&gt;The first thing you’ll see on top of the Do Not Disturb page (and, in fact, on top of all the profile pages) is the toggle to turn the mode on and off. After that, there are a variety of filters that you can tweak to determine when and how Focus will be set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="l6AgJT"&gt;Allowed notifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JafgFu"&gt;Focus lets you specify people or apps that can continue to notify you even if you have Do Not Disturb active. For example, you may want to allow calls to come in from family members, or notifications from your work Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FV9dc"&gt;To make these exceptions, tap on the People or Apps box to get to the Allowed Notifications page. (It doesn’t really matter which you tap; you’ll end up on the same page.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can allow specific apps to continuing notifying you during Focus times." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sEQxI-DYvD0_AMxW9F-grctJC9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929036/IMG_12BD6DF55162_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can allow specific apps to continuing notifying you during Focus times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on the plus sign and you get a list of apps to choose from." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/49kc4VfarFcKI73BMb04EpaMdpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929037/IMG_698503BFB14C_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on the plus sign and you get a list of apps to choose from.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id="GkJBIZ"&gt;Allowed apps&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="zPsxL8"&gt;If you’re choosing one or more apps, then tap the App tab and then the plus button. You’ll get a list of your installed apps; check off those you want to add to the Allowed Notifications list, and select Done at the top right of the page. You’ll now see your chosen apps listed under Allowed Apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="poPpBl"&gt;If you change your mind for any of your apps, you can just tap the minus sign next to each icon or select the “Remove All” link on the upper right of the Allowed Apps section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHtNdN"&gt;You can also allow Time Sensitive notifications to come through by toggling it on. Time  Sensitive notifications are from apps you’ve individually tagged as important enough to break through any filter, no matter what. To select which apps are that important to you, you have to leave Focus and go to Settings &amp;gt; Notifications; select the app or apps you want to qualify — say, Calendar — and make sure Time Sensitive notifications is toggled on for that app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can also select which people can still contact you." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p2aIH9ToanE_9iOj1t68um-wDGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929042/IMG_092F5ED1AB24_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also select which people can still contact you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap “Calls From” to choose general categories of contacts." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SUhzR5d2dv_4o12ZaWz4KYlDboA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929044/IMG_4EC82D8508B0_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap “Calls From” to choose general categories of contacts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id="4o02dF"&gt;Allowed people&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="tjHRzU"&gt;The way you allow notifications from specific people to break through the set Focus mode is pretty much the same as with the apps: select the plus sign under the People tab to add from your list of contacts. You can also allow incoming calls from various categories of people: either everyone who calls, no one (if you really want not to be disturbed), people who are tagged as favorites, or anyone in your contact list. You can also allow through any calls that are repeated within three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ym6FGI"&gt;Other options&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pXCwk4"&gt;There are also a variety of other options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2WPEQX"&gt;You can choose to share your focus status — so if somebody texts you, they will get a display saying that you have notifications silenced. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JvSCV9"&gt;You can hide notifications from your homescreen pages or your lock screen. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AdypEo"&gt;You can have only specific homescreens be active during certain times of the day — for example, you can put all your gaming apps on one homescreen, and keep that screen hidden when you’re at work. To do that, tap on the Home Screen button in your profile, toggle on Custom Pages, and then choose which page or pages you want to be available when that profile is active. (Pro tip: to hide those custom extra homescreens when you’re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in a Focus mode, long-press on your homescreen to put it in editing mode, then tap the dots at the bottom. Uncheck the screens you don’t want to show.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="From the profile’s main screen, select Home Screen and then toggle on Custom Pages." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fySmiX4tfuvb0YJwuvuZKwWO_pE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929209/IMG_09CF86ED709C_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the profile’s main screen, select Home Screen and then toggle on Custom Pages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uhqUZnABBt0X2pxhJli2CyvfUaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929210/IMG_F356B3B5F40F_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can then choose which screens you want available when the profile is active.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="I9svS1"&gt;You can arrange to have the focus mode turn on automatically during specific times and on specific days — for example, from 9AM to 5PM on weekdays. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oSnWz5"&gt;You can even — and this is really nice — arrange to have it activate when you are at specific locations or when you’re using specific apps by selecting “Add Schedule or Automation” at the bottom of the mode settings page. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Add Schedule or Automation” brings you to a page where you can arrange for Focus to automatically start." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5GTcZYkDbTsvm80u2zz9vXOJclk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929026/IMG_675B90AF3D63_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Add Schedule or Automation” brings you to a page where you can arrange for Focus to automatically start.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="For example, you can have a Focus profile automatically start when you are at a specific location." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bAnKcuSxlDLTKLXlH-KxtGKC63E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929028/IMG_F33D365A26CE_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For example, you can have a Focus profile automatically start when you are at a specific location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XBnb8F"&gt;That brings you to the New Automation page where, for example, you can have it activate whenever you’re at work, or when you’re watching a Netflix video. And if this is something that happens often — for example, when you go to work or read in the evenings — activate Smart Activation, which will (hopefully) learn your habits and turn on Do Not Disturb when you need it. (If it gets things wrong, you can always turn it off.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="q0BLRx"&gt;Focus profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OOCtg7"&gt;In order to use the profiles, you need to set them up to fit your needs. I listed the ones available at the beginning of this article; in order to get used to them, let’s try setting up two: Personal and Driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOHqUO"&gt;When you tap on a profile that has not yet been set up, you are presented with a set of screens that walk you through the initial processing, including which people and apps should be allowed to notify you when the Focus is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The preset Focus profiles use wizards to help you start using them." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DItlkXxSgopkn8OgxDK1vmqmqeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929022/IMG_D59C1674EB50_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The preset Focus profiles use wizards to help you start using them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="After the initial setup, you can continue to filter each profile." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v5xPrDVIP-F7vLzxVVPf5ZJPEbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929023/IMG_CB5C5AB66007_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After the initial setup, you can continue to filter each profile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7R325M"&gt;After that, you are dropped into the Focus page for that profile, which will be similar to the Do Not Disturb setup described above. In Personal, you can not only tweak the allowed notifications but decide whether you want to share your Focus status, hide the notifications on your homescreen or lock screen, or create an automation that will turn it on and off at a certain time, in a certain place, or with a certain app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlrFO6"&gt;Some of the other presets are more specific. For example, when I created a Focus for driving, the opening page of the wizard told me that it was silencing alerts and notifications while I was driving; that it would turn on automatically when I was driving; and that it would arrange auto-reply to let people know why I wasn’t responding to notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Profiles such as “Driving” offer specialized filters." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RE2ZL_O7aPofaUdH2GCZjeiYxXc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929018/IMG_06093F59A446_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Profiles such as “Driving” offer specialized filters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can decide what will cause the profile to automatically start." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/acMGfIxQ6X6xhTu0OLaQ0DduTn0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929020/IMG_0ABB49FDE07B_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can decide what will cause the profile to automatically start.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="svlOjw"&gt;And the Driving Focus page had a few differences as well. Allowed notifications include people but not apps (under the assumption that you’re not playing with apps while you’re at the wheel). There is an auto-reply option that lets you edit the message that will be sent to people who try to contact you while the Focus is on. And you can choose how the app will know you’re driving: automatically (based on detected motion), if the CarPlay app is activated, if the phone is connected to a car’s Bluetooth, or when you turn it on manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nyeg1"&gt;If none of the presets work for you, you can create a custom profile by tapping on the plus sign in the upper right corner of the main Focus screen and choosing Custom. You will be asked to name your new profile and to choose a color and icon to represent it.  After that, the process is pretty much the same as for Personal, except that you can also tweak the name and appearance of the Focus in the profile’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UEUvja"&gt;So what next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nu0Ltz"&gt;Now, when you tap the Focus icon in your Control Center, it will activate all the various features you’ve created for your profile. Note that the last profile that was active will be the one that is featured: for example, if you last used your Driving profile, the Focus button will have the car icon. Touch the icon to active it, or touch the word Focus to switch to a different profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5qtBR"&gt;The new Focus app in iOS 15 can be very useful by helping you concentrate when you need to, by letting you relax when you want to, by keeping unwanted calls and texts from waking you at night, and by keeping you safe from distractions when driving. It may take a while to figure out which profiles you want to set up, and to discovering what combination of factors works for you. But once you’ve got it working, Focus can really make things easier for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo Switch Online’s N64 and Sega Genesis ‘expansion pack’ launches October 25th for $49.99 per year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b7rpTpqB-yMNZmw6WqtznEJEhJI=/146x0:1601x970/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999439/image.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TojyjK"&gt;Nintendo has announced the price and release for its upcoming Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription tier, which adds Nintendo 64 games, Sega Genesis games, and bundled access to the new paid &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons — Happy Home Paradise&lt;/em&gt; DLC. It’ll cost $49.99 per year for an individual subscription or $79.99 for a shared family membership. The service will officially launch on October 25th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9DzGv"&gt;Those prices are a big jump from the regular Switch Online subscription, which costs $19.99 per year for a single membership or $34.99 per year for a family subscription. The Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription tier offers the same benefits as the standard Switch Online service — including online multiplayer, classic NES and SNES games, cloud saves, and other perks. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8_t16bfCPIMiOnWunsHrek0xwxE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929332/Screen_Shot_2021_10_15_at_10.32.07_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yykZH6"&gt;But the Expansion Pack subscription also adds access to other retro titles from the Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis. Today’s pricing announcement included news that the premium subscription service would also bring bundled access to the new paid &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; DLC (which is set to cost $24.99 on its own).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgNZlP"&gt;At launch, the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service will include several of the most popular N64 games, including &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; Mario Kart 64.&lt;/em&gt; Additional titles are also planned for the future, like &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Paper Mario. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tz4miX"&gt;The higher $49.99 per year price point also puts Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack more in line with other major subscription costs from competitors like Sony and Microsoft (PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Gold both cost $59.99 per year, albeit with fewer perks than Nintendo’s retro game offerings). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETU2Zh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 15th, 10:44AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added release date information. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="m4WZqE"&gt;The White House is expected to announce Friday that the US is reopening its land and air borders to vaccinated foreign nationals on November 8th, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-us-partly-lift-international-travel-curbs-nov-8-official-2021-10-15/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlKs6h"&gt;As part of COVID-19 restrictions, non-essential travelers from more than 30 countries have been barred from entering the US since March 2020. This latest news comes as the White House announced Tuesday that the US was ending restrictions at the borders and ferry crossings with Mexico and Canada for foreign nationals vaccinated against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Br9ePb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584359/canada-border-reopen-non-essential-travel-us-citizens-vaccinated"&gt;Canada began allowing&lt;/a&gt; vaccinated US visitors into the country for non-essential travel in August. Travelers seeking to enter Canada will be required to fill out a questionnaire using the ArriveCAN app and need to demonstrate a quarantine plan in case they don’t meet Canada’s requirements for quarantine exemption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2zwaz"&gt;Last month, the White House said the US would end restrictions on air travel from more than 30 countries in early November but didn’t provide a date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSRW1J"&gt;Non-US air travelers will be required to show proof of vaccination before boarding a flight and proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test. For foreign visitors crossing into the US at a land border, only proof of vaccination will be required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFAVlK"&gt;The White House didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Series X mini fridge preorders begin on October 19th for $99.99</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3I5xLjGDLef-N2u1aBe6dOZOTI=/47x0:554x338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999240/xboxminifridge.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UQbTur"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series X-shaped mini fridge will be available to preorder next week. The Xbox Mini Fridge will be priced at $99.99 (£89.99 / €99) and available to preorder on October 19th in the US, UK, Canada, and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0ZaTr"&gt;The mini fridge is expected to ship at some point in December, and Microsoft has partnered with &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-series-x-video-games%2F-%2FN-fd2hh%3FNao%3D0&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target in the US&lt;/a&gt; and Canada, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.game.co.uk%2Fwebapp%2Fwcs%2Fstores%2Fservlet%2FHubArticleView%3FhubId%3D2862757%26articleId%3D2868421%26catalogId%3D10201%26langId%3D44%26storeId%3D10151&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F15%2F22727969%2Fxbox-series-x-mini-fridge-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Game in the UK&lt;/a&gt;, and Game Stop EU, Micromania, or Toynk in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xbox Mini Fridge can hold up to 12 cans of drink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eym0nPuSaFmw9qXPo7iA6G4YIFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929279/17315_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside the mini fridge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hHqyJQ"&gt;The Xbox Mini Fridge can hold up to 12 cans of drink, and has two shelves inside the door designed to hold snacks. It even has a USB at the front to charge devices, and also comes equipped with a DC power adapter so it can be portable. The mini fridge was first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22532185/xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-available-holiday-2021"&gt;teased at E3&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, following Microsoft’s promise to make one after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/2/22364073/microsoft-xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-skittles-twitter-brand-poll"&gt;defeating Skittles in a Twitter poll&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2ZrIZ"&gt;The Xbox Mini Fridge is the result of Microsoft really leaning into the initial memes about the boxy and fridge-like shape of the Xbox Series X. Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/3/16/21181399/microsoft-xbox-series-x-size-fridge-comparison-measurements"&gt;joked about the shape&lt;/a&gt;, and the company’s mini fridge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22532185/xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-available-holiday-2021"&gt;announcement at E3&lt;/a&gt; even called it “the world’s most powerful mini fridge” with “Xbox Velocity Cooling Architecture.” Microsoft even gave away a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538654/microsoft-xbox-series-x-fridge-competition"&gt;full-sized, Series X-shaped fridge last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA is sending a spacecraft on a 12-year journey to explore swarms of asteroids around Jupiter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s5w9LcXoCA5bL_5kGXu3IZpVGqc=/11x0:1429x945/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999138/final_lucy_high_end_render_pira.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of NASA’s Lucy spacecraft visiting a Trojan asteroid&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Southwest Research Institute&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Lucy is on a mission to see seven Trojan asteroids up close&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="7qwEO0"&gt;Early this weekend, a new robotic explorer built by NASA is set to launch deep into the Solar System, with its sights set on exploring a large swarm of distant asteroids that flock around Jupiter. The uncrewed spacecraft, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/lucy/overview/index"&gt;dubbed Lucy&lt;/a&gt;, is the first of its kind to target these mostly unexplored space rocks, in the hopes that studying them will tell us slightly more about how our celestial home came into being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85wlNR"&gt;The asteroids that Lucy is visiting are known as the Jupiter Trojans, or simply, the Trojans, named after the Trojan War by the astronomer who first calculated their distinct orbits. They orbit the Sun along the same &lt;em&gt;path&lt;/em&gt; as Jupiter, with one large cluster charging ahead of the massive planet and another cluster trailing behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hla7Ug"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the Trojans, we think, paint another part of the picture.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1MuzwW"&gt;No spacecraft has ever visited this population of space objects before. But scientists have been eager to study the Trojans up close, as they think these asteroids may provide some clues as to how our Solar System materialized. Just like other asteroids in our cosmic neighborhood, the Trojans are thought to have changed very little since they first formed roughly 4.5 billion years ago, during the dawn of the planets. In that way, they serve as baby pictures of the Solar System. Even more enticing is the theory that these Trojans didn’t form in Jupiter’s orbit but came from somewhere else. If that’s true, then they could tell us a lot about how the earliest objects and burgeoning planets in our Solar System crossed paths in those chaotic first years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUJ49s"&gt;“We’ve studied a lot of asteroids and comets, and they all paint certain parts of the picture,” Bill Bottke, a member of &lt;a href="http://lucy.swri.edu/"&gt;Lucy’s science team at the Southwest Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SwRI), tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “But the Trojans, we think, paint another part of the picture — but we’re not sure what part yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VtDTuK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trojan Source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qro48h"&gt;The mission is named after the famous fossilized skeleton “Lucy,” a pre-human ancestor discovered in Ethiopia in 1974 that was found 40 percent intact. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; Lucy provided crucial insight into the history of human evolution, and the mission team behind NASA’s Lucy hopes their spacecraft will do the same, but this time for our Solar System. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="znxorT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NASA is actually sending Lucy into the sky, but the “diamonds” are a little different&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1H6QUb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/inspiration-links-the-beatles-a-fossil-and-a-nasa-mission"&gt;The original Lucy’s name comes from The Beatles’ song&lt;/a&gt; “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,” which blasted throughout the Ethiopian dig site when excavators found the fossil. Now, NASA is actually sending Lucy into the sky, but the “diamonds” the spacecraft will visit are like nothing we’ve ever seen before. These Trojans, numbering in the thousands, are clustered into two groups around Jupiter. One group, dubbed the “Greeks,” is in a pretty stable spot 60 degrees ahead of Jupiter in its orbit; the second group, the “Trojans,” is 60 degrees behind Jupiter. At an astronomical scale, those regions aren’t very big. So how did a large group of space rocks wind up there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZDMxr"&gt;One idea is that the Trojans are just the leftover rocks that didn’t make it into Jupiter when the planet was forming. At our Solar System’s birth, a giant disc of gas and dust swirled around our Sun, and eventually, materials within that disc started clumping together, forming the planets. The Trojans are perhaps the nearby pieces that missed out on becoming Jupiter and instead got captured by the massive planet’s gravity in the locations they are now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nm-jlYlrD6R7nYPzJKJiAdw9faU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929034/697015main_pia16211_full.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of the Trojan asteroid swarms, with one clump ahead of Jupiter and another clump trailing Jupiter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pjI9yX"&gt;Another idea, &lt;a href="https://www.swri.org/press-release/swri-scientists-evidence-early-planetary-shake-up"&gt;which Bottke and others suggested in a study a few years ago&lt;/a&gt;, is that the Trojans actually came from somewhere else — possibly from a group of space rocks that once existed beyond Neptune. Then, the planets played musical chairs and shuffled the Trojans to their current spots. Plenty of scientists believe it’s possible that the giant planets — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune — didn’t form in the orbits they hold right now. They think that they formed closer to the Sun, but when the gaseous disc that formed the planets went away, the entire Solar System went unstable and the planets shifted. Neptune wound up passing through a giant cloud of objects that existed at the Solar System’s edge, sending rocks all over the place — possibly a bunch to Jupiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YSCgaB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s really ‘What are they?’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="So9qOA"&gt;If that’s the case, then the Trojans are the “first cousins,” as Bottke puts it, of objects in the Kuiper Belt, a huge cloud of icy space rocks at the outer edges of the Solar System that include Pluto and other dwarf planets. We’ve been to a few Kuiper Belt objects before. Studying the Trojans close up could help determine if the objects are similar, and that tells us if the planets actually did move around back in those early days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wSD4qN"&gt;Plus, scientists just want to know what &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of space rocks the Trojans are, compared to the other objects that permeate our Solar System. “It’s really ‘What are they?’” says Bottke. “Are they similar to comets? Are they different from comets? Are they similar to the asteroids we’ve seen? Are they highly different? You can make a case for almost all the possibilities. So we need to find out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F8dQFe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touring the Trojans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kvS3Xl"&gt;NASA needs to get to the Trojans first, which is no easy feat. Lucy is taking one of the most complex trajectories ever conceived, spanning 4 billion miles over the course of 12 years. During that time, the probe will visit one asteroid in the Asteroid Belt and seven Trojan asteroids, while also swinging by Earth for some gravity boosts three different times. Because of this, Lucy will become the first spacecraft ever to return to Earth after journeying to the outer Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HDqsYK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Rather than stopping at two asteroids, why don’t we do a flyby of a bunch of asteroids?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mYB3g2"&gt;To figure out Lucy’s spaghetti-like path, NASA and SwRI teamed up with Lockheed Martin, which both built the spacecraft and came up with its trajectory. Originally, the mission team hoped to visit two different Trojan asteroids, with the goal of orbiting them and taking really high-resolution pictures. But it became clear that putting a spacecraft into orbit around a Trojan was going to cost way too much, exceeding the budget cap that NASA had placed on the mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wUE-xIOBVemNcCKfhPJNwPea1vY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929040/ta010359_lucy3_b_orbit_crop_0.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cP7U21"&gt;Lockheed Martin had to get creative. “I said, ‘Okay how can I provide the same kind of science but do it for half the price?’” Brian Sutter, a mission architect at Lockheed Martin, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, adding, “Rather than stopping at two asteroids, why don’t we do a flyby of a bunch of asteroids?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRQVyO"&gt;The mission team gave Sutter a wishlist of 20 Trojans they’d like to visit and he figured out how to visit two of them pretty easily within the budget. But he was curious if they could get even more out of Lucy. So he sat down and created, of all things, an Excel spreadsheet. He put in Lucy’s proposed path and the known orbits of 750,000 other asteroids, to see if the spacecraft came close to any of them on its journey. “I had this cool little spreadsheet that I built,” Sutter says. “Actually somebody had seen it once and they called it the most ridiculously complicated Excel spreadsheet they’d ever seen.” Thanks to his Microsoft Office skills, he found more Trojans Lucy could swing by and a main-belt asteroid to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="eZjj46"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5SphnD95b0c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tPTZzC"&gt;That gives Lucy scientists a diverse range of objects to visit. First in 2025, Lucy will fly by a main belt asteroid named Donaldjohanson (in honor of the paleoanthropologist who discovered the Lucy fossil). That encounter will serve as a bit of a test run for what’s to come. In 2027, Lucy will visit two Trojans — Eurybates and Polymele — located in the swarm trailing Jupiter. Eurybates has a tiny moonlet called Queta, which scientists think was created during a past collision. The next year, Lucy will visit two more Trojans in the same swarm, Leucus and Orus. Then in 2033, Lucy will make its way to the swarm &lt;em&gt;ahead&lt;/em&gt; of Jupiter, meeting up with two Trojans that orbit around one another, Patroclus and Menoetius. It’s an eclectic bunch. “We’re not only seeing a lot of these objects, but we’re sort of sampling how diverse they are in composition,” Bottke says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GQ5xRX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re not only seeing a lot of these objects, but we’re sort of sampling how diverse they are.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Buok8v"&gt;If that wasn’t enough, Lucy may even have fuel leftover for an extended mission once it’s done. But the mission team will cross that bridge after the 12 years is up. Now, everyone is just focused on Lucy’s launch, which has been complicated by the COVID pandemic. Back when stay-at-home orders went into effect in March 2020, the mission team was five months out from piecing together Lucy and performing crucial pre-launch tests. “We really had to re-engineer the way we did [that process],” Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, the Lucy project manager at NASA, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “a lot of the activities that would have been done face to face were done remotely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iiuhvW"&gt;The teams at NASA were able to keep the schedule on track, despite completely overhauling their protocols. Now, Lucy is set to launch on top of an Atlas V rocket, manufactured by the United Launch Alliance, this weekend out of Cape Canaveral, Florida. As of now, liftoff is scheduled for 5:34AM ET on Saturday, October 16th, but there’s plenty of time to send Lucy on its way. NASA has a launch window that spans 23 days beyond Saturday, with the option to launch within one hour each day during that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ez992q"&gt;Of course, launch is just the beginning of a long road ahead. But for those who have been on the journey this far, it’s an emotional moment. “It feels a little surreal,” Douglas-Bradshaw says. “I mean last week was the last time that I will see the spacecraft, prior to, perhaps seeing it when it’s flying close to Earth. And, you know, it felt a little sad, because it’s truly a work of art.” &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Mmxwi"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7Xehh"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, Nilay and Dieter start the show with &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;senior reporter Adi Robertson and managing editor Alex Cranz to discuss &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22713276/htc-vive-flow-vr-headset-launch-price-hands-on"&gt;HTC’s new VR headset, the Vive Flow&lt;/a&gt;. Adi was able to try out the $499 entertainment-focused headset and shares experience and first impressions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elK43M"&gt;Second half of the show, we turn it back to event season. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722112/apple-october-2021-event-rumors-macbook-mac-mini-airpods-m1x"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721480/samsung-galaxy-foldables-testing-z-flip-3-screens-cracking"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; have all scheduled product release events for next week.
