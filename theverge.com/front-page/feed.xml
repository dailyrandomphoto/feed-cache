    <title>Ryder says EV startup Chanje owes millions for undelivered vans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZHujxot8l5uTlfe9Q25d91R79tw=/375x0:2925x1700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68985114/Exterior___Rear_3_4_Downtown_edited.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mt1ETy"&gt;Truck rental company Ryder says it’s owed nearly $4 million from EV startup Chanje after it failed to deliver 100 of the 125 vans promised back in 2017, according to &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.589122/gov.uscourts.flsd.589122.1.0.pdf"&gt;a previously unreported lawsuit in Florida&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6ZDRQ"&gt;The lawsuit comes as a massive shift toward electric propulsion is underway in the commercial vehicle space, with new startups raising billions of dollars and established automakers announcing electric delivery vans and trucks at a regular clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsHqG5"&gt;Chanje emerged from stealth in 2017 and is one of a number of electric vehicle startups that have called California home. Like many of its peers, it got early attention by hiring a few former execs from Tesla, and even poached some talent from fellow startup Faraday Future. Also like many of those California EV startups, Chanje is owned by a larger Chinese automotive company — in this case one called FDG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7pshlM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chanje said at one point it didn’t have the cash to pay Ryder back&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eXyb4y"&gt;But whereas others at the time were focused on luxury passenger cars, Chanje set out to make electric delivery vans instead. Ryder was Chanje’s first big customer, pledging to buy 125 vans back in 2017. The truck rental company agreed to pay $45,000 for each of the vehicles from Chanje, with $35,000 per vehicle up front and $10,000 per vehicle upon delivery. As such, Ryder made an initial deposit of $4,375,000 in 2017. Ryder was also supposed to be the exclusive sales and service provider for the startup’s vans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJOJgm"&gt;Ryder received 22 vehicles from Chanje by the end of 2017, but when it went to pay the $10,000 deposit on those, it mistakenly paid the full $45,000 for each, an overpayment of $770,000. That’s when the trouble started, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RzFSN"&gt;Ryder made “repeated requests” to be reimbursed for the overpayment, but Chanje told the truck rental company it did not have the cash to pay Ryder back, according to the complaint. Chanje eventually delivered three more electric vans, but never delivered the remaining 100. Ryder tried to terminate the contract and recoup the $3.5 million in deposits it paid on those vans it never got, but Chanje balked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tu2e2e"&gt;In early 2019, according to the lawsuit, Ryder got FDG to agree to loan money to Chanje to pay the $770,000 in overpayments. In late 2019, Ryder again got FDG to agree to loan money to Chanje to pay back the $3.5 million in deposits. Chanje ultimately paid Ryder back $500,000 of the overpayment money, but hasn’t paid the truck rental company another dollar since. Ryder therefore says it’s still owed $3,770,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqzUma"&gt;Ryder, Chanje, and FDG did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAzF5g"&gt;In 2018, Ryder had arranged to have FedEx lease 900 Chanje vans and buy 100 more. But as it started to fight Chanje and FDG for the money it was owed in 2019 and 2020, Ryder tried to give the electric van startup and its parent company an out. It struck an agreement with Chanje and FDG that said if they delivered at least 700 vans to FedEx, Ryder would waive the $3.5 million in deposit money. “Chanje did not meet its obligations and deliver the 700 vehicles” to FedEx, Ryder’s lawyers write. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fj17Lf"&gt;It’s unclear if Chanje delivered any vans to FedEx. FedEx also said in early 2020 that it was developing “groundbreaking charging infrastructure” with Chanje &lt;a href="https://newsroom.fedex.com/newsroom/fedex-and-chanje-to-develop-groundbreaking-charging-infrastructure/"&gt;at a few dozen stations in California&lt;/a&gt;, and the status of that project is also unclear. FedEx did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KV8mjA"&gt;Chanje has been quiet since its debut in 2017, aside from the announcements with FedEx. The startup has been sued more than once in Los Angeles Superior Court by former employees who say they’re owed tens of thousands in back pay and bonuses. Chanje has also been hit with liens from the California Secretary of State for not paying taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v54fGF"&gt;In the time since Chanje came onto the scene, commercial electric vehicle companies have taken off as governments around the world push to reduce harmful emissions. The UK’s Arrival recently went public after merging with a special purpose acquisition company, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/18/uk-electric-vehicle-maker-arrival-is-going-public-via-spac.html"&gt;raising nearly $700 million at a $5.4 billion valuation&lt;/a&gt;. General Motors even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;spun out an entire business dedicated to commercial EVs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome can now instantly caption audio and video on the web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YaG09nhFGqzAaatWO8xFBUwcnDo=/139x234:888x733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68984871/Screen_Shot_2021_03_17_at_4.21.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5UtL8v"&gt;Google is expanding its real-time caption feature, Live Captions, from Pixel phones to anyone using a Chrome browser, as first spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-chrome-live-caption-feature-rolls-out-transcribe-speech-videos/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Live Captions uses machine learning to spontaneously create captions for videos or audio where none existed before, and making the web that much more accessible for anyone who’s deaf or hard of hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1xrjd"&gt;When enabled, Live Captions automatically appear in a small, moveable box in the bottom of your browser when you’re watching or listening to a piece of content where people are talking. Words appear after a slight delay, and for fast or stuttering speech, you might spot mistakes. But in general, the feature is just as impressive as it was when it first appeared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;on Pixel phones in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Captions will even appear with muted audio or your volume turned down, making it a way to “read” videos or podcasts without bugging others around you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Y8co8Pyq5oIHT9uKzMkPMbKxmY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22378878/Screen_Shot_2021_03_17_at_4.35.39_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Captions captioning audio from a podcast player&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ayaFKF"&gt;Chrome’s Live Captions worked on YouTube videos, Twitch streams, podcast players, and even music streaming services like SoundCloud in early tests run by a few of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. However, it seems that Live Captions in Chrome only work in English, which is also the case on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYfmP4"&gt;Live Captions can be enabled in the latest version of Chrome by going to Settings, then the “Advanced” section, and then “Accessibility.” (If you’re not seeing the feature, try manually updating and restarting your browser.) When you toggle them on, Chrome will quickly download some speech recognition files, and then captions should appear the next time your browser plays audio where people are talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arX95B"&gt;Live Captions were first introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18528447/google-android-q-live-caption-video-transcription-io-2019"&gt;in the Android Q beta&lt;/a&gt;, but until today, they were exclusive to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/9350862?hl=en"&gt;some Pixel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/09/16/live-captions-now-available-for-galaxy-s10-note-10-w-one-ui-2-5-update/"&gt;Samsung phones&lt;/a&gt;. Now that they’re on Chrome, Live Captions will be available to a much wider audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FW71tJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZcUEd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QU26h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft PowerPoint can now help you practice presentations almost anywhere — no humans required</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tkrDuN_n3G_1IhMZ8t0AHar4MPg=/61x0:1936x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68984582/Screen_Shot_2021_03_17_at_2.54.00_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Presenter Coach report, telling me how I did.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F3dxi0"&gt;Microsoft’s Presenter Coach, which helps you practice presentations, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18683351/microsoft-powerpoint-presenter-coach-monitoring-feature"&gt;has been available on the web version of PowerPoint&lt;/a&gt; for a while now, but it’s finally coming to the desktop and mobile versions of the app. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fblog%2F2021%2F03%2F17%2Fimprove-your-presenting-skills-with-additional-platforms-and-new-features-for-powerpoint-presenter-coach%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, the feature will now be available on Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, and, of course, the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0pOfy"&gt;PowerPoint Presenter Coach listens to you while you practice a presentation out loud — it analyzes what you’re saying, and can warn you if you’re talking too fast or slow, using filler words like “um” or “ahh,” or just reading the words off the slide (a personal pet peeve of mine). Trying it out on both PowerPoint for Windows and iOS, it worked shockingly well, doing pretty much everything Microsoft says it should. At the end it gives you a little report, telling you what you need to practice.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z777kc"&gt;Along with the expanded availability, there are also some new ways that the feature can try to make your presentation better: it can look at body language (how close you are to the camera, if you’re making eye contact or putting things in front of your face), and warn you if you’re repeating words or saying them wrong. And yes, it still tells you not to swear in your presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hrTl1UhF5nlyjrYp-Wn5XHTgjBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22378650/Screen_Shot_2021_03_17_at_3.42.03_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PowerPoint for web (seen here) censors the profanity, but the version for Windows hilariously doesn’t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VkF5xF"&gt;When I tried it, the feature didn’t show up in the Mac version of the app, but I was able to use it on iOS. Microsoft was not immediately available for comment about when the feature would show up on the Mac, or on whether the vocal and video analysis was done on-device or in the cloud for the desktop and mobile versions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VrwvRU"&gt;For the privacy-conscious, though, it is worth noting that when I tried it in airplane mode, it told me I had to connect to the internet to use the coaching feature. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New iPad Pros reportedly launching as soon as April, and the 12.9-inch model may have a Mini LED screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PEWN5MlqraSpp_ht-z_mzwwhUbA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68984260/bking_200321_3945_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Brennan King / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8N0Nkk"&gt;Apple is reportedly planning a number of updates to its iPad line, including new iPad Pros launching as soon as April, a new iPad mini with a larger screen, and a refresh of the base iPad, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jY2HJg"&gt;The new iPad Pros are expected to have a similar design as the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;released last March&lt;/a&gt; but have a better processor that’s “on par” with the speedy M1 chip in Apple’s newest MacBook Airs, Pros, and Mac mini, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. Both models may also have improved cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlPrXy"&gt;The 12.9-inch iPad Pro could have a Mini LED screen, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, which should offer a higher contrast ratio and be less susceptible to burn-in than OLED screens.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/2/20992125/apple-mini-led-ipad-macbook-pro-2020-oled-rumor-kuo"&gt;since 2019&lt;/a&gt; that Apple has Mini LED-equipped tablets and laptops in the works, and said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452182/ipad-pro-mini-led-display-oled-contrast-burn-in-screen-technology"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s first device with the new screen technology would be a 12.9-inch iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJV9Eq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Apple has tested these new iPad Pros with a Thunderbolt port, which would be able to transfer data faster than the USB-C port found on the iPad Pros right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LmFil"&gt;In addition to the new iPad Pros, Apple is also working on an iPad mini update with a screen that’s larger than the 7.9-inch display currently used on the company’s smallest tablet, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Apple last refreshed the iPad mini &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; after not updating the device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/28/9409015/apple-ipad-mini-4-review-2015"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The new iPad mini could launch as soon as this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNFwec"&gt;Apple is also planning to update its cheapest iPad with a new design that’s thinner and lighter at some point this year, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. Apple last refreshed the base iPad &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Streaming HBO Max will now count toward data limits for AT&amp;T customers </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Game of Thrones" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BGJkalC2J_t1yJWMOtxoJifZMHU=/4x0:4054x2700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68984228/GOT_603_tyrion_HBO.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HCDvtc"&gt;One perk of being an AT&amp;amp;T wireless subscriber was being able to stream HBO Max without that counting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21277402/hbo-max-att-data-caps-netflix-disney-plus-streaming-services-net-neutrality"&gt;toward a customer’s data cap&lt;/a&gt;. That’s no longer the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXtgc7"&gt;California’s new net neutrality law includes banning sponsored data services, known as zero-rating, which previously allowed companies like AT&amp;amp;T to cover data usage of certain platforms (like HBO Max) for customers who use other offerings like internet plans. As part of the law, internet service providers like AT&amp;amp;T won’t be able to cover bundle customers’ streaming data usage alongside no longer being able to offer paid prioritization or play down service speed questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2yJCZ"&gt;“We regret the inconvenience to customers caused by California’s new ‘net neutrality’ law,” the company &lt;a href="https://www.attpublicpolicy.com/congress/impact-of-california-net-neutrality-law-on-free-data-services/"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “Given that the Internet does not recognize state borders, the new law not only ends our ability to offer California customers such free data services but also similarly impacts our customers in states beyond California.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JUcMy"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Scott_Wiener/status/1364364559641759747"&gt;some representatives&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;) see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;this as an absolute win&lt;/a&gt;, the telecom giants like AT&amp;amp;T feel differently. The companies tried to invoke a preliminary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22298199/california-net-neutrality-law-sb822"&gt;injunction in late February&lt;/a&gt; that would stop the bill from passing, but Judge John Mendez declined the request. AT&amp;amp;T called a state-by-state approach to net neutrality “unworkable” in the blog post today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bn5F3J"&gt;“We deliver the content and services our customers want because it’s what they demand, not because it’s mandated by regulation,” the blog post reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEnGan"&gt;For AT&amp;amp;T specifically, promising that HBO Max subscribers who are also AT&amp;amp;T wireless customers could stream without worrying about hitting their data caps is a big deal. AT&amp;amp;T bought Time Warner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/14/17466518/att-time-warner-acquisition-closes"&gt;in 2018 for $85 billion.&lt;/a&gt; The goal was always to launch what HBO Max became and integrate that vertically with its other businesses. AT&amp;amp;T wireless customers could sign up for HBO Max and stream without worrying about data caps, which might be a selling point for some customers who are looking to switch internet service providers and want to stream all the &lt;em&gt;Friends &lt;/em&gt;in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c92zZD"&gt;As AT&amp;amp;T tries to scale HBO Max’s subscriber base, the company is looking into any opportunity to get more people to stream and for longer periods of time. With a cheaper, ad-supported tier coming in June, any little extra “offer” can help the company sign up customers and potentially convince people to spend more time watching HBO Max instead of Netflix. Not enabling this type of corporate influence, however, is something that &lt;a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/barbara-van-schewick"&gt;Barbara van Schewick&lt;/a&gt;, a law professor at Stanford University and the director of Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society, celebrated &lt;a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2021/03/in-a-win-open-internet-att-stops-zero-rating-its-own-video"&gt;in a blog post today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCeBqR"&gt;“People should be free to choose which videos they want to watch — whether that’s Netflix, Twitch or their local church’s Sunday service, without the company they pay to get online trying to influence their choices,” van Schewick wrote, adding that AT&amp;amp;T is “trying to score political points against state net neutrality protections by lying to the public about the law and its effects.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6YwSe"&gt;For AT&amp;amp;T customers, this means that streaming HBO Max will start counting toward your data cap. But it also means that it’s slightly more difficult for AT&amp;amp;T to influence customers into using more of their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8Hlvf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wki3p6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpSnNh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tbpqPM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canon’s new camera kits make it easier to turn your DLSR and mirrorless into webcams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dSPjzwvsH1-flwPiEt8VhqLDhX8=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68984133/vlcsnap_2021_03_17_15h19m52s233__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UisRoq"&gt;If you’ve got a recent Canon DSLR or mirrorless camera and are interested in getting more use out of it, Canon announced today that it would soon begin selling webcam accessory kits, allowing Canon owners an easier way to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241305/canon-cameras-dslr-eos-webcam-utility-released"&gt;retool their cameras as high-quality webcams&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUFL66"&gt;Each kit has different parts, but all three packages include a USB cable to connect your camera to your desktop computer or laptop, and a battery insert and power cord so that you can continually keep your Canon camera powered with a wall outlet. It is important to note that none of these kits include a tripod to mount your camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7YKZcj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Webcams have been in high demand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jv78cf"&gt;Canon has announced three versions of its accessory kit, which are available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fl%2F%3Fsearchinfo%3Dcanon%2520webcam%2520kits%26sel%3DItem-Condition_New-Items&amp;amp;subid1=CanonWebcamStory03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Canon+webcam+kit&amp;amp;i=amazon-devices&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735187887684653293#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DCanon%2520webcam%2520kits%26filters%3Dfct_a_filter_by%253A07_NEW_RELEASE%252Cfct_category%253Aaccessory_kits_4969&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F17%2F22336762%2Fcanon-webcam-accessory-kits-dslr-mirrorless-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, with both retailers noting that preorders are expected to ship on March 25th. The two most affordable kits are compatible with &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Ficawcskm.html&amp;amp;subid1=CanonWebcamStory03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;EOS M cameras&lt;/a&gt; (M50, M50 Mark II &amp;amp; M200) and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/17351879635939234593donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EOS Rebel cameras&lt;/a&gt; (Rebel T3, T5, T6 &amp;amp; T7), and cost $89.99 each. The more expensive kit, which works with &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1630732-REG%2Fcanon_1425c009_eos_webcam_accessories_starter.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EOS RP cameras&lt;/a&gt;, will retail for $159.99. Alternatively, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ACK-E18-Adapter-Charger-Coupler-Replace/dp/B074K181L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a third-party charging kit&lt;/a&gt; and supply your own USB cable for less than the Canon kits cost; or if you don’t own a camera at all, you can buy a webcam starter kit for as low as $466 on &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.usa.canon.com%2Fshop%2Fen%2Fcatalog%2Fdslr-webcam-bundles#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VZaMJ"&gt;Within the past year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22173744/webcam-gadget-of-the-year-2020"&gt;webcams have been in high demand&lt;/a&gt; due to the pandemic as many people work from home or rely on videoconferencing tools to communicate. Canon, like its competitors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241305/canon-cameras-dslr-eos-webcam-utility-released"&gt;already released software&lt;/a&gt; that allowed owners to repurpose select Canon cameras as webcams to address the shortages. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola’s Ready For brings a DeX-style desktop to the Edge Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yLQp0sZ0n56nOcF9EuGWI_6YvYU=/0x258:5792x4119/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68983843/motorola.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O2YGmO"&gt;Motorola is expanding its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241919/motorola-edge-plus-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;Edge Plus flagship phone&lt;/a&gt; with a new, desktop computer interface called Ready For. Similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/2/15495036/samsung-dex-station-galaxy-s8-review-desktop-dock"&gt;Samsung’s DeX&lt;/a&gt;, Ready For allows users to plug their smartphone into a larger screen (using either a USB-C to USB-C or USB-C to HDMI cable), allowing the Edge Plus (and presumably, future Motorola phones) to be used as a computer or even a set-top box alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5u8jR"&gt;The company actually envisions four different use cases for Ready For. On the most basic level, users can convert the Edge Plus into a mobile desktop computer setup, complete with a Bluetooth mouse or keyboard — similar to DeX. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1crHudJe_wDrGHgdy1q0iSCVbmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22378484/Ready_For_Edge__Bundle_1_Campaign_Wallpaper.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VyRT5v"&gt;But Motorola also has more interesting ideas for how to use the Edge Plus. One more, for instance, turns the Edge Plus into a videoconference station, using the superior cameras on the smartphone (either the 108-megapixel main lens or the 16-megapixel ultrawide lens) for a better video chat experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNW2oW"&gt;There are also entertainment options. Players can pair a controller and use the Edge Plus as a makeshift console, either for native mobile games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; or with game-streaming services like xCloud. Users can also hook up their phone as an easily portable set-top box — Motorola envisions plugging the Edge Plus into a hotel room TV, for instance, giving you access to all your already logged-in streaming apps when you’re traveling without having to worry about your room’s Wi-Fi setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBoASV"&gt;Ready For (or DeX) isn’t the first attempt to turn a smartphone into a computer. Mobile phone history is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20837263/samsung-dex-note-10-plus-palm-foleo-motorola-atrix-celio-redfly"&gt;littered with past attempts&lt;/a&gt;, like the &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-05-30-palm-foleo-hands-on.html"&gt;aborted Palm Foleo&lt;/a&gt; or Motorola’s own &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fmotorola-lapdock%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F17%2F22336800%2Fmotorola-ready-edge-plus-verizon-dex-desktop-atrix-lapdock" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Atrix 4G’s LapDock accessory&lt;/a&gt;. And while Motorola’s use cases here are a little ambitious (and, perhaps, a little optimistic about the number of users who routinely keep HDMI to USB-C cables around), there are certainly more creative ideas for converting a phone to a larger screen beyond a half-baked desktop computer experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuezOC"&gt;Motorola’s Ready For experience is set to roll out to Edge Plus users on Verizon starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EnSaL4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors probed by SEC for allegedly misleading investors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/caCIHhBVZoua5nMBOOaobh1UtEY=/0x0:5600x3733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68983577/DSCF3107.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lordstown Motors&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pY1Fcn"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission has asked Lordstown Motors for more information about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"&gt;allegations&lt;/a&gt; that the EV startup misled investors about its progress to date. Lordstown Motors said Wednesday that it is cooperating with the inquiry and that its board of directors has created a special committee to review the claims. The startup is backed by General Motors, which has a seat on the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eljDcb"&gt;The allegations came last Friday from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"&gt;short-selling firm Hindenburg Research&lt;/a&gt;, which disclosed along with the report that it had taken a short position in Lordstown Motors. The firm previously released a report about hydrogen trucking startup Nikola that similarly led to probes from the SEC and the Department of Justice. (General Motors was also planning to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726594/gm-nikola-deal-equity-badger-truck-hydrogen"&gt;take a stake in Nikola before that report&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fn75tI"&gt;Hindenburg claimed in the report that some of the EV startup’s biggest preorders were made by companies that do not appear to have the money required to purchase big batches of Lordstown Motors’ electric pickup truck, which starts at around $50,000. Hindenburg also claimed that Lordstown Motors misled the public, investors, and the government about the progress it’s made so far on the prototypes of its Endurance electric pickup truck, and pointed to a recent fire as evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rPCEa"&gt;“We want to take a moment and acknowledge that we are aware of the short-seller’s report,” CEO Steve Burns said on an earnings call Wednesday, before disclosing the SEC inquiry and the internal review. “That is all we can say, and we cannot comment on this during the Q&amp;amp;A period following this call, or any follow-up questions and conversations, until the special committee has finished its review.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NkZKj5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I3ha7a"&gt;Lordstown Motors went public in late 2020 as part of a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, and raised $675 million in cash. Wednesday’s earnings call was the startup’s first with investors as a public company. Just before it, the company reported that it lost $101 million in 2020 but finished the year with $630 million in cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUz9SQ"&gt;Burns previously said the Hindenburg report was full of half-truths and lies, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ev-startup-lordstown-motors-is-targeted-by-short-seller-hindenburg-research-shares-fall-16-11615569913"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “There’s always haters,” he said on Monday, according to local outlet &lt;a href="https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/theres-always-haters-lordstown-motors-ceo-responds-to-negative-report/"&gt;WKBN&lt;/a&gt;. “I quoted Taylor Swift to somebody the other day: ‘Haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate. You gotta shake it off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4af7e"&gt;The SEC’s inquiry and the internal review aren’t slowing down Lordstown Motors, at least not yet. The startup said Wednesday that it’s accelerating development of a second vehicle: an electric van. Burns also said Lordstown Motors remains committed to shipping the first Endurance electric pickup trucks this coming September &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac"&gt;at the Lordstown, Ohio facility that the startup bought from General Motors in 2019&lt;/a&gt; — a deal that was praised by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUWkMa"&gt;Lordstown Motors is only targeting commercial fleet sales in the near term for the Endurance, but the startup is nonetheless racing to bring the electric pickup to market so that it can be the first one produced at scale. The startup is at an advantage compared to some of its peers because it basically got started with a factory in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFXKnU"&gt;Burns said Wednesday that he believes the Endurance will be an attractive option for state and local governments, especially following President Biden’s push to electrify the federal fleet. He also said the military is interested, though he did not share any details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2igLPy"&gt;“Everybody feels demand is not going to be our problem,” Burns said. “There is no company on planet Earth six months away from entering into mass production — not hand building — mass production of a full-size electric pickup truck.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gILvbp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV finally adds Nick Jr. (and the rest of ViacomCBS’s channels)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NSz0OszL3Ithb2s61a4tTEMmFrs=/216x0:2490x1516/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68983498/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_8.23.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SWAFoG"&gt;YouTube TV added popular missing channels like MTV and Nickelodeon in 2020 after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;striking a deal with ViacomCBS&lt;/a&gt;, but now the streaming service is finally adding in the remaining stragglers like Nick Jr. and MTV2, according to &lt;a href="https://www.whattowatch.com/news/youtube-tv-adds-the-missing-batch-of-viacomcbs-channels"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WhatToWatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSenRm"&gt;The new additions include Nick Jr., Teen Nick, Nicktoons, MTV Classic, MTV2, Dabl, and BET Her. Generally these channels are spinoffs of more well-known offerings like BET and MTV, but Nick Jr.’s younger children’s programming will definitely have some parents breathing a sigh of relief. Dabl — which I had never heard of before today — is apparently ViacomCBS’s “lifestyle-oriented network” for licensing cooking and homemaking shows like &lt;em&gt;Emeril Live&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Martha Stewart Living&lt;/em&gt;. It’s probably great for a late-night marathon or your daily background noise while working around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfylHk"&gt;Unlike the original addition of ViacomCBS’s biggest channels, this new drop won’t come with a price increase to YouTube TV, but it is the most recent in a collection of small updates the service has received in the last month. In February, YouTube TV announced that it plans to offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286374/youtube-tv-4k-streaming-offline-viewing-announced"&gt;a 4K streaming option and offline downloads&lt;/a&gt;. That same month, it also introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289589/youtube-tv-hbo-max-showtime-starz-bundle-virtual-premium-cable"&gt;a $30 add-on bundle&lt;/a&gt; that includes HBO Max, Showtime, and Starz for $5 cheaper than they would be separately.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disco Elysium is coming to the PS5, along with a bunch of other indie games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MsTUh9pN09utq-uhGs1iH_g8yac=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68983403/51040678236_7d944b3c05_k.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sTScOj"&gt;Sony has been announcing new games coming to PlayStation 5 all day as part of a spotlight on indie titles. Included in that list is &lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium - The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt;, a “definitive edition” of the game, launching on March 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHxKBh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Final Cu&lt;/em&gt;t includes new quests, quality of life improvements, and voice work from professional actors across the world. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/25/21019476/pc-gaming-best-games-top-exclusives-destiny-rdr2-halo-sekiro"&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;, previously a PC exclusive, is heading to the PlayStation store, alongside Steam, GOG, Epic Store, Google Stadia, and the App store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDhXtN"&gt;Here’s the full list of other games announced today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oCgeIN"&gt;Operation: Tango&lt;/h3&gt;
