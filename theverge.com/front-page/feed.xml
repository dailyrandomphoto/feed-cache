    <title>Samsung’s next tablet lineup could include a 14.6-inch ‘Ultra’ model with a notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qJwOIsI9IXEFPr5hF0yw-01sgv0=/53x0:2048x1330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70396772/samsung_galaxy_s8_ultra_tab.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sAqDQj"&gt;Samsung might be adding its first-ever “Ultra” model to its upcoming Galaxy Tab S8 lineup, which will also include a Tab S8 and S8 Plus, as rumored by &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,127516.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bH7WWr"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;, the flagship Ultra model could sport a 14.6-inch Super AMOLED display with a 2960 x 1848px resolution, a refresh rate of up to 120Hz, as well as a notch with two 12-megapixel (MP) cameras. It may also come with the option of up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, along with a 11200mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/30F2KvIVz7ydyYWgg42-oKNdhPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23172714/galaxy_tab_s8_plus.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,127516.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Galaxy Tab S8 Plus is rumored to have a 12.7-inch display with no notch.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yUmooi"&gt;When compared to the Tab S8 Ultra, the Super AMOLED display on the Tab S8 Plus is a bit smaller, potentially measuring at 12.7 inches with a resolution of 2800 x 1752px. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; says the midgrade model may not have a notch and could come with a 10090mAh battery. The base Tab S8 model will obviously be the smallest of the bunch and is rumored to have an 11-inch LTPS TFT display with a resolution of 2560 x 1600px, a notch-less design, and an 8000mAh battery. Both the Tab S8 and S8 Plus have smaller memory and storage options, offering up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpzpVj"&gt;As for what’s powering the devices, &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; notes that each tablet in Samsung’s new lineup may come with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809687/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-chip-smartphone-processor-specs-details"&gt;Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip&lt;/a&gt; and the Adreno 730 GPU. All models will also have a 13MP dual camera and 6MP ultra wide-angle lens on the back, a 12MP camera in the front (except for the Ultra, which has two), S-Pen compatibility, under-display fingerprint scanners, optional 5G connectivity, as well as quad speakers that support Dolby Atmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJPzVP"&gt;There’s no confirmed pricing information for any S8 Tabs just yet, but a leak from &lt;a href="https://appuals.com/samsung-tab-s8-prices-leaked/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Appuals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might provide a hint at what to expect. &lt;em&gt;Appuals&lt;/em&gt; claims pricing for the Wi-Fi-only Tab S8 Ultra begins at 1,040€ to 1,060€ (~$1,187 to $1,210), with additional storage and 5G connectivity adding to that price. The Wi-Fi-only Tab S8 Plus could start at 880€ to 900€ (~$1,004 to $1,027), with the base Tab S8 potentially starting at 680€ to 700€ (~$776 to $799).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GiRAC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; predicts that Samsung will either introduce its Galaxy Tab S8 lineup at its February 8th Samsung Unpacked event (potentially alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S22&lt;/a&gt;), or at the Mobile World Conference (MWC), which begins on February 28th. Samsung last released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;Galaxy Tab S7 lineup&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, which only consists of two tablets: the Tab S7 and Tab S7 Plus. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wordle! and Wardle team up to donate proceeds from an unrelated app’s popularity spike</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/unhSSseOxOElvtT5Yll3DCjvAdQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70396480/1237669516.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Stefani Reynolds / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ArkgCl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a free browser game, and a browser game only — it has no accompanying apps, something that some people (myself included, regrettably) might not realize during a time when nearly everything has an app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tyw6yh"&gt;This leaves plenty of room for &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-pulls-wordle-knockoffs-app-store-2022-01-12/"&gt;fake &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; apps to crowd app stores&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to leech off of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22881995/wordle-emoji-results-auto-generated-tell-a-story"&gt;the word puzzle game’s sudden rise in popularity&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s one app coincidentally called &lt;em&gt;Wordle!&lt;/em&gt; that’s not a clone — it actually existed before the browser game itself. That’s why its developer is teaming up with the mind behind the browser-based &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt;, Josh Wardle, to use its accidental success as an opportunity to give back, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-with-unrelated-five-year-old-wordle-app-is-donating-proceeds-to-charity/1100-6499675/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7L33cC"&gt;The story unraveled in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StevenCravotta/status/1482056565867696128"&gt;a thread on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;em&gt;Wordle!&lt;/em&gt; app developer, Steven Cravotta, detailing how his coding project blew up five years after its creation, unknowingly riding on &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt;’s coattails. He developed an iOS app called &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordle/id1095569891"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordle!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 to brush up on his coding skills, and while it got around 100,000 downloads, it wasn’t as successful as a previous game he built, called &lt;em&gt;Grid&lt;/em&gt;, so Cravotta decided to stop updating and promoting the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w4L6YM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Can confirm this is true. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StevenCravotta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@StevenCravotta&lt;/a&gt; reached out to me unprompted and asked about donating the proceeds. He's a class act and you should follow him. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7Xeixe6VHh"&gt;https://t.co/7Xeixe6VHh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Josh Wardle (@powerlanguish) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/powerlanguish/status/1482007797437014020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5B5V4"&gt;Cravotta says that downloads for &lt;em&gt;Wordle!&lt;/em&gt; slowed to around one to two per day, but when the browser-based &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; started taking off, so did his app. The app racked up 200,000 downloads in a single week, albeit from confused users who mistook it for the browser-based &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt;. Cravotta reached out to &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; app developer, Josh Wardle, and let him know about his plans to donate the proceeds from his app to charity — Wardle sent out a tweet of his own to acknowledge the gesture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThoNvQ"&gt;Cravotta later confirmed that he and Wardle decided to donate any money earned by &lt;em&gt;Wordle!&lt;/em&gt; to BoostOakland, a charity geared towards tutoring and mentoring young people in Oakland, California. When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Cravotta, he told us that he has collected a little more than $2,000 so far and that he’ll donate the total amount earned at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The trials and tribulations of turning a real camera into a webcam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mcxjiyJ2CXUMaJv8uduZIjqVa_c=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70396326/VRG_ILL_4947_Sony_Webcam.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not a Sony A7 III, but it will do.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Samar Haddad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A mirrorless camera should just work; it did not&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4wV0En"&gt;My colleague Dieter Bohn is one of the nicest people I’ve met, but every time I’d hop onto Zoom to record &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; there would be just the tiniest, most minute twitch of displeasure on his face. Dieter was too kind to address the big, camera-obscuring elephant in the room: how for several minutes, instead of my face, he’d see a giant reversed Sony Imaging Edge webcam logo — a huge white W on an orange square set against a not-quite-black background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXvElb"&gt;Finally, after at least four months of the big W, he politely asked, “Alex, what’s your address?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="doJ5r6"&gt;“Why?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lqc6Ga"&gt;“So I can send you an HDMI adapter.” He said it with that unique Midwestern clip that says, “I am being very polite and gracious, but you should know I may also commit a murder in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cS3rNE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I’d already collected more “HDMI to X” cables than I think Monoprice even knows exists&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d9vbVJ"&gt;Dieter, and indeed all my colleagues at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, had been forced to stare at that ugly W because I wanted to convert my very expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/30/17176246/sony-a7-a7r-iii-alpha-3-mirrorless-camera-review-specs-price"&gt;Sony A7 III&lt;/a&gt; mirrorless camera into a webcam. I was feeling frugal, and I’d already collected more capture cards and “HDMI to X” cables than I think Monoprice even knows exists; I was sure I could figure out a way to give my Zoom experience a gorgeous boost with minimal cost. Who doesn’t want to control the ISO and aperture and have all their colleagues ask why you’re in high definition when they’re firmly in standard? While some of my colleagues might rather tinker with phone settings or CPU voltages, I could happily spend weeks — months — perfecting my Zoom look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="95xpJ1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"I refuse to care about the quality of my webcam","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22858876/built-in-laptop-webcam-zoom-video-conferencing"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GCrjv0"&gt;It’s supposed to be easy. You buy a mount for your camera. (Deputy editor Dan Seifert recommended this &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1015864-REG%2Fimpact_3_section_double_articulated.html%3Fcnxclid%3D16418337913438427578510070301008005&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22841507%2Fmirrorless-webcam-sony-a7-iii-imaging-edge-overheating" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$60 arm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F824360-REG%2Fimpact_cc_106r_super_clamp_with_ratchet.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22841507%2Fmirrorless-webcam-sony-a7-iii-imaging-edge-overheating" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20 clamp&lt;/a&gt;, which worked great.) You download some software to your computer. You plug your big expensive digital camera into your computer and you have &lt;em&gt;magic&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0WsOO"&gt;Sony’s A7 III had other plans for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PQPV5"&gt;In the early days of the pandemic, webcam shortages led to many people requesting software that would let them use their expensive cameras as webcams. Camera makers happily obliged. Sony was one of the last, but that additional time feels ... poorly spent. The Mac version, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517673/sony-imaging-edge-webcam-digital-camera-webcam-software-mac"&gt;which launched in October 2020&lt;/a&gt;, is more driver than app. Sony’s software does little more than tell my computer that my camera is a camera, and throws up the W whenever the video feed isn’t ready. There’s no controlling of settings or any of the other things that, say, Sony’s tethering app can do (like ISO and aperture). There’s simply installation and prayers. You install it, restart your computer, and pray Sony Imaging appears in the camera choices for apps you use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="uZqJ0a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s simply installation and prayers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YEWqne"&gt;Importantly, you then have to open an app that uses your camera, and then turn on the camera, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; wait for Sony Imaging Edge Webcam to start running before your video will actually, finally appear on the screen. If you turn on the camera &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you open, say, Zoom, you may be faced with an error message saying the camera is already in use. Only restarting the physical Sony camera itself will resolve it — and while you’re busy fixing things, other people on the Zoom call (probably Dieter) are stuck looking at that big ugly W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKvzzw"&gt;Mastering the order of operations is key. So is remembering to reboot it periodically during the day. When I walked away after a call and came back to do another one, I found myself staring at the W because the camera decided to power itself off again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9CAsq"&gt;Eventually, I did &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexhcranz/status/1462803898675175425?s=20"&gt;buy that adapter Dieter had been begging me to buy for months&lt;/a&gt;, and it instantly resolved my great orange W issue. But it revealed that while I’d laid a lot of blame at Sony Imaging Edge Webcam’s feet, the software didn’t deserve all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZFG43ReMCsGvS8jQzSYhHu4tAlA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160196/gygvusba7iii__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not pictured: a viable webcam power source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vpR8D3"&gt;Those automatic shutdowns? With that big orange W glaring at me I’d naturally assumed they were a software problem. But my coworkers (and I) soon learned it was a &lt;em&gt;heating &lt;/em&gt;problem. The &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fgygvusba7iii.html&amp;amp;subid1=Verge011322"&gt;USB-powered dummy battery ($45.95)&lt;/a&gt; I used was overheating my entire camera, forcing it to shut down again and again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fue1K8"&gt;I’m now on a quest for an adapter that will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; overheat my entire camera. But so far, I’ve already spent $80 on a stand, $46 on a battery pack, and $25 on an HDMI adapter. That’s $151 I’d sunk into trying to cheaply turn my DSLR into a high-powered webcam. For the same price, I could have picked up a webcam from Newegg or Micro Center and avoided the shame of the W. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="La4bye"&gt;And after spending all that money trying to have the very best fidelity webcam, that’s when Opal launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22834196/opal-c1-webcam-camera-dslr-video-quality-performance-review-price"&gt;the $300 Opal C1&lt;/a&gt;. My co-workers love it, probably because it does everything I’d spent $151 on, but in a tiny package that doesn’t also require investing in a costly camera. I try to be a savvy enough tech shopper that I rarely regret purchases, but reading &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22834196/opal-c1-webcam-camera-dslr-video-quality-performance-review-price"&gt;Cameron Faulkner’s review of the C1&lt;/a&gt; while my expensive and not very reliable webcam literally loomed over my head gave me some powerful regret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HuJ1yD5Y1CPqGlp6jjxIFBWdTYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067802/cfaulkner_141231_4911_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Opal C1, quietly mocking me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EmLZFg"&gt;Soon after, I edited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22858876/built-in-laptop-webcam-zoom-video-conferencing"&gt;Allison Johnson’s piece about refusing to care about her webcam&lt;/a&gt; because she has no interest in tinkering with that part of her work setup. I wildly disagree with her (that’s okay! She also likes Android phones!) — a big reason I spent so much time trying to perfect this setup was because it was something I wanted to tinker with. I wanted to be finicky and tweak things and produce the best image I could even if it was only visible to Nilay, Dieter, and Andru during a &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; recording on Zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHNYnj"&gt;I probably won’t get the Opal C1 or even just a budget webcam at Micro Center. I probably &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;continue to refresh &lt;a href="https://support.d-imaging.sony.co.jp/app/webcam/en/"&gt;the Sony Imaging Edge Webcam page&lt;/a&gt; hoping for a better update, while buying and returning scores of USB dummy battery adapters as I hunt for one that doesn’t exacerbate the Sony A7 III’s well-known heating problem. I’ll continue to tinker even as Dieter’s eye twitches and I inevitably get roasted on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1FrLu"&gt;Trying to turn a real camera into a webcam will not be worth the money or time I’ve spent thus far and will probably continue to spend. But one day I will have that perfect video quality and a keen satisfaction with all the effort I’ve put into this relatively needless task. No one will acknowledge my webcam and I’ll feel immense pride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pgnRwx"&gt;And then I’ll probably start working on my Zoom background.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CKqHbu"&gt;Most of us check our gift card balances online (because who actually keeps those receipts that tell us how much money we have left on them?), making an apparent oversight by Google all the worse. It appears that Google inadvertently approved a prominent ad for a phony Target gift card balance checker that’s meant to steal your funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mg9E3y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/s4m8ou/i_googled_target_gift_card_balance_to_check_gift/"&gt;A Reddit user&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/"&gt;r/assholedesign&lt;/a&gt; discovered the slip-up when searching Google for “Target gift card balance” on mobile, and found that the very first result is an ad, titled “Check Gift Card Balance - Target.” Only, the site isn’t Target — it’s actually a site called “bristolhirevan.” The ad’s description says it will let you check your gift card balance “immediately,” and that it also offers “all van sizes to fit your needs” — how can you get more legit than that?  My colleague Sean Hollister and I found the same phony ad when searching for the exact phrase ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V1vAjQ"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2022-01-15T22:45:40.362882+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/s4m8ou/i_googled_target_gift_card_balance_to_check_gift/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;I googled target gift card balance to check gift card balances. An ad appears above the actual target website that copies the target website. I'm imagining it steals card numbers from people that don't check. I reported the ad to Google a few days ago and nothing has happened to it.&lt;/a&gt; from
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/"&gt;assholedesign&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PNNXPF"&gt;Okay, while the name of the site doesn’t sound convincing at all, its interface sure looks like the real thing, although the actual Target site requires you to sign in to check your gift card balance, while this fake site doesn’t. Besides that, the only things that are off about the webpage are the URL, which still has the “bristolhirevan” domain and the fact that every single link on the page leads to the real Target homepage, despite promising to link to a weekly ad or a gift registry. If you were really in a rush (and were somehow distracted enough to ignore the mention of vans), you just might accidentally enter your gift card’s number and security code here, resulting in it getting stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbNs8c"&gt;Gift card scams appear to be on the rise. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-data-show-major-increase-gift-cards-scam-payment-method"&gt;the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported that victims of gift card scams lost a total of $148 million&lt;/a&gt; within the first nine months of 2021 — more than all of 2020. Target gift cards are apparently scammers’ cards of choice, as FTC data shows people were scammed out of $35 million worth of Target gift cards last year, more than double the amount of any other gift card brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61J1Xr"&gt;As pointed out by the FTC, &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/gift-card-scams"&gt;gift card scams&lt;/a&gt; often take place over the phone, with the scammer pretending to be an employee of a company like Google or Amazon (or even someone from a federal agency) who demands the victim make a payment in the form of a gift card. However, fake balance checker sites like these often hide in plain sight — apparently even as ads on Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUWX4G"&gt;A 2020 report from &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/scammers-spoof-targets-gift-card-balance-checking-page/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; draws attention to sites that impersonate Target gift card balance checker pages, noting that Target is actually one of the most popular sites for scammers to replicate. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Google with a request for comment about how this scam may have slipped through its ad review process, and if it will be removed, but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T, Dish, and T-Mobile spend billions on more 5G spectrum </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SG5J4lOul3g8Ig7s8E6mBkatZkM=/0x27:4774x3210/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70394713/1187777086.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by George Frey/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zn3KZ1"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, Dish, and T-Mobile dropped billions of dollars in a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction to acquire more 5G spectrum licenses in the midrange 3.45GHz to 3.55GHz band, according to a report by the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-dish-spend-billions-on-spectrum-for-5g-services-11642188054"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HA5pFV"&gt;While AT&amp;amp;T was the biggest spender at $9 billion, Dish spent $7.3 billion, and T-Mobile followed behind at $2.9 billion. Verizon was notably absent from the auction. A number of smaller players also made the list, like Three Forty-Five Spectrum, which you can view on &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/atandt-dish-win-big-in-andromeda-auction-verizon-gets-nothing/d/d-id/774625"&gt;Light Reading’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YDLbhD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the third-largest FCC auction yet, with total bids reaching about $22.5 billion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxTIvd"&gt;The auction officially ended in November, but the FCC hasn’t publicly disclosed the winning bidders until now (&lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-379256A1.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). Total bids reached about $22.5 billion, making it the third-largest FCC spectrum auction yet. Only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;last year’s $80 billion C-band auction&lt;/a&gt; (over half of which was contributed by Verizon), and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/29/7945035/fcc-aws-3-spectrum-auction-largest-ever"&gt;2015’s $44.9 billion AWS-3 auction&lt;/a&gt; top this amount of spending, as pointed out by &lt;a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/fccs-345-ghz-5g-auction-now-third-largest-in-aggregate-bids"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next TV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vB3yi4"&gt;When it comes to using the 3.45GHz band, however, &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt; says that companies will have to deploy new radios on cell towers that have the ability to broadcast signals across it. Smartphones that support C-band may already be capable of using the band, &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt; also notes, as they both fall under the 3rd Generation Partnership Project’s (3GPP) n77 technical standards that cover 3.3GHz to 4.2GHz, which existing 5G smartphones already use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="110NtU"&gt;Although the 3.45GHz band operates closely to C-band, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes that it’s not as likely to interfere with aircraft equipment. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;set to deploy their expanded 5G C-band services on January 19th&lt;/a&gt; after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;delayed the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;rollout twice&lt;/a&gt; due to aircraft safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will now require employees to submit proof of COVID-19 booster shot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Store cube stock 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nbql_Y8lQk52pmKhPsCxgYqN-xw=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70394216/theverge3_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R0bPp0"&gt;Apple now requires store and corporate employees to get a COVID-19 booster shot, the company announced in an internal email seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8JQJu"&gt;Once an employee is eligible to get a booster shot, they will have four weeks to comply, otherwise, they will need to take frequent tests to enter a retail store, partner store, or Apple office starting on February 15th. Apple will require unvaccinated employees — or those who haven’t yet submitted proof of vaccination — to provide negative COVID-19 rapid antigen tests before entering the workplace beginning on January 24th, although it’s unclear whether this applies to both corporate and retail employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8RVbxv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple boosts safety protocols as the omicron variant spreads&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mILrja"&gt;“Due to waning efficacy of the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines and the emergence of highly transmissible variants such as Omicron, a booster shot is now part of staying up to date with your COVID-19 vaccination to protect against severe disease,” Apple states in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgxOlg"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738265/apple-vaccine-requirement-daily-covid-19-tests"&gt;Apple asked that unvaccinated corporate employees take daily tests&lt;/a&gt; before entering the office, with unvaccinated retail workers testing twice per week. The company also began requiring vaccinated individuals to take COVID-19 tests once every week, and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679772/apple-vaccine-policy-covid-19-testing-unvaccinated"&gt;lowered the frequency of these tests&lt;/a&gt;. It appears that Apple’s “infrequent” testing policy no longer applies to employees who don’t receive the booster shot by Apple’s deadline, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Sp61V"&gt;Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877332/meta-facebook-require-employees-covid-19-booster-vaccine-shot-return-office-reopening"&gt;Meta said employees will need to get a COVID-19 booster shot&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the company’s return to in-office work in March. While Google hasn’t mandated company-wide booster shots yet, it requires employees to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22836575/google-unvaccinated-employees-mandate-unpaid-leave-termination-remote-work"&gt;have the first two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884539/google-require-negative-molecular-test-covid-19-offices"&gt;take weekly molecular tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will let dating apps offer third-party payment options in the Netherlands</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-G1OIsdNoZpjEYYJ4rTZp7cd0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70393949/acastro_170731_1777_0003_v6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oc0YNi"&gt;Apple will let dating app developers offer alternate payment options in the Netherlands in compliance with the Dutch regulator’s ruling, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-15/apple-will-add-additional-payment-options-for-dutch-dating-apps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This will allow dating apps — and only dating apps — distributed in the country to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;Apple’s 15 to 30 percent commission&lt;/a&gt; on in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSHZQL"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mbbs4zql"&gt;a message to developers on its site&lt;/a&gt;, Apple explains that it’s introducing two new optional “entitlements,” or specific app capabilities, that will let developers add third-party payment processors for dating apps in the Netherlands. Dating app developers can either direct customers to a website to complete their purchase or add a third-party payment service within the app. However, if developers choose to snub Apple’s payment service in favor of an alternative, Apple says it won’t be able to help users with refunds, subscription management, or any payment issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1ZtqF"&gt;There’s another, more concerning caveat, though — any developers that want to add alternate payment options will have to create a separate version of the dating app only available in the Netherlands, as noted on &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement/"&gt;a developer support page&lt;/a&gt;. Apple will still charge dating apps a commission for using external payment processors. “Dating apps that are granted an entitlement to link out or use a third-party in-app payment provider will pay Apple a commission on transactions,” Apple writes. “More information on all aspects of the entitlements will be available shortly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rEFNMv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Because we do not believe these orders are in our users’ best interests, we have appealed the ACM’s decision to a higher court”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NWesu1"&gt;Apple has also appealed the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets’ (ACM) decision. “Because we do not believe these orders are in our users’ best interests, we have appealed the ACM’s decision to a higher court,” Apple explains. “We’re concerned these changes could compromise the user experience, and create new threats to user privacy and data security. In the meantime, we are obligated to make the mandated changes which we’re launching today and we will provide further information shortly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K53ogY"&gt;In December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22852966/apple-netherlands-dating-apps-match-tinder-app-store-competition"&gt;the ACM ruled that Apple allow dating apps in the country to offer third-party payment services&lt;/a&gt;, and if the company failed to do so by January 15th, it would face a 5 million Euro-per-week fine. The &lt;a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/acm-launches-investigation-abuse-dominance-apple-its-app-store"&gt;ACM began its investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Apple’s payment rules in 2019, concentrating specifically on dating apps following a complaint from Match Group, which owns popular online dating services Match.com, Tinder, OkCupid, and Hinge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHp9Z3"&gt;Apple’s payment policies have stirred up controversy across the globe, with South Korea introducing legislation that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22877952/apple-third-party-payments-app-store-south-korea"&gt;requires the company to allow in-app third-party payment services&lt;/a&gt;. Its restriction on alternate payment services is also the catalyst behind the ongoing battle between Epic Games and Apple — a court order that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;forces Apple to allow external payment options&lt;/a&gt; was just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;put on hold after an appeal from Apple&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, Apple made a small compromise and agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;let “reader” apps point customers to external sites&lt;/a&gt; for subscription signups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JHLAM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 4:50PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added clarification that Apple will require developers to create a separate app binary specific to the Netherlands in order to use third-party payment services, and that it will still take a commission on transactions that use external payment processors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yellowjackets has reawakened my inner Lost fan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="yellowjackets" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y6I7OX-xF4WzAJFwG4chBRefoBo=/0x0:4096x2731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70393860/FEAlvwrVkAUjpmf.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Showtime&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u1hUuy"&gt;For the last few weeks, my mind has been filled with questions that, out of context, make little sense. I’ve thought long and hard about why a high school girl would start eating dirt and which middle-aged man might be covered in glitter. I’ve pondered the significance of everything from psychedelic mushrooms to a high school soccer coach’s pep talk to a missing bullet in a police officer’s gun. I’ve even rewatched video to see if a state championship-winning goal was offside — and don’t get me started on how much I’ve thought about cannibalism. What I’m saying is: &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; has completely taken over my brain. I haven’t been this obsessed with theorizing about events in a television show since the cast of &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt; discovered the hatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bX9YRD"&gt;On the surface, there are some very obvious connections between &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt;. Both center on a plane crash in which the survivors find themselves in the wilderness where a bunch of weird shit starts happening. Both jump around in time, exploring not only the events in the wild but also the cast’s life before and after the tragedy. Most crucially, both are absolutely jam-packed with secrets, making theorizing about what’s actually happening arguably the most fun part of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C51BQ1"&gt;It’s not like there haven’t been weird mysteries since &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt;. I mean, I watched the ongoing Microsoft Surface ad known as &lt;em&gt;Under the Dome&lt;/em&gt;. But none of &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt;’s successors has grabbed me quite the same way that &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; has. I actually came to the show a few weeks late and binged the first half in a single night, before fitting Sunday evening viewings into my schedule. It didn’t take long at all; I’ve been hooked since the first five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W3vgBw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sYznLoeS_mA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0b35ck"&gt;It starts out in the perfect way: pure &lt;em&gt;what the fuck?&lt;/em&gt; energy. A young girl, chased through a frozen forest, with unsettling whispers and screams in the background, ends up impaled on spikes in a trap beneath the snow. Then there’s a gruesome ritual that I’d rather not think about too much. From there, things get a little more wholesome, shifting to the titular Yellowjackets, a high school soccer team from New Jersey that just won the state championship, earning them a spot at nationals. (I remain convinced that the game-winning goal was, in fact, offside, but I need to see some better camera angles to be sure.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOXtED"&gt;There are many different kinds of dramas happening in &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; simultaneously. There’s the typical teenage stuff from before the crash, as the girls deal with parties and boyfriends and their on-field dynamics. There’s the &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/em&gt;-style breakdown in the woods, as the team — and a few other folks who happened to be stuck on the plane, like the obsessive and possessive equipment manager Misty — try to survive in the wilderness. And then we have the present day, when the survivors struggle to keep it together after everything they went through; one is just getting out of rehab, while another lets loose on a reporter looking for juicy details on the crash. And all of this is set to a musical backdrop of this one mixtape I made myself in 1995 by recording Smashing Pumpkins songs from the radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCj7rN"&gt;It’s this combination of bizarre moments, intense drama, and time-shifting storytelling that makes &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; work so well — and makes it so ideal for theorizing. First, you’ll see something that’s either shocking or confusing. It could be dark, like a ritual killing or a suspicious suicide or a kid wearing antlers like some kind of mystical goddess. Or it could be something smaller, like a strange symbol that keeps appearing with no explanation. These moments all provoke questions, and as the story shifts around in time, it rarely clears things up. Instead, it piles on the mysteries and makes you wonder if the answer you’re seeking might just be found in a different time. A great example of this is the survivors; until someone makes an appearance in the present, or you see them die, you never actually know if someone made it through the ordeal in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FoI50J"&gt;As any &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt; fan will tell you, this kind of structure can be frustrating, particularly if it doesn’t pay off. That show was a deluge of cool, weird ideas — a smoke monster! a hatch! also polar bears? — that ultimately never went anywhere. But I still loved it. The mysteries were fun enough even without satisfying answers, and besides, they were also an excuse to spend lots of time with these characters. The cast of &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; is a delight and totally unpredictable, to the point that I’d watch for the &lt;em&gt;Riverdale&lt;/em&gt;-style drama alone. (Seriously, Misty scares me, and that’s true in any time period.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VI5Zk"&gt;So far, &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; is evoking all of those same feelings for me that&lt;em&gt; Lost&lt;/em&gt; did. Sure, I’d love the finale to satisfy my lingering curiosity and to find out who is really behind the antlers. But the ride so far has already been a blast. It’s the journey, as they say, not necessarily the destination. Only, in this case, the journey involves teens eating each other and a seance gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdp6Kp"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The final episode of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;’ first season airs on Showtime on January 16th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How a design museum unearthed a treasure trove of classic Slovak games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/71EDrmOsnr8OPdaBm21y8vhwUVM=/0x32:774x548/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70393767/S_atochin.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Šatochin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hAxVN9"&gt;Late last year, the Slovak Design Museum released a translated collection of ’80s text adventures from the region. The games, often programmed by teenagers, capture a moment in history when the first generation of Slovak developers were learning their craft to share among their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ifwunf"&gt;The museum didn’t always cover games. Maroš Brojo, the general manager of the Slovak Game Developers Association, pitched the multimedia collection that he now curates. “When you get the patronage of a museum… it gives you much more credibility,” he says. “Suddenly, people start to have a very different view of this actually being part of something important. Our culture and our heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Xd6DT"&gt;The 10 games that make up this first batch of translations and re-releases were selected for their historical significance. They capture a part of the late ’80s in what was then Czechoslovakia, a Soviet satellite state. In one, &lt;em&gt;Šatochín&lt;/em&gt;, the titular Soviet Major fights with Rambo in Vietnam. “I don’t want to say [it was] against the regime, but it’s very subversive,” says Brojo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrQxEw"&gt;One of the developers behind &lt;em&gt;Šatochín&lt;/em&gt;, Stanislav Hrda, was also involved in the translation and preservation project. He was 16 when he and some friends published &lt;em&gt;Šatochín&lt;/em&gt; after being fascinated by the American movies that made it across the border on VHS tapes. “This game is making jokes [about] the regime… and the Soviet army,” he says. “It’s hard to win. So when you are playing, Rambo will kill you 10 times because you [were] not lucky, and you made the wrong choice. It was very funny for my friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wsSVJZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When you get the patronage of a museum… it gives you much more credibility.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hsw4Cr"&gt;Ten may be underselling it — in my experimentation with &lt;em&gt;Šatochín, &lt;/em&gt;the Soviet soldier lost his life in a handful of gruesome ways, including being crushed against a coral reef, within just a few minutes of starting the game. Hrda also integrated an Easter egg into the game, where binding the keys “KGB” as controls would allow the player to play as Rambo himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQp361"&gt;Game development was primarily a teenage hobby at the time. Because games weren’t sold in shops, there was no chance of making money out of it. Hrda and others shared these games among their friends for entertainment rather than profit. At one point, &lt;em&gt;Šatochín &lt;/em&gt;made it into the hands of František Fuka, a developer from Prague who had previously inspired Hrda and his friends. In Hrda’s words, he told them, “Yeah, you guys made such a nice, fun game, but be prepared and take a toothbrush with you because when the police come to catch you, you must be ready.” Hrda laughs as he says it, but he admits that he was “a bit afraid” after that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LYplLieA1dU0QkCsPA85XOIW1vU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23167268/Cover_1024x768.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gb3FA6"&gt;But he and his friends continued to make games, calling themselves Sybilasoft. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989 led to more democratic governance and a market economy being established in Czechoslovakia, Hrda, then 18, created a real company to sell games. With financing now available, he says, programmers across Czechoslovakia were able to create “very high-quality games for the ZX Spectrum.” But in the West, people had moved on to more advanced computers, leaving the creations of Hrda, Fuka, and others to be played primarily in Eastern Europe only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptZU4c"&gt;But a few years ago, Hrda was involved in an exhibition at the Design Museum that showed off these games from the ’80s, allowing people to play them on the original hardware. More exhibitions were planned — before COVID got in the way. Brojo calls the website “sort of a backup virtual exhibition, but also says that he’s pleased that it can form the beginning of a database as they continue to develop the project further. As well as the games themselves, which can be run on emulators on modern PCs, there are images of the hardware, box art, and so on from the period. Brojo says that his next goal is to add scans of ’80s and ’90s Slovak game magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="7ArrPD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Keep playing good games, and if you are brave enough, you can try ours.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G7S5uv"&gt;Along with the translations, the website also makes the games accessible to a wider audience. Brojo says that the team was lucky that much of that work had been done by ZX Spectrum fan communities like&lt;a href="https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php"&gt; Spectrum Computing&lt;/a&gt;, so they didn’t have to salvage much from cassettes and the like. And finding the original developers in order to get their permission was usually straightforward. “Most of the community was very friendly, so a lot of the authors know other authors, and they were able to get us in touch with them,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikka9B"&gt;The tricky part was disassembling the games so that Slovak text could be replaced with English. Programmer Slavomír Labský and translation coordinator Marián Kabát wrote about some of their experience in a post on the&lt;a href="https://scd.sk/clanky/playable-english-localizations-of-slovak-digital-games-from-the-late-80s-period/"&gt; Slovak Design Museum’s website&lt;/a&gt;. Labský explains his process in taking the games apart and replacing them once the translations were delivered to him, taking into account difficulties like the short lengths of the text segments. Kabát described the challenges of contextualizing era- and location-specific references, such as those to popular folk singers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hvsok"&gt;Brojo says he hopes that the nuances of the games will come across in these translations, like the subversive writing in &lt;em&gt;Šatochín&lt;/em&gt;. On the other hand, he mentions that the 1987 game &lt;em&gt;Pepsi Cola&lt;/em&gt; appears to be the one that English-speaking people are most interested in on social media. Developed in part by Fuka, it tasks the player with stealing the drink’s secret recipe. Brojo assumes that the recognizability of the brand is curious to Western players. “It might be sort of a bizarre thing that we also knew Pepsi Cola in the East before 1989,” he says. “Although Pepsi Cola was actually one of the most popular soft drinks.” (It had been sold in the Soviet Union since 1972.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="9ZsqOe"&gt;But the historical value of the games isn’t the only reason they’ve been made available. Instead, Hrda just wants people to enjoy them like his friends did back when he made them. “I [hope people] will have fun with them even if those games are very old,” he laughs. “Keep playing good games, and if you are brave enough, you can try ours.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s excellent Basilisk V3 mouse is selling for its best price ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Basilisk V3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/93zvcK6thr59E8heEEsXStf-ij4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70393670/cfaulkner_141231_4910_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s Basilisk V3 is on sale at Amazon today for just $59.99.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sEIbpk"&gt;We’re starting the weekend with some exciting news for gamers: our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;pick for the best wired gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt; is now available for its lowest price to date. For only the third time, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-Customizable-Ergonomic-Gaming/dp/B09C13PZX7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling Razer’s Basilisk V3 for just $59.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $69.99. The comfortable mouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22650400/razer-basilisk-v3-chroma-rgb-scroll-wheel-price-features"&gt;delivers notable improvements&lt;/a&gt; over its predecessor, particularly in regards to its scroll wheel. Depending upon how hard your scroll, the mouse can switch between ridged scrolling and free-spin modes, which make it easier to scroll down the page more freely — a perk that comes in handy even if you’re not using the mouse for gaming. It also touts a 26K DPI sensor, RGB lighting, and 11 programmable buttons, so you can adjust the controls to your liking within Razer’s Synapse software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wjkAwO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10909072"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X0ChiQ"&gt;If you’re on the market for a pair of affordable true wireless earbuds, today we’re seeing some great discounts on both the new Jabra Elite 3 earbuds &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Jabra’s older Elite 75t. Already considered Jabra’s budget buds, the Elite 3 typically retail for $79.99 but are on sale today for $59.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Built/dp/B09B45T59G/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVt4AzUUic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, their lowest price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Chris Welch praised the earbuds, noting that they sound better than he expected given their price. He was also impressed by their performance, decent call quality, no-fuss controls, and lengthy battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTXNHE"&gt;However, if you’re looking for wireless earbuds that offer features like noise cancellation, the $149.99 Elite 75t are also on sale at Best Buy &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgp0dUvFa7T" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $79.99&lt;/a&gt;, which nearly matches their best price to date. While the noise cancellation on these isn’t quite as good as it is on the newer &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/26374473.5227/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxNTQ5NTg3L2phYnJhLWVsaXRlLTg1dC1yZXZpZXctZmVhdHVyZXMtc3BlY3MtcHJpY2U/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bb3df85a2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t&lt;/a&gt;, they both boast excellent sound with a good amount of bass. The Elite 75t are also comfortable and capable of connecting to two Bluetooth devices simultaneously, a feature still not commonly found in many wireless earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Elite 75t review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="pPy4Pw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XILdnP"&gt;Shifting from wireless earbuds to high-quality microphones, the $129.99 Blue Yeti mic is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N1YPXW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale in select colors for $99.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgp5KfMrnfX" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;; this includes the black model, which Amazon hasn’t discounted since July. While not its best price ever, this is the lowest we’ve seen the mic sell for since the holidays. A popular staple with podcasters, YouTubers, and Twitch streamers, the Yeti is capable of conforming to a number of different recording environments. It also allows you to change pickup patterns, modulate, and otherwise fine-tune your audio, rendering it one of the more versatile budget options out there for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lggHuR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10650797"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m_-4643279180604848904ZHRjPs"&gt;DJI’s Mavic Mini remains one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best drones you can buy for under $500&lt;/a&gt;, however, $450 is still a lot of money. Thankfully, if you’re looking for something more affordable, its 2019 predecessor is available today at Newegg with a handful of accessories. Right now, you can buy the last-gen &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=TheVergeDailyDeals1152022&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F380-0002-00345" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DJI Mavic Mini Fly More Combo for just $299.99&lt;/a&gt;, a solid $100 discount. The bundle includes three sets of spare propellers, a carrying bag, a propeller guard, a gimbal protector, spare batteries, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m_-4643279180604848904Y1gSCr"&gt;Despite the fact the Mavic Mini is an older, more budget-friendly drone, it still shares many features in common with more expensive models, like a number of creative shooting modes and the ability to automatically return to its takeoff spot. It also doesn’t require FAA registration, a boon for experienced drone pilots and newcomers alike. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938530/dji-mavic-mini-price-specs-faa-ultra-light-combo-pack" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mEkTeZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730560"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T07o9o"&gt;Some other ways to save this weekend&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="AWG8HQ"&gt;If you’re a Nintendo Switch owner, Amazon is selling a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online Family Membership and a SanDisk 128GB Micro SD card for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BT4MTZS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just $34.99 (nearly $40 off&lt;/a&gt;), giving you a way to game online and expand your console’s storage space at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZwVNY7"&gt;Apple’s latest AirPods are still selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at the low price of $139.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. They originally sold for $179.99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="h5OXiV"&gt;Lenovo’s Smart Clock 2 with a built-in wireless charging pad &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgqmnNTjMYj" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $64.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, down from $89.99.&lt;/li&gt;
