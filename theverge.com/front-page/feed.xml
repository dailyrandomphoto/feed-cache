    <title>A finder’s fee won’t guarantee a PS5 from Amazon, Walmart, or Best Buy this holiday </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="TMAP0s"&gt;It’s still difficult to find a PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch OLED, or practically any desktop graphics card made in the last three years. &lt;em&gt;So&lt;/em&gt; difficult that many people resort to paying scalpers far more than it should cost to get one. This trend has stuck around since the early days of the pandemic, and it might not change any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vVmGv"&gt;This year, the likes of Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart signaled that they, too, would like to become console and GPU scalpers, in a sense. Each began hosting some restock events you couldn’t access unless you had a paid subscription to Amazon Prime, Walmart Plus, or Best Buy’s new “Totaltech.” But don’t fall for the notion that these services will go the extra mile for you. In fact, they don’t guarantee the basic tools you need to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk6cMi"&gt;While Scalpers have what you want and will give it to you if you pay, that’s not how it works with these subscriptions. Yes, instead of going up against countless others in a restock battle royale, you might be competing with a smaller set of paying customers, theoretically boosting your chances of success. But it’s still a total gamble. It’s essentially a cover charge to get into the same page where you might be able to click a buy button, or you might not. And the more people who pay the cover charge, the worse your chances get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RzGeAe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;don’t fall for the notion that these services will go the extra mile for you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hw2vIf"&gt;It didn’t take long for people to realize none of these memberships guarantee the most important element of snapping up a new console: getting alerted about when these restocks are actually happening. One shared theme with the likes of Amazon Prime, Best Buy Totaltech, and Walmart Plus is their overall lack of communication with subscribers. They rarely provide any heads-up about these restock opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NjbUiosqHh3QWL8lrXIWzDjPkbk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552884/rtx3080ti.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Founders Edition RTX 3080 Ti has a retail price of 1,199.99, but &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://stockx.pvxt.net/c/482924/530344/9060?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstockx.com%2Fnvidia-founders-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-graphics-card%3Fcountry%3DUS%26currencyCode%3DUSD&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the lowest price at StockX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is currently $1,778.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gLUKbw"&gt;Without some serious strides in how these retailers communicate with subscribers, you’ll likely still be outpaced in getting a console or GPU by people who have made a hobby out of following Twitter profiles like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wario64/"&gt;Wario64&lt;/a&gt;, who’s known for being among the first to post news of restocks; joining the relevant Discord servers that obsessively track restocks; and being quick to the draw with the refresh button on your browser (and knowing when to stop tapping refresh to avoid getting flagged as a spammer, too). Sadly, all of this is among the best advice out there for finding success yourself. It’s no surprise that careers have been made from this unusual supply and demand climate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="asvbbq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even with a subscription, you may be outpaced by people who’ve turned restocks into a hobby — or a career&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kDZbUt"&gt;It’s part of my role here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, alongside my colleagues, to figure out if it’s actually possible to get these hard-to-find items when a retailer claims to have them in stock and running through the chaotic process of trying to buy one ourselves (don’t worry, we throw them back in the water for everyone else). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYS8rB"&gt;While I don’t recommend any of these memberships if all that you want to do is score a console, they’re useful for things like free shipping or scoring some discounts. So I can see why some might subscribe to them with the bonus of a scant possibility of finding a new PS5, Switch OLED, Xbox Series X, or a new Nvidia GPU. With Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart being the places where these restocks most frequently occur, we’ve included info below about each subscription, what it’s like to try to score on these sites, and how we think the checkout process could improve.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="spFaxG"&gt;Amazon Prime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="I5o8vz"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"&gt;its Prime subscription&lt;/a&gt; that costs $119.99 per year or $12.99 per month (if you’re fine paying more in total each year to be on a month-to-month plan). It nets you complementary fast shipping, access to Prime Video streaming, and a variety of other perks, including being the key that gets you in the door for some exclusive restocking events. Notably, you can get all of these perks — and access to its Prime Day shopping event — even with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G6RZ3AA6NQMCKYEM"&gt;a free trial to Prime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmOvGU"&gt;Actually getting into one of Amazon’s Prime-exclusive console restocks is almost entirely the result of seeing the right tweet at the right time. Amazon’s restocks tend to sell out much faster than they do at Walmart or Best Buy. In minutes, or sometimes less, things usually go out of stock, but it’s also usually unclear whether it’s actually stock or a site stability issue instead. I’ve had luck buying a PS5 by constantly refreshing pages that seem inactive or broken. Even when items went to my cart, it was a trial-and-error process that ended in failure more than success. So, it’s not the most elegant process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9QhQS"&gt;To my knowledge, Amazon hasn’t attempted a queueing system for console restocks, which would be the most fair way to go. Instead, it’s a free-for-all that’s far too easy to miss out on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LLwqVN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a trial-and-error process that ends in failure more than success&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EmjmxV"&gt;While it’s not usually limited to Prime members, Amazon also sends out text messages to those who register for updates on its Treasure Truck, which previously has offered the PS5 and Nintendo Switch OLED for Prime customers only. Though, in both cases, these text messages didn’t arrive until after each had already sold out. So, not much help there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEtKjd"&gt;When I asked Amazon if it intended to improve how it communicates with Prime subscribers who aren’t on the restock beat, an Amazon spokesperson dodged my inquiries, talking instead about the other benefits of a Prime subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Walmart Raises Forecast As Earnings Beat Estimates" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ncJd1HKIHMEYwr0rYBDHoC1-hBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23025607/1353679329.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tTeU9C"&gt;Walmart Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jzYuBU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5111921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart Plus&lt;/a&gt; is $98 per year or $12.95 per month if you’d rather pay more to go month-to-month. It offers free shipping with no order minimum, discounts on prescriptions and fuel, the ability to scan and checkout from the Walmart app on your phone (you’ll still need to finalize the order at a self-checkout kiosk), and more. It’s also offering exclusive restock opportunities for subscribers, in addition to giving them four hours of early access to shop its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;. One caveat is that, unlike Prime, you need to be a paying member to take advantage of these perks. Being on its 15-day trial won’t suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lnkzcw"&gt;Word of Walmart restocks usually spreads on Twitter a few hours before they actually go live, though the company rarely sends the news out via official channels. Recently, about half of those restock events seem to have been exclusive to Walmart Plus subscribers, with the others being openly available to anyone with a free Walmart account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TxYHu"&gt;It’s tough to know what it’s going to be like jumping into any given Walmart restock. I’ve had luck refreshing the page the moment it goes live, adding a PS5 to a cart, and buying it. Most other times, though, its site hangs and crashes in frustrating ways. Its “add to cart” buttons usually aren’t quick enough to show as “out of stock,” often leading me to believe I still have a chance even when I actually don’t. Walmart’s restocks usually come in waves, with new stock replenishing every 10 minutes for a few rounds, so it’s good to stick around for a while, refreshing frequently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v699Zh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s tough to know what it’s going to be like jumping into any given Walmart restock&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7YjX7S"&gt;More recently, Walmart has experimented with a new queueing system that lets you shop around while you wait for a timer to run down. While it’s more orderly in theory, it didn’t make the process of getting a console any easier. My wait for an Xbox Series X hung at “one minute remaining” for about 30 minutes until it notified me that it was out of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4JasU"&gt;I asked Walmart if it could share more detailed plans for future restocking events for its Walmart Plus subscribers and how it aims to improve communication, but the retailer declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ayo2V2"&gt;Best Buy Totaltech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xFgmKg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf17AZjAf3K" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy’s&lt;/a&gt; Totaltech costs $200 per year and grants you complimentary Geek Squad tech support, exclusive discounts, up to two years of warranty support on most products (so long as you remain a member), free, fast shipping, an extended return and exchange window, and more. It has already hosted several exclusive opportunities for Totaltech members to buy a PS5, the Nintendo Switch OLED, and the Xbox Series X, though the retailer offers as many, if not more, opportunities that don’t require a subscription — just a free My Best Buy account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICl11a"&gt;Where Best Buy sticks out from Amazon and Walmart actually has nothing to do with its Totaltech membership. Over the past year, it has hosted ticketed, in-store restocking events each month that grant early birds a ticket, guaranteeing them the ability to buy one of these products once doors open. This is a particularly big deal to some PC gamers who are after Nvidia’s Founder’s Edition graphics cards, which are exclusively sold at Best Buy in the US and easier to fit into PCs than those made by many aftermarket brands. Of course, whether you’re after a GPU or a PS5, supply is still very limited. That said, your chances seem better here than what Totaltech or any competing subscriptions can offer — and it’s free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSn1GH"&gt;Whether you’re a Totaltech member or not, Best Buy has the most stable online queuing system of any site that I’ve tried to use during restocks. I’ve successfully added consoles and GPUs to my cart, before releasing them back in the wild.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zGpxJp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Best Buy has the most stable online queuing system of any site that I’ve used, plus some in-store restocks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xqpk8D"&gt;Carly Charlson, director of public relations at Best Buy, shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company knows there are “more customers shopping for them than what’s available” and that its teams “are working on the best ways to alert them when they’re available.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhZpZi"&gt;For many (but not all) of its in-store restocks, Best Buy will post about them a day in advance to give you some heads-up. That’s not the case with online restocks. Those usually go live without advanced notice, requiring you to be paying close attention to Twitter or Discord if you want the best chances of succeeding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKhlxy"&gt;Best Buy told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it alerted Totaltech members via email about a recent PS5 and Nintendo Switch OLED restock a day in advance, then followed up with a push notification via the Best Buy app once inventory went live. Strangely, it also shared that this kind of outreach won’t happen for every restock in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ai8vEjJ5BZr7CZcbM2OA8D8jVeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22263398/gamestop_stock_sean_hollister.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IzUJwh"&gt;What other paid options exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FMn1yz"&gt;If you want to take a look outside of what the biggest retailers are doing (and not doing) for eager console shoppers, GameStop offers exclusive restocking opportunities for subscribers to its PowerUp Rewards Pro service, in addition to&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=VergePS5111821&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpoweruprewards%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; other gaming-centric perks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUcNiG"&gt;Subscribers will get “first dibs on new console drops, graphics cards, collectibles, and more.” What’s more, it explicitly informs its subscribers via email about upcoming console drops. It costs $14.99 per year. According to&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/ps5-restock-tracker-retailers-prep-black-friday/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;em&gt;CNET’s &lt;/em&gt;post on tracking PS5 restocks&lt;/a&gt;, the retailer lets PowerUp Rewards Pro members have a go at the consoles one hour ahead of everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cJV2bW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GameStop notoriously offers the priciest bundles in many of its exclusive restocks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SeMrKW"&gt;GameStop gets the nod for being more affordable than the subscriptions mentioned above, but it offers the fewest amount of perks. You’ll get a little promotional credit each month for sticking with the subscription, as well as discounts on games, and a subscription to the &lt;em&gt;Game Informer&lt;/em&gt; magazine. Though, it notoriously offers only the most expensive console bundles in almost all of its exclusive restock events. GameStop stuffs the bundles with games, controllers, and gift cards you might not want, and this is the thanks you get for subscribing to its service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3Xks9O"&gt;What if you don’t want to buy any subscriptions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ignVXa"&gt;Some manufacturers themselves have offered registration to give you a chance at buying products in a more orderly manner. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772145/ps5-restock-sony-ps-direct-november-holiday-playstation-5-register-email" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony is accepting free registration&lt;/a&gt; to express interest in purchasing its PlayStation 5, though it doesn’t ensure that you’ll get an invite. Instead, its selection process is determined on “previous interests and PlayStation activity,” not a first-come, first-served basis. I’m sure this is helping some people get consoles, but it’s certainly not a sure-fire way to get one soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XR78O7"&gt;Computer components company EVGA did the logical thing of just allowing people to sign up to buy an Nvidia RTX 30-series graphics card in early 2021, letting people buy it once their number in line is called. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776567/evga-line-queue-to-get-nvidia-rtx-3000-graphics-card-works" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;That’s how my colleague Sean Hollister scored an RTX 3060 at MSRP&lt;/a&gt; — it only took &lt;em&gt;nine months&lt;/em&gt; to reach his spot in line. Still, to him, it felt like a fair system at work. Sadly, EVGA halted its queues, so it’s not currently available to sign up for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w0i4C4AWF6f0y7PybLCCvSEfQsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23005942/verge_sean_hollister_evga_rtx_3060_20211111_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;EVGA used to let people sign up to be offered a chance to buy graphics cards, though its queue system is not currently available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aA5mUj"&gt;We might all be a bit happier if more retailers adopted more sensible queuing methods. If paying for a subscription increased your chances of getting what you want sooner &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;made it easier to do it at your own pace, that’d be great, too. Unfortunately, it seems like we’re not totally there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHhxBm"&gt;That’s the strange part about all of this. Retailers are good at sending out lots of marketing emails, yet this kind of personalized email or text outreach seems to have befuddled even the biggest stores. Or perhaps it’s not befuddling them, and they just choose not to do it. After all, these restocks generate a huge level of buzz and traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LWg3L"&gt;I wonder if the reality is somewhere in the middle. It can’t be overstated how limited stock is, and perhaps for site stability and security purposes, it behooves retailers to be as vague as possible — even to paying subscribers. On the other hand, retailers are fully aware that this frenzy won’t last forever, and as a business, it’s in their interest to turn as many of you as possible into regular-paying customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbXnOM"&gt;As these subscriptions currently exist, they want to get you in the door with the promise of exclusive access to restocking opportunities. I want these services to improve because they could be more useful for people who choose to pay. But without offering a real guarantee of success, they’re arguably worse than scalpers. They’re taking a cut of this madness with too little to show for it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite turned Craig into a rock star</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gSX0nEFcRaz5pM3AeJoYOjOVNZQ=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70165313/Q3EnkCx.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XumIBz"&gt;One day you’re just another Brute on the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; ring minding your own business, and the next you’re a rock star. That’s Craig, &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s infamous Brute that appeared in the notorious trailer last year. He might have originally represented the poor quality of graphics in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335520/halo-infinite-gameplay-xbox-series-x-trailer-demo"&gt;original &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt;, but now he has been memorialized as a rock star inside the game in an Easter egg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQc1En"&gt;The Craig shrine can be discovered on top of a giant tower in the fourth campaign mission in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. It includes a greatest hits album and a tour poster with dates for when Craig is holding a Zeta Halo tour. Songs include classics like “The Day You Become a Meme, I Got Tears Last Summer” and “I Smile Inside.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0OhDbDFB5st95A9dros00we3dSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23027177/OLGcMNd.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Craig’s greatest hits album.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuQ1mo"&gt;The Brutes inside &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; (like Craig) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744656/microsoft-halo-infinite-craig-brute-improved-graphics"&gt;have had a glow-up&lt;/a&gt; since we last saw them, and the graphical improvements leave just the memory of Craig in players’ minds. 343 Industries has promised Craig Easter eggs, so there could be even more to discover throughout the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBvwAX"&gt;Mint Blitz, a YouTuber who is so good at &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; I’m convinced his arms are autonomous, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_1kT_E1m4M"&gt;discovered the hidden Easter egg&lt;/a&gt; during the campaign missions. You’ll need to upgrade your Grappleshot, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22789035/halo-infinite-campaign-preview"&gt;awesome new ability in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to the 40 percent cooldown reduction in order to get to the top of the tower. Once you’re there, you can pick up a collectible skull and check out Craig’s wonderful rock star shrine.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Otter.ai is limiting its free plan to 30-minute transcriptions starting December 1st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Otter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GsphqH20S7fsY7rXvk31lX-XWNU=/40x0:1240x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70165281/otter.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lgn9Mx"&gt;Otter.ai is adding new limitations to the free Otter Basic plan on the subscription service, which will limit free users to 30-minute transcriptions starting December 1st, down from the current 40-minute limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fvD24"&gt;The company says that the changes are “due to increased costs and to maintain high standards of service.” Otter.ai is still offering the same 600 minutes of transcription per month to free users, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XmwUAi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The overall monthly limit for free users isn’t changing, however&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mXhBmB"&gt;The change isn’t hugely problematic in the long run, given that Otter.ai still isn’t changing the &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; amount of transcription that free users can do — just the amount that you can have transcribed in a single recording. That means that attentive users can simple just start a new file once the 30-minute limit is reached, although you’ll generally have to pay attention to when you’re creeping up on the time limit (and lose the benefit of having everything in a single document). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJCn64"&gt;Otter.ai customers who need the capability for longer recordings can pay for Otter Pro, which costs $99.99 per year or $12.99 per month. That price gets you transcriptions up to four hours long, up to 6,000 minutes of transcription each month, and additional features including custom vocabulary lists and the ability to import prerecorded files. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei MateBook 16 review: a nose(cam) short of great</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It has an excellent screen, but some weird quirks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="dzH3QW"&gt;Huawei laptops haven’t been widely available in the US for years. But they’ve traditionally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17396818/huawei-matebook-x-pro-laptop-review-specs-price"&gt;been fantastic products&lt;/a&gt;, with good enough performance and build quality to make them serious MacBook competitors. So I figured I’d review the MateBook 16, Huawei’s latest flagship notebook, even though it may not be on the radars of our US readers. Consider this a resource for those in markets where Huawei is still operating but also a quick check on what the rest of us are missing out on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CkuEj"&gt;On the outside, the MateBook 16… kind of looks like a MacBook Pro. Huawei’s got the colors and the general vibe down pat. Whether it performs as well as a MacBook is, of course, another question. Most of the MateBook 16 is great, from the speedy and comfortable keyboard to the all-day battery life, massive 3:2 display, and surprisingly powerful speakers. I know people who have replaced MacBooks with MateBooks as a primary driver, and I can see how for most office workers, the daily experience is quite similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERexf5"&gt;But the main difference is that when I’m using a MateBook, I occasionally come across weird things. They’re not things that make or break the experience, but they’re just odd flaws for such a nice laptop to have. And they add up to make a product that’s great but not as great as it feels like it easily could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6jx6PT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10873827"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Huawei MateBook 16 on a black table facing forward, open. The screen displays The Verge homepage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kJK1Ck3zU5OKMckBDJ9Pn2qrtys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22906773/akrales_211005_4788_0053.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You could convince me this was a MacBook in dim lighting from far away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HoTVFH"&gt;I should note, before we get too far into this, that the MateBook is only available in a somewhat limited number of countries. Currently, you can only order it directly from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fmatebook-16%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22790175%2Fhuawei-matebook-16-review-price-speces-features-amd-ryzen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Huawei’s site&lt;/a&gt; if you’re in China or Germany as of this writing. (I can’t imagine it will be available within the US any time soon, given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684274/huawei-honor-blacklist-entity-list-commerce-pentagon-energy-state"&gt;Huawei’s relationship with&lt;/a&gt; the Biden administration.) If you’re outside of those countries but are willing to ship one over, I have found &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aliexpress.com%2Fitem%2F1005002700344861.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22790175%2Fhuawei-matebook-16-review-price-speces-features-amd-ryzen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;models on AliExpress&lt;/a&gt; for as low as $1,259. My test unit, which has a Ryzen 7 5800H, 16GB of memory, and 512G of storage, is currently available for $1,469 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aliexpress.com%2Fitem%2F1005002700344861.html%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22790175%2Fhuawei-matebook-16-review-price-speces-features-amd-ryzen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on AliExpress&lt;/a&gt;. (Of course, the usual caveats about ordering from third-party sites apply if you’re going to shop there — you probably won’t recieve a warranty, you may need to get a separate charger, and you should make sure you’re buying from a reputable seller.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MhYjAh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The highlight of this device is the display&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FcH2zk"&gt;If you are able to get your hands on one of these, it has a number of selling points. It’s fairly light for a 16-inch notebook at 4.39 pounds. The trackpad is smooth and roomy, though it occasionally had issues with palm rejection. The keyboard is sturdy and impressively quiet — it’s probably the most MacBook-esque keyboard I’ve ever used on a Windows laptop (and I mean the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;recent models&lt;/a&gt;, not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;god-awful butterfly ones&lt;/a&gt;). There’s a useful port selection with two USB-C, two USB-A, a headphone jack, and HDMI. The speakers are quite good, with bass that’s a bit weak. It’s got an unobtrusive, professional look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The touchpad on the Huawei MateBook 16 seen from above and to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g8y5J1bfUuWEW21m9ZNBNpFi-0c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908078/akrales_211005_4788_0040.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The touchpad is “a durable matte glass.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z0rtMj"&gt;The highlight of the device, for me, is the display. Not only is it a whopping 16 inches, but it has a 3:2 aspect ratio, which is my favorite laptop aspect ratio. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7#:~:text=An%20aspect%20ratio%20is%20the,divides%20down%20to%2016%3A9."&gt;Yes, I have a favorite&lt;/a&gt;.) There’s a ton of vertical space, and I comfortably worked in multiple windows side by side; as someone who generally uses a 13-incher, the extra room feels luxurious. The panel itself, while not quite MacBook quality, still displays strong colors and sharp details and kicked back almost no glare. I enjoyed looking at it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The power button on the Huawei MateBook 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aK8quarfyUuVxCzVd8qyRxef4wM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908077/akrales_211005_4788_0036.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fingerprint reader in the power button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0Adq4a"&gt;Now, for the weird things. The MateBook’s microphones come equipped with Huawei’s Ai noise cancelation technology that’s supposed to reduce echo and ambient noise, but coworkers said that it made me sound very weird on Zoom calls. It was clearly processing my voice while I was speaking; someone said I sounded like I was underwater. They could still hear and understand me just fine, but it’s an odd caveat to such a nice laptop. I’ve asked Huawei about this issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em8xaa"&gt;Another oddity: the SSD is partitioned? There are essentially two drives on the MateBook 16. I’ve asked Huawei why this is, but I really can’t fathom why this would be necessary on a consumer laptop. It seems likely to cause needless confusion and hassle — I had various downloads interrupted midway because they’d been dumped into a partition that didn’t have room, and I had to move a bunch of things around to accommodate a large folder I was trying to load that was well under 512GB but too big for either partition. Finding files and applications that I needed was also more complicated, because I couldn’t always remember which drive they were on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNWMYS"&gt;And finally, the webcam. The MateBook has a nosecam that pops out of the keyboard’s top row when you press down on it. This, to me, is the equivalent of having no webcam — I’d rather be a black square on Zoom calls than have coworkers staring up my nostrils. So that’s also a thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="dHBO0o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The microphones made me sound weird on Zoom calls&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The webcam of the Huawei MateBook 16, open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gKYRI_-_jH0Hq2OfOq6uS_ebdbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925609/akrales_211012_4788_0134.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yep, this is where the webcam is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The webcam of the Huawei MateBook 16, depressed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YHj9m8Jft46JL30wr4pY1NFp7YQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925608/akrales_211012_4788_0123.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, seriously.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9JGENg"&gt;Huawei enthusiasts can use a Multi-Screen collaboration feature to connect the MateBook 16 to a Huawei phone or tablet. You can then drag and drop files between the tethered devices, access their apps interchangeably, or use the latter as a traditional external display. I wasn’t able to test this, as I didn’t have any Huawei phones or tablets on hand, but it sounds convenient and similar to Apple’s Sidecar feature. It does seem that you have to &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-matebook-16-review-3028122/"&gt;enter a passcode&lt;/a&gt; every time you reconnect a device, which would probably drive me up the wall after a while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KF40td"&gt;The MateBook also connects easily to Huawei earbuds — per Huawei, the two gadgets will prompt you to pair them automatically if you put them near each other. Huawei is clearly moving towards a robust and developed ecosystem, though whether people buy in will likely depend on how well the features continue to work as new products are released. Regardless, it’s something I’m jealous of as someone whose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose 700&lt;/a&gt; come disconnected from her &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271796/microsoft-surface-book-3-review-price-specs-features-13-5-screen"&gt;Surface Book&lt;/a&gt; at least a few times a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Huawei MateBook 16 seen from above angled to the right side, open. The screen displays a blue and purple desktop background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4AwsZtUMcfBz28Lmg9NgUNgJHpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908075/akrales_211005_4788_0031.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With Multi-Screen Collaboration, use a Huawei tablet as a touchpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Huawei MateBook 16 on a table with a potted plant in the background, angled to the right, open. The screen displays a blue and purple background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OTXlfr5ELwDOvkGSUay6ozKF5pk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908071/akrales_211005_4788_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;90 percent screen-to-body ratio — it’s a beauty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TdcNIf"&gt;As a work driver, the MateBook’s eight-core Ryzen processor did an excellent job. The fans were silent under heaps of Chrome tabs, Spotify streaming, and Zoom calls. I was never worried about anything crashing or slowing down, and nothing was ever hot. You can switch to a dedicated Performance Mode by pressing FN+P, though I’m not sure where a user who doesn’t have Huawei’s reviewers’ guide would find that information out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvdVfZ"&gt;As we generally expect from AMD Ryzen 5000 systems, the MateBook did quite well on multi-core benchmarks and lagged behind a bit on single-core devices. It also did not blow any graphical tasks out of the water — AMD’s integrated graphics haven’t received a major update for a couple years. We saw an average of 15 frames per second on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at the MateBook’s native resolution of 2520 x 1680 and 28fps at 1920 x 1080. Neither of those is a fantastic gaming experience, and they’re significantly worse than what we saw from the 13-inch M1 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Por5PZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10874105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K7uBhY"&gt;The MateBook took 13 minutes and 44 seconds to complete our 4K export test. This isn’t a terrible result among AMD systems with integrated graphics, but it does underscore the delta between a system like this and a heavier-duty creative workstation (which people often expect 16-inch laptops to be). The most recent MacBook Pros, even the 14-incher, all took under three minutes for the same task. On the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/PugetBench-for-Premiere-Pro-1519/"&gt;Puget Systems&lt;/a&gt; benchmark for Premiere Pro, the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=65556"&gt;MateBook also landed&lt;/a&gt; far behind Apple’s machines, including the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/space-gray-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-512gb#"&gt;very similarly priced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=65275"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. None of this is to say that the MateBook is a bad laptop; it’s just to emphasize that you can get more graphics power for this price if that’s a priority for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the right side of the Huawei MateBook 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L67Cy7NBjMm_kfcOYJBijN2arS0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908080/akrales_211005_4788_0113.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two USB 3.2 Gen 1 on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Huawei MateBook 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Yp1lMwnDwi-QfwfaNtwZIRcXGw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908074/akrales_211005_4788_0103.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two USB-C, one HDMI, one audio jack on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2J591W"&gt;What AMD’s chips tend to lack in single-core power, though, they often make up for in battery life. The MateBook comes with an 84Wh battery, and I averaged just over 10 hours of continuous use with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. (Huawei claims you’ll get 12.5 hours of “continuous local 1080p video playback,” so I guess take note if you do a lot of that.) That does beat the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; (although not by a ton) and many Intel laptops of this size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnpKIt"&gt;To me, the battery life is the strongest argument in favor of buying the MateBook. It should get you through a workday with no problem, which is especially impressive considering the massive high-resolution screen. I’d love to be able to carry this around a conference, charger-free, and have so much real estate to work with whenever I opened it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The AMD Ryzen 7 sticker on the right palm rest of the Huawei MateBook 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AmUnd9v-cCxEuYiM0Q0LDH4WK_Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908076/akrales_211005_4788_0034.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to AMD, it’s Huawei’s most powerful MateBook to date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="liRMMg"&gt;While the MateBook 16 seems like a notebook with the potential to have widespread appeal, the folks I’d most recommend it to are largely still Huawei superfans. The MateBook’s compatibility with other Huawei products is something that nothing from Apple or Asus can offer. I can see that benefit outweighing the odd drawbacks for people that already own other Huawei devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hC3cDy"&gt;For everyone else, I think the MateBook could be a fine purchase for a general work driver, but you can get other laptops with most of the same benefits and without the weirdness surrounding the webcam, speakers, and drive. Even if MacBook Pros are outside your price range, many Ryzen devices have similar performance and battery life to the MateBook, as well as a functional webcam and microphones. The MacBook Air is basically there as well (and as bad as its webcam is, I’ll take that over a nostril shot any day). Basically, I think you have to really, really want the 16-inch, 3:2 screen for the MateBook to have a shot. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA clears Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 boosters for all US adults</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tUXkk3"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration opened booster shots for the &lt;a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-receive-expanded-us-fda-emergency-use"&gt;Pfizer / BioNTech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-fda-authorization-booster-dose-covid-19"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; COVID-19 vaccine to all adults today, the companies announced, expanding eligibility outside of the initial, vulnerable groups they were cleared for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22728877/fda-boosters-covid-vaccine-moderna-johnson-mix"&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22679950/fda-covid-vaccine-booster-pfizer-older-adults"&gt;this fall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="io7B96"&gt;Although the COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States are still highly effective protection against severe cases of the disease, hospitalization, and death, protection against any infection or symptoms appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/18/health/covid-cdc-boosters-elderly.html"&gt;weakening&lt;/a&gt;. A third, booster shot of the vaccines could restore that protection: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/21/health/pfizer-booster-dose-efficacy-wellness-bn/index.html"&gt;Pfizer showed&lt;/a&gt; in a clinical trial that the shot was around 95 percent effective compared with people who only had two doses, essentially restoring the same efficacy seen in the initial clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7nsCZ"&gt;Analysis out of &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02249-2/fulltext"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and the United Kingdom, which have been using booster doses for longer than the US, also show that a third shot significantly blunts infection rates. They’re available to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/uk-extends-covid-booster-vaccines-to-the-over-40s.html"&gt;anyone over 40&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom and anyone &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/israel-doubles-down-on-covid-booster-shots-as-breakthrough-cases-rise.html"&gt;over 12&lt;/a&gt; in Israel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VwyDfw"&gt;Until now, booster shots of the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were officially available to people 65 years of age and older, those who are at high risk of severe disease, healthcare workers, and other people at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 at work. However, in response to recent upticks in infection rates, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/15/us/arkansas-boosters-adults-covid.html"&gt;some states&lt;/a&gt; have moved ahead and started offering third doses to everyone. (Everyone who got the one-shot Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22728877/fda-boosters-covid-vaccine-moderna-johnson-mix"&gt;already eligible&lt;/a&gt; for a second dose).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWYlFY"&gt;Just over &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total"&gt;16 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people in the United States who had an initial vaccine series have already received a booster shot.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cowboy will send someone to wash your e-bike and fix flat tires, for a price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Byxfd2pIDNYs6-ZYQRyICsbY9JU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70164964/ahawkins_210919_4769_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The regular Cowboy 4 (shown here) is also available in a step-through model.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jlLhWg"&gt;Cowboy, one of Europe’s premier makers of electric commuter bikes, is now offering a mobile support service in 22 cities with more to follow; 14 in the EU and eight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22687710/cowboy-ebike-us-sell-c4-price-specs"&gt;in the US where Cowboy only recently set up operations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRxWxH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cowboy-bikes.medium.com/e-bike-designer-and-maker-cowboy-unveils-cowboy-care-taking-the-entire-industry-by-storm-and-9fb55a57fb42"&gt;Cowboy Care costs €20 / £20 / $20 a month&lt;/a&gt; and covers cleaning the bike, tightening screws, replacing parts, and fixing flat tires wherever owners might be. It launches just in time for shipments of the much-anticipated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22417053/cowboy-c4-st-electric-bike-price-specs"&gt;Cowboy 4 and 4ST e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. After some delays to the original September target, the newest Cowboys will begin deliveries next week to people who got their preorders in early, according to Adrien Roose, co-founder and CEO of Brussels-based Cowboy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j2_5eOgNm2iB7SZZ3emdvCQZ21s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23027023/cowboy_care.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Cowboy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An unlimited number of Cowboy Care appointments can be scheduled in the Cowboy app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jZkYJW"&gt;Cowboy Care appointments — broken down by maintenance, repair, and flat tire fixes — can be booked in Cowboy’s iOS and Android apps. A trained technician, employed by Cowboy, is then dispatched to meet the owner to deal with whatever request they might have. Cowboy notes that care is unlimited, “the technician comes to the rider as many times as they need us there.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKNz5P"&gt;In-home repairs are not new for Cowboy. As Roose explained during a phone interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; today, the company already dispatches technicians to homes for warranty repairs. Cowboy Care subscriptions extend that model to include maintenance services like cleaning the frame, belt drive, and brakes; tightening the belt, bolts, and screws; topping-up the tire pressure; servicing brakes; top-to-bottom checkups; and fixing flat tires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="of0SVl"&gt;Parts needed to replace brake pads, tires, and inner tubes are included in the subscription price. However, out-of-warranty repairs like snapped belt drives, busted motors, and batteries that have reached end of life are not currently covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xs6iXw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mobile support is a major new battleground for e-bike companies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="72Uy05"&gt;Mobile support is a major new battleground for direct-to-consumer e-bike companies like Cowboy, Rad Power, and VanMoof, each of which have raised millions to build out their networks of roaming technicians. Purchasing an e-bike over the internet can save the buyer money, but bypassing traditional bike shops can mean boxing up your e-bike and shipping it back across the globe for repairs. That’s especially true for e-bikes from makers like Cowboy and VanMoof that use large numbers of custom parts, instead of the off-the-shelf parts found in commodity e-bikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcgUDP"&gt;Cowboy Care is available now in the European cities of Amsterdam, Berlin, Hamburg, Paris, London, Gent, Munich, Brussels, Cologne, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Dusseldorf, Utrecht, and Frankfurt. It’ll be live in the US cities of San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, Seattle, San Diego, and Portland in time for the first US shipments of the C4 and C4ST to arrive in January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals on Google devices</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Mh0_3X0EfpRrKKHupmlvHZ18yw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70164962/ajohnson_210813_4713_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5A leads the charge in a variety of early Black Friday deals from Google.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n6ej8I"&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/collection/offers?hl=en-US"&gt;launched its early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s a lot to like if you’re in the market for a Pixel, Chromecast, or Nest device. The search giant kicked off the deals in the Google Store, and now many of the big-name retailers are offering equivalent deals on the same items. Google even advertises these deals as running until December 1st, a few days after Cyber Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShDHRU"&gt;By now there are many great &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; to consider, and in addition to our retailer-specific roundups for sales at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22783434/target-black-friday-2021-deals-cyber-monday-tech-games"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784145/amazon-black-friday-2021-best-deals-tech-cyber-monday"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784126/walmart-black-friday-2021-tech-cyber-monday-deals"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re starved for ideas on what to shop for, we also have a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"&gt;gift guides&lt;/a&gt; for you to check out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9bWFH"&gt;In the meantime, we have highlighted all the worthwhile Google deals below — such as &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_5a_5g?hl=en-US"&gt;$50 off the budget-friendly Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_audio?hl=en-US"&gt;$40 off the excellent Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/stadia_premiere_edition?hl=en-US"&gt;Stadia Premiere Edition bundle for just $22&lt;/a&gt;. Check out all there is on offer directly from Google and other retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fBqnn3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021: news, deal highlights, and money-saving tips","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22783359/black-friday-2021-news-tips-deals-retailers-cyber-monday"},{"title":"Know the price-matching policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"},{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Z9hn2U"&gt;Pixel deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="BsYXJD"&gt;The Pixel 5A is the latest midrange phone from Google, released in the summer before the new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro started to mix things up. It doesn’t offer Google’s custom-designed processor like the Pixel 6, but its Snapdragon 765G chip, IP67 rating, and friendly price tag give this “boring” phone ample performance. Google dropped the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_5a_5g?hl=en-US"&gt;Pixel 5A down to just $399 for Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;, offering a strong value proposition with that $50 discount. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="B1ZWOf"&gt;Chromecast deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="hYd0Ds"&gt;Google’s latest streaming stick, the Chromecast with Google TV, comes with a handy remote and is now $10 off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/chromecast_google_tv?hl=en-US"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FChromecast-with-Google-TV%2F403830906%3Fathbdg%3DL1200&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-chromecast-with-google-tv%2F-%2FA-81563926%3Fpreselect%3D80173812%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1JKx5U7SD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. It makes for a solid streaming option at just $40 and is one of our favorites. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="m9MImc"&gt;Even the basic Chromecast, which is a little older, is $10 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-GA00439-US-Chromecast-3rd-Generation/dp/B015UKRNGS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Chromecast-3rd-Gen%2F435188866%3Fathbdg%3DL1200&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1LynNnW5u" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-chromecast-charcoal-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-54010906%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/chromecast?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. It’s still a solid option at $20, but if you can afford to spend more, we strongly advise springing for the newer model with Google TV. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xeHdOZ"&gt;Nest displays and speakers deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Xqi4nQ"&gt;Google’s second-gen Nest Hub, one of the best cloud-connected digital photo frames you can buy, is half off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_hub_2nd_gen?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1K8HEDXXz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-Chalk%2F619753146&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-2nd-gen-smart-display%2F-%2FA-82678346%3Fpreselect%3D80209776%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Even if the second-gen model isn’t the biggest upgrade over the original, for just $50, this smart speaker and its seven-inch display offer a lot for your connected home. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="GnnfcN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best smart displays for every home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="6q7TQK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872756"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="s9fdGa"&gt;If you prefer to supersize all the displays in your life, you can get the Nest Hub Max for $50 off at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-Max-Charcoal%2F842552117%3Fathbdg%3DL1200&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1LB56siPj" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-max%2F-%2FA-78295230%3Fpreselect%3D76500131%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_nest_hub_max?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. This brings the smart speaker with a 10-inch display down to $179. Sure, that’s a lot more than the cost of its smaller sibling, but the larger size really helps with readability and sound quality. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="nukcYF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872961"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="5WclDY"&gt;The Google Nest Audio is one of the more recent additions to Google’s line of smart home devices, and for $40, we cannot recommend it enough. This diminutive speaker — which is on sale right now for $60 at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_audio?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-audio-smart-speaker%2F-%2FA-81539079%3Fpreselect%3D80209773%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1SFFXAfi7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; — produces bigger sound than you might think. At its current price, you could pick up two and pair them in stereo, giving you room-filling sound for $20 more than the normal price of a single unit. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Lgy80K"&gt;Need a simple smart speaker for listening to music and controlling your home? The minuscule Nest Mini is currently $24 off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/google_nest_mini?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Mini-2nd-Generation-Charcoal%2F741412707%3Fathbdg%3DL1300&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1LKg5XqS2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-mini-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-78589456%3Fpreselect%3D76500134%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to just $25. It’s one of the easiest ways to add Google Assistant to your home, comes in a variety of fun colors, and sounds much better than the Google Home Mini that came before it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="SnQGkp"&gt;The latest iteration of Google’s battery-powered Nest Doorbell is $50 off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_doorbell_battery?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Doorbell-Battery-Video-Doorbell-Camera-Wireless-Doorbell-Security-Camera-Linen%2F983055336&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1L0G8uYpV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-doorbell-battery%2F-%2FA-84283100%3Fpreselect%3D82685731%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. At $130, the Nest Doorbell is a solid option if you prefer not to futz around with hardwiring, and it comes in an array of muted colors so you can best match the exterior of your home. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710545/nest-doorbell-battery-cam-battery-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="NWPNjm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873038"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="XQjdTT"&gt;Google’s older Nest Doorbell, which does require hardwiring, is $80 off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/nest_doorbell_wired?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Doorbell-Wired%2F381881630%3Fathbdg%3DL1600&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1L6cm1smu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-hdr-video-doorbell-wired%2F-%2FA-52629447%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, dropping the price to $149. This option may be worthwhile if you prefer a smart video doorbell that is always powered and doesn’t require you to charge it. We do &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700859/google-nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-launching-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;expect a new model in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, but this is a great price on a long-standing product from Google.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="0nA11R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873304"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="XorsEo"&gt;The new battery-powered Google Nest Cam that can be indoors or outdoors is $30 off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_cam_battery?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1NSwELA5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-indoor-outdoor-cam-battery%2F-%2FA-82685730%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. This drops the price to $150 during the shopping holiday, making the Nest Cam a little more appealing. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710545/nest-doorbell-battery-cam-battery-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we mentioned how we were left a little disappointed by the video quality but praised the camera’s handsome robot-like design, which should fit well in any home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1TwRvm"&gt;If you’re looking to cover multiple angles of your home, inside or out, you can also stack up extra savings on the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_cam_battery?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nest Cam at the Google Store&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, you can buy a two-pack for $50 off ($280 total) or a four-pack for $100 off ($560 total).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DLYK93"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873328"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="dHZX8L"&gt;Possibly the most appealing, and certainly most unique, Nest Cam is the new outdoor wired model with a floodlight. You can get this brightly illuminated one for $50 off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_cam_floodlight?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Cam-with-Floodlight-Snow%2F386164023&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1N0uvdGbE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-cam-with-floodlight%2F-%2FA-83702962%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="AvOAKH"&gt;The latest generation of the Nest Learning Thermostat, the model that automatically learns your habits and helped kick-start the smart thermostat craze, is $70 off for Black Friday at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_learning_thermostat_3rd_gen?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNest-Smart-Learning-Thermostat-3rd-Generation%2F46667636%3Fathbdg%3DL1600&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1Oc1QH6I4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-learning-thermostat%2F-%2FA-52586860%3Fpreselect%3D49163945%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you want one of the most robust thermostats around, $179 is about as good as it gets.

&lt;div id="9S66KC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LwG7Ur"&gt;Nest Wifi deals&lt;/h2&gt;

This includes the router and one mesh point, letting you extend the signal and tailor it to your own space or home layout.

And for much larger homes, Google is also offering &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_wifi?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 off a Nest router with two points&lt;/a&gt;, dropping the price to $249. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="RcdykR"&gt;If you have been wanting to try out Google’s Stadia game streaming service, the early Black Friday deal on the Stadia Premiere Edition is the absolute best option possible. &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/stadia_premiere_edition?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This bundle from the Google Store consists of a white Stadia controller and 4K-capable Chromecast Ultra streaming puck for just $22&lt;/a&gt;, a discount of $57. That’s 73 percent off the usual $80 price! It’s a pretty wild deal, offering a lot of value. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Discord now lets you send up to 10 (accessible) memes at a time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aXjN3uWTUzTmzTg2vuZJooLOURw=/0x0:989x659/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70164529/Discord_47Z2dGAzDg.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discord’s new alt text feature in action.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Discord&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Onzd9E"&gt;Discord has updated its Windows and macOS desktop clients to let users add alt text for image attachments, the service &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/discord/status/1461442402917359618"&gt;has announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a helpful accessibility feature for users that rely on screen readers and arrives alongside the ability to preview and upload up to 10 files at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iikH2v"&gt;The alt text accessibility feature can be found by clicking the small pen icon (“Modify Attachment”) on the top right of each individual preview before sending it in a text channel. Of course, the feature relies on people making the effort to manually add alt text in order for it to be useful. But it’s better than not having the option at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z8niMl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;big upgrades to attachments: now you can upload up to 10 files at a time on desktop, see previews, and add alt text for ppl with screen readers (plus a few more things). pretty big. &lt;a href="https://t.co/rptaHdlCem"&gt;pic.twitter.com/rptaHdlCem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Discord (@discord) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/discord/status/1461442402917359618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="coSFer"&gt;Alt text support joins a number of other accessibility features Discord has added to its desktop apps in recent months. Other quality of life improvements include keyboard support for drag and drop, allowing users to organize their servers and channels without needing to use a mouse, and a slider that changes the speed of its text-to-speech feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTV8jt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Xbox app for Windows finally solves game install headaches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jyqpy7-DHaNPw72dWOfRojubTI4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70164389/Xbox_App_Preview_11_17_21.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbFYla"&gt;Microsoft is now allowing testers to access a new Xbox app for Windows that greatly improves the game install process from the Windows store. As we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776024/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-folder-install-uwp-options"&gt;reported earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, the updated app allows PC gamers to install titles into any folder of their choice with unrestricted access to game files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVWmQT"&gt;It’s an option that helps address many of the headaches of installing titles from Xbox Game Pass for PC, and it should also mean you can backup game files and restore them if need be. Previously, Microsoft forced games to install into a WindowsApps folder at the root of a drive, and it was locked down so you couldn’t modify files or freely move them around.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_kXLNPIu8qLH5HRoWb1ZQFs0PIE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23026938/dKIC0Le.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You now get options to manage where games are installed to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BxuIsB"&gt;The updated Xbox app now lets you choose a location, and, if you have existing games installed, you can move them onto secondary drives. I’ve tested the app and successfully moved &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator &lt;/em&gt;onto secondary drives. I can now fully access those files and folders, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDbZ9N"&gt;Windows 10 and Windows 11 users can test the new Xbox app through the Xbox Insider Hub app from the store. You’ll need to join the “Windows Gaming” preview within the Xbox Insider Hub app to get the updated Xbox app. Microsoft does &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/11/18/advanced-installation-and-management-features-available-for-insiders-through-the-xbox-app-for-windows/"&gt;list a number of known issues&lt;/a&gt; for this early release though, including issues launching some games on external drives and a number of games that aren’t supported yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMyu9e"&gt;You also still can’t add games downloaded from the Windows store into Steam, as there appears to be a permission issue preventing that. The Xbox app is still in preview, so that could be a bug that will be addressed before it’s widely available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwKWQD"&gt;Either way, Windows store game installs are finally getting more Steam-like, after years of issues and bugs for PC users. If you’ve been avoiding Xbox Game Pass for PC due to the Windows store, this new Xbox app should remove some of the associated headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mj6R0G"&gt;Social media conglomerate Meta continues its tactic of buying buzz, after CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised in July that the company would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577242/facebook-1-billion-payments-creators-2022"&gt;pay $1 billion&lt;/a&gt; to creators by the end of 2022. A report &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-hands-out-cash-to-creators-to-boost-clubhouse-rival"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; details how some of this money is being spent, with Meta-owned Facebook paying creators up to $50,000 to use the platform’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22540508/facebook-live-audio-rooms-clubhouse-rival-spaces-greenhouse"&gt;Live Audio Rooms&lt;/a&gt; feature — a rival to the once-buzzy live audio app Clubhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdYGIT"&gt;When you make as much money as Meta does, buying success is a reasonable tactic, at least in the short term. The Meta-owned Instagram, for example, has been doing the same to boost its TikTok-rival Reels, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22777899/instagram-reels-bonus-program-35000-dollars-creators-tiktok-competitors"&gt;paying creators up to $35,000&lt;/a&gt; to post to the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X2330R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Meta promised to pay creators $1 billion by the end of 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EJPDjw"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;, the terms for using Live Audio Rooms are similarly generous. “Facebook is offering to pay musicians and other creators $10,000 to $50,000 per session on its five-month-old live audio product, plus a fee for guests of $10,000 or more,” says the publication, citing “people with direct knowledge of deal terms.” For this money, Facebook reportedly wants creators to host four to six sessions at least 30 minutes in length. Live Audio Rooms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22540508/facebook-live-audio-rooms-clubhouse-rival-spaces-greenhouse"&gt;launched in the US in June&lt;/a&gt;, with the feature sitting alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394215/facebook-soundbites-audio-mark-zuckerberg-interview"&gt;other audio-focused products&lt;/a&gt; like podcasts, music, and short-form “Soundbites.” Established names who’ve appeared on Live Audio Rooms include singer Miley Cyrus and comedian Sherry Cola, though there’s no reporting that these individuals were paid to appear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WM6mEw"&gt;You may have the impression that only Meta needs to pay creators to use its platform, but really this behavior is common across the entire industry (Meta just has deeper pockets than most). TikTok has its &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/the-tiktok-creator-fund-is-now-live-across-europe-and-here-is-how-to-apply"&gt;Creator Fund&lt;/a&gt;, Snap has its &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/snapchat-revamps-creator-payouts-by-offering-chance-to-win-prizes-with-spotlight-challenges/"&gt;Spotlight program&lt;/a&gt;, and Twitter has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724450/twitter-spaces-accelerator-spark-clubhouse-creators"&gt;paid “accelerator” program&lt;/a&gt; for its audio feature Spaces. Indeed, pretty much every major platform offers financial incentives of some sort to attract and retain talent. The only question is who will stay when the money runs out.&lt;/p&gt;
