    <title>Elon Musk passes Jeff Bezos to become the richest person on Earth</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HzofYK"&gt;Elon Musk has become the wealthiest person on the planet, surpassing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, thanks to the continued rise in Tesla’s stock price. Musk is now worth around $188 billion, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OBk7f"&gt;“How strange,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347204459147902978?s=21"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. “Well, back to work ...” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbxEyt"&gt;Musk eclipsing Bezos’ own extravagant personal wealth of around $187 billion marks the latest development in a years-long rivalry between the two tech magnates — one that often centers around the accomplishments of their respective businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXBtHJ"&gt;Bezos was reportedly so envious of Musk’s success in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/8/10937076/tesla-gigafactory-battery-factory-nevada-tax-deal-elon-musk"&gt;securing a $1.3 billion incentive package&lt;/a&gt; for Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada that it served as the genesis for Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-03/amazon-s-hq2-fiasco-was-driven-by-bezos-envy-of-elon-musk?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;beauty pageant-style search for its second headquarters&lt;/a&gt;. Bezos has a spaceflight company in Blue Origin much like Musk does with SpaceX. The two men have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/21/10641840/jeff-bezos-congratulatory-rocket-landing-tweet-spacex-clinical-shade"&gt;traded&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/669194136248041472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;barbs&lt;/a&gt; about their rockets, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/24/4553652/jeff-bezos-and-elon-musk-battle-for-nasa-space-shuttle-launchpad"&gt;fought over hallowed NASA real estate&lt;/a&gt;. (SpaceX won that fight, and is the only of the two companies to successfully reach orbit.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vB1L0R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk and Bezos have been rivals of sorts for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dmq9YQ"&gt;Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612410/elon-musk-overtakes-bill-gates-to-become-worlds-second-richest-person-behind-jeff-bezos"&gt;only just passed Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; in November to become the second-richest person in the world. The Tesla CEO saw his personal wealth skyrocket in 2020 to the tune of more than $150 billion, in large part because Musk owns a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of Tesla stock — about 20 percent of the company, in fact. And Tesla’s stock has grown incredibly valuable over the last year or so, too, as Musk pulled the company out of so-called “production hell” and dramatically increased sales of its electric vehicles, thanks to the more affordable Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV. That coincided with an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/retail-investors-pocket-gains-with-eye-toward-bumpy-year-end?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;incredible rise of retail investors&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-24/bloomberg-wealth-the-investors-who-became-millionaires-with-just-one-stock?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;more willing to fully buy into Tesla’s story&lt;/a&gt; than many on Wall Street once were. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="719ZIv"&gt;The billionaire CEO’s stock stash continues to grow, too, especially after he signed a major &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17147678/elon-musk-tesla-ceo-compensation-award-plan"&gt;10-year compensation package&lt;/a&gt; with the company in 2018 that further tied his earnings to Tesla’s stock price and revenue goals. He is awarded a raft of company stock options every time a new milestone is hit; the first tranche, which he received earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273882/elon-musk-tesla-compensation-plan-stock-award-dollars"&gt;was worth some $800 million&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqpqS6"&gt;Like most billionaires, Musk has only seen his overall wealth increase during the coronavirus pandemic. But unlike that peer group, Musk claimed in court to be “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-techs-cash-poor-billionaire-11588967043"&gt;cash poor&lt;/a&gt;” and “financially illiquid” in 2019, and said last year that he would sell “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239554148724737"&gt;almost all physical possessions&lt;/a&gt;,” including his mansions. He takes loans against the stock that makes him so wealthy and plows that money back into his companies, like when he dumped &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-16/musk-s-boring-co-raises-113-million-for-tunnels-and-hyperloop?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;around $100 million into The Boring Company in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Musk has a long history of using his own personal wealth to fund new endeavors, too, as he funded Tesla and SpaceX after becoming a millionaire running Zip2 and PayPal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1ORIj"&gt;Musk may now be the richest man on Earth by the standards of money-focused outlets like &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, though they tend to focus on calculating knowable assets. However, authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin and Mohammed Bin Salman are both extremely personally wealthy in &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-putin-spends-his-mysterious-fortune-2017-6"&gt;ways that are harder to calculate&lt;/a&gt;, and also have unchallengeable access to the vast wealth of their nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83N7Jf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>JBL’s Bar 5.0 Multibeam is an all-in-one soundbar with Virtual Dolby Atmos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PlTvoYYeJi3XbTqUBUxcquDrI68=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632550/JBL_BAR_5.0_MULTIBEAM_HERO_0013_x1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bar 5.0 Multibeam comes a year after JBL’s first Atmos soundbar.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: JBL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ATNSTs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harman.com/releases/experience-3d-surround-sound-with-the-jblR-bar-5-0-multibeamtm-soundbar"&gt;JBL’s Bar 5.0 Multibeam&lt;/a&gt; is a new soundbar which is its first to offer Virtual Dolby Atmos thanks to its Multibeam technology. It will be available for $399.95 (£349.99) starting later this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1YkGS"&gt;The announcement of the JBL Bar 5.0 comes a year after the company announced its first Dolby Atmos soundbar, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/6/21051720/jbl-soundbar-speakers-bar-9-1-dolby-atmos-detachable-rear-ces-2020"&gt;JBL Bar 9.1&lt;/a&gt;. The previous Atmos soundbar used upward-firing drivers to bounce sound off the ceiling to give the impression of it coming from above. In contrast, the new JBL Bar 5.0, which costs less than half the price of its predecessor, uses virtualization to achieve what JBL claims is a similar effect. It’s unlikely to sound as convincing, but the result is a much more affordable soundbar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Crms9FMyZc4qYFK0cgvii0qrEo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217436/JBL_BAR_5.0_MULTIBEAM_DETAIL_1_0047_x1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: JBL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The soundbar packs in five drivers and four passive radiators.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oqlWwh"&gt;The JBL Bar 5.0 uses five drivers (three forward-facing and two side-facing), and four passive radiators to create its sound. It supports streaming via Bluetooth, Alexa (including multiroom audio), Apple AirPlay 2, and has Chromecast support built in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bN6nfI"&gt;The JBL Bar 5.0 isn’t the only new device the company is announcing today. There’s also the &lt;a href="https://news.harman.com/releases/play-endlessly-with-the-jblR-charge-5-portable-bluetooth-speaker"&gt;JBL Charge 5&lt;/a&gt;, which is a new Bluetooth speaker costing $179.95 (£159.99) that will be available beginning in March. It offers 20 hours of playback and contains a 7,500mAh battery that can be used to charge external devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gSAw61Zofp50CIvkLdqd-5FhVT0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217449/JBL_Charge_5_Marina_Charging.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The JBL Charge 5 has a 7,500mAh battery and can charge external devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n522sE"&gt;Finally, JBL also has a &lt;a href="https://news.harman.com/releases/jblR-expands-live-series-with-four-new-headphones-designed-to-elevate-lifes-experiences"&gt;collection&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://news.harman.com/releases/jblR-launches-tour-headphone-series-designed-for-business-professionals"&gt;headphones&lt;/a&gt; to announce. There’s the $129.95 (£119.99) JBL Live 460NC noise-canceling on-ear headphones that have up to 50 hours of battery life and will be available from March. Meanwhile, the JBL Live Pro Plus noise-canceling true wireless earbuds, cost $179.95 (£169.99) and will go on sale in April. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZNB9T1ToBmGUg4N2o9FB8mdXdBE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217454/JBL_LIVE_460NC_Product_Image_Group.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The JBL Live Pro Plus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xR9flC"&gt;Next are the over-ear JBL Live 660NC noise-canceling headphones that feature up to 50 hours of battery life and will cost $199.95 (£159.99) when they go on sale in March. The JBL Tour Pro Plus noise-canceling, true wireless earbuds will also cost $199.95 (or £179.99 in the UK) and release in May. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wfOOcA"&gt;Finally, the most expensive new headphones being announced today are the $299.95 (£279.99) JBL Tour One noise-canceling over-ear headphones that feature up to 50 hours of playback. They’ll go on sale starting in May. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>JBL’s new stereo amplifier pairs retro looks with modern connectivity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xBqZ86xp0JFVLMRpwM9CSoVgdzA=/0x0:6600x4400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632507/JBL_SA750_uncropped.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SA750 looks straight out of the 70s.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: JBL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JnS8XF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://news.harman.com/releases/releases-20210105"&gt;JBL SA750&lt;/a&gt; is a new stereo amplifier pairing modern streaming technologies like Airplay 2 and Google Chromecast with a design that wouldn’t look out of place in a hi-fi rack from the ‘60s or ‘70s. It’s got a set of reassuringly chunky-looking dials and switches as physical controls, an understated display, and its sides are covered with wood veneers. The amplifier, whose release coincides with JBL’s 75th anniversary, will cost $3,000 when it goes on sale beginning this May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15SqjD"&gt;Alongside its wireless connectivity, which includes support for UPnP alongside Apple and Google’s protocols, the JBL SA750 has all the wired inputs you’d expect. There are six pairs of analog RCA inputs, a 3.5mm aux in, and two optical and two coaxial digital inputs alongside USB and Ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m9QXi-XnL619S0S7NOtlA4Y4c-U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219616/JBL_L100_Classic_75.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: JBL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The JBL L100 Classic 75 speakers have a similar retro design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D1af3w"&gt;As a standalone stereo amplifier, you’ll need to plug in a separate set of speakers to listen to the JBL SA750. To that end it’s got two pairs of binding-post speaker connectors, and it can output up to 220W of power per channel. We’re sure JBL would love to sell you a pair of its new &lt;a href="https://news.harman.com/releases/still-blown-away-after-all-these-years-jbl-launches-75th-anniversary-edition-of-l100-loudspeaker"&gt;L100 Classic 75&lt;/a&gt; loudspeakers to use alongside it, but at $5,500 a pair, they’re far from an economical choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMMYgN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s what Hitman 3 will look like in virtual reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hyxcrh8p014SAIrxFePbGMbop70=/40x0:480x293/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632454/HITMAN_3___SANDBOX_VR_PSVR.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JolEDl"&gt;IO Interactive &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6_9kxRX0mk"&gt;released a trailer&lt;/a&gt; that shows off what the VR mode in &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt; actually looks like. In short, it’s probably like what you imagined if you’ve played the recent games — which means it looks like a lot of fun. The hands-on look shows Agent 47 doing a lot of shooting and trap-setting, as well as an array of mundane tasks used to stay disguised during missions. There appear to be a few immersive moments created just for the virtual reality component, like tapping an enemy on the shoulder and quickly getting out of sight to fool them. And just like the base game, there seems to be a load of interactable objects, which should translate well to virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BR5fGZ"&gt;One thing I’m curious about with this VR mode is its difficulty. &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt; is a notoriously tough game, especially if you want to complete every objective without alerting enemies. There are usually enemies coming at you from all angles, and there’s just a lot to pay attention to. Though, like all trailers, this one released today makes the VR mode seem even more like an action romp. Not being able to see Agent 47’s shiny, barcode-laden noggin makes it look like a proper James Bond game, which, ironically, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575090/james-bond-game-origin-io-interactive-007-project-hitman"&gt;is the studio’s next project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kqtGSA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N6_9kxRX0mk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cb65Me"&gt;As the developer promised when the mode was announced in 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-vr/"&gt;every location from the recent &lt;em&gt;Hitman &lt;/em&gt;titles will &lt;/a&gt;be playable in virtual reality via PlayStation VR. To be clear, you’ll need to already own &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hitman 2&lt;/em&gt; to play those levels in VR, and &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt; will offer a way to import those environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LluisB"&gt;For now, this mode is coming only to the PS4 and PS5 versions of the game via a PlayStation VR headset. But since the game is releasing on PC, it’s possible that we’ll see this mode make its way at some point to other platforms, like Steam VR or Oculus. The base game will also release on January 20th for the systems mentioned above as well as Xbox One, Xbox Series S and X, Google Stadia. It’s also coming to the Nintendo Switch via cloud streaming tech.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xqsrgx"&gt;Amazon is offering a good deal on the 44mm-sized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; (GPS). Normally $309, it’s $270 for the model built with space gray aluminum that comes with a black sport band. For now, this puts both the 40mm and larger 44mm Apple Watch SE at the same price. If you’re wondering where the SE sits among all of Apple’s recent smartwatches in terms of specs, it has the same processor as the Apple Watch 5, but it notably lacks its ECG capability and the ability to have an always-on display. No other retailers are currently offering this deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="GIfrF3"&gt;If you bought a PS5 or received one as a gift over the holidays, you can add &lt;em&gt;Godfall &lt;/em&gt;to your lineup of games today for less than it usually costs. The third-person game normally costs a full $70, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728753977509596763" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but the disc version is $40 today only at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. I haven’t played this title, but I’ve heard that you’re most likely to enjoy it if you like games like &lt;em&gt;Warframe &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with nonstop action encounters that only end to let you collect a lot of loot for your character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="jirPH4"&gt;Sam’s Club members can still take advantage of the best deal I’ve seen yet for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262459/razer-opus-review-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones-thx-over-ear-price-specs"&gt;Razer’s Opus&lt;/a&gt; noise-canceling headphones. These usually cost $200 (with the lowest previous price at $150), but you can snag them at Sam’s Club for just $80 for one more day. The Opus justify their full price, but at $80 I think you really should just get yourself a set. The noise cancellation effect, sound quality, battery life, and overall design are surprisingly good for a relatively budget-friendly set of over-ear headphones. The biggest barrier to getting these is the paid Sam’s Club membership.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new Yoga all-in-one has a rotating display for better TikTok videos and Twitter scrolling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AOQSvxaucEbXzCvV-uOqoONvsTM=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632136/lenovo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Yoga AIO 7 in its rotated configuration | Image: Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtEIpt"&gt;Lenovo has a new Yoga computer out, but it’s not a laptop — it’s the new Yoga AIO 7 desktop. But while it may look like a standard all-in-one desktop, like its more portable cousins, the Yoga AIO 7 does have a display trick up its sleeve: the entire screen can rotate around, transforming the 27-inch landscape monitor into a vertical form factor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oM9v9D"&gt;Of course, the ability to rotate a display isn’t a wholly new idea. Standalone desktop monitors have offered the feature for years, making it easier for users to display content that’s better suited to a taller panel like Twitter feeds, long documents, or TikTok videos. But it’s far rarer to see the concept on an all-in-one computer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/boRyXvu-QEsXyIU96Vz9bI6z_9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219478/lenovo2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Yoga AIO 7 in its standard mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oPwHVa"&gt;The idea is reminiscent of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21050604/samsung-sero-tv-rotate-vertical-video-tiktok-ces-2020"&gt;Samsung’s Sero TV from last year&lt;/a&gt;, a similarly rotating product that scaled up the idea to a full-sized 43-inch television in response to the popularity of vertical video formats from apps like Instagram and TikTok (which, in turn is directly due to the ubiquity of smartphones with video cameras). Lenovo seems aware of the potential for a vertical TV, promising a future software update that will effectively let the AIO 7 double as a full-fledged 4K smart TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wqxj1Q"&gt;As for the specs, the Yoga AIO 7 offers a choice between two 27-inch 4K panels (one regular and one that meets Adobe RGB and DCI-P3 color standards); a choice between AMD’s Ryzen 7 4800H and Ryzen 5 4500H CPUs; Nvidia’s integrated RTX 2060 GPU; either 16GB or 32GB of RAM; and a mix of PCIe and HDD storage options (topping out at a 1TB SSD and a 2TB hard drive, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZhDjm"&gt;Of particular note is how Lenovo is taking advantage of USB-C with the Yoga AIO 7. Plug in your laptop with a USB-C cable, and you’ll be able to use the Yoga AIO 7’s hardware — including the display, speakers, mouse and keyboard, power supply, and even the integrated hard drive — directly with your laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXdoPX"&gt;The Yoga AIO 7 is already available in China (where its called the Yoga 27), but it’ll be out in “select markets” in February starting at $1,599. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new IdeaPad 5 Pro includes AMD Ryzen mobile processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRRpgpob8_b4OnN9EYZHY9TfqyQ=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632036/Lenovo_IdeaPad_5_Pro_AMD_Front_Facing_Cloud_Grey.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XlCA6q"&gt;Lenovo has announced a new lineup of IdeaPad laptops for 2021. But American readers should note that only one of them is coming to the US: the 16-inch IdeaPad 5 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWkEfQ"&gt;Lenovo says that the IdeaPad 5 Pro is one of the most powerful IdeaPad laptops the company has ever made. The device can be configured with up to an H-Series AMD Ryzen mobile processor and “next-gen” Nvidia GeForce RTX GPUs. You can also get up to 32GB of DDR4 memory and 1TB of SSD PCIe M.2 storage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OhHAqWqKwxWKtkEjp4IVoXa53aY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22218911/Lenovo_IdeaPad_5_Pro_AMD_Rear_Facing_Cloud_Grey.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OR5UQB"&gt;One thing I’m excited about: the 5 Pro is the first IdeaPad laptop to offer a 16:10 display. Coupled with a 90 percent screen-to-body ratio, that should provide extra space for productivity and multitasking over a 16:9 device. The display also has a 90Hz refresh rate and can reach 400 nits of brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWqkZx"&gt;Lenovo says you’ll also get a larger trackpad than those of previous IdeaPads, as well as an improved keyboard with “soft-landing switches.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L-y-eSfapIjvN5UKsuo4LNvxROg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22218913/Lenovo_IdeaPad_5_Pro_AMD_Right_Profile_Storm_Grey.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vxvLQt"&gt;You’ll be able to buy the IdeaPad 5 Pro in May 2021, starting at $1,149.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWQD90"&gt;In addition to the IdeaPad 5 Pro 16, Lenovo has announced the IdeaPad 5G 14 (coming to “select markets” at a not-yet-announced time), and the IdeaPad 5i Pro (available in Europe, Middle East, and Africa starting March 2021) which contains Intel processors. The 14-inch IdeaPad 5 Pro isn’t coming to North America, but it will also be available in Europe, Middle East, and Africa in March 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4tBqx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 hands-on: promisingly boring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jMDvxmO8olif93zOD0dDBhlNmMQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632044/bfarsace190331_4355_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It’s a regular-ass Chromebook&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="F682fD"&gt;“Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2” is a somewhat misleading title. Yes, this $549.99 laptop is technically the second device to bear the name “Samsung Galaxy Chromebook.” But it’s not a sequel in the sense that it’s an upgrade: Samsung didn’t add a ton of new features or bump up many of the specs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TATFFq"&gt;The Galaxy Chromebook 2, coming in the first quarter of 2021, is actually a step &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; from its predecessor when it comes to most of the hardware. Some of the features that made the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; stand out have been removed — there’s no AMOLED screen or included stylus. It retains the original’s unique color, but on paper the Chromebook 2 is a world away. It’s not fancy or flashy; it’s not pushing the boundaries of the category. It’s a regular-ass Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkLOpJ"&gt;And I’m totally fine with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C8_GN30cBihPrMWa-L5TC1N9ph4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217912/bfarsace190331_4355_0011.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xThKCfBX2wMxjBEv3Mj-JCYQU_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217908/bfarsace190331_4355_0008.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ktFfXE"&gt;From the outside, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 doesn’t look too different from the Galaxy Chromebook. That’s largely because of the color. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 comes in a bold “fiesta red” that looks either bright red or bright orange depending on the lighting. Either way, it’ll turn heads. (There’s also a “mercury gray” option, if you’re boring.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8qdQN"&gt;Pick the Chromebook 2 up, though, and you’ll feel the first corner that Samsung has cut. The Chromebook 2 is noticeably thicker and heavier than its predecessor: 2.71 pounds and .55 inches thick, to the Galaxy Chromebook’s 2.29 pounds and 0.38 inches thick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Bzki1"&gt;Of course, that’s still plenty portable as Chromebooks go —&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt; Acer’s Chromebook Spin&lt;/a&gt; 713 is thicker and heavier. The one thing I’ll note is that while I had no trouble using the Galaxy Chromebook as a tablet, holding the Chromebook 2 in one hand for long periods of time is more of a chore. I wouldn’t have wanted to use it for a long presentation. (Your mileage will vary, of course — I’m not particularly swole.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b_jjobf89GEUexkRifvCV1P6F7Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217906/bfarsace190331_4355_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LNfI5nS5L2Wer27Ch9C4vdmUl58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217913/bfarsace190331_4355_0015.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="l7FB5l"&gt;The second big change: the screen. The Galaxy Chromebook’s display was its highlight feature. It was the first 4K AMOLED panel ever to appear on a Chromebook, and it was one of the most drop-dead gorgeous screens I’ve ever seen on a laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3R0Pzh"&gt;That’s gone here. The Chromebook 2 has an FHD (that is, 1920 x 1080) QLED screen. QLED panels, despite the name similarity, are not OLED panels — they’re LED-backlit LCD screens that use Samsung’s quantum-dot technology. You won’t see the same natural contrast and impeccable blacks that you would on an OLED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXEYPc"&gt;That doesn’t mean the screen is bad, though. The Chromebook 2 is the first Chromebook to feature a QLED display, and QLEDs are still very good. Samsung says this one can produce over a billion colors. I watched a few videos on the device, and they all looked just fine. On top of that, the audio sounded great, easily filling up the large testing area far below its maximum level. All in all, a good multimedia experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q4xhs5"&gt;There were a few other nifty features of the Galaxy Chromebook’s chassis that are absent here. There’s no built-in stylus (though you can purchase one separately), no keyboard deck camera, and no fingerprint sensor. I understand why Samsung removed these things — they’re all cool to have, but I can’t imagine I’d miss them too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRrnLf"&gt;Regarding what’s inside, you have two options. The $549.99 base model includes an Intel Celeron 5205U, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. The $699.99 configuration has an Intel Core i3-10110U, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. Both models get two USB-C ports, a microSD slot, and a headphone / microphone combo jack, as well as a 720p webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TOGT4"&gt;The Chromebook 2’s Core i3 processor is another downgrade from its predecessor (which had a Core i5-10210U), but I’m hesitant to call that a big compromise. I reviewed an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21206912/asus-chromebook-flip-c436-review-chromeos-android"&gt;Asus Chromebook Flip C436&lt;/a&gt; with that same Core i3 last year and the chip absolutely got the job done — I didn’t notice much of a performance difference between that system and the Core i5-powered Galaxy Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmuqhZ"&gt;(The Celeron, on the other hand, is fairly entry-level. I generally don’t recommend it for tasks beyond general browsing or light office work — the $699 model will likely be the best choice for most people.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qoVeBrHIh5X8XPkooBaC_RPgzYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217916/bfarsace190331_4355_0020.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VxKHEkaPPPTb6glOvQTELaGrajM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217915/bfarsace190331_4355_0019.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nDfOF9"&gt;But there’s one question I’m waiting on that might make or break my recommendation for this device, and that’s battery life. The Galaxy Chromebook had a number of great features, but it could only last around four hours and 20 minutes to a charge. I don’t think anyone should buy a $999 Chromebook that can’t even last five hours, no matter how nice it looks. Heck, I don’t think anyone should buy a $700 Chromebook that can’t even last five hours. There are just way better options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HP24pR"&gt;So when Samsung sends the Galaxy Chromebook 2 out for review, all eyes will be on the battery life. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Chromebook 2 outlasts its predecessor, given its lower-resolution screen and the lower-powered processor. On the other hand, the Chromebook 2 also has a slightly smaller battery — and the Chromebook Flip C436 (with the same processor and screen resolution) only lasted a bit longer than the Galaxy Chromebook, giving me around five hours in testing. So, we’ll have to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VNuQtYFv3V6MXf7XAFPPWEkRBK4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217914/bfarsace190331_4355_0016.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="yC2F2O"&gt;Samsung made a bold, bright bet with the Galaxy Chromebook. It put out a Chrome OS device unlike anything the market had ever seen, full of bells and whistles that made me go “wow.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77iwWG"&gt;The Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t that. It’s not out to target a brand-new segment of users or to push the boundaries of what a Chromebook can be. And I’m glad to see that, because what I really want at the $549 and $699 price point is a Chromebook that’s nicely built, nails the basics, and doesn’t have any major flaws. It doesn’t need extra fancy stuff; it just needs to deliver in the areas that matter most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NqoVkl"&gt;I’m excited that Samsung is trying to do that. As for whether it’s succeeded, that remains to be seen. But I have my fingers crossed.  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TuRqRi"&gt;Wi-Fi is about to get a lot better. Many of this year’s new phones, laptops, TVs, routers, and more will come with support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;Wi-Fi 6E&lt;/a&gt;, a new upgrade to Wi-Fi that’s essentially like expanding your wireless connection from a two-lane road to an eight-lane highway. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;It’s the biggest upgrade to Wi-Fi in 20 years&lt;/a&gt;, and connections should be faster and a lot more reliable because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAaal3"&gt;The Wi-Fi Alliance, the industry-wide group that oversees Wi-Fi, is now starting to certify the first wave of products with support for Wi-Fi 6E. Phones, PCs, and laptops with support should start hitting the market in the first months of 2021, according to the IDC research group, and TVs and VR devices with support are expected to arrive by the middle of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xrTBBL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wi-Fi 6E explained: Wi-Fi is getting its biggest upgrade in 20 years","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PXv0kg"&gt;Some of the first devices are likely to be announced over the next week. During CES, which kicks off on January 11th, router companies will preview what they have coming up for the year. Samsung is also planning to announce its next flagship phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;the Galaxy S21 series&lt;/a&gt;, and some if not all of them are likely to have support for Wi-Fi 6E thanks to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21672519/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-cpu-gpu-details-performance-ai-isp-photography-specs-release-date"&gt;Snapdragon 888 processor&lt;/a&gt;. Because the chip includes support for it, Wi-Fi 6E should be present in many of this year’s top Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLEJgG"&gt;Wi-Fi 6E is such a big upgrade because it relies on a huge expansion of the wireless airwaves available to consumer devices. In April 2020, the Federal Communications Commission opened up this wide new swath of spectrum in the United States, but new hardware was required in order to make use of it. Nearly a year on, we’re finally starting to see devices with those capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vfJf9W"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oOZLhkaehzU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KziBaF"&gt;Existing Wi-Fi devices operate on two spectrum bands, 2.4GHz and 5GHz. Wi-Fi 6E adds a third — 6GHz — and there’s a lot more of it, quadrupling the total amount of airwaves used for typical Wi-Fi. That means you can have larger, higher-speed connections, and that airwaves are less likely to be congested. In an apartment building, for instance, your neighbors’ Wi-Fi networks might interfere with your own. But with Wi-Fi 6E, there’s a lot more bandwidth to go around, so there’s less of a chance that you’ll be fighting over the exact same airwaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeBSF5"&gt;It’ll be some time before most new devices are shipping with Wi-Fi 6E, though. Not all new gadgets are even shipping with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18232026/wi-fi-6-speed-explained-router-wifi-how-does-work"&gt;standard Wi-Fi 6 yet&lt;/a&gt;, and that version of Wi-Fi started rolling out about two years ago. By the start of 2022, IDC only expects 20 percent of shipping Wi-Fi 6 products to also support Wi-Fi 6E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnOmYV"&gt;Another hurdle is support from regulators worldwide. Though the US has approved use of 6GHz airwaves, communications regulators in other countries need to approve the spectrum for Wi-Fi use, too. The Wi-Fi Alliance says that the UK, EU, South Korea, Chile, and United Arab Emirates have all given a green light on allowing 6GHz usage for Wi-Fi, while regulators in Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and Japan are among others where progress is being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWaBuV"&gt;“There is absolutely momentum, and it is building around making [6GHz] available for Wi-Fi,” Kevin Robinson, the Wi-Fi Alliance’s marketing leader, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz unveils its absolutely massive 56-inch ‘Hyperscreen’ display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/68f6P9cNNvPmZtTs-NwZLWJq3f8=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68631835/21C0001_011.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9eSk2d"&gt;There are big infotainment displays. And then there’s Mercedes-Benz’s “Hyperscreen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27CEqf"&gt;The German automaker just unveiled a mammoth, pillar-to-pillar, 56-inch touchscreen that will debut in the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504049/mercedes-benz-eqs-electric-sedan-eqe-suv"&gt;EQS luxury electric sedan&lt;/a&gt;. The Hyperscreen is the centerpiece of the automaker’s second generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21316700/mercedes-benz-mbux-second-generation-infotainment-system-touchscreen-hey-mercedes"&gt;MBUX infotainment system&lt;/a&gt; that eschews physical buttons in favor of a completely digital (and voice-controlled) in-car user experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cm67M4"&gt;To be sure, the Hyperscreen isn’t one screen, but several displays embedded in one solid piece of curved glass that spans the entire dash. Based on early images, there appear to be at least three screens embedded in the display: an instrument cluster behind the steering column, a central infotainment screen, and an additional screen facing the front passenger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wtsSdJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To be sure, the Hyperscreen isn’t one screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qo1mul"&gt;The Hyperscreen will first appear in the EQS, a luxury electric sedan that Mercedes has said will go into production in late 2021. It will be powered by MBUX, which is short for “Mercedes-Benz User Experience.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/2/16965682/mercedes-a-class-mbux-voice-assistant"&gt;First introduced in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, MBUX is one of the more capable automaker-created, voice-controlled infotainment systems on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ABQsU1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10270759"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xRfcMf"&gt;Mercedes says the Hyperscreen will include something called “zero layers,”  in which the user no longer has to scroll through a variety of sub-menus or give voice commands “as the most important applications are always available in a situational and contextual way at the top of the driver’s field of vision.” The automaker provided a couple of examples, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xLHA6h"&gt;If you always call one particular person on the way home on Tuesday evenings, you will be asked to make a corresponding call on that day of the week and that specific time of day. A business card appears with their contact information and – if it’s stored – their photo will appear. All MBUX suggestions are linked to the user’s profile. If someone else drives the EQS on a Tuesday evening, this recommendation would not be made – or another one is made, depending on the preferences of the other user.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="m2eHUP"&gt;The Hyperscreen will include a total of 12 actuators beneath the touch-sensitive surface for haptic feedback. Two coatings of the cover plate are said to reduce reflections and make cleaning easier. The curved glass itself consists of particularly scratch-resistant aluminum silicate. And analogue air vents are embedded in the surface at either end, offering an interesting blend of the digital and physical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q02gYB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;analogue air vents are embedded in the surface at either end&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kbu0PG"&gt;The Hyperscreen won’t appear in a production car until the late 2021 release of the EQS, but the new version MBUX will see its debut in the new S-Class, which was first unveiled late last year. The updated infotainment system will let drivers save various preferences like seat settings, interior lighting color, favorite radio station, and more. These personal profiles can be enabled or disabled by using the new security features, or even loaded in other Mercedes-Benz vehicles. A fingerprint sensor in the main touchscreen and voice recognition will come standard, and there is a PIN setting as well. Buyers can opt for a version of the car with cameras that allow for facial recognition, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUACGf"&gt;Vehicle touchscreens have grown larger over the years, with some automakers assuming that bigger equals better. Among production vehicles, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21126299/escalade-2021-oled-display-touchscreen-curved-glass"&gt;2021 Cadillac Escalade’s&lt;/a&gt; 14.2-inch screen is particularly noteworthy, as is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/15/16892836/ram-1500-carplay-android-auto-detroit-show-2018"&gt;2019 Ram 1500’s 12-inch screen&lt;/a&gt;. And the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;Cadillac Lyriq&lt;/a&gt; electric SUV is promising a mind-boggling 33-inch screen. The Tesla Model 3’s 15-inch screen, which floats above the dash rather than hugging the interior’s curves, has set the bar high for electric cars — one that Mercedes seems eager to vault over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKObOE"&gt;Of course, it remains to be seen how distracting to the driver all these screens will be. Without a robust driver monitoring system to ensure drivers stay focused on the road, these  ultra-large screens can be a huge liability and safety risk. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-seniors-autos/vehicle-infotainment-systems-dangerously-distracting-especially-for-seniors-idUSKCN1UK34F"&gt;A recent study by AAA found&lt;/a&gt; that many digital infotainment systems turning up in newer cars may be distracting enough to increase the risk for accidents, especially for older drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xGvPU"&gt;Mercedes says its zero layer feature will hopefully reduce driver distraction — though that will need to be proven out. “The goal was a concept without distraction of the driver or creating complicated operation,” Sajjad Khan, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz AG and CTO on the new MBUX generation, said in a press release. “We didn’t want to build the biggest screen ever in a car. Instead, we have developed special screens with a perfect ratio of size and functionality for maximum user-friendliness.”&lt;/p&gt;
