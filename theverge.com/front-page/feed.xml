    <title>Sri Lanka’s cannabis-seekers are gathering on Facebook</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Facebook groups have become a gray market for the country’s weed dealers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="BwqatQ"&gt;One weekend about a year ago in Balangoda, a misty mountain town outside Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, Sanjana was supposed to meet a dealer she found on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/923602878094040"&gt;Thriloka Wijaya Pathra&lt;/a&gt;, a Facebook group for cannabis users in Sri Lanka. Like many strangers who had connected over Facebook, Sanjana had decided to buy a few joints of ganja (a local word for weed). Then a family emergency happened and Sanjana couldn’t make it. A few days later, another group member told Sanjana that police caught her dealer. Perhaps he was released after a fine. Perhaps he went behind the bars. Sanjana didn’t hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObsZLX"&gt;“The only thing I know is that this stuff is illegal in Sri Lanka and it can get you in trouble,” Sanjana, now an 18-year-old, recalled to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, while waiting for another dealer to bring ganja grown domestically, 4.5 hours north of Colombo. “I was at my boyfriend’s place in Balangoda,” Sanjana said, chuckling. “If it’s two to three joints, I’ve heard they release you after a $30 fine. Plus my boyfriend works in the police. He could’ve got me out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOfTEq"&gt;Cannabis has a complicated history in the island nation. While native medicinal practitioners used cannabis to treat illnesses in the past, a law introduced in 1935 under British colonial rule criminalized cannabis. Though a 1967 government act permitted registered Ayurvedic doctors to use cannabis for medicinal purposes, today Sri Lanka &lt;a href="https://sensiseeds.com/en/blog/countries/cannabis-in-sri-lanka-laws-use-history/"&gt;still considers&lt;/a&gt; cannabis to be a “dangerous drug,” and recreational use can result in fines and years of prison time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RmFph9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People feel that Facebook is safer than real life.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i0qzfS"&gt;Despite these laws, cannabis is the &lt;a href="https://www.unafei.or.jp/publications/pdf/RS_No107/No107_15_IP_SriLanka.pdf"&gt;most-used illicit drug in Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, with an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.unodc.org/southasia/frontpage/2009/October/interview-with-mr.-mendes.html"&gt;600,000 users&lt;/a&gt;; natural scientist Wasantha Sena Weliange believes that number is much higher. In recent years, cannabis has become extremely popular with Gen Z.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3nJPo"&gt;Buwanka, 25, is an Instagram influencer in Colombo who despised cannabis as a schoolkid. The anti-cannabis rhetoric, Buwanka said, comes from his parents’ generation, who believed cannabis was harmful. “Because that’s what everyone thought in the 1960s and 1970s. My parents fed me the same mentality. So as a teen, I was the first to report my classmates if they smoked ganja,” said Buwanka, who only wanted to reveal his first name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imALsD"&gt;But things changed when he left for college in Adelaide, Australia. Thousands of miles away from his Sri Lankan home, he began to feel lonely. When his roommate gave him ganja, he gave it a try. “I became happier. I started going out and joining all the cool events in the city.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ujf54"&gt;Buwanka now thinks that people refuse cannabis not because they dislike it, but because it’s tied to social stigma. “We constantly believe ganja is bad and if someone smokes ganja, they are addicts who have no use for society.” But Facebook communities, he said, are working toward changing this stereotype by gathering like-minded people into one place and creating a forum for discussion. “People feel that Facebook is safer than real life. They are more confident in sharing what they want on social media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNpxsY"&gt;When Sanjana joined Thriloka Wijaya Pathra two years ago, there were only a few thousand members — now there are over 177,000. The group, which takes its name from the Sanskrit for cannabis, provides a platform for cannabis users to get together and share information: different uses of cannabis, medicinal qualities, details on how to roll a joint, etc. Members post pictures of their cannabis plants in tiny pots grown in secret inside their houses. And of course there are memes and TikTok videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hp6i3c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dinesh considers himself “just a pawn” in a large drug supply chain&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hsZx2e"&gt;Anil, 19, smokes weed in Ja-Ela, a town just a few miles north of Colombo. He started smoking at 15 with his rugby teammates. “Every stoner grows a ganja plant, or at least we try,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, recalling his unsuccessful attempts to grow cannabis in a clay pot. “Because this shit is hard to find.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtpXnY"&gt;In Sri Lanka, police often &lt;a href="http://www.colombopage.com/archive_19A/Feb26_1551154235CH.php"&gt;raid cannabis plantations&lt;/a&gt;, destroy them, and put traditional growers behind bars. This leads to a shortage of fresh, local weed. Smokers, Anil said, have found a solution: Kerala ganja — commonly known as &lt;em&gt;KG&lt;/em&gt; — smuggled from South India to Sri Lanka. Anil meets KG users in a place he calls “smokers den” in Colombo, a sort of cannabis retreat run by a 30-year-old in his private apartment where smokers can meet, chat, dance, and party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9uaJE"&gt;Although local distributors &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gopiharan/status/1005353974235463680?lang=en"&gt;spray poisonous ingredients&lt;/a&gt; like formaldehyde and domestic pest killers like Mortein on these products, making commonly available KG a &lt;a href="https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2019/09/08/health/medi-snippets-kerala-ganja-users-are-risk-heart-failure-stroke"&gt;harmful narcotic&lt;/a&gt;, Anil boasts that he smokes “pure KG” — cannabis without added chemicals — and can identify the “real stuff” when he sees it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lcdF8"&gt;“There’s nothing like pure KG now. All KG is a shit mix of chemicals,” said Dinesh, 28, who is a drug dealer and a tuk-tuk driver in the Colombo suburb of Mattakkuliya. Like Dinesh, many weed distributors in Sri Lanka are tuk-tuk drivers who sell low-quality, cheap KG. Dinesh, who started dealing drugs when he was 16, soon after he dropped out of school, considers himself “just a pawn” in a large drug supply chain. He receives goods from several others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JPcv68"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s cheap. It’s everywhere.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fzIZ9h"&gt;While his customers come from all walks of life, Dinesh said that most of them are teens. Most young users, he said, don’t come face to face; they send someone older to buy ganja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFGgGG"&gt;His prices start at $2 for a small packet of KG, enough for a joint. “This cheap stuff has lots of chemicals. The more chemicals, the more you feel,” said Dinesh. “It’s a different kind of high. It’s the sudden thrill that young boys, and occasionally girls, love.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KZogY"&gt;Dinesh agrees that teens are aware of the harmful substances in chemically treated KG. “But it’s what most people can afford,” he said. “Rich kids come to me and buy &lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Hashish_vs_Marijuana"&gt;hash&lt;/a&gt; and kush [imported drugs with higher levels of THC].” Dinesh sells a gram of kush for about 7,000 LKR ($40).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80MSef"&gt;Janith, a 19-year-old in Colombo who goes to a paid private school, said his friends also use expensive edibles, like gummies from Canada that go for $100. Janith and his mates consider KG a “bad trip” they avoid. But young smokers often don’t have an idea about what is good or not, so they search on Reddit or join Facebook groups to find information and connect with fellow smokers, Janith said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFS30h"&gt;Although a March &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/923602878094040/posts/1171718439949148"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; on the Thriloka Wijaya Pathra group asks members to not talk about KG, a June post from a member asks his fellow smokers what they prefer, KG or local ganja. Most users wrote KG. A handful of them said they use KG since local ganja is hard to find. Sanjana agreed. “It’s cheap. It’s everywhere.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qT4im9"&gt;Sanjana, who has smoked KG, believes that Facebook groups like Thriloka Wijaya Pathra play a key role in educating smokers. When Sanjana initially joined, she saw a series of Facebook posts about cannabis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="go9UsE"&gt;“Maybe there are bad sides to cannabis, but why would I stop something if it makes me feel good?” said Sanjana, “In the past, some people commented against using cannabis. But now people get correct information and see there’s no harm. It’s all thanks to these groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P63ayF"&gt;Gen Z aren’t the only ones using social media to talk about cannabis. When Buwanka posted an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CG5IzyZhA_9/"&gt;IGTV video&lt;/a&gt; about cannabis and why it should be legalized in Sri Lanka about eight months ago, it caught attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYQZ0R"&gt;But Buwanka’s video didn’t go viral on Instagram. It was when cannabis community groups on Facebook shared it that he received a roaring response. There were 138,000 views on popular Facebook pages like Weedboy. Comments poured in. People loved Buwanka’s video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7k78VF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Only a handful of urban people use Instagram, but everyone’s on Facebook”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gKGY1Y"&gt;Buwanka said it was because he spoke in a local language, Sinhala. “Most cannabis users don’t speak English. When you go online, you can read about cannabis, but it’s all in English. I needed to do something that everyone could understand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9A2tfQ"&gt;“Only a handful of urban people use Instagram, but everyone’s on Facebook,” said Buwanka. “That’s why it went viral on Facebook.” While over &lt;a href="https://napoleoncat.com/stats/facebook-users-in-sri_lanka/2020/01"&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Sri Lankans have a Facebook account, only &lt;a href="https://napoleoncat.com/stats/instagram-users-in-sri_lanka/2020/01"&gt;4.7 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Sri Lankans are on Instagram. Most Facebook users are young. Over a third of them are under 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9q6MnB"&gt;Of course, safe use of cannabis isn’t the only thing they talk about. While these Facebook groups don’t allow users to sell cannabis or share details about dealers in public, Buwanka said that Facebook users still talk about these things. “Especially during lockdowns, people would come to these groups and comment, ‘I’m from Gampola and we’ve run dry over here.’ Or, ‘My tuk-tuk dealer has tested positive for COVID. Can someone send me some ganja?’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFFLP3"&gt;These groups have connected the cannabis community with one another, giving smokers a chance to share details outside the groups. Buwanka said that members chat on Messenger and share supplier details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UViayh"&gt;“You make friends in these groups, but it’s hard to send ganja to some other place because it’s risky. I know people put it in perfume bottles and send it via delivery guys,” said Sanjana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWhvCY"&gt;During holidays, Sanjana smokes a few joints with her 17-year-old cousin; they post about cannabis on Thriloka Wijaya Pathra and share photos. “Because our society expects girls to be cultural, people think that cannabis is only for boys and girls can’t use it,” said Sanjana. “That’s bullshit. Everyone can use it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJrYBW"&gt;Sanjana thinks that Facebook helps change how people think. “When I first posted, people wrote negative things. Boys thought, ‘Girls can’t use ganja.’ But now a lot of members support the idea of girls smoking,” said Sanjana, who responded to negative comments with a rolling-eyes emoji and wrote, “Girls need to feel good, just like you do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="oGw1r8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you can just walk into a shop and buy fresh ganja at affordable prices, why would you choose harmful stuff?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9NZln4"&gt;While young smokers are finding community on Facebook, 56-year-old natural scientist Wasantha Sena Weliange, who is &lt;a href="https://www.themorning.lk/high-time-for-cannabis-legalisation/"&gt;fighting to legalize&lt;/a&gt; cannabis in Sri Lanka, runs his own &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/448451116534844"&gt;Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; to support generational cannabis farmers. Weliange, who wrote a Sinhala-language book about cannabis, is now building a hemp museum and a cannabis village in Thanamalvila in the southeast of the country. “On Facebook, we are trying to establish knowledge and influence young people to join the fight to legalize cannabis,” Weliange said. “We get calls from a lot of young people. They are happy to see this. They are curious. Some of them ask me, ‘Can I mix ganja with yogurt?’ or ‘What can we make from them?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axtpw4"&gt;Weliange believes that legalizing cannabis will not only help farmers, but also prevent young people from using chemically processed KG and other harmful substances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oJK6E"&gt;This also resonated with Buwanka. “If you can just walk into a shop and buy fresh ganja at affordable prices, why would you choose harmful stuff?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HN44UP"&gt;While the government has discussed &lt;a href="http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2020/09/13/news-features/legalising-and-exporting-cannabis-cards"&gt;planting cannabis for export purposes&lt;/a&gt;, Sri Lanka’s &lt;a href="https://www.ucanews.com/news/sri-lankan-religious-leaders-oppose-cannabis-cultivation/89629"&gt;dominant Buddhist clergy&lt;/a&gt; are against decriminalizing cannabis for everyday use. But both Gen Z and older generations are still using it, and frequenting Facebook to meet each other. “If it wasn’t for social media, I don’t think we can come together around a tree and talk about cannabis,” Buwanka said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KbEZM"&gt;Meanwhile, Anil still believes he can identify good KG, while Janith says friends make brownies when they get together. Dinesh knows his job is risky, as police can raid him, but he’s happy being a dealer as long as it brings him money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4yGj66"&gt;“If they legalize it, I will be the first to plant ganja in my garden,” said Sanjana, who’s planning to study a Japanese-language course in order to go work in Japan with her cousin. “But the only problem is that cannabis is illegal in Japan. I’ve heard you can’t get around it like we do here.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Boeing launch its astronaut capsule to space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NASA/Kim Shiflett" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hDIeWCBP92CG4HI8VoLtYlc4PN4=/0x116:1365x1026/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671303/51347154310_cb53a69a6b_k.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Boeing’s Starliner capsule sits atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket | NASA/Kim Shiflett&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3MNIyb"&gt;Boeing is set to launch its Starliner astronaut capsule to the International Space Station (ISS) on Tuesday, more than a year and a half after its first orbital Starliner test failed to reach the station and returned home earlier than planned. The mission is a test, and there won’t be any humans on board. If all goes well, it’ll mark a crucial step toward Boeing and NASA’s goal to use Starliner for routine astronaut missions, and a key chance to salvage the aerospace giant’s reputation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22595730/boeing-starliner-astronaut-capsule-launch-nasa-oft2"&gt;after years of setbacks and controversies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVlemU"&gt;The test mission, called Orbital Flight Test 2, will launch from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station using an Atlas-V rocket built by United Launch Alliance. Starliner, sitting on top of the rocket, will do what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/2/18244499/spacex-crew-dragon-launch-first-capsule-iss-nasa-passenger-flight"&gt;Boeing’s rival SpaceX did with its Crew Dragon capsule in early 2019&lt;/a&gt; — go to space, dock to the ISS, remain there for 10 days, then return back to Earth. Both companies have developed their capsules under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, with Boeing’s Starliner contract at $4.5 billion and SpaceX’s at $2.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVS5n1"&gt;Starliner, a seven-seated astronaut pod shaped like a flat acorn, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/22/21033757/boeing-cst-100-starliner-landing-success-oft-rough-flight"&gt;suffered a series of software glitches&lt;/a&gt; during its 2019 test flight, forcing Boeing to skip its space station docking and bring it home early just two days after launching to space. In the next 18 months, Boeing worked to settle 80 different concerns that sprang from lengthy technical investigations led by company employees and independent experts at NASA. Those 80 recommendations have been implemented, Boeing’s Starliner chief John Vollmer told reporters on Tuesday, and Starliner is ready to fly again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w1Dg8e"&gt;What time is the launch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GM2H0z"&gt;Liftoff is slated for 1:20PM ET on Tuesday, with &lt;a href="https://www.patrick.spaceforce.mil/About-Us/Weather/"&gt;forecasts&lt;/a&gt; from the Air Force predicting only a 40 percent chance of unfavorable launch weather. Boeing and NASA postponed the mission from last Friday after a new Russian science module that docked the day before Starliner’s planned launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22601752/russia-nauka-module-software-glitch-iss-space-station-nasa"&gt;started uncontrollably firing its thrusters and pushed the entire space station out of position&lt;/a&gt;. NASA’s ISS team needed time to make sure everything on the space station was back to normal before welcoming a new spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sbNh1b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If weather messes things up, the next chance to launch is Wednesday&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AybluV"&gt;If Tuesday’s launch gets called off because of weather, Boeing would try again on Wednesday, August 4th, at 1PM ET. Assuming it launches on Tuesday, Starliner will try docking to the International Space Station roughly 24 hours later, at 1:37PM ET on Wednesday, to begin its ten-day stay. NASA astronauts already on board the station — Shane Kimbrough, Megan McArthur, Mark Vande Hei — will run tests inside the capsule before it undocks roughly 10 days later. The exact time Starliner undocks to begin its trek home depends on weather forecasts over New Mexico, where the capsule will return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HIzTDJ"&gt;How to watch Starliner’s mission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Swqpbf"&gt;Like all of its launches, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF9LpNpNjNI&amp;amp;ab_channel=NASA"&gt;NASA plans to stream Starliner’s launch on a YouTube feed&lt;/a&gt;, with live coverage starting at 12:30PM ET. NASA’s live coverage of Starliner’s ISS docking begins the following day, Wednesday, at 10:30AM ET, and will be viewable on the agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive"&gt;main live YouTube feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon and Best Buy’s latest Fire TVs have a sleeker design and better HDR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uFYqK_rdb5GVsalYEwVZlNPwJS8=/34x0:2485x1634/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671298/B823E2AA_EE2D_4D51_9125_88DEF71EF1B4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ddycRY"&gt;Amazon and Best Buy are continuing on with their TV partnership that started three years ago. Today, the companies announced new Insignia and Toshiba TVs that run Amazon’s Fire TV software. The latest F50 series improves on previous “Fire TV Edition” sets — Amazon is just calling them “Fire TVs” now — with expanded quantum dot HDR color for a more vivid picture. The new models also feature slimmer bezels, DTS Virtual-X audio from the built-in speakers, and continue to support Dolby Vision HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Boc3m"&gt;Pricing will start at $599.99 for a 50-inch model, and the F50 series tops out at 70 inches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5yK0L"&gt;Between different models and screen sizes (ranging from 24 inches to 75 inches) sold in the US and Canada, there are now over 80 Insignia and Toshiba Fire TVs available. Both are Best Buy’s house brands, and customers can order any of the TVs on Amazon’s website for in-store pickup at their nearest Best Buy store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuOPgs"&gt;When they ship later this summer, the latest TVs will come preloaded with Amazon’s revamped, content-focused Fire TV software experience. The included remote will also support Alexa voice commands. You’ve still got to press and hold the Alexa button to make voice requests; Amazon and Best Buy continue to refrain from putting always-listening mics in these TVs, which seems like the right decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5WaDX2"&gt;These are still being positioned as inexpensive TVs that are centered around &lt;em&gt;video&lt;/em&gt; entertainment; if you’re looking for the best set for showcasing your new Xbox Series X or PS5, you’ll probably want to look elsewhere. While Amazon has released higher-end Fire TV sets in other countries (like an OLED from Grundig in Germany), so far there’s nothing in its US lineup that can go toe to toe with TCL’s flagship Roku TVs in picture quality. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fWb4t6"&gt;In the last week or so, we’ve learned about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;the state of California filing a lawsuit against Blizzard citing numerous stories of sexual harassment and discrimination at the company&lt;/a&gt;. The revelations have been followed by even more stories of unacceptable behavior by leaders of the company, and now the president of Blizzard (who was named in the lawsuit) is leaving the company “to pursue new opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FJKdF"&gt;Employees were informed of J. Allen Brack’s departure this morning, and &lt;a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23706475/new-leadership-at-blizzard"&gt;an announcement&lt;/a&gt; from Activision Blizzard says that former Vicarious Visions leader Jen Oneal and former Xbox executive Mike Ybarra will take over as co-leaders of the company. Brack &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/3/17934432/mike-morhaime-blizzard-president-resigns"&gt;took over Blizzard in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and prior to that, he led the development of &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, where the team included the only other person specifically named in the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) lawsuit, Alex Afrasiabi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZtEkmH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the latest accusations Activision Blizzard employees have leveled at the company ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602655/activision-blizzard-employees-accusations-allegations-lawsuit"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NpcOvA"&gt;Ahead of their walkout, employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595922/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-sexual-harassment"&gt;made a list with four demands&lt;/a&gt; including an audit of executive staff, an end to forced arbitration clauses, and other changes to improve diversity and equity for marginalized groups at the company. These demands followed an inconsistent and self-admittedly “tone deaf” response from the company, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22591611/activision-blizzard-brack-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-california"&gt;a letter from Brack&lt;/a&gt; where he claimed to have fought “bro culture” throughout his career — despite the lawsuit alleging he was aware of and enabling the behavior cited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8JnLG"&gt;Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has not addressed the issues since his letter last week, and the announcement of Brack’s departure comes from COO Daniel Alegre. Saying that Oneal and Ybarra “will share responsibility for development and operational accountability” at Blizzard, he noted that Oneal has been providing leadership and support for the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; franchises, while Ybarra has been an EVP overseeing &lt;a href="http://Battle.net"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; since joining Blizzard in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FtUi9B"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J. Allen Brack:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPtY51"&gt;I am confident that Jen Oneal and Mike Ybarra will provide the leadership Blizzard needs to realize its full potential and will accelerate the pace of change. I anticipate they will do so with passion and enthusiasm and that they can be trusted to lead with the highest levels of integrity and commitment to the components of our culture that make Blizzard so special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="stKY6I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Realme launches MagDart magnetic wireless charging devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_uLABIWNFvtb7IAxYfsNGoK0h4=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671195/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.009___.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5RDuFl"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595550/realme-flash-magdart-wireless-charging-magnetic-android-specs"&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt;, Realme is working on a magnetic wireless charging system for its Android phones, and today it’s revealed a full range of products that’ll use the new technology. Realme is calling the system MagDart, and it’s basically a high-powered take on Apple’s MagSafe system for the iPhone 12 range of phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8jHox"&gt;The key product in the lineup is the 50W MagDart charger, which Realme says is the world’s fastest magnetic wireless charger. It has an inescapably bulky cuboid design that makes room for a cooling fan, but Realme is banking that users will make the tradeoff for faster charging speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oD8xGq"&gt;When plugged into the company’s 65W SuperDart wired charger, Realme claims that the MagDart charger will fill a 4,500mAh phone battery up to 100 percent in 54 minutes. That’s almost as fast as what you get from Realme’s 50W wired charger.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UMWayB2ya6IR8I5bD7B1J1qihsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757981/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.011___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RFObBC"&gt;If you don’t want to have to plug a charging brick into a charging brick, Realme is also working on a somewhat sleeker and more convenient 15W MagDart charger, which basically looks like Apple’s MagSafe puck — though Realme points out it’s 26.4 percent thinner and claims faster charging speeds. It’ll fill a 4,500mAh battery in 90 minutes, according to Realme, which would indeed be &lt;a href="https://www.cambrionix.com/magsafe-usb-c-charging-speed-tested"&gt;much faster&lt;/a&gt; than Apple’s own 15W option.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RA93AmxmWRjo782pjm_7h35o2XE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757985/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.021___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H9ZFQG"&gt;Wireless charging convenience aside, a major advantage of a magnetic design like MagDart and MagSafe is the potential for slick portless accessories, and Realme has a bunch of those as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="6mfuyn"&gt;The 2-in-1 MagDart Power Bank is similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;Apple’s recently-released MagSafe Battery Pack,&lt;/a&gt; but it comes with a dock that lets you use the battery as a phone stand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVPrDZ-dVzmqXS8K8vO_CQ9Fbck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758014/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.001___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZKrtej"&gt;The MagDart Case is a carbon fiber-style case for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534618/realme-gt-hands-on-europe-launch-price-specs"&gt;the new Realme GT flagship phone&lt;/a&gt; with a passthrough USB-C port and headphone jack as well as built-in MagDart connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQa74990q8Wpfirf_vgZoOLEsUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758017/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.043___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="mbW209"&gt;The MagDart Wallet is, you guessed it, a three-card sleeve similar to Apple’s MagSafe wallet. But this one has a kickstand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8jKMiMMweJ5mfrbwMxdsjwDKU9M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758020/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.040___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="qQDjyf"&gt;Perhaps best of all is the MagDart Beauty Light, a flip-up ring light for selfies that’s powered by reverse wireless charging. It has 60 mini LEDs and a dedicated control button that lets you adjust settings like brightness and color temperature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V5tmot1sqNpTLFLqUmEHiD6E5ks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758023/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.038___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1wpXkD"&gt;Realme hasn’t said anything about a release date or pricing for any of these products, and the sole existing phone confirmed to work with any MagDart device is the Realme GT — and that’s only if you buy the dedicated case. Realme is demonstrating the ecosystem with a “concept phone” called the Realme Flash, which is pictured in the above images and does have MagDart directly built in, but there aren’t any plans to actually release it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhvDRX"&gt;That’s a pretty big catch for what’s ostensibly a launch for a major new ecosystem of products. But if Realme does integrate MagDart into its future phones, it could be a solid differentiator. Wireless charging is consistently one of the key omissions from Chinese phones that otherwise have impressive spec sheets — Oppo only recently adopted the tech, and Vivo is yet to get on board. And since Oppo’s VOOC fast-charging system made its way to OnePlus and Realme phones due to the companies’ shared ownership and supply chain, it’s plausible that the same could happen with MagDart.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter to work with AP and Reuters to provide more context around disputed topics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kbbe8JZnKPwENA-YiNW6UM1aqzM=/0x0:4962x3308/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671108/MisleadingInfo.png.img.fullhd.medium.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter’s added context for content on its platform.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="toli3h"&gt;Twitter is working with news agencies the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;to more proactively combat misinformation on its platform, the &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/bringing-more-reliable-context-to-conversations-on-twitter"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The platform’s internal teams already work to explain and add context to Twitter content, but it says the two news agencies will help provide more authoritative information, especially when facts are in dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meIFu2"&gt;In particular, Twitter says it wants to be more proactive about providing accurate information on topics as they develop, before misinformation emerges. “Rather than waiting until something goes viral, Twitter will contextualize developing discourse at pace with or in anticipation of the public conversation,” the platform says. &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; will also provide feedback on fact-checking provided via Twitter’s crowd-sourced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248903/twitter-birdwatch-fact-checking-misinformation"&gt;Birdwatch program&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently in a pilot phase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iixPOC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re excited to announce a new collaboration with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Reuters?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Reuters&lt;/a&gt;! Conversations move fast on Twitter and we need to be able to surface credible context just as quickly. Learn more about where you’ll see these updates: &lt;a href="https://t.co/ptp5PWiFxq"&gt;https://t.co/ptp5PWiFxq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1422288755197726731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uMSnC3"&gt;The collaboration is an expansion of Twitter’s existing attempts to stop misinformation from spreading on its platform. The company’s Curation team already adds explanatory content to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418044/twitter-trending-topics-representative-pinned-tweets-descriptions-misinformation"&gt;trending topics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254733/twitter-covid-19-misleading-information-label-warnings-misinformation"&gt;certain misleading tweets&lt;/a&gt;, and will surface authoritative information when users search for specific terms, or during major events like elections or public health emergencies. But Twitter says the new partnerships will help “when Twitter’s Curation team doesn’t have the specific expertise or access to a high enough volume of reputable reporting on Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZM4nF"&gt;It will be the first time Twitter has formally collaborated with news agencies to provide accurate information on its site, the company &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-partners-with-ap-reuters-battle-misinformation-its-site-2021-08-02/"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Associated Press &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;already work with Facebook to fact-check content on its platform, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-58065463"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmVvGs"&gt;Twitter says its collaboration with the two news agencies will be separate from the work done by its own enforcement teams, and that neither &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; nor &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;will be deciding whether tweets break Twitter’s rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSk1qN"&gt;The new partnerships come as social media platforms are facing intense scrutiny from regulators for the amount of misinformation they spread. The problem has become particularly acute in light of the global COVID-19 pandemic, in which misinformation about the virus and now its vaccines has spread online. Last month, US surgeon general Vivek Murthy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines"&gt;called on platforms&lt;/a&gt; to do more to combat coronavirus misinformation, including redesigning their algorithms to avoid amplifying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4Dbi7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRCoGV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP is flooding the zone with seven new gaming monitors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HP gaming monitors" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4pw4exhbKOnJ7U2r6OREkwyejuk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671039/hpecosystemmonitors.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X34 1440p monitor sits in the middle of the fleet of new models.&lt;/em&gt; | HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vb6p4B"&gt;HP has gone on a tear and announced seven new gaming monitors in its X lineup, featuring a range of sizes, panel types, and resolutions, as well as some that are curved or flat-screened. It seems like HP is aiming to deliver a flurry of options that have a high refresh rate, low response time, competent design, and crucially, competitive prices. HP is staggering this launch over the next few months, with availability starting now for some of its monitors and continuing through October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZaRHW"&gt;To being with, there’s HP’s X27, which is available now and comes in a 1080p version for $259.99 or a 1440p variant called the X27q that costs $339.99. Both are IPS panels with a 165Hz refresh rate and a 1ms response time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16WfcB"&gt;Resolution differences aside, they’re very similar in design. Each features slim bezels on three sides and can be raised, swiveled, and rotated to your liking. If you don’t like the stand that’s included, they include VESA mounts so you can mount them to one of the many monitor arms that are available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aT6ebf"&gt;In terms of ports, these are simple offerings with a DisplayPort 1.4 port, a HDMI 2.0 port, and a headphone jack. Each panel can reach up to 400 nits of brightness (the X27q, the X32, and the X34 that’s mentioned below support HDR content, but at the HDR400 standard that isn’t all that bright), and there’s AMD’s FreeSync Premium for variable refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9kKxW"&gt;(In fact, every monitor announced today has the same selection of ports, and each has an adaptive sync feature that works with both AMD and Nvidia GeForce GTX 10 series, GTX 16 series, and newer graphics cards. I’ve reached out to HP for clarification on how its adaptive sync compares to Nvidia G-Sync compatibility.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP X34" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NewQ3P2XvXxdPDDPH3gTeXjjMz8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22756754/hpx34monitor.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X34 is the biggest option to come in HP’s late 2021 lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FWSpRA"&gt;Coming in August is a larger variant called the HP X32, a 1440p monitor with many of the same specs and features as the X27q (though it can’t pivot or swivel); it will cost $389.99. A month later, in September, the HP X34 will add an ultrawide option to the lineup; it will cost $459.99. It has a 21:9 aspect ratio display and a 3440 x 1440 resolution. It’s still limited to just one DisplayPort and a single HDMI port for video input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTHBYe"&gt;HP will release three different sizes of 1500R curved gaming monitors in October, and these are similar in design, port selection, and feature set to the flat panel options. These, however, have VA panels that usually boast more narrow viewing angles, but that’s less of an issue on a curved screen. They also have 350 nits of peak brightness compared to 400 nits in the flat panel monitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iD7pRv"&gt;The X27c with a 27-inch 1080p curved screen is $259.99 — the same price as the flat X27. The X27qc is the 1440p curved variant, bumping the cost just $10 over the non-curved option at $349.99. Finally, HP is releasing a 31.5-inch X32c with a bigger 1080p curved display that costs $309.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTRJVt"&gt;Each of these monitors support VESA mounts and can be raised or lowered, but don’t support pivoting or swiveling. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP X32c" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ubaYhDTuX1h_nkUVeh4WFLi22tg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22756757/x32cmonitor.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1500R isn’t as curvy as gaming monitors come these days, but it’s certainly more immersive than a flat panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ae5hSK"&gt;Those are appealing prices if you’re thinking of dipping a toe into the world of curved gaming monitors. You could get two of each size and still spend less than the cost of a single &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22587089/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-49-inch-curved-gaming-monitor-price-specs-release-date-features"&gt;Samsung 49-inch Odyssey Neo G9&lt;/a&gt;. The picture quality and features provided by that $2,499 monitor are way ahead of these curved HP models, but you’re paying dearly for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPIbIj"&gt;In announcing &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many monitors at once, it’s clear that HP wants to flood shelves with plenty of options for the latter half of 2021. Seven monitors might be overkill, but these could be worth checking out if you’re on a budget and don’t want to decide between buying a graphics card or a display.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s drone delivery program ‘one gigantic oversell,’ says report into UK operation</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/18M-yMQ6zGdFbM43Qi-6uABTIQ0=/3x0:2109x1404/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69670929/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_11.54.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s delivery drones have gone through many iterations, including the design above. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K1f7IU"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/amazon-drone-delivery-prime-air"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into Amazon’s drone delivery program in the UK says the operation has lost over 100 employees, with insiders saying the project is “collapsing inwards.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4P7k9o"&gt;Citing testimony from former employees, &lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;describes a culture of managerial dysfunction and overwork. In February 2020, for example, Amazon reportedly shut down a team of dozens in the UK dedicated to analyzing drone footage to identify humans and animals, only to re-open the unit months later. Other stories cited in the report include the fast turnover of senior staff, an employee drinking beer at their desk in the morning, and another “pinning down the ‘approve’ button on their computer so that all the frames of footage were being approved irrelevant of whether there were hazards in them or not.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fjfroc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“they put people in charge who didn’t know anything about the project and they oversold”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8fA6fc"&gt;As one former worker told &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;: “Everything started collapsing inwards because they [Amazon] piled too much on, they put people in charge who didn’t know anything about the project and they oversold. It’s all one gigantic oversell — just so many promises that can’t be kept.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGgpcL"&gt;A spokesperson for Amazon told &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; that the company will continue to have a Prime Air presence in the UK, but did not confirm its current or future headcount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5J6rWS"&gt;It’s not clear how the dysfunction described in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;’s report extends to Amazon’s overall drone delivery program, which was first announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/1/5164340/delivery-drones-are-coming-jeff-bezos-previews-half-hour-shipping"&gt;all the way back in 2013&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly, the company has oversold the ease of introducing the technology, though, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18654044/amazon-prime-air-delivery-drone-new-design-safety-transforming-flight-video"&gt;promising in June 2019&lt;/a&gt; it would be launching a delivery service in “the coming months.” In August last year, Amazon did finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408646/amazon-prime-air-drone-delivery-faa-clearance-approval-health-safety-alphabet-wing"&gt;receive approval from the FAA&lt;/a&gt; to deliver packages in the US — which it cited as a key restraint — but has yet to outline a timeline for when this might happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GV5dhm"&gt;Amazon positioned the UK as a big market for its technology, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/14/13952240/amazon-drone-delivery-launch-uk"&gt;announcing in 2016&lt;/a&gt; that it had made its first real drone delivery in Cambridge, England. But this was a stunt using a pre-arranged order, and Amazon has never offered commercial deliveries in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSm8fc"&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;’s report focuses on the UK operation, some of the problems identified in the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;story seem like they would affect Amazon’s overall drone ambitions. These include the company’s desire to land its drones to deliver their packages, a method which takes particularly careful navigation. Rivals like Google-owned Wing, by contrast, drop off packages without actually descending to the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrDuWR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has contacted Amazon for further comment and will update this story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi overtakes Samsung to take top spot in European phone shipments in Q2 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LPLZPwxGXWuTO09gw8-Cz5XZ6Q8=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69670808/DSCF7531.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GDnNl2"&gt;Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is continuing to post solid growth. After overtaking Apple as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22579771/worldwide-smartphone-market-share-ranking-q2-2022-canalys-xiaomi-apple-samsung"&gt;number two smartphone vendor in the world&lt;/a&gt; in the second quarter of 2021, it’s now become the top seller in Europe for the first time, according to &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210802005339/en/Strategy-Analytics-Xiaomi-Captures-Top-Position-in-European-Smartphone-Shipments-for-the-First-Time-in-Q2-2021-%C2%A0"&gt;new figures from Strategy Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fn4FXW"&gt;Xiaomi overtook Samsung to take the top spot in Europe, with 12.7 million phones shipped in Q2, up 67.1 percent year-on-year. Samsung’s shipments fell 7 percent in that same period to 12 million units, though the Korean company remains the world’s biggest phone vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGCRE1"&gt;Overall smartphone shipments in Europe increased in 2021 thanks to post-COVID recovery, say Strategy Analytics’ researchers, with Apple also showing decent growth. The iPhone maker was up 15.7 percent compared to 2021 thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596120/apple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;strong interest in the iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smartphone shipment figures for Europe in the second quarter of 2021. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMvtvW"&gt;Xiaomi’s focus on value, though, seems to have helped broaden its appeal in Europe. “Xiaomi has seen great success in Russia, Ukraine, Spain and Italy among others and found customers eager for its Mi and Redmi series of feature rich, value smartphones,” said Boris Metodiev, associate director at Strategy Analytics, in a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210802005339/en/Strategy-Analytics-Xiaomi-Captures-Top-Position-in-European-Smartphone-Shipments-for-the-First-Time-in-Q2-2021-%C2%A0"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlUdGv"&gt;Xiaomi’s growth has also been assisted by the demise of Huawei, which continues to vacate the European market after its phones lost access to Android and Google services in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qs7Yqd"&gt;In one of our recent reviews of Xiaomi’s hardware, looking at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;the company’s flagship Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;, we were impressed by the phone’s value. “It costs less than the $799 Galaxy S21 in markets where it’s sold, but in many ways, it has more in common with the $1,199 S21 Ultra,” noted  reviewer Sam Byford. “My biggest takeaway from the Mi 11 is that Samsung is lucky Xiaomi doesn’t sell phones in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLbsyh"&gt;Perhaps, buoyed by its success in Europe, Xiaomi will now be considering a US invasion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will give you a whole $10 for your palm print</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uhuU4G-YwxcEAtJ7TTX9iAnDyNc=/103x0:1218x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69670735/amazon_one_palm_print.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon One identifies unique patterns in your palm to confirm payments in Amazon stores. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5X5L15"&gt;Amazon is offering $10 in credit if you enroll your biometric data in the company’s palm print recognition system, Amazon One. The promotion, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;says people must connect their palm print to their Amazon account to claim the reward, though it’s not clear exactly where it’s available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZyqLB"&gt;Amazon launched Amazon One in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493094/amazon-one-palm-recognition-hand-payments-amazon-go-store"&gt;September last year&lt;/a&gt;, presenting it as an easy way to pay in the company’s stores, as well as a future identity service to be used by other venues and businesses. Users simply position their hand over the company’s scanners, which recognize their unique palm print based on its patterns of lines, ridges, and veins. This information can be used to verify payments in stores, but also in lieu of entrance tickets and the like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vq9n0v"&gt;Amazon One is currently available in 50 US locations, including Whole Food stores and Amazon Go shops. In &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-one-continues-expansion-now-available-as-a-contactless-payment-option-at-initial-whole-foods-market-store-in-seattle"&gt;April&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon said “thousands” of customers have enrolled in the service, though the company did not respond to a request for comment about this promotion. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xjockeZL5OqFY4W_pdVtSOfG4Z0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757992/amazon_store_palm_prints_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/" target="_blank"&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Amazon One promotion&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7xpg71"&gt;The retailing giant presents Amazon One as a “fast, convenient, contactless way for people to use their palm to enter, identify, and pay.” But critics say the technology is unnecessary, with similar benefits provided by contactless payment cards, and a potential security risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPtyUp"&gt;“The advantage [of your palm print] is that it’s on you all the time, this isn’t something you can lose, but that’s also a disadvantage because you can never change it,” security researcher and University of Oxford academic Reuben Binns &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496673/amazon-one-palm-reading-vein-recognition-payments-identity-verification"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;. “You can never change your palm like you change your password or other identification tokens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KC7QK"&gt;Many have expressed concerns about a company like Amazon in particular collecting such data. The firm has been criticized in the past for pushing new technology in uncomfortable ways: selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287101/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police-ban-one-year-ai-racial-bias"&gt;biased facial recognition algorithms&lt;/a&gt; and aggressively expanding its &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvg48d/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ring-amazons-surveillance-camera-company"&gt;network of police-connected home surveillance cameras&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KADp3N"&gt;It’s clear also that Amazon wants other businesses to use Amazon One as an identity service. This would potentially allow Amazon to track people around a greater variety of physical venues — not just shops, but office buildings, stadiums, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
