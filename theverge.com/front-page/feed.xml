    <title>Apple’s latest AirPods are selling for just $140 at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5TrE5Uxh3_92cAbphTpiq9WQOFg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70258564/IMG_0044.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m_9003484103508200907J9So2B"&gt;Things have chilled out considerably this week, both in terms of how cold it has become in parts of the US and how few deals there are compared to the hectic Black Friday and Cyber Monday extravaganza. However, that’s not to say there aren’t some fantastic offers happening both in-store and online. We’ll be keeping a close eye on deals in the next few weeks to make sure you get what you’re looking for ahead of the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bF0hQ1"&gt;Alright, let’s get to the deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="pfojO4"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1BGXAl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Save $40 on the third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="U9bNqV"&gt;I can’t remember the last time an Apple product was discounted so swiftly. That’s what is happening to the third-gen AirPods, which debuted at $179, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but are now just $139.99&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon (the correct price will reflect at checkout). While they resemble the AirPods Pro with their shorter stems, the latest AirPods lack active noise cancellation, and they rest in your ear instead of fitting snugly via the Pro’s included silicon tips. Those differences may not matter to some people, and if you’re one of those people, check out this deal before it expires. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="UQ7j2j"&gt;While its bigger, more powerful $499.99 Xbox Series X sibling is tough to find, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08G9J44ZN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $299.99 Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt; is comparatively bountiful. At the time of publishing, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08G9J44ZN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling stock for the MSRP price&lt;/a&gt;, and for Prime members, you’ll have a shot at getting &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09H73LTM6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the special edition console for $299.99&lt;/a&gt; that includes in-game currency for both &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xmC4Qw"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="v4LyXM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals121121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fomen-by-hp-laptop-16-c0035nr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP’s powerful 16-inch Omen gaming laptop is a bargain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pvk6SZ"&gt;Presumably for a limited time, HP is offering a fairly capable configuration of its Omen 16 gaming laptop &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals121121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fomen-by-hp-laptop-16-c0035nr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $1,304.99&lt;/a&gt; when you use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;WINTER10 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout (h/t &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15492136-hp-omen-16-c0035nr-16-1-fhd-144hz-ryzen-7-5800h-rtx-3070-16gb-ddr4-512gb-pcie-ssd-win11h-1304-99-f-s?src=popular_recombee"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The price is impressive when you consider what’s inside of this laptop. You’re getting a 16.1-inch FHD panel with a 144Hz refresh rate, AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800H processor, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB M.2 PCIe SSD, and most impressively, an RTX 3070 graphics chip with 115W of total graphics power. Most gaming laptops at this price range include the RTX 3060.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="QfuIGM"&gt;At Buydig, a reputable site that often gets the edge over other retailers by offering extended warranties or Visa gift cards with big-ticket purchases, you can buy a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FE90MS8PN00001&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F11%2F22827785%2Fapple-airpods-third-gen-wireless-earbuds-xbox-series-s-surface-pro-8-gaming-laptop-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new Surface Pro 8 bundle for just $999&lt;/a&gt;. It comes bundled with a Type Cover (usually $100) and an added one-year warranty, giving you two years total of coverage. The Surface Pro 8 on offer is the base configuration (usually $999), with an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, an upgradeable 128GB SSD, as well as a 120Hz refresh rate display. You’re getting about $300 worth of extras at no additional cost. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="m_9003484103508200907jOxh3U"&gt;If you have a PC or an Xbox, you can (and should) play &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; on the cheap with a Game Pass subscription. For new PC subscribers, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeDeals121121&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%2Fpc-game-pass" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Game Pass costs just $1&lt;/a&gt; for the first three months of service ($9.99 per month after that) and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeDeals121121&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%3FlaunchStore%3DCFQ7TTC0KHS0%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate costs $1&lt;/a&gt; for the first month (costing $14.99 monthly afterward). Whichever one you choose, that’s plenty of time to play through the campaign, and to see if its multiplayer component digs its talons into your brain, making you just a little addicted (I’m totally not speaking from personal experience. Nope, not at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFboGb"&gt;Of course, you don’t need Game Pass to play &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. You can pay $60 for the game... or on second though, just get Game Pass. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; campaign review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wtuMus"&gt;Logitech’s stellar G435 wireless gaming headset is $10 off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="m_9003484103508200907XmwQuJ"&gt;$79.99 is a reasonable price to pay for a comfortable, good-sounding wireless headset that offers both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connectivity. I’m describing the Logitech G435 Lightspeed, a headset that I liked so much I chose it as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;my favorite wireless headset in our buying guide&lt;/a&gt;. Today, however, you can save $10 on it at a number of retailers, including &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLogitech-G435-LIGHTSPEED-Bluetooth-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-Lightweight-over-ear-headphones-built-in-mics-18h-battery-compatible-Dolby-Atmos-PC-PS4-PS%2F377935551&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals121121" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G435-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B08R8DT7X6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cga548BGiR3?u1=vergedeals121121" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $69.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite’s creators say your wildest stunts are part of the series’ DNA</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9x0XedIxINewcjz94GQOfsIcVlA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70258273/Screen_Shot_2021_12_09_at_3.51.34_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTuber “Mint Blitz” found a way to soar through the air in &lt;/em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK8beuE0-d0" target="_blank"&gt;Mint Blitz on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Xnbut"&gt;On Monday, a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MintBlitz/status/1467839509291167744"&gt;jaw-dropping &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; video&lt;/a&gt; kept showing up on my Twitter feed that looked like something out of a &lt;em&gt;Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; speedrun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCYKUr"&gt;The video, from Australian YouTuber “Mint Blitz,” begins with Master Chief armed with a massive hammer behind a Warthog vehicle. In an impressive sequence taking place over a matter of seconds, Mint Blitz swings the hammer to send the Warthog flying while almost simultaneously using Master Chief’s new grappling hook on the vehicle to slingshot himself into the air like Spider-Man. As he’s soaring high above Zeta Halo’s treetops, he uses the thruster powerup — and then, inexplicably, just keeps flying forward. After 39 seconds in the air, he finally lands, gracefully setting down on top of a tall tower that’s likely supposed to otherwise be inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J7vkya"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This Changes EVERYTHING &lt;a href="https://t.co/j3fIGw4oxA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/j3fIGw4oxA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mint Blitz (@MintBlitz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MintBlitz/status/1467839509291167744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0nxnZX"&gt;Mint Blitz is almost assuredly doing something &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; developer 343 Industries never specifically intended. I can’t imagine that players are supposed to be able to fly straight forward without falling for more than half a minute. But based on a conversation I had with 343 Industries, it seems like the studio is fine with letting players figure out how to do similarly outlandish stunts and doesn’t plan to patch those sorts of things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mP1eUQ"&gt;“It would actually have to be something that causes the game to lock up for us to be wanting to stop it,” 343 Industries associate creative director Paul Crocker tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I’d love it if someone managed to speedrun the game by using some crazy combination of mechanics to get there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYM4Id"&gt;“Unless it’s brick-blocking player progression or their ability to enjoy the game, we’ll fix it,” adds character director Stephen Dyck. “Those are the types of things we patch. Otherwise, we love seeing that kind of stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6mZZV"&gt;Dyck argues that pushing the boundaries is something that’s “part of &lt;em&gt;Halo’s&lt;/em&gt; DNA.” He gave an example of trying to squeeze a vehicle where you technically aren’t supposed to. “If the player wants to invest time and energy into doing that, and then ultimately they’re successful, and they get the vehicle where they technically weren’t supposed to? Awesome,” he says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jNO1UP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’re totally able to do that”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="keyGkN"&gt;Crocker shared the story of a time the development team spent two hours trying to get a Ghost (kind of an alien hovercraft speeder) into a certain building. “When they wrote up this huge bug [report] about, ‘I can get a Ghost in, we need to fix this,’ we went, ‘Nope. You’re totally able to do that,’” Crocker said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mLzGrf"&gt;Seeing the things players end up doing also inspires the team for things they make down the line, according to Dyck. “We’ll see interesting things that players are gravitating towards, and we’re like, ‘Cool, yeah, we’ll lean into that one.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkqU1e"&gt;Pushing worlds to their limits can give games extended lives. People are still actively &lt;a href="https://www.speedrun.com/botw#Any"&gt;shaving time off &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild &lt;/em&gt;speedruns&lt;/a&gt; more than four and a half years after its original release, for example. And &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; fans have already shown they’re a persistent bunch, having spent seven years trying to get &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-reach-players-spent-seven-years-trying-to-get-into-1823356029"&gt;into a cutscene room in &lt;em&gt;Halo: Reach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGyVZb"&gt;343 Industries hasn’t said what’s next for &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; campaign, so we don’t know how the next chapter on Zeta Halo may unfold. But while we’re waiting for what’s to come, I’m looking forward to seeing whatever tricks top Mint Blitz’s epic flight across the map — and it seems like 343 will be, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch as Blue Origin plans to launch its first crew of six to space, with Michael Strahan on board</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/npkEyZ3FZPeE0PGcB_soFTKl_70=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70258084/blueorigin_ns19_barntour_l_2_1639079187.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4it0ZE"&gt;This morning, Jeff Bezos’ spaceflight company Blue Origin is slated to launch another crew of customers to the edge of space and back. The crew cabin will be a little more crowded than usual: a total of six passengers will ride to space inside Blue Origin’s New Shepard tourist rocket, the largest group the company has ever sent up on one flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3kOps"&gt;That makes this flight a bit unusual. The launch also comes after an FAA investigation into the safety of Blue Origin’s rockets came to an inconclusive resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iM4Rtd"&gt;On board are a mixture of celebrity guests and paying spaceflight enthusiasts. Notably, Michael Strahan, a host for &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/em&gt; and former NFL rusher for the New York Giants, will be flying, along with Laura Shepard Churchley, the eldest daughter of Alan Shepard, who was the first American in space. Both are considered guests, so they did not pay for their seats. Flying with them are paying customers: Evan Dick, an investor, Lane Bess, the founder of Bess Ventures, and Bess’ son Cameron Bess. Dylan Taylor, a major investor in the spaceflight industry, will round out the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I73rNt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’ll be interesting to see how a crew of six fares&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jJu1NC"&gt;This will be Blue Origin’s third time launching people to the edge of space from the company’s test facility in Van Horn, Texas. For all three of these missions, Blue Origin has made sure to have some kind of star on board. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;The company’s first crewed mission carried Bezos&lt;/a&gt;, as well as legendary female aviator Wally Funk, while the second flight notably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724058/blue-origin-william-shatner-new-shepard-flight-success"&gt;carried William Shatner&lt;/a&gt;, best known for playing Captain James T. Kirk on &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;. For those first two tourist flights, however, Blue Origin only flew crews of four. Videos from inside the crew cabin showed that the interior &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpiBhOQrtPo"&gt;got somewhat crowded&lt;/a&gt;, even with such small complements of people. It’ll be interesting to see how a crew of six fares, which is the maximum number of people the capsule is supposed to hold.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XFgFOx"&gt;The flight comes just after the Federal Aviation Administration confirms that it closed an investigation into Blue Origin’s safety culture without finding any substantial issues. The FAA, which is responsible for issuing licenses for commercial rocket launches, started looking into the company in early October &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702335/jeff-bezos-employees-essay-blue-origin-toxic-workplace"&gt;after 21 current and former employees at Blue Origin published an essay&lt;/a&gt; alleging a culture of rampant sexual harassment and safety concerns with the company’s rockets. The essay, penned by former Blue Origin head of employee communications Alexandra Abrams, argued that employees are too scared to speak about safety violations over fears of retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUWIGw"&gt;“In the opinion of an engineer who has signed on to this essay, ‘Blue Origin has been lucky that nothing has happened so far,’” the essay stated. “Many of this essay’s authors say they would not fly on a Blue Origin vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="iHV91c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the FAA found “no specific safety issues” after investigating allegations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0hyVpJ"&gt;When the essay came out, the FAA said it was “reviewing the information.” However, as CNN &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/10/tech/blue-origin-safety-review-whistleblower-scn/index.html"&gt;first reported on Friday&lt;/a&gt; and the FAA confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; its investigation is now over. Steven Kulm, a public affairs specialist at the FAA, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the FAA found “no specific safety issues” after investigating allegations made against the company’s human spaceflight program. When asked for comment, Linda Mills, the vice president for communications at Blue Origin, said, “The FAA statement is accurate.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRwGHO"&gt;However, in an email obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, FAA representatives explained to Abrams that the agency was unable to conduct a thorough investigation because no additional engineering or safety experts from Blue Origin came forward to discuss issues at the company that were raised in Abrams’ letter. The emails show that FAA investigators put the burden on Abrams to convince her former colleagues to speak up. Abrams passed along key information to the investigators, including email exchanges between Blue Origin employees detailing concerns over capsule recovery operations and a memo crafted by a departing employee about safety concerns. She also got nearly three people to provide written statements, but the individuals ultimately backed out over fears of their identities being disclosed, Abrams tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. In an email to Abrams, the FAA noted that those who came forward could not be guaranteed protection because there are no statutes in place to protect whistleblowers at space companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xt4wes"&gt;A copy of the FAA’s email to Abrams, sent on December 6th, is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vjrHXW"&gt;It has been several weeks since our last contact with you and although we know you did everything possible to try and persuade members of your group to come forward, no technical experts have reached out to us or provided any specific documentation regarding the safety allegations. We understand that there are no federal “whistleblower protection” statutes protecting employees of commercial space companies from retaliation resulting from reporting safety issues. This is in stark contrast to the extensive protections available to commercial aviation industry whistleblowers. We believe this was an enormous factor in our inability to pursue this investigation further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSPEBZ"&gt;Following a thorough review of the limited information provided, multiple discussions with you, and consulting the applicable law and regulations, the FAA could not investigate this matter in depth, and thus, could not substantiate the safety concerns described in the document you provided. No further actions can be recommended at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4Lp2xt"&gt;Currently, the commercial space industry benefits from little federal oversight regarding safety, thanks to something called the&lt;a href="https://www.theregreview.org/2015/12/31/rathz-space-commerce-regulation/"&gt; US Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act passed in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The law prohibits the FAA or other federal agencies from placing safety regulations on the commercial space industry until 2023. The impetus for the law was to allow a space industry that’s still in its infancy to continue to grow and innovate without “burdensome” regulations. That means when the FAA issues launch licenses, it is only responsible for making sure that a rocket launch will not harm uninvolved people or property on the ground. The agency cannot dictate rules for how commercial space companies should make their vehicles or operations safer. &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-ends-commercial-space-astronaut-wings-program-will-recognize-individuals-reaching"&gt;Commercial space tourists fly through “informed consent&lt;/a&gt;,” meaning they agree that the trip they are taking is inherently dangerous and risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4hTr6"&gt;After the original essay was published in October, the company stood by its culture. “Blue Origin has no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind. We provide numerous avenues for employees, including a 24/7 anonymous hotline, and will promptly investigate any new claims of misconduct,” a Blue Origin spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymMSD1"&gt;To get passengers to the edge of space and back, Blue Origin relies on its New Shepard rocket, a reusable vehicle designed to launch upright from Earth and then land upright back on the ground again. Passengers ride on top of the vehicle inside a crew cabin with reclined seats and large windows. Once the rocket reaches a certain altitude, the cabin separates from the top of the rocket and enters space, allowing the riders to experience a few moments of weightlessness. Both the capsule and the rocket return to Earth; the rocket lands upright, while the capsule touches down gently using parachutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLIh5U"&gt;Typically, New Shepard reaches an altitude of roughly 62 miles up when it flies, which most consider to be above the boundary to space. When today’s passengers return to Earth, all of them should be awarded commercial astronaut wings by the FAA. These wings have historically been given to people who fly above 50 miles on a commercial spacecraft. However, &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-ends-commercial-space-astronaut-wings-program-will-recognize-individuals-reaching"&gt;the FAA announced this week that it will be ending this practice&lt;/a&gt; by the end of the year and will merely list all future commercial tourists and flyers who reach space on the agency’s website. That means this crew may be the last ones to ever get the wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msNQ9L"&gt;Today’s New Shepard launch is slated for takeoff this morning at 9:45AM ET out of Blue Origin’s launch site in Van Horn. Blue Origin plans to begin live coverage 90 minutes ahead of launch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG C1 OLED vs. Samsung Odyssey Neo G9: the perfect monitor doesn’t exist</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Still searching for endgame&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PiA5Kg"&gt;I hate leaving unfinished business, but that’s what I did on November 27th of last year. I ended my review of the most ridiculous, most advanced PC monitor ever made — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;the 49-inch Samsung Odyssey G9&lt;/a&gt; — by wondering out loud whether a similarly sized OLED television might actually be better. That question has been burning in my skull for many, many months, but I’m happy to say I finally have an answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ubv9Bo"&gt;This September, I took delivery of&lt;em&gt; both&lt;/em&gt; LG’s latest 48-inch C1 OLED television &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Samsung’s upgraded 49-inch Odyssey Neo G9, with its Mini-LED backlit screen that attempts to rival OLED for deep blacks and adds explosive brightness. I’ve used them back to back ever since, swapping again and again between the latest and greatest gigantic gaming monitors and between work and play. I used them all day, every day, jotting down notes about every frustration and all the joy I experienced with these monster screens just a foot or two from my face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFFXTO"&gt;It was &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m not sure I’m ready to go back to the comparatively puny 27-inch screen I actually own. But the funny thing is, my answer is neither. Neither of these screens is my PC monitor endgame. And I wasn’t even sad to see one of them go home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="qTXJTG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10912306"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="vqQbGB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10912324"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XpCuv8"&gt;First, the basics. Why a monitor versus a TV? Well, for a staggering $2,499, the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is arguably the most feature-packed gaming monitor ever made — and yet LG’s $1,299 48-inch OLED TV meets or beats it in most ways that matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p80In8"&gt;For instance, the Samsung has a tremendous 5120 x 1440-pixel resolution panel that stretches out across your entire field of view, practically letting you bathe in games or tasks. But the sheer size of LG’s 48-inch 3840 x 2160 panel &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; fills your view at what’s technically a higher resolution (8.3M pixels vs. 7.4M pixels). It’s just that the corners of LG’s screen are a bit farther away from your face because it’s not curved like Samsung. (I have more to say about that later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lALtVF"&gt;Both monitors have a similar footprint on a desk, too, at 45.3 inches wide for the Odyssey G9 and 42.2 inches wide for the 48-inch LG, but it feels like the LG provides &lt;em&gt;so much more &lt;/em&gt;screen in exchange. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7"&gt;We’ve long made fun of small 16:9 laptop screens&lt;/a&gt; for being too short for productivity, but LG’s 24-inch-tall slab of pixels is far, far past the point where that’s an issue. Every time I swapped out the Neo G9 for the LG C1 (or vice versa), I had to ask myself why I would pay twice as much for a screen with the top and bottom chopped off when both fit fine on my &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fbekant-desk-white-s19006323%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F11%2F22815110%2Flg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;47-inch Ikea Bekant desk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="ji6bxQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10913432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwyFFm"&gt;And while the Samsung monitor does reach twice the refresh rate at 240Hz, compared to 120Hz for the LG, highly technical review sites &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/monitor/tools/compare/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-vs-lg-48-c1-oled/23186/24625?usage=3623&amp;amp;threshold=0.10#comparison_1425"&gt;like Rtings&lt;/a&gt; will tell you the LG is actually better when it comes to response time and blur (which is what we actually care about when we care about refresh rate). For variable refresh rate, both support Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium or Premium Pro, and the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;HDMI 2.1 with VRR&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox Series X and (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383288/sony-ps5-update-hdr-options-120hz-pc-monitor-support-features"&gt;eventually&lt;/a&gt;) the PS5 as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yc6Pq"&gt;Wondering if a TV might guzzle more electricity than a dedicated monitor? It’s a fair question, but you might be surprised. Playing through the same exact section of &lt;em&gt;Deathloop &lt;/em&gt;with HDR, I averaged 68Wh per hour with the 48-inch LG, compared to 89Wh per hour with the Samsung Neo. When I added desktop apps, it was a bit closer: the LG consumed 85Wh per hour, while the Samsung drank 91Wh per hour on average. That’s with power saving settings turned off on the LG — and I’d recommend you do that right away because it’s &lt;em&gt;really dim&lt;/em&gt; out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NCnDP"&gt;Despite all this, it’s not necessarily that simple to swap your traditional monitor for&lt;em&gt; either&lt;/em&gt; of these gigantic panels. Let’s talk gaming, productivity, and lastly, we’ll spend a few words chatting about your desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_LpdibYivgwgMPj379oza7cqp0w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23040338/shollister_211124_4893_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ve never played until you’ve seen the gorgeous colors OLED can bring out in a game like Genshin Impact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8mHlaV"&gt;Gaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7Jc5vm"&gt;I’m not going to rehash &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;my entire Samsung Odyssey G9 review&lt;/a&gt;, where I included 14 full-bleed images to show you what gaming is like on a 32:9 screen, but I’ll give you the TL;DR version here: super-ultrawide gaming is wonderful but &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;. Playing on the Odyssey G9 and Neo G9 is incredibly immersive, but it’s also literally warped in a way I don’t always find pleasant because game developers never adopted &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/p6NbyEmPalA"&gt;multi-projection&lt;/a&gt; in their games. And in the year since that review, nothing’s changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lzynZ"&gt;I played a new bunch of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer, dove through all of &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, and played through the entire &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; campaign swapping between the Odyssey Neo G9 and the LG C1 48. While all three of these games have perfectly adequate 32:9 support, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410863/microsoft-halo-infinite-pc-32-9-ultrawide-lan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; even marketed it as a feature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;all of them have that stunted-and-zoomed look on the left and right sides of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h2YRxdLJMkWq3xrD5NnOe4zGt7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925723/HaloInfinite_2021_10_02_14_56_13_996.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We had high hopes &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410863/microsoft-halo-infinite-pc-32-9-ultrawide-lan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;for Halo Infinite’s 32:9 monitor support&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. It looks neat, but I’m afraid the edges are pretty distorted.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V4lB7Iry3RqRBZWvQkyahB9LvS4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079879/Screenshot__40_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;2D games, like Duck Game, look great at 32:9. So do some 3D games; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;see my original review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVCAkY"&gt;I don’t always hate it. But I would never, ever choose to play them on the Odyssey Neo G9 &lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; of LG’s 48-inch gaming television, where every game &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt; looks fantastic because they’re designed for 16:9 to begin with. It’s just as immersive, if not more so, given that you’ve got more screen and fewer distracting warped edges in view. And it doesn’t help Samsung that its monitor has some extremely strange results displaying HDR and 240Hz content, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gcSR3"&gt;Like I said, the LG set already punches harder than its Hz would suggest when it comes to busting blur, but the Samsung Neo G9 also appears to have weird problems with its 240Hz mode, most prominently that it will display visible horizontal lines across portions of the display, ones that are most visible on gradients, bright colors, or when the panel’s full-array local dimming gets particularly dark or bright all of a sudden. A big, splashy, story-critical explosion in &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; was ruined for me when horizontal lines cut through what would otherwise have been an extremely impressive burst of flame — the kind of thing that the Neo’s peak brightness of 2000 nits makes so bright you might swear you can feel the heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zh2jDx"&gt;Here’s a video example of what the horizontal lines look like when the screen gets dim: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T3KbVE"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Samsung Odyssey G9 Neo 240Hz scanlines?|105191" data-volume-uuid="dc3b32ff8" data-volume-id="105191" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-263" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rqpn2x"&gt;And I’m far from the only one who’s seen this issue — or the issues with HDR in general, where the Neo G9 shipped with HDR support that can charitably be described as “broken” and has only reached “partially acceptable” after months of firmware updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iBnHp"&gt;Originally, turning on HDR mode would wash out the colors of your entire Windows desktop, though that’s now fixed. But even after the latest firmware update (which you have to &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgbabJ1u2jy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;download on a PC&lt;/a&gt;, then apply directly to the monitor with a thumb drive after removing any USB peripherals from the monitor’s USB ports), some of the dark shadowy regions of &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; look green and &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; looks like it’s being flooded by the headlights of a car. Tweaking luminance and color helped some, but the best result I could muster was still &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; shy of the fantastic results LG gave me without tweaking at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTVoW0"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Hardware Unboxed&lt;/em&gt; deserves serious credit &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T7pogOgS_M" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for pushing Samsung on these problems&lt;/a&gt;, going through multiple review units and feeding Samsung data, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUbJ8u5NVgE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Techtesters&lt;/em&gt; recently testified&lt;/a&gt; they’d gone through three different review units as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXAHeM"&gt;It’s wild because last year’s Odyssey G9 also suffered from some quality control issues around its 240Hz mode (which didn’t work with some graphics cards out of the gate) and poor local dimming, and we figured a Neo G9 (at twice the price!) would solve both. But while the new Mini-LED full array local dimming provides those fantastic deep blacks around, say, the borders of a movie you’re watching, we aren’t seeing that in games where we definitely should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbQXdy"&gt;At 120Hz or 144Hz without HDR, the Odyssey Neo G9 was fairly satisfactory, not unlike the vanilla Odyssey G9 I tested last year. But that original G9 is also over $1,000 less expensive — and so is LG’s set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div id="cGONMF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10913611"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ic2ZCl"&gt;Productivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="786TOP"&gt;And yet, if you plan to get &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; done on your new gigantic screen, I can’t wholeheartedly recommend an LG TV, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ea98C7"&gt;People ask me two questions: “Aren’t you worried about burn-in?” “Don’t you get headaches sitting two feet away from the TV?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLFtjP"&gt;The answer is that LG gives me my &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; of headache: I can get a literal headache because LG’s overzealous burn-in protections make the screen so dim it can lead to serious eyestrain, or I can spend my time worrying about that burn-in by turning some of those protections off in a hidden service menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeQdb8"&gt;In general, I am not worried about burn-in, the phenomenon where OLED subpixels (which have organic chemical compounds that emit their own light) can wear unevenly over time, creating ghostly images that stick around. Numerous OLED burn-in tests have shown that it can take thousands upon thousands of hours to see permanent retention even if you leave static content up on the screen. That’s because LG has built in a wide array of protections, including shifting around the pixels every so often, dimming logos and icons that don’t move, and dimming the entire screen if it doesn’t move enough or gets too bright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLs6WX"&gt;That last example can be weird in practice: if you expand a bright white web browser page (like the one you’re reading) from a window to fullscreen, you can watch the entire screen dim to a paper white instead. But I learned to live with that pretty quickly and maybe even prefer it to the sometimes-searing whites of the Samsung, particularly when Windows is set to HDR mode. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s how much I can fit on screen at my typical 125-percent scaling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mMlLD7"&gt;No, It’s the Temporal Peak Luminance Control (TPC), also sometimes called the Automatic Static Brightness Limiter, that sets my eyeballs on fire. I might be typing in a document or scrolling down a webpage, but the majority of the windows on my vast desktop aren’t moving, so the LG TV will &lt;em&gt;ever so slowly&lt;/em&gt; dip the entire brightness of the screen, so slowly I don’t even notice until the eyestrain creeps up on me. It’s about as dim as my laptop gets on the lowest setting, even if I’m using it in a bright room. I’ve tried everything to stop it, including various picture modes, reducing the TV’s brightness and even the individual OLED pixel brightness, but the only thing that stopped it was &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/MKJ39170828-Replacement-Service-Remote-Control/dp/B075M91STG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buying a special remote control designed for troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt; and turning off “TPC” in the service menu. (Tap “In Start,” then type in 0413.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WC6WPd"&gt;No more headaches, but at what cost? I might have just voided this TV’s warranty, and I’ve started to see minor image retention after each day of use. (If I check a neutral gray image, I can sometimes see “seams” where the windows used to be.) So far, they’re always gone the next morning, likely thanks to LG’s automatic &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fca_en%2Ftvs%2Foled-tvs%2Foled-reliability%2Fmain.jsp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F11%2F22815110%2Flg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“pixel refresher,”&lt;/a&gt; but I’m still worried I may be aging the TV prematurely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lp2LUs"&gt;Even if it weren’t for the brightness woes, I might still prefer the 32:9 Samsung monitor for multitasking, and it’s all thanks to that curve. Like I said in my original Odyssey G9 review, you can fit an astonishing amount on screen with the equivalent of two 27-inch monitors at your command, and the monitor’s unique 1000R curve puts it all at the same distance from your face at a crisp angular resolution. But with the 48-inch LG, text was uncomfortably small and / or pixelated unless I both pushed the TV back to two feet from my face &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; ran Windows at 125 percent scaling for an effective resolution of 3072 x 1680 rather than 3840 x 2160. While I’ve been comfortable working that way for weeks, it’s simply not as much screen real estate as Samsung gives you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s G9 let you fit some things beneath the wings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SNXheG"&gt;What still separates a TV from a monitor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FxZAh8"&gt;I hope it’s clear by now that these screens are an &lt;em&gt;investment&lt;/em&gt;, not just in money but in physical space. I’m lucky to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725010/ncase-m1-pc-case-sff-small-form-factor-discontinued" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a particularly compact Mini-ITX tower&lt;/a&gt; as my gaming rig because even it barely fits behind the Samsung on my desk and only works with the LG because it’s &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; small it can piggyback on the TV’s stand. With the LG, I also needed to awkwardly loop my keyboard cable around the left or right of that stand (because there’s no cable management or even a groove). My Ikea desk is small enough I actually have to place my speakers &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt; the TV and make sure nothing (not even my water bottle) stands between me and the TV to avoid blocking my view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="f53Act"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10913533"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3jDDOv"&gt;I’m getting used to it, but even a simpler four-legged stand &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Built-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED48A1PUA/dp/B092LZNZB7?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22135602%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;like the one LG ships with its cheaper LG A1&lt;/a&gt; would make things a good bit easier. Maybe don’t buy that one for PC gaming, though; it tops out at 60Hz. I could put my PC on the floor and clean it often, I suppose, or drill a wall stud and find a mount strong enough to hold up a 42-pound TV or a 32-pound monitor, but that’s not an option for every buyer. (They both technically work with VESA monitor arms if you have one strong enough; the Neo G9 has a 100x100 pattern with M4 screws, the C1 48 is 300x200 with M6 screws instead.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzTYap"&gt;You may want to find room for LG’s TV remote, too, because there’s no nub to easily navigate an on-screen display with the LG, just a single button under the manufacturer logo to turn it on and off and cycle through inputs. Meanwhile, the Samsung not only has serious cable management and easy OSD navigation but also an adjustable stand, a built-in USB 3 hub, and a remarkably capable picture-by-picture mode that lets you connect two computers or a computer and a modern game console simultaneously. They can each run at 120Hz on their own virtual 27-inch screens, and it comes with three programmable buttons to swap between entire sets of user-customized settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MxXlH"&gt;I’m a little sad that neither the LG nor Samsung is ready to claim the title of the ultimate PC monitor because we’re tantalizingly close. Samsung needs quality control and maybe partnerships to reboot &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/p6NbyEmPalA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;multi-projection game development&lt;/a&gt;; LG’s gotta build a burn-in protection algorithm that doesn’t make me want to claw my eyes out. Having these gigantic screens on my desk feels like the future, and I badly want both companies to do a lot more focused testing with gamers to perfect their products for us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="s6YwVI"&gt;I have high hopes for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640058/lg-42-inch-oled-tv-panel-delayed-ces-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s upcoming 42-inch OLED TV&lt;/a&gt;, but I wonder if it’s time for the company to build a true OLED PC gaming monitor as well. Maybe it could even take a page from Samsung and make it a super curved screen; I hear great things about &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Floc38bn95cw.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeLGvSamsungOdysseyReview121021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s 38-inch 3840 x 1600 curved ultrawide&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s pricey and not OLED. I suppose the great GPU shortage means there’s time for these companies to figure it out: I used an RTX 3080 to competently drive these screens’ 7 or 8 million pixels across the latest games, and that kind of card will likely be in short supply &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;throughout 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVKYyb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Matrix Awakens didn’t blow my mind, but it convinced me next-gen gaming is nigh</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VDDyLpwvqm3ORnGl7e7-1IdJ1qw=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70257765/51737478995_0f7258ab4a_h.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="78LTEL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens &lt;/em&gt;single-handedly proves next-gen graphics are within reach of Sony and Microsoft’s new game consoles. It’s unlike any tech demo you’ve ever tried before. When we said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791886/ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-consoles-games-delays-supply-shorage"&gt;the next generation of gaming didn’t actually arrive with Xbox Series X and PS5&lt;/a&gt;, this is the kind of push that has the potential to turn that around. And it’s free to download on those consoles right now, so you should really give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJKS8C"&gt;Just don’t expect it to make you question your reality — &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley"&gt;the uncanny valley&lt;/a&gt; is still alive and well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HltST04LKMsO83IPAYnu394_qlA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080419/51737478995_0f7258ab4a_h.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0IhTxL"&gt;I jacked into &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens &lt;/em&gt;today after watching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22825102/keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss-interview-matrix-awakens-epic-games"&gt;our exclusive interview with Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss&lt;/a&gt; — they play Neo and Trinity, I’m sure you know — and hearing breathless praise around its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22815755/the-game-awards-2021-trailers-news-announcements"&gt;Game Awards&lt;/a&gt; debut. At first, I was wowed by how realistic Keanu Reeves looks off the bat, but if you watch closely (in the demo or video atop this post), you’ll see that the character models get &lt;em&gt;less and less&lt;/em&gt; impressive as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CmFSYEzl7zg2aBOR87wsDPuOQow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080572/matrix_faces.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kNGvBG"&gt;We go from a veritable doppelganger of Reeves that must have been at least partially real-life footage, to uncanny valley puppetry (what robot is wearing Keanu’s skin?) to cutscene-quality video game avatars, to finally just fairly average video game characters roaming around a world with no particular purpose. From a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22821377/digital-human-as-a-service-kddi-mawari"&gt;“digital humans”&lt;/a&gt; perspective, the illusion breaks pretty quick. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FTMx1zERm9SUJhpTrIna2e8jgc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080576/matrix_faces_3.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting a little more uncanny...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nTotVA"&gt;It honestly reminds me a bit of the original &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt;, where Cloud, Tifa, Barrett and Aerith might look quite different depending on whether you were playing a battle, watching a cutscene, or traversing the world — because even though developer Square could produce state-of-the-art graphics, there weren’t resources to give everything the same level of polish. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n5F-PMzBEaUQlHR5aHSGWNBV8ts=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080454/51737478955_267a693f0b_h.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bUvTOI"&gt;But from a “is it time for photorealistic video game cities?” perspective, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens &lt;/em&gt;is seriously convincing. It’s head-and-shoulders above the most photorealistic video game cities we’ve seen so far, including those in the &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs&lt;/em&gt; series. Going back to look at &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfQvu9f6ig"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdbtOKQ1iLo"&gt;those games&lt;/a&gt;, even the most recent ones that added real-time raytracing, their cities look game-like by comparison. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dG0TsZ8CkeGXm6nSHMcoea8VMEo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080565/matrix_city_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4HVAmW"&gt;Despite glitches and an occasionally choppy framerate, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awaken&lt;/em&gt;s &lt;em&gt;city &lt;/em&gt;feels more real, thanks to&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Unreal Engine’s incredible global illumination and real-time raytracing (“The entire world is lit by only the sun, sky and emissive materials on meshes,” claims Epic), the detail of the procedurally generated buildings, and how dense it all is in terms of cars and foot traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ylKXDi3y0yidKyVhV-_ZaCnhb2o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080563/matrix_city.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AkEzVT"&gt;And the most convincing part is that it’s not just a scripted sequence running in real-time on your PS5 or Xbox like practically every other tech demo you’ve seen — you get to run, drive, and fly through it, manipulate the angle of the sun, turn on filters, and dive into a full photo mode, as soon as the scripted and on-rails shooter parts of the demo are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9Z88Lb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10914137"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aFbaNH"&gt;Not that there’s a lot to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens &lt;/em&gt;except finding different ways to take in the view. You can’t land on buildings, there’s no car chases except for the scripted one, no bullets to dodge. You can crash any one of the game’s 38,146 drivable cars into any of the other cars or walls, I guess. I did a bunch of that before I got bored, though, just taking in the world. Here are some other impressive stats from the game from Epic’s press release (via &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-the-matrix-ue5-demo-is-incredible"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/12/09/epic-games-shows-off-unreal-engine-5-realism-with-stunning-the-matrix-awakens-demo/amp/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xyRyTK"&gt;The city is 4.138 km wide and 4.968 km long, slightly larger than the size of downtown Los Angeles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lDL6k2"&gt;The city surface is 15.79 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6gWqcn"&gt;The city perimeter is 14.519 km long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lOv5tT"&gt;There are 260 km of roads in the city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KhhnSV"&gt;There are 512 km of sidewalk in the city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mdd8UT"&gt;There are 1,248 intersections in the city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8epQKt"&gt;There are 45,073 parked cars, of which 38,146 are drivable and destructible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TPvgMe"&gt;There are 17,000 simulated traffic vehicles on the road that are destructible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ExVQ3D"&gt;7,000 buildings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="x53nkn"&gt;27,848 lamp posts on the street side only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qDVpE9"&gt;12,422 sewer holes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wJqqMr"&gt;Almost 10 million unique and duplicated assets were created to make the city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nAH4GN"&gt;The entire world is lit by only the sun, sky and emissive materials on meshes. No light sources were placed for the tens of thousands of street lights and headlights. In night mode, nearly all lighting comes from the millions of emissive building windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EvU8Il"&gt;35,000 simulated MetaHuman pedestrians&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Yfj66J"&gt;Average polygon count? 7000k buildings made of 1000s of assets and each asset could be up to millions of polygons so we have several billions of polygons to make up just the buildings of the city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="kWY5Qj"&gt;Epic Games’ pitch is that Unreal Engine 5 developers can do this or better with its ready-made tools at their disposal, and I can’t wait to see them try. Not that photorealistic games are &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; my favorites, but I’ll take all the immersion I can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZpDfV"&gt;It would sure be nice to finally have a good game based on &lt;em&gt;The Matrix, &lt;/em&gt;too, hint-hint-wink-wink. If there’s a good script, it sure sounds like Keanu and Carrie-Anne might be up for it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="a0RPkf"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Unreal_Engine_5_Keanu|104877" data-volume-uuid="4900396db" data-volume-id="104877" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-492" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oGZcJt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The city would be 4.138 km wide, not 4,138 km wide. Sorry for the typo!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 5 (left), Echo Show 8 (middle), and the Echo Show (right).&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fR5pJ"&gt;When it comes to smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of voice-enabled Echo devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. Maybe you want to add Alexa to a spare bedroom, for example, or you’re looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your lighting or other smart home devices. Regardless of the reason, this is one of the best times of the year to pick up an Echo device, even if Black and Cyber Monday are behind us. Below, we’ve curated a list of some of the very best Amazon Echo deals available right now, from the last-gen Echo Dot to Amazon’s latest Echo Show 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="868HqZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Kindle deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21539047/best-amazon-kindle-deals"},{"title":"The best smart displays for every home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="qblixW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10913993"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;The best Echo Dot deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry: Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;third-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape and is currently on sale for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot/dp/B07FZ8S74R/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$19.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BDRU5"&gt;We’ve recently seen the latest Echo Dot drop to an all-time low of $29.99, which is the smart speaker’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;current price at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is also selling a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; that showcases the time, weather, and other information for an additional $15 more, bringing the price to $34.99. Note, however, that both the base model and the LED-equipped variant are available 25 percent off at Amazon when you trade in select devices. Both can also be picked up with a Sengled smart bulb at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7P5bD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, are also offering the fourth-gen Dot for $29.99, with the latter retailer taking $10 off if you buy two — meaning you’d pay $50 instead of $60 for a pair. Best Buy, however, will also throw in a four-month trial to SiriusXM Streaming Platinum in addition to a Sengled smart bulb with each purchase. The same promotions apply to the fourth-gen Dot with the built-in LED display, which is available at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-clock-and-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795704%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYzQMDs5Oi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $34.99, the full retail price. The only difference is that Best Buy is not currently offering $10 off when you purchase two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EVsfiu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;The best Echo Dot Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt; is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;The Kids Edition is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $34.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, 42 percent off the original list price. However, the retail giant is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling a discounted bundle for $49.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $89.98, which includes an Echo Dot Kids Edition and an Echo Glow. If you prefer a different retailer, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502549%26clkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgbfjoL52Lr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are also selling the Kids Edition for $34.99, the latter with a four-month trial to SiriusXM Streaming Platinum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VgQp2M"&gt;The best Amazon Echo deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; also received a makeover this year. Like the aforementioned fourth-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. That said, it also touts a built-in smart home hub and produces better sound, thanks to a pair of 0.8-inch tweeters and a 3-inch woofer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdAa8S"&gt;We’ve seen the Echo drop to as low as $60 during shopping events like Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday before. Thankfully, it’s still available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747624046492524210" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo--4th-gen----smart-home-hub-with-alexa---charcoal%2F-%2FA-80770246%2F%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; right now for $59.99, its lowest price to date. Like with the fourth-gen Dot, you can also get a free Sengled smart bulb with your purchase at either Amazon or Best Buy, and Amazon is offering a 25 percent discount when you trade in select devices. Best Buy is additionally including four months of SiriusXM Streaming Platinum with each purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;The best Amazon Echo Studio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $199.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon also offers a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0939S1B5R/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Billie Eilish Limited Edition Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; with the singer’s image pasted on the side for $229.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D411Fi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ccs5nU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="oiVOWB"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for a compact Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is the Echo device to consider. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest edition&lt;/a&gt;, which launched in June, features an always-on microphone, an upgraded 2MP camera, a 5.5-inch display, and a physical shutter, allowing you to block the camera’s view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8jLZ5"&gt;The latest Echo Show 5 is currently available for $44.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAzhE7JLdJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KJN3333/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, an all-time low and $35 cheaper than the first-gen model is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Sandstone/dp/B07HZJ64WD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently selling for at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. You can also pick up a Blink Mini for $5 more through either retailer, which is a nice discount on the basic, 1080p security camera. Like with other Echo devices, Amazon will take 25 percent off either configuration if you trade in an eligible device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mVseNr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609475"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FiYkkx"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JGaEAZ"&gt;The Echo Dot isn’t the only Echo device with a kid-friendly design. The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition offers all of the same features as the standard, second-gen Echo Show 5, only with a vibrant print on the rear and a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which grants your family access to a trove of videos, games, and other kid-friendly content. It even comes with a two-year warranty, providing a bit of protection from whatever your child might (literally) throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1db3Rn"&gt;The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition is available for $45 off ($49.99) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMSC4WZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740551130085982176" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers. If you’re looking for add-ons, you can also pick up an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09345FQWY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $64.98 (normally $114.98) or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093462JMH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt; for $64.99 (normally $124.98) through Amazon. Once more, Amazon is also offering a 25 percent discount on each model and bundle if you trade in certain devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DwZKlk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O97UD3"&gt;The best Echo Show 8 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Like the Echo Show 5, the Echo Show 8 is available in two distinct models, both of which feature 8-inch displays and dual speakers. However, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with a 13MP camera and some unique software tricks, one of which grants it the ability to keep the subject centered in the frame as they move around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNLpG4"&gt;When pitted against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Home Hub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, their closest competitors in terms of price and functionality, both iterations of the Echo Show 8 are better options for a few reasons: they feature slightly larger displays, better speakers, and cameras that allow you to use them as video chatting devices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; the Echo Show 8 to be better than other devices in Amazon’s current smart display lineup, which is why we think it’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best smart display&lt;/a&gt; for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;As far as deals go, the first-gen Show 8 is currently available for $59.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and there are a few discounted bundles available for a few dollars more. For $64.99, for instance, you can pick up a first-gen Echo Show 8 and a Blink Mini security camera at either &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $75.98 instead of $130.98, or with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DDXMXFT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;portable battery for $109.98&lt;/a&gt; instead of $159.98. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovLiAu"&gt;The second-gen Echo Show 8 is currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084DCJKSL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCe6zrQP2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $94.99, nearly matching the smart display’s best price to date. Like the last-gen model, it’s also available in a bundle at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZN82HH7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCe6zrQP2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; that contains a Blink Mini for $99.99 instead of $164.99, or with an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0914YLN4D/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;adjustable stand for $116.98&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DDZPDB9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;portable base for $144.98&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon. If you purchase through Amazon, the 25 percent trade-in discount is also applicable to all generations of the Echo Show 8 as well as the bundles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YdQbrX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="NkSBNy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10611942"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QJ2PFl"&gt;The best Echo Show 10 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-gen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. The device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and, unlike the Show 5 and Show 8, the 2021 model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It’s also mounted on a motorized, swiveling base that allows the display to follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;We’ve seen the latest Echo Show 10 get discounted to as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now. But if you still want to pick it up, you can get it for its usual $249.99 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SQ2F8D2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is also offering a discounted bundle, which includes an Echo Show 10 and a Blink Mini for $259.99 instead of $284.98. Again, trading in select devices at Amazon can net you 25 percent off on the Echo Show 10 and all aforementioned bundles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bA0Mnl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10362085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="Qe3Eto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Qus6Ft"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Adam Mosseri explains how Instagram is bringing back the chronological feed </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DnTyFwFKcndsmxadjRIgK0vb864=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70257519/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The return of a proper feed could come soon.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e6M4Fl"&gt;Instagram head Adam Mosseri used his story to answer people’s questions about the company’s plan to bring back the much-missed chronological feed, which he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22824609/instagram-chronological-feed-adam-mosseri"&gt;promised during his appearance at a Senate hearing&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. In a Q&amp;amp;A on Friday, he said that the company is testing out two versions of the feature and that it’s “targeting early next year” as a release window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wEfws"&gt;One version of the chronological feed would let you “pick your favorites and they show up at the top in chronological order,” he said. The other would let you see the posts from everyone you’re following in chronological order, though he didn't mention how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/27/16823118/instagram-recommended-posts-feature-roll-out-now-android-ios"&gt;recommended posts&lt;/a&gt; would be interspersed.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instagram wants to release the feature “early next year.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mMfZLp"&gt;When a follow-up question asked Mosseri when the feature would show up, he said it wouldn’t be too long, and that Instagram is “already testing the favorites idea.” He said that “full chronological” mode would come shortly after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7EWFNc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We want to be clear that we’re creating new options — providing people with more choices so they can decide what works best for them — not switching everyone back to a chronological feed. You can expect more on this early next year!&lt;/p&gt;— Instagram Comms (@InstagramComms) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/InstagramComms/status/1468707111135764491?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LwdS20"&gt;Reiterating a tweet from Instagram on Wednesday, Mosseri makes it clear that the company isn’t ditching its algorithmic feed to revert back to one that’s in order, and that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722879/twitter-switch-reverse-chronological-latest-feed-test"&gt;like Twitter&lt;/a&gt; where you can choose which version you’d like. “We’re not moving away from ranking altogether. We’re going to give people the option to go to a chronological version of feed,” he said. “But at a high level, we believe that ranking helps us connect people with the content that matters to them most.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTptv2"&gt;In his Q&amp;amp;A (which you can view in full below), Mosseri also answered questions about Instagram’s plans for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22821955/instagram-parental-controls-teenage-safety-features-take-a-break-nudge"&gt;its upcoming parental control feature&lt;/a&gt;, as well as his time at the Senate.

    <title>Apple’s concessions in China reportedly include a secret $275 billion deal and one odd change in Maps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="China Development Forum (CDF) 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-g6pMQeaQtsPNtqxMwj3xHnbY0=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70257237/937560290.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook attends China Development Forum (CDF) 2018&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Visual China Group via Getty Images/Visual China Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uuy4e9"&gt;Tim Cook has pushed Apple’s value within close range of $3 trillion, and a lot of that has to do with the former operations lead’s ability to manage a relationship with China, where many of its products are made and, increasingly, many of them are sold. A report this week from &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; relies on unnamed sources and internal documents to peel back some of the details about Apple’s ties with China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="tTir7D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A 1,250-word MOU between Apple and China’s National Development and Reform Commission reportedly runs for five years and accounted for $275 billion in spending&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w1kBY4"&gt;That includes a request Apple reportedly received in 2014 or 2015 about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senkaku_Islands"&gt;a small group of uninhabited islands&lt;/a&gt; that China and Japan apparently have a dispute over in terms of who owns them. Going by either the Senkaku Islands or the Diaoyu Islands, depending on which side of the argument you’re taking, they inspired a request from China to members of the Maps team to make them appear larger, even when viewers are zoomed out on the map. According to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;, not only did Apple eventually make the change, but even today, for viewers using its map from within China, the islands are still shown at a larger scale than the territories around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Satellite views of the Senkaku Islands" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYck_ik3Kilhuzno12VIIj354wg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080195/588404986.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by USGS/NASA Landsat/Orbital Horizon/Gallo Images/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A satellite image of the Senkaku Islands located in the East of China on April 01, 2016 in Japan. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cVgQYI"&gt;The report also details disputes over everything from iTunes and iCloud to Apple Pay. The figure that looms over everything is a 1,250-word memorandum of understanding that &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; says Tim Cook signed during a publicized trip to China in 2016. The way it’s laid out, Cook went to China because of repeated regulatory actions affecting Apple’s business. By signing a five-year agreement (with an option to extend to a sixth year) promising investments, business deals, and training in China, worth an estimated $275 billion, the aim was to avoid further disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hj5SPP"&gt;And as &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; has confirmed from its sources, that seems to have mostly held true. The report points out &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-becomes-largest-smartphone-brand-china-october-2021/"&gt;data from the analysts at Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt; who said that in October, Apple became the largest smartphone brand in China, a title it hadn’t held in six years. Meanwhile, Apple has built new R&amp;amp;D centers in the country and started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17587304/apple-icloud-china-user-data-state-run-telecom-privacy-security"&gt;storing iCloud data for Chinese users there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWxick"&gt;However, that relationship also has downsides, with critics &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18020508/how-china-complicates-apples-chest-thumping-about-privacy"&gt;questioning the company’s commitment to privacy&lt;/a&gt; — its Private Relay feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523871/china-private-relay-regulatory-reasons-not-launching-great-firewall-internet-censorship"&gt;will not be available in China&lt;/a&gt; — and business dealings with companies accused of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428899/apple-suppliers-china-uyghur-forced-labor-report"&gt;links to Uyghur forced labor&lt;/a&gt;. That’s before we mention the other visible concessions that harken back to that decision about the disputed islands, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632029/apple-engraving-filter-censorship-keyword-china-hong-kong-taiwan"&gt;the numbers Apple won’t let you engrave on an iPad in China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728257/apple-quran-majeed-app-removed-china"&gt;takedowns of certain apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFqi7c"&gt;After the report surfaced, the &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3159087/apples-reported-us275-billion-china-investment-questioned-state-media"&gt;&lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports (via &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/12/09/chinese-media-downplaying-apples-reported-275b-deal-with-the-country"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that a state-run tabloid in China referred to it as “McCarthyism,” claiming it was an attack “clearly driven by the ‘political correctness’ of Sinophobia.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sDw2s8nxtbi_zO0noojtecgfitM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/akrales_190408_3351_0016.7.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fourth-gen Kindle might not be Amazon’s latest e-reader, but it’s down to just $55 right now.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZCNr8"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UeWxe"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products, which is why we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price in those instances. Additionally, while newer models like the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite are currently only available for full price, the retailer also offers 20 percent off all of its Kindles when you trade in select devices, so there are still other ways to save money when none of the models are available at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="U51BKy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="r36wrm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;Kindle (10th-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $89.99. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, the latest base Kindle features a slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy a 10th-gen Kindle with lock screen ads for $54.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VT322X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1221005/2092?subId1=VergeBestKindleDeals121021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-8gb-now-with-a-built-in-front-light-8211-black%2F-%2FA-79804909%2F"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxG6j9qO2d" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $35 off the original MSRP. If you want one without ads, you can grab it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$74.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy either Kindle model at Amazon, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $84.97 ($50 off its usual price) at Amazon; it includes an ad-supported Kindle in either black or white, one of three printed covers, and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $109.99 ($20 more than the base Kindle at standard MSRP). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids Plus service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost. Right now it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746224890339507137" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $109.99, the full retail price, though we did see it drop to $60 last month during Black Friday and Cyber Month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="0EetaF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (2021)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="deHMlR"&gt;Amazon’s latest Kindle Paperwhite is its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684801/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-features-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11th-gen model&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with USB-C support, longer battery life, and a larger, 6.8-inch display. Given just how recently the new e-reader launched, however, we haven’t seen a ton of discounts yet. Thankfully, you can still pick up the last-gen model, which is frequently available for far less than the standard retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkwzBt"&gt;The 2021 Kindle Paperwhite comes in three main configurations: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KTZ8249/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB model with ads for $139.99&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N38WQSH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB without ads for $159.99&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B495319/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Signature Edition for $189.99&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is identical to the standard Paperwhite, except it also features Qi wireless charging and a sensor that will automatically adjust the backlight when needed. Amazon has also rolled out a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WPB8PW9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite Kids Edition for $159.99&lt;/a&gt;, which comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a year of Amazon Kids Plus, much like the aforementioned Kindle Kids Edition. All 2021 models are also similar to the 2018 model in that they feature a waterproof design and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrLCU1"&gt;Currently, both the ad-supported and ad-free configurations of the base Kindle Paperwhite are only available from Amazon starting at $139.99, their full retail price. The 32GB, ad-free Signature Edition is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FNY4RRP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available as part of a discounted bundle for $249.97&lt;/a&gt;, however, which also includes a “cork” cover and a wireless charging dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEYFbp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10765216"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="S8bhtR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10913659"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iorwh0"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (2018)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;While there currently are no price breaks on the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite — save for the 20 percent off you can get with an eligible trade-in — Best Buy has lowered the price of the last-gen model. Currently, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxHjGSDlV6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;retailer is offering the 8GB Kindle Paperwhite&lt;/a&gt; with ad support for $89.99, a cool $40 off the original list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;If you don’t mind paying for a leather case and a power adapter, Amazon is also currently discounting its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084LN58ZH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader with ads for $159.97&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084LMT23Z/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB reader with ads for $189.97&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a fan of Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy, Amazon also offers a bundle that includes a Kindle Paperwhite, a power adapter, and a Mockingjay-emblazoned cover. It’s currently available in two ad-supported configurations and colors: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB version for $159.97&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $189.97&lt;/a&gt;, both of which save you $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, 7-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. However, unlike previous models, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we’ve seen the 8GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $174.99, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $249.99 at Amazon and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $249.99 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $269.99&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $279.99 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$299.99 without&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal list price, too. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RSVGLKV/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported configuration for as low as $279.97&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RW2K1MD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $309.97&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus pulls buggy OxygenOS 12 update</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HA9atD"&gt;OnePlus released the Android 12-based OxygenOS 12 to the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro this week, but the company has already pulled it following reports of bugs and issues from users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOxakL"&gt;“We are aware of the issues caused by the OxygenOS 12 update and our software team is fixing them,” OnePlus said &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/oneplus-is-pulling-its-oxygenos-12-update-for-the-op-9-and-9-pro/"&gt;in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We will suspend this software update and roll out a new iteration as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AS0CyB"&gt;The release has been widely panned. &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; called it &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/oxygen-os12-oneplus-9-awful/"&gt;“just awful,”&lt;/a&gt; highlighting the need to toggle settings to get the 120Hz display to work again and that some menus “straight-up crash” as examples of issues. &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; agreed: “For a so-called ‘stable’ release, OxygenOS 12 is riddled with bugs and issues that honestly make it very hard to suggest that you update and install on your eligible OnePlus phone,” the &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/10/oxygenos-12-review-unsettling-ui-alterations-video/"&gt;publication said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; even put out a PSA recommending that you &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/factory-reset-oneplus-9-series-improve-experience-oxygenos-12/"&gt;factory reset your OnePlus 9 or 9 Pro&lt;/a&gt; to try to improve things — which, as &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; noted, isn’t something you should need to do after a software update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZSiYCD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not that you should ever have to do this, but I factory reset my OnePlus 9 Pro just now after updating to Android 12. It is so, so, so much better. This is much more usable. &lt;a href="https://t.co/b7lXxieJHn"&gt;https://t.co/b7lXxieJHn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Conway (@AdamConwayIE) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AdamConwayIE/status/1468912672049618948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C7KqKD"&gt;It’s apparently not just OnePlus that has had a rough rollout of an Android 12-based OS. Samsung’s Android 12-based One UI 4 began rolling out to the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3 this week, but it is &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-android-12-problems-issues-update-postponed/"&gt;reportedly quite buggy&lt;/a&gt;. Google’s own Pixel phones haven’t been squeaky clean, either, as users have reported &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pixel-6-connectivity-issues/"&gt;connectivity issues&lt;/a&gt; seemingly caused by a bug in Android 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MngGJH"&gt;It’s unclear when OnePlus’ revised OxygenOS 12 update will hit. &lt;/p&gt;
