    <title>Google will make it easier to separate your work and personal life on Android </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQOaz-2RhlEiAcYAhYOncCmPSjg=/78x0:1362x856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026346/Screen_Shot_2021_10_20_at_2.25.01_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vWQON"&gt;Google’s Work Profile tool for Android, which lets you hide your work apps and data with the flip of a switch and keeps your personal phone use safe from your company, will be coming to more users next year. According to a blog post from the company, currently, the feature is limited to phones that your organization manages, but Google says it’ll start to become available to people using Google Workspace in 2022. After that, it’ll branch out with the ultimate goal of letting anyone using Android for work flip a switch to make their business apps disappear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJfnme"&gt;The ability to turn off work, especially when many of us are working remotely, is sorely needed. My colleague Monica Chin recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22671697/personal-laptop-work-security-privacy"&gt;wrote a great argument&lt;/a&gt; for why you should have a personal laptop and a work laptop that you can close at the end of the day (and that doesn’t expose your business to your company). It’s nice to see Google making its software equivalent of that available to more people because while having two phones really cements the work / life walls, it’s just not practical for most (and could honestly be a bit of a headache).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6ECdmo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lqwoXmaxs3M?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=69&amp;amp;start=69" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GbXXIX"&gt;Google also says that it’s working with identity and single sign-on providers Ping, Okta (choice of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s IT department), and Forgerock to improve security when users access their company’s content. The company wants to have users authenticate in its Custom Tabs system, rather than a WebView, making &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs/"&gt;the experience faster for employees&lt;/a&gt; and allowing providers like Okta to access more of the phone’s security information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nzgoQ"&gt;Google’s focus on security, which includes pushing the Android Management API that comes with &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/enterprise/recommended/requirements/"&gt;Android’s recommended requirements&lt;/a&gt; set by default and lets enterprises get new features quickly, isn’t just talk, either. It’s also launched a bug bounty specifically for Android Enterprise, which will pay up to $250,000 if you’re able to find a major vulnerability on Pixel devices running Google’s business-focused software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evaIbS"&gt;The focus on security, combined with the other improvements we’ve covered, makes it seem like Google’s focusing on making Android more suitable for the future where many of us work remotely — an especially relevant focus for the company, which is planning on (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650639/google-mandatory-return-january-2022-remote-work"&gt;eventually&lt;/a&gt;) implementing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422518/google-hybrid-work-office-remote-work-sundar-pichai-memo-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;a hybrid work system for its own employees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google lowers Play Store fees for subscriptions and music streaming apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2eHIgJEzxbCPY3isq0hfR3ZY7Ag=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026351/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sGWkFg"&gt;As regulatory pressure on the Play Store for Android increases, Google is once again making changes to its business structure. It has announced that more categories of apps will be eligible to pay significantly less than the usual 30 percent fee. The company is announcing that all subscription-based apps will now pay a fee of 15 percent. It’s also says that “ebooks and on-demand music streaming services” will be “eligible” for a fee “as low as 10%.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6rhMj"&gt;Google’s stated reason for the cheaper prices on ebooks and music streaming apps is that “content costs account for the majority of sales” and that the rates “recognize industry economics of media content verticals.” It’s unstated but also surely true that regulatory pressure and public pressure from companies like Spotify have factored in to Google’s decision. Currently, signing up for a Spotify subscription on Android redirects you to Spotify’s website to enter your payment information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbMLST"&gt;The lower fee structure for music streaming is still at Google’s discretion, both for which apps are eligible and how low that fee will be. When asked how exactly developers can know if they qualify for the reduced fees, a Google spokesperson said, “Developers can review program guidelines and express interest now and we’ll follow up with more information if they are eligible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Re4Ccw"&gt;As for subscriptions, Google’s previous structure was similar to Apple’s: 30 percent the first year, 15 percent thereafter. The new change simplifies that by offering 15 percent right off the bat and is likely a strong incentive for developers to switch over from one-time payments to subscriptions. Google says that one reason for the change is that “we’ve heard that customer churn makes it challenging for subscription businesses to benefit from that reduced rate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YEvhp7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google is feeling the regulatory heat&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Osen9"&gt;Google already has a program wherein the first million dollars a developer earns through Google require a 15 percent cut, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;instituted in March 2021&lt;/a&gt;. And since so many apps are ad-based and therefore free, the company claims that 99 percent of developers “qualify for a service fee of 15% or less.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlI13M"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;South Korea recently ruled&lt;/a&gt; that Google must allow third party payments in its Google Play ecosystem and Google has said that it would comply. In an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last week&lt;/a&gt;, CEO Sundar Pichai spoke to the importance of Google Play revenue to the overall Android business model for Google (emphasis ours below):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NPH6Eb"&gt;We don’t take a share of the device sales, not a share of the carrier revenues. So in some way we have to sustain our ecosystem. We have a different model. Google Play is an important way. &lt;strong&gt;In fact, it’s the main source of revenue&lt;/strong&gt;. It supports Android as a whole. I think we’ll make that viewpoint clear, but we’ll engage in conversations. I’ll leave it to the team to figure out the right next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBiUXV"&gt;One big source of revenue is in-app payments for games. On that front, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;Google is in a legal battle with Epic Games over &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is not available in the Google Play store (but can be side-loaded through a relatively onerous process). Google is also facing a lawsuit filed by a coalition of 36 state attorneys general over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;antitrust concerns with the Google Play store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAXwR7"&gt;Add it all up and it’s obvious that Google is doing what it can to set up release valves for all that pressure by reducing store fees where it feels it can. Google lined up positive quotes from both Bumble and Duolingo in support of its lower subscription fees, a message surely aimed at regulators. And the company is likely to continue to bring out developers who aren’t angry at the Play Store business model at its &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/events/dev-summit"&gt;developer summit next week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxgBDa"&gt;We asked Google to comment if these changes were in response to regulatory pressure, and a spokesperson replied, “Google has a long history of evolving Android and Play’s model based on feedback from our developer ecosystem on what they need to be successful on Play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxAYiz"&gt;Still, it isn’t going to bring &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; back to the Play Store (since it won’t qualify) and it’s far from clear that the lower fees are going to appease regulators anywhere. The pressure on Google and Apple to lower their app store fees is already having an effect. Despite these changes, it still seems that the pressure will lead to actual legal action — either via the courts or Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter bought a messaging app to help make DMs and Communities better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZxBNWeejnJIBBxJQpW4WgRw9Au4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026299/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1Ssgqa"&gt;In an effort to strengthen its Communities, Twitter has acquired Sphere, a group chat app founded in 2016 that aims to make conversations more interactive and organized. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but &lt;a href="https://www.sphere.me/"&gt;Sphere’s website&lt;/a&gt; describes the app as a place that “transforms groups into vibrant communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XsP8Y"&gt;Sphere was co-founded in 2016 by &lt;a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/nick-daloisio"&gt;Nick D’Aloisio, a British computer programmer turned serial entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, it was an app for real-time questions and answers but later evolved into a hub for group chats (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/twitter-buys-nick-daloisios-free-chat-app-sphere-.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;). During Sphere’s standalone existence, it aimed to bring organization to group conversations on mobile. As shown on Sphere’s website, some of its features included self-clearing feeds, auto-archiving, and call-outs for important messages. It also let users hold interactive conversations categorized by specific interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmM0Of"&gt;The Sphere acquisition marks the second startup that D’Aloisio has sold; in 2013, when he was 17, D’Aloisio sold his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/1/3583720/summly-nick-d-aloisio"&gt;news summarizer startup Summly&lt;/a&gt; to Yahoo for $30 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdlwSR"&gt;All employees on Sphere’s small 20-member team will be joining Twitter, according to &lt;a href="https://blog.sphere.me/sphere-has-joined-twitter-e7127cfe0467"&gt;Sphere’s blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Nick Caldwell, Twitter’s vice president of engineering, tweeted that Sphere will be helping Twitter tackle Communities, DMS, and Creators roadmaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dtB4NB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Sphere team’s expertise and leadership’s passion for finding ways to help people connect will help accelerate our Communities, DM, and Creators roadmaps.  &lt;/p&gt;— Nick Caldwell   ‍ ⚡️ (@nickcald) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nickcald/status/1450854466127683588?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5x45jA"&gt;It’ll be especially interesting to see Sphere’s impact on Twitter’s invitation-only Communities, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661649/twitter-releases-communities-facebook-groups-reddit-competitor"&gt;the feature it launched in September to compete with Facebook Groups&lt;/a&gt;. Communities let users join spaces for specific interests, such as for sneaker collectors or for skincare lovers. Although Communities are invite-only for now, Sphere may be able to help speed up the process and make the feature become available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpm30M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Critics and supporters come out in force to discuss SpaceX’s plans to launch from South Texas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bgdRM0Q5BFsaT_lN1mrTOYRA7oo=/0x0:3840x2560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026268/51370391111_a43a3825e5_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX stacking its Starship spacecraft on top of a Super Heavy booster at the company’s launch site in Boca Chica, Texas.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cLINNc"&gt;This week, a vibrant mixture of supporters and critics voiced their opinions about SpaceX’s launch operations in Boca Chica, Texas during virtual town halls — input that will be considered as the government decides the company’s future in the state. More than one hundred people took the time to give their thoughts during the meetings on Monday and Wednesday, with opinions ranging from effusive praise of the company to concerns over SpaceX’s impact on the region’s communities and environment. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcxSBL"&gt;The lengthy town halls were &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship/"&gt;hosted by the Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently evaluating whether to give SpaceX a license to launch the company’s massive new Starship rocket out of Boca Chica. SpaceX has been building and testing Starship prototypes at its launch facility in Boca Chica for the last four years now, but the company wants permission to launch the vehicle into orbit from the area. Such operations require a license from the FAA in order to ensure that orbital launches won’t harm nearby people or property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qT1hD5"&gt;As part of the licensing process, the FAA conducted an environmental review to assess what kind of effects SpaceX’s launches will have on the area. The agency released its findings in what is known as a &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship/media/Draft_PEA_for_SpaceX_Starship_Super_Heavy_at_Boca_Chica.pdf"&gt;Draft Programmatic Environmental Assessment&lt;/a&gt;, or PEA, &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/faa-releases-draft-environmental-report-on-spacex-starship-orbital-launches/"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;. That release sparked the beginning of a comment period that has been extended until November 1st, where members of the public can give their thoughts on the PEA and bring up any possible issues the FAA might have missed. While the FAA accepts comments in writing, the agency also hosted the town halls this week so that people could give their opinions orally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X6ATs4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I would just like to say that SpaceX is doing an amazing job in Texas.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zgc5Ue"&gt;SpaceX fans attended the meetings to show their support for the company’s efforts. A common theme among the supporters was that while they did not live in Texas or near Boca Chica, they wished to see SpaceX continue working and launching from the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCfgap"&gt;“I don’t live near Texas, I have no stake in this currently,” one commenter said. “But I would just like to say that SpaceX is doing an amazing job in Texas, and that I would like to see this process move a bit faster.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3qdBrLK4bqzQ5alJLdfCAEoN0_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944727/FCA6oFSWUAEWC5Q.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rendering of the proposed launch site provided during the FAA meeting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LlLBwD"&gt;“I’m a Georgia resident not representing any organization or special interest group,” another commenter said. “I’m speaking on behalf of my personal capacity as an enthusiastic supporter of SpaceX and a supporter of the human enterprise to push mankind’s boundary beyond Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eoUjWO"&gt;Some fans of the company argued that SpaceX is bringing jobs and economic growth to Brownsville, the city next to Boca Chica, but most talked about being inspired by the company and their belief&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that Starship work must continue so that humanity can become a “multi-planet species” — a common term used by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. SpaceX’s Starship system has yet to carry passengers or reach orbit, but the company hopes to fly people on the vehicle to Mars someday. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;SpaceX also holds a contract with NASA&lt;/a&gt; to develop Starship as a lunar lander that can take astronauts to the surface of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="oajSE6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re not considering us.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VvjyQE"&gt;Some who identified as residents in the area also expressed support. “I love you, SpaceX and I love you, Elon Musk, too,” one person who recently moved to the area said during her statement. Another woman living in the area noted that she “slowly but surely have watched a rocket rise from the dunes of the beach and it’s been an honor and a privilege to be able to see something magical created out of this world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbDnny"&gt;However, plenty of nearby residents were adamantly opposed to SpaceX’s plans. Common complaints revolved around access to the nearby beach. Roads are frequently closed in Boca Chica to accommodate major testing and test launches. “They’re not considering us,” a resident said. “My personal experience having to want to go to the beach and the road is always closed, where they have promised that we will not be affected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t7SzpX"&gt;Others denounced the debris that has fallen on the ground during major test failures. One test launch in March &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358060/spacex-starship-prototype-fail-landing-texas"&gt;ended in an explosion that sprayed chunks of metal and rocket parts&lt;/a&gt; across the terrain surrounding the Boca Chica launch site. Apart from that, noise and rumblings from successful launch tests were also a big point of contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gan6fm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t know how you can say that the noise is in any way acceptable.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eEROSb"&gt;“With these smaller rockets, I don’t know how you can say that the noise is in any way acceptable or that the vibrations are in any way acceptable,” one resident argued. “My house shakes with little rockets, and it sounds like the rocket is coming right over my head. And when they lose these heavy rockets, you’re already seeing cracks and certain seismic issues having to do in South Padre Island.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HizDf3"&gt;Supporters had their own interpretations of the intense noise. “Regarding the sonic booms and the noises caused by SpaceX operations, they should be met with a consideration that the shaking of your chest is a positive thing, as SpaceX’s operations not only inspire hope in so many across this nation and the world [but are] propelling humanity on a course of togetherness and prosperity,” one supporter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGPIuw"&gt;Critics representing environmental groups joined the calls to express concerns about SpaceX construction and operations harming the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;surrounding wetlands and endangered species, including birds called plovers that nest&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the area. Others also worried about the vague nature of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;SpaceX’s plans to build a natural gas plant in the area to provide methane for the rockets; without details, they say the impacts of a plant are difficult to assess. In response, supporters argued that Cape Canaveral, Florida — home of the US’s busiest spaceport — also operates near a wildlife preserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7rhRO"&gt;A lot of critics demanded that the FAA conduct a second environmental impact statement, or EIS, &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/space/environmental/nepa_docs/spacex_texas_eis/"&gt;which the agency already did for SpaceX’s Boca Chica site in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. However, the FAA conducted that review when SpaceX originally planned to fly its smaller Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets from the area, with up to 12 planned commercial launches a year. Starship is substantially bigger than SpaceX’s other rockets and still has years of development ahead. The FAA says the company plans to fly Starship up to 20 times a year during flight tests in the early years of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yY44Kq"&gt;The FAA says it will weigh all comments equally, including the ones submitted in writing. After evaluating all of the feedback, the FAA will respond and incorporate them before publishing a final PEA sometime after the comment period closes on November 1st. The agency could release a “finding of no significant impact,” or FONSI, for SpaceX’s launch site, before continuing on with the launch licensing process. Or the FAA could decide to conduct another EIS, a choice that would certainly prolong SpaceX’s plans to conduct an orbital launch from Boca Chica as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NySyv3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eBfvQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer gaming peripherals are discounted at Best Buy and Amazon today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FYnGecbImsG5cINGQ3_1zU6F1vw=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026178/6384937cv18d.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer products offer a lot for those that love RGB accent lighting, with software to sync it all together.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rejspL"&gt;Best Buy’s deal of the day for today &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPOcS1owyb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;features a range of Razer products&lt;/a&gt; worth considering for any of your gaming or streaming needs, and Amazon is matching or beating some of these prices. If retailers are competing, you’re probably winning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a49Jgq"&gt;There are multiple options of keyboards and mice, as well as the top-range webcam from Razer and its compact microphone. For your mechanical keyboard fix, you can go big or small. If you prefer compact, you can pick between black or white versions of Razer’s Huntsman Mini 60-percent boards with clicky optical switches for just &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPOazpadJ7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$95 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Mini-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08BFF4C7J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$94 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. A small-format keyboard might be intimidating at first, with its omission of a number pad and F-keys, but it allows you to keep your hands closer together for a more ergonomic feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjT5n2"&gt;If a full-size board is more in your comfort zone, the larger BlackWidow V3 with Razer’s clicky green switches for that tactile and audible response is $100 — saving you $40 at both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPOjJq4uaA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08FQPLCNC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WiXzcI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361276"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="g5JFHe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10819458"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E7fsLi"&gt;Other notable Razer deals to consider today are its top-tier &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPOqPZrvBi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kiyo Pro webcam for $155&lt;/a&gt;, the Razer Basilisk Ultimate wireless mouse for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-Ultimate-HyperSpeed-Wireless/dp/B08564NLZG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$90 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, the more modest entry-level Basilisk X wireless mouse for just $35 at both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPOAdW3WZ7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-HyperSpeed-Wireless-Gaming/dp/B07YPBQSCK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and the Seiren Mini condenser microphone for just &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPODf4PLOE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$40 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is a very compact microphone that can be a gateway for getting started with streaming, pairing nicely with the Kiyo Pro for a one-two punch of audio and video. If you opt for the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPOEhcFa4I" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pink version of the Seiren Mini at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, it’s just $30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="19GKyw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730624"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Xs1mtM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10392735"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="887QVN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10819480"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lK00Wm"&gt;This massive 70-inch 4K Smart TV from Samsung is currently enjoying a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPsT1iGcFW" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 discount at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This voice-assistant enabled Smart TV is currently available for its lowest price ever, making it an excellent value for anyone looking for a larger-than-average HDR panel. The Tizen smart platform is compatible with most major streaming services, but this model does have a built-in USB port if you want to expand your channel selection with a Roku or other peripheral streaming device. This model features two HDMI inputs but doesn’t have any component inputs, however, this omission likely won’t affect you unless you’re using devices that are more than 10 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2t7kni"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10818003"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DTuYU0"&gt;The HP 15 laptop is an excellent option for anyone who needs a sensible, budget-friendly laptop. Best Buy is currently offering this model for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPsX3hjULG" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$400, the lowest price we’ve ever seen&lt;/a&gt; for this particular model. Its specs aren’t going to blow anyone out of the water, but it’s more than up to the task if you need to take work away from your desk. The HP 15 features a 15-inch 1080p screen powered by Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzJavs"&gt;A pair of USB-A ports for peripherals is backed up by an SDXC card slot, an HDMI output, and a single USB-C port. Just take note that the USB-C port is not Thunderbolt 4 compatible, however, so it won’t work with a Thunderbolt dock if you need the extra connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FCXEjP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10818010"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9RjQCP"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 7i 14 ultraportable touchscreen laptop is a great thin and light 2-in-1 for everyday computing needs or getting work done while traveling. Best Buy is currently offering it for $200 off until October 23rd, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPs1ilvrxd" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bringing the price down to just $750&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a great value for a laptop which is ready for commuting and fully compatible with a free Windows 11 upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="40TglV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10818016"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4bIwNh"&gt;If your home is struggling with your current wireless setup, you might benefit from an upgrade. Currently, at Best Buy you can grab this Netgear Nighthawk Wi-Fi 6 router for half off, bringing it down to just &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPs7Uo6AxV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150, its lowest price ever&lt;/a&gt;. Like most people, you’re probably spending top dollar on your ISP’s internet connection, but if you feel your download speeds are still having a hard time, you could probably benefit from a better router. The AX5200 offers transfer speeds up to 5,200MB/s over Wi-Fi and managing your security settings is made easy through the Nighthawk app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UU0Td3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10818030"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mvCJBp"&gt;Some deals to revisit or reconsider&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TbkN7T"&gt;We just featured the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 in yesterday’s roundup, but now &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergeGalaxyBuds2102121/https://www.woot.com/offers/samsung-galaxy-buds2-true-wireless-anc-earbuds-6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot also has them for even cheaper at just $100&lt;/a&gt;. This is a new all-time low for the noise-canceling wireless earbuds from Samsung, though note that this new offer comes with a 90-day warranty direct from Woot. If you prefer the full one-year warranty, the deal for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Wireless-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Lightweight/dp/B0942DM32W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$130 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is still going. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bSJTaD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815939"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rc0kVO"&gt;A similar deal across Amazon and Woot can be had on the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro. Woot has an international model with its own 90-day warranty &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergeGalaxyBudsPro102121/https://www.woot.com/offers/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-anc-wireless-earbuds-international-model-4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for only $115&lt;/a&gt;, while Amazon has the USA model, complete with a one-year warranty from Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $150&lt;/a&gt;. This is another nice choice of ANC earbuds if you prefer to have its IPX7 water and sweat resistance. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="I6OYiT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QSP8Ge"&gt;Lastly, the Sony WH-1000XM4 Bluetooth headphones are still on sale for the limited-time pricing of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$248 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. We don’t know how much longer this deal will stick around, but there’s a reason it has been one of our favorite over-ear wireless headphones. These headphones are comfy to wear and they offer great sound quality with active noise cancellation. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ROXXPk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uUUdlv"&gt;Come hang out with us at our 10-year anniversary party this weekend&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Apple still won’t mandate vaccines but will require employees to regularly take COVID-19 tests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VQrzhAXr3SfckiQIdgUZ7X-X4Gk=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026134/B2E53F34_14F4_4895_AECA_E72D86070E7C.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fcpkIi"&gt;Apple is tightening its COVID-19 policies, requiring that unvaccinated employees (or employees who refuse to disclose their vaccination status) get daily COVID-19 tests to enter its offices, although the company still has yet to require workers to get vaccinated. Vaccinated employees will also have to do regular tests, but only once a week, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/apple-will-force-unvaccinated-office-workers-to-get-tested-daily?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAC851"&gt;Retail workers at Apple Stores will also have to regularly test, although at a lower rate than other Apple employees: unvaccinated store workers will have to take tests twice per week, with vaccinated workers getting tested once a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ant7NO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google, Microsoft, and Facebook all require in-person employees to be vaccinated&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9uVSGn"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Apple has asked its employees to submit proof of vaccination by October 24th, ahead of the new testing requirements kicking in on November 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T634xv"&gt;And while the move does mark a slightly stronger push by Apple to get its employees vaccinated, it still falls short of actually requiring employees to get vaccinated. Apple is one of the largest major tech companies that hasn’t instituted a mandate yet, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598316/google-vaccination-requirement-return-offices-covid-19-delta-variant"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598818/facebook-vaccine-requirement-us-office-employees"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607690/microsoft-proof-vaccination-covid-19-us-buildings-office-reopening"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; all requiring that in-person employees be vaccinated against COVID-19 to enter their offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DInOFI"&gt;Apple’s new requirements also after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666508/biden-vaccine-mandate-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;President Joe Biden’s announcement of plans&lt;/a&gt; to establish new OSHA standards that would require companies with more than 100 employees (which Apple certainly falls under) to ensure employees either are vaccinated against COVID-19 or conducting weekly testing, something Apple’s new requirements would meet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s tiny electrical aircraft is almost ready for lift-off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Darx8gJE9AfX7uFRe5tBJU8yBaU=/0x1:1920x1281/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026061/Mod_2_motor_testing.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6vGojW"&gt;NASA’s first electric plane is getting ready for takeoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJXfnj"&gt;For the last five years, a small team of NASA engineers has been working to convert an Italian Tecnam P2006T aircraft so that it runs only on battery power. The X-57 Maxwell, named after 19th-century Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell, recently began &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/newsreleases/2021/21-01NR.html"&gt;high-voltage functional ground testing&lt;/a&gt; at the Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, Calif., and is set to take its inaugural flight in the spring of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3egI4"&gt;That flight, when it happens, will signal a crucial milestone for NASA, which has been tasked by President Joe Biden to &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/10/nasa-preparing-climate-change-space-infrastructure-michael-mann/"&gt;focus more of its resources&lt;/a&gt; on lessening the impact of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oOqEI"&gt;NASA Administrator Bill Nelson toured Armstrong last week, where he got an up-close look at the tiny two-seater aircraft. In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Nelson said that the technology that underpins the X-57 will be crucial in the effort to decarbonize the aviation industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mM3VHO"&gt;“They’re getting ready to fly this,” Nelson said. “And it is the first demonstrator of an all-electric [airplane].” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ext3iv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re getting ready to fly this”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zpnI9U"&gt;In concept form, the X-57 has a unique look. (&lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;called it &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/06/nasas-new-electric-plane-looks-goofy-packs-sweet-tech/"&gt;“goofy as hell”&lt;/a&gt; back in 2016.) The high-aspect-ratio wings are much skinnier than typical airplane wings, lined with 12 electric motors with propellers to help with lift and two larger engines at the end to aid cruising. When not in use, the 12 smaller motors fold in to help reduce drag. NASA expects the X-57 will have a range of roughly 100 miles and a cruise speed of 172 mph. It will also have a maximum flight time of approximately 40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tRHjF"&gt;But in reality, the motors have yet to be installed, and the X-57 still looks like a normal light aircraft that you might see at any airfield. Nelson said the prototype will soon “morph” into the image of the plane that NASA first revealed back in 2016. And from there, the team will build a hybrid version that can run on both electricity and gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiTkg6"&gt;“All of which has the purpose of lessening our reliance on fossil fuels, less pollution, and keeping the cost reasonable,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bRkFuxTdGamk9gDY1IgIFqKUDuA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944636/Mod_4_in_flight_concept_image.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The X-57 in concept form.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="szxe22"&gt;One of the main obstacles standing in the way of electric aviation is the weight of the battery. Energy density — the amount of energy stored in a battery — is the key metric, and today’s batteries don’t contain enough energy to get most planes off the ground &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;sustain flight beyond more than a few hundred miles. To weigh it out: jet fuel doles out about 43 times more energy than a battery that’s just as heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9xRkI"&gt;The X-57 requires about 800 pounds of battery for its research flights, said Sean Clark, principal investigator at Armstrong Flight Research Center. One of the innovations developed by the X-57 team was an installation pack that can absorb a failed battery cell after its energy is spent, which helps prevent the failure of an entire battery pack. This experimental installation pack is already being commercialized and used by NASA’s contractors. “You have to be prepared for failures,” Clark said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIraig"&gt;Most companies working on electric aircraft say their prototypes will be useful for short trips within a city, like from Lower Manhattan to JFK Airport. Nelson said these air taxis could prove useful in reducing the amount of surface congestion on urban roadways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N0cGGx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You have to be prepared for failures”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Il8VV9"&gt;“You could have short-hop aircraft ... between cities that are not far apart,” he said. “However, you could even have intracity in a large city like Los Angeles, going from one part of Los Angeles, taking passengers to another, and avoid having to get in the four o’clock traffic jam on the freeways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxSbKF"&gt;The aviation industry only produces about 2 percent of global carbon emissions. But the effort to remove the noise and pollution from flying is (pardon the pun) really taking off in a variety of ways. Figuring out how to swap jet fuel with heavy lithium-ion batteries has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/14/17686706/electric-airplane-flying-car-battery-weight-green-energy-travel"&gt;a huge sticking point&lt;/a&gt; — one that NASA’s team of scientists and engineers feel well suited to solve. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ATn-qkgQMLIaZH1JNOX8C0YTDHY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944638/AFRC2021_0128_43.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA/Joshua Fisher&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy in front of the X-57 Maxwell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nRNC2q"&gt;“Are we gonna be serious about trying to save the planet?” Nelson said. “There are a lot of other things that pollute a lot more, namely coal-fired electrical plants. But the fact is we’ve got to work on them all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxXBl2"&gt;Clark said that NASA has already made huge advances in battery technology that will help the aircraft achieve lift and sustain a cruising altitude. The X-57 team’s development of battery technology, along with the packaging of energy storage into the fuselage putting the motors, has been valuable, along with figuring out a process for performing “health checks” on the battery and motors while in flight, Clark said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uEOsk"&gt;Those details are being published and shared with the aviation community to help inform their own efforts. “Even before the first flight, we’re able to help support this new industry and kickstart this new technology,” Clark said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oWuiA"&gt;It’s still early days for electric aircraft, but the companies developing prototypes have already conducted their own test flights. NASA wants it to be a two-way street: you share data with us, and we’ll share our learnings, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hJK4yY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Even before the first flight, we’re able to help support this new industry and kickstart this new technology”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bOzX9a"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651998/nasa-joby-evtol-test-flight-air-taxi"&gt;NASA kicked off test flights of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft with Joby Aviation&lt;/a&gt;, the Northern California company that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298957/joby-aviation-public-evtol-electric-aircraft-spac-hoffman"&gt;recently went public&lt;/a&gt;. The agency is closely monitoring the aircraft’s sound profile to see how well it compares to helicopters and other gas-powered vehicles. A major selling point for eVTOL companies is that these aircraft are noticeably less noisy than helicopters and therefore better suited for flights over populated areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1om5ns"&gt;The test flights are part of a national campaign by NASA to observe these experimental aircraft in action and gather data. Joby, which was founded in 2009, is the first eVTOL company to participate in &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/aamnationalcampaign"&gt;NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) National Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCTniB"&gt;NASA is getting data from Joby, and in exchange, the company has supplied components to the X-57 project, such as its electric motors, Clark said. If this collaboration continues to bear fruit, people may find themselves whisking through in an electric aircraft sooner than they think. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTzfzB"&gt;“It’s really important that we support the industry and make this technology accessible to Joby and other airframe manufacturers,” Clark said, “to make these aircraft more accessible to the flying public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjAeMP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s Nova 9 is its latest smartphone to launch globally sans Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sb-RDQcjHh7R152PgcdWDuFZNTI=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025998/huawei_nova_9_1_mob_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huawei’s Nova 9.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Huawei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2z0MQ4"&gt;Huawei’s Nova 9 is getting a global launch just under a month after the phone was &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_nova_9_series_announced_with_snapdragon_778g_4g_chipsets_up_to_100w_charging_-news-51106.php"&gt;announced for the Chinese market&lt;/a&gt;, the company said today. Huawei characterizes the Nova 9 as a “flagship smartphone for the younger generation,” compared to its Mate series (high-tech and premium) and P-series (photography) lineups. Pre-orders open today with pricing starting at €499, and Huawei says the phone will be on sale from November 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OY7tmv"&gt;The company also gave an update on the global release status of the P50, the flagship phone Huawei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598135/huawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras"&gt;announced for the domestic Chinese market in July&lt;/a&gt;. The company says the P50 will release outside of China in 2022, which will come roughly two years after the release of its predecessor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21278958/huawei-p40-pro-review-camera-price-specs-features"&gt;P40&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYXQMz"&gt;Thanks to Huawei’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;ongoing presence on the USA’s entity list&lt;/a&gt;, the Nova 9 will once again ship without Google’s apps or services, including the Google Play Store, which will severely limit its appeal outside of China. Instead, it runs Huawei’s Harmony OS-branded software, which shares a lot of similarities with the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/harmonyos-hands-on-huaweis-android-killer-is-just-android/"&gt;open-source version of Android&lt;/a&gt;, only with Huawei’s apps, services, and app store replacing Google’s versions. The P50 will likely suffer the same fate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RwemAqXW6RzbgNA1lw79gtoUNvc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941587/huawei_nova_9_pro_colours_4_mob_2x.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nova 9 is launching globally in black and blue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FXwqpr"&gt;The Nova 9 is powered by a Snapdragon 778G rather than one of Huawei’s in-house Kirin chips, following the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21360598/huawei-chips-us-sanctions-trump-china-privacy-smartphone"&gt;problems with Kirin production&lt;/a&gt;. Around back, there’s an array of four cameras: a 50-megapixel main camera, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel depth camera, and a 2-megapixel macro. Meanwhile, on the front you’ll find a 32-megapixel selfie camera inside a hole-punch notch in its 1080p, 120Hz 6.57-inch curved OLED display. Its 4,300mAh battery can be fast charged at 66W, which Huawei says should refill its battery in 38 minutes. There’s no mention of 5G support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJGtgA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 21st, 11:27AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with pricing and release date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ug6ytf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook Oversight Board says Facebook wasn’t ‘fully forthcoming’ about Trump ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HB_2uzdjOPGWOAfyPJfed4nF6vs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025957/mdoying_180411_2400_0045still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eE5Cnd"&gt;The Facebook Oversight Board says it will review &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671565/facebook-xcheck-moderation-system-high-profile-exemptions"&gt;Facebook’s “cross-check” program&lt;/a&gt; for high-profile users and criticized it for not disclosing enough information about the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHNmN9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/215139350722703-oversight-board-demands-more-transparency-from-facebook/"&gt;In a new transparency report&lt;/a&gt;, the Oversight Board — a semi-independent body that reviews Facebook’s moderation process — publicly accepted a Facebook request to review cross-check (sometimes called “XCheck”) and recommend changes. Facebook will also share documents related to reporting &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353?mod=hp_lead_pos7"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which described cross-check as a system that “shields millions of VIP users from the company’s normal enforcement process.” The board previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686364/facebook-oversight-board-xcheck-moderation-exemption"&gt;raised concerns about cross-check&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEjOKi"&gt;“In the board’s view, the team within Facebook tasked to provide information has not been fully forthcoming in its responses on cross-check. On some occasions, Facebook failed to provide relevant information to the board, while in other instances, the information it did provide was incomplete,” the board report says. The board says its “credibility” depends on being able to trust that Facebook’s information is “accurate, comprehensive, and paints a full picture of the topic at hand” — and a lack of disclosure undermines that credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yTyVcM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The board says its credibility relies on Facebook’s trustworthiness&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jr3xXb"&gt;The board calls it “not acceptable” that Facebook didn’t initially mention cross-check was a factor in its moderation of former President Donald Trump, who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"&gt;banned for violating Facebook’s policies&lt;/a&gt; against inciting violence. It also says that Facebook should not have referred to cross-check as covering a “small number of decisions” when its true scope was clearly far wider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lbTn0"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/requesting-oversight-board-guidance-cross-check-system/"&gt;asked the board for guidance&lt;/a&gt; on cross-check in late September, and the board says it will now reach out to academics, researchers, and former Facebook employees who have come forward as whistleblowers. It will also open a public comment period in the coming days, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256821/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board-public-feedback"&gt;something it also did&lt;/a&gt; around the Trump ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYeqoP"&gt;The transparency report is the first of its kind, although the Oversight Board says it will now release these reports quarterly. It offers a sense of the program’s scope compared to the massive demand for its services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzBaF3"&gt;Facebook and Instagram users submitted around 524,000 total requests for review between October 2020 and June 2021. The requests were particularly concentrated in the US and Canada, where a combined total of roughly 46 percent originated. This doesn’t reflect the overall demographic makeup of Facebook, and the board says it will conduct more outreach to draw reports from other areas — saying that “if anything, we have reason to believe that users in Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East experience more, not fewer, problems with Facebook than parts of the world with more appeals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXVNfR"&gt;Either way, that volume is orders of magnitude greater than the number of cases the Oversight Board actually takes up. It decided 11 cases in the first and second quarters of 2021, and its review process caused Facebook to identify 38 cases where it had made an incorrect moderation decision, apparently leading it to restore around 35 pieces of content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KiaO2"&gt;The Oversight Board recommendations can have a larger indirect effect by leading Facebook to review and modify its policies — in at least one case, it also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568648/facebook-oversight-board-abdullah-ocalan-dangerous-entities-exception-lost"&gt;rediscovered a policy it had lost&lt;/a&gt;. And one of the transparency report’s themes is that Facebook should be more transparent with &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt; as well. “In areas where we feel that Facebook is falling short, such as transparency, we will keep challenging the company to do better,” the report says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku calls out Google over YouTube contract stalemate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qDXz5UnZzmDFuAoumDbn832oXIY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025930/cwelch_181128_3103_0677_2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R77EXb"&gt;Tensions between Roku and Google spilled over to customers in a new blog posted by the streaming service on Thursday. After months of failed negotiations for Roku to maintain the YouTube app, the company is accusing Google of anti-competitive demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIX9YD"&gt;Responding to the deadlocked negotiations, Google said that it would end all distribution of YouTube on new Roku devices after December 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AJq23"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.roku.com/blog/update-on-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In its Thursday blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Roku accused Google of making anti-competitive demands in carriage agreements, like requiring Roku to implement a dedicated YouTube search results row in the Roku interface. Roku also alleged that Google overrides music voice search and blocks relevant searches outside of YouTube’s own results while users are in the YouTube app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLD5XS"&gt;“Doing business with an enterprise as powerful as Google creates complex challenges,” the blog post said. “Importantly, our concerns with Google are not about money. We have not asked for a single change in the financial terms of our existing agreement. In fact, Roku does not earn a single dollar from YouTube’s ad supported video sharing service today, whereas Google makes hundreds of millions of dollars from the YouTube app on Roku.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZoqVB"&gt;Outside of these demands being hostile to consumers, Roku also alleged that Google’s requirements give it access to vast amounts of consumer data related to what Roku users watch on their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLp2bb"&gt;Roku’s deal to distribute &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403740/roku-youtube-tv-google-standoff-competition-negotiations-contract"&gt;the YouTube TV app expired in April&lt;/a&gt; and the company removed the app from its store after failing to reach a new agreement with Google. Roku has consistently accused Google of making unfair demands while not requiring similar data-sharing and search features on other platforms like Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMxugc"&gt;“Since our negotiations with Roku earlier this year, we’ve continued to work with them to find a resolution that benefits our mutual users,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement Thursday. “Roku has once again chosen to make unproductive and baseless claims rather than try to work constructively with us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuYp5b"&gt;The blog comes just a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726897/amazon-apple-google-app-stores-marketplace-antitrust-competition-klobuchar-grassley"&gt;a new bipartisan bill to combat anti-competitive&lt;/a&gt; behavior in the tech industry was introduced by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA). The American Innovation and Choice Online Act would ban similar behaviors alleged by Roku in its Thursday blog, like self-preferencing and discriminating against competitors’ content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2w4be"&gt;“Roku supports bipartisan efforts such as the American Innovation and Choice Online Act to modernize our competition laws, promote innovation, and protect consumers in the Digital Age,” said John Kelly, Roku senior vice president of corporate affairs and communications at Roku in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/10/support-builds-for-bipartisan-legislation-from-klobuchar-grassley-and-colleagues-to-rein-in-big-tech"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBzllf"&gt;Roku told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Wednesday that company representatives were in contact with lawmakers over these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pesJzu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 10/21/19 at 11:08AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included a statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wClyRx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
