    <title>Apple trusts Phobio for its trade-ins, but maybe you should think twice</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The Atlanta-based firm is the behind-the-scenes operator of Apple’s trade-in program, and its online reputation raises questions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="qPAV1C"&gt;When Daniel McGloin decided to trade in his mid-2017 Apple MacBook in February of this year, he thought he was getting a pretty good deal. The software engineer and San Diego native initiated the trade-in with Apple through the Apple Store mobile app, where he was quoted $350 for his used laptop. He felt it was in pretty good condition, with no apparent damage to the case and a fully functioning display and keyboard. So McGloin packed up the device and shipped it in, expecting to receive his money in the coming weeks, which would help offset his purchase of a MacBook Air carrying Apple’s new M1 chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5kb94"&gt;The situation soon changed after his laptop arrived for inspection. Suddenly, McGloin was told his MacBook was worth just $140, less than half what Apple originally quoted. The mysterious culprit: “display has 3 or more white spots,” the Apple Store app told him. It’s a defect McGloin doesn’t remember ever seeing, and one that he should have noticed: typically, white spots on an LCD display are evidence of serious damage or burn-in and are clearly visible. In McGloin’s estimation, however, the laptop was in “excellent” condition, he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and he didn’t see any white spots when he packed it up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKProV"&gt;So McGloin decided to search around online, where he discovered a lesser-known fact about Apple’s trade-in program. The company he had been dealing with was not actually Apple, but an Atlanta-based contractor named Phobio. Founded in 2010, Phobio is an enterprise service provider that specializes in offering white label trade-in services other companies can pass off as their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CGiyU"&gt;McGloin also found Phobio had a pretty questionable online reputation when it came to Apple products.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Daniel McGloin sent in his 2017 MacBook after receiving a quote of $350, only to have his quote marked down to $140. “Display has 3 or more white spots,” was the reason, though &lt;/em&gt;The Verge &lt;em&gt;found no such issue when it inspected the computer in person. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uCsfUn"&gt;“It’s here I realized that number one, the trade-in program is not run by Apple, number two, there are lots of people observing the same behavior, and number three, this seems to be a new development in the last few months,” McGloin says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXOd1m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;inspected McGloin’s MacBook in person, after he rejected the trade-in offer and Phobio returned the computer to him. We could detect no such white spots or any discernible damage whatsoever. The laptop booted up and operates like new, and it has since passed numerous online diagnostic tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7A7A6i"&gt;It’s not clear why McGloin’s estimate was halved. But his experience is indicative of a common belief that’s emerged about Phobio online — that the company stiffs owners of Apple products out of hundreds of dollars in trade-in value — and the supposed “3 or more white spots” defect seems unlikely enough that it bears investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P349GE"&gt;Two other people who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and provided documentation of their Phobio trade-in processes also experienced a similar situation, in which “white spots” or other supposed defects, only detected after the device was shipped to a Phobio facility, resulted in reduced trade-in quotes. And that’s just a tiny sample of an online torrent of complaints against Phobio and its practices across multiple types of gadgets and with an alarming uptick in the last few months. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another Apple customer, Carlos Pero, had their laptop marked down from $640 to $210 over display white spots Phobio claims it detected. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RD0mEQ"&gt;“Having used it for three years, I can tell you I never noticed a problem,” Carlo Pero, another Apple customer who had their laptop trade-in quote reduced by Phobio from $640 to $210, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Pero also asked for his laptop back, and Phobio returned it. Upon inspection, Pero could not detect any issues with his computer, and he showed us a video of his MacBook Pro booting up to verify there were no “white spots” present. “Maybe they have some diagnostic tool? But from a consumer perspective, no way I see a problem before I sent it or after receiving it back.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0395H"&gt;Pero says he was never given any photographic proof of the white spots when his trade-in was adjusted. “They sent no such thing. Just the notification of the change in value and essentially the take-it-or-leave-it message which came by way of Apple,” he says. “I imagine it would be a tougher choice for someone who was counting on realizing the full value of the trade-in, who may not be able to afford a new computer otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JzUT3y"&gt;Scores of other instances of this exact situation happening to Apple product owners can be found online, too, with numerous customers citing Phobio’s “3 or more white spots” explanation as the reason for their adjusted trade-in, as well as stories of other types of apparent damage detected only after sending a device in for inspection. This isn’t just restricted to MacBooks, either. Customers often complain of reduced trade-in quotes for iPhones, iPads, and iMacs, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiJjaH"&gt;In some cases, like McGloin’s, Phobio’s name never comes up, so customers are left with the impression Apple inspected it and reduced their quote accordingly. “The only real ‘correspondence’ I had with Apple and Phobio were the interactions in the Apple Store app. I didn’t otherwise contact them through email or phone,” McGloin says. He tells us he was faced with the tough decision to either accept less than half the promised money or try to sell his computer elsewhere after going through the hassle of wiping it clean and shipping it. “I’m actually a pretty big Apple fan, but this feels off-brand and pretty shady,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oIkbTpNFiCIQiARJ3FUh5Y9h5Eo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425009/phobio_apple_macbook_final.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A mid-2017 Apple MacBook Phobio says was worth $140, down from $350, due to “3 or more white spots” in the display. &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; could find no evidence of white spots. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MoZ7rk"&gt;Apple often prides itself on customer service and in handling many of its sales operations in-house. So the use of a third-party vendor not advertised publicly on its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22368541%2Fapple-trade-in-phobio-macbook-white-spots" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;trade-in website&lt;/a&gt; — even in receipts, Apple only refers to an unnamed “trade-in partner” — is a peculiar approach for the iPhone maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdXGh5"&gt;Outsourcing trade-ins is common in the industry, though. Many businesses pick white-label inspection and recycling firms to cut costs and avoid the hassle of managing a cumbersome operation. Phobio also happens to be the &lt;a href="https://www.phobio.com/blog/phobio-partners-with-oneplus-to-power-its-trade-in-program-in-north-america"&gt;trade-in partner of OnePlus in the US&lt;/a&gt;, and the firm also &lt;a href="https://www.phobio.com/blog/phobio-named-trade-in-provider-to-three-new-companies-amazon-canada-hyperion-partners-and-drone-nerds"&gt;inked a deal with Amazon Canada just last month&lt;/a&gt; to handle trade-ins of “certain eligible mobile phones, laptops, iPads and Apple watches.” It handles trade-ins for Costco and B&amp;amp;H Photo, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E53zad"&gt;Yet for Apple, which stakes its reputation on quality control, the negative experiences customers report having with Phobio threaten to undermine the image Apple has cultivated as a customer-obsessed product company, which in turn helps justify the company’s high-priced consumer tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAL5nD"&gt;Apple tells us Phobio is not the only company that helps manage its US trade-in program, but wouldn’t name any others — and we verified that every type of product you’d trade in at Apple.com (computers, phones, tablets, and watches) is currently handled by Phobio in the United States. Apple also has a trade-in partner named Brightstar servicing Canada and other parts of the globe, but two Brightstar employees told us it no longer accepts US trade-ins. One referred us to Phobio specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2frVDX"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://mixergy.com/interviews/phobio-with-stephen-wakeling/"&gt;podcast interview with Phobio founder and CEO Stephen Wakeling&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 includes vague details on the partnership — at one point, Wakeling tells the podcast host he’s not sure Apple would permit him to talk further about the program. Some &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/20/apple-mac-trade-in-partner-phobio/"&gt;news posts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/71vctg/psa_do_not_use_apples_trade_in_partner_phobio/"&gt;forum threads as far back as 2017&lt;/a&gt; mention Phobio as Apple’s trade-in partner, but it’s not clear how long the two have been in business; Apple first began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/30/4675768/apple-launches-iphone-trade-in-program-retail-stores"&gt;accepting used iPhones at its retail stores in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, and the Apple trade-in program has since expanded to include close to its full lineup of hardware products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LsTWh"&gt;It’s not like customers could just walk into an Apple Store to avoid Phobio, at least not where laptops are concerned. Up until &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/06/17/mac-trade-ins-retail-stores/"&gt;last summer&lt;/a&gt;, Mac trade-ins, unlike with iPhones or iPads, were not eligible for in-store inspections by Apple employees at the company’s retail locations — Macs had to be sent in the mail, where Apple’s trade-in partner Phobio steps in. (Due to COVID-19 store closures and limitations on in-store services, it’s likely many customers have kept using the mail-in service for Macs.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SrQYoS"&gt;And even a cursory Google search on Phobio and its handling of Apple trade-ins returns &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=phobio+scam+site:www.reddit.com&amp;amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS896US897&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjbq9Gf2PHvAhXNieAKHQKMBdsQrQIoBHoECAUQBQ&amp;amp;biw=2048&amp;amp;bih=941"&gt;dozens&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252009512?page=3"&gt;upon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/knkt9h/advice_do_not_attempt_to_try_apple_mac_tradein/"&gt;dozens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252160186"&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252160186"&gt;board &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ka5no3/did_phobio_actually_deliver_the_price_they/"&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt; detailing bad experiences and a &lt;a href="https://www.bbb.org/us/ga/kennesaw/profile/ecommerce/phobio-llc-0443-27756683/complaints"&gt;Better Business Bureau page&lt;/a&gt; with more than 500 complaints and new entries added almost every day. Many of these complaints are recent, and some are from Apple customers wondering openly if they’ve been a victim of some type of fraud or whether Phobio is a legitimate company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1msgL6"&gt;When some customers complained, they reported Phobio’s provided proof &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/a57h7w/anyone_else_get_scammed_by_apples_trade_in/"&gt;consisted of grainy images&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bad-phobio-trade-in-experience-merged.2069167/page-3"&gt;didn’t show clear-cut evidence&lt;/a&gt;. Some customers have &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/knkt9h/advice_do_not_attempt_to_try_apple_mac_tradein/"&gt;detailed how they took photos of their devices&lt;/a&gt; prior to shipping them in in the event of disputes, only for Phobio to return photographic evidence they say either &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/a/j0F22nX"&gt;doesn’t illustrate the alleged issue or is too low-quality or obfuscating&lt;/a&gt; to serve as proper proof. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2/ So on with them now, it turns out they use "trusted partners" to do fulfillment on the trade-ins. So the outsourced company can I guess either break it or report damage to stiff you on the price.&lt;/p&gt;— Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1341380478184660992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div id="FZPZaY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I know what everyone is going to say. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; is just being apple. But when you offer me $120 to trade-in my old device and then drop that offer to $30 for an imaginary "white spot", that is BS. What white spot?!?!? You put the red sticker to identify it but I don't see it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#sus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/gnAyp044x0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gnAyp044x0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— A Mindful Minx (@TweetaVonTease) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TweetaVonTease/status/1325812118789234695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="UEzniV"&gt;A large number of the complaints about Phobio have a common theme: a MacBook or iPhone that seems to be in perfect working order, only for the device to later have an unexplained deficiency. Phobio, which is at that point in possession of the device, then offers the customer the option to accept the reduced quote or ask for the product to be shipped back. (Phobio does offer to ship the product both ways for free.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kRVFW"&gt;This presents a thorny set of choices for a device owner, primarily by seeding self-doubt as to the real value of the product they’re hoping to trade in and what their best option might be. What if the product did have the damage beforehand and they simply didn’t notice, or perhaps something happened during transit? Maybe Phobio is using a proprietary diagnostic tool that reveals something no consumer could ever find on their own? What if, by some stroke of bad luck, the device was somehow damaged during transit, and you’d have a hard time using it or selling it somewhere else if you ask for it back? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="miPTQm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pretty disappointed in Apple’s trade in vendor. Trade in value dropped from $490 to $180 after “three white spots” magically appeared on my old MBP while in transit. Certainly feels like bait and switch on that one.&lt;/p&gt;— Rob Zimmerman (@taintedzodiac) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/taintedzodiac/status/1341763871145603072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rs4yGg"&gt;Chris Dwan calls his experience with Phobio a “pretty straightforward bait and switch,” telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that he mailed in his MacBook Air with an expected trade-in value of $370, only for it to be knocked down to $150 for damage to the outer shell he suspects happened during transit or inspection. “At that point it was take-it-or-leave-it. They did offer to ship the laptop back, but I caved and took my $150.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZPgLP6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“At that point it was take-it-or-leave-it. They did offer to ship the laptop back, but I caved and took my $150.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wkF26E"&gt;At the end of the day, someone trading in their used Apple device is looking to get rid of it and hoping they’ll get a little cash for their trouble, instead of simply recycling it or leaving it to collect dust. That could make them easy to take advantage of: many are likely willing to take what they can get, rather than spend additional time and energy trying to get satisfaction from a company that’s holding all the cards, particularly when it’s not clear who’s to blame or whether their product is actually damaged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKaf4O"&gt;“White spots” or no, it’s not surprising that a company like Phobio would be facing loads of complaints. Every company working in customer service is likely to have its fair share of disgruntled customers complaining online; people with positive experiences tend to have little reason to share those stories with the world. Trade-in programs can involve especially fraught negotiations because of the money involved and the fear customers harbor of being scammed. Even rightful adjustments to trade-in quotes might inspire someone to leave a negative review or feel as if they’ve been had. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="46BpA6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So upset at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt;. I traded in my watch, which was in perfect working conditions and no screen issues. They now saw it had white spots. That isn’t true. I have pictures of it before packing it. So mad!!&lt;/p&gt;— Mari (@Busyspider23) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Busyspider23/status/1313807676388913152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fJhJ4K"&gt;In fact, many people have reported positive experiences with Phobio — many never realizing they weren’t dealing with Apple directly. One &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffer says they were even given more money for an Apple trade-in after the device exceeded the quality estimate they were initially quoted on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgOxa8"&gt;Phobio customer service representatives can also be seen replying to almost every single tweet, tagging the company’s support account, and Better Business Bureau post, asking how to remedy the situation. In the latter cases, many of the customers who complained post to the bureau’s website after the fact saying Phobio resolved their issues with fixed trade-in values or Apple Store gift cards to make up the difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gWwiM"&gt;In a tour of one of its so-called aggregation facilities &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F524211358&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22368541%2Fapple-trade-in-phobio-macbook-white-spots" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;posted to LinkedIn last month&lt;/a&gt;, a Phobio representative shed some light on how Apple products are evaluated. “We have very simple grading criteria. We only have two of course, which is working and damaged to make it easy for folks at home to grade their own devices,” the representative explains, before transitioning to a Phobio employee inspecting a MacBook. “He’s making sure the screen is intact and functional, he’s making sure the keys function, and then he’s checking to see if there’s any wear or tear to the computer or any major dents or damage.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="uIbR1B"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/524211358?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4qCi4D"&gt;“A couple of other things to look out for: LCD damage, screen spotting and dead pixels, cracked screen, missing or malfunctioning buttons, and large dents,” the representative says. When asked by Wakeling, Phobio’s CEO who appears on-screen at the beginning and end of the video, what the top issues are with devices sent in for trade-in, the representative simply says “screen delamination” or “any major damage” to the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ih2SE"&gt;In a Phobio &lt;a href="https://phobio.com/static/downloads/smb/inspection_guide.pdf"&gt;inspection guideline document&lt;/a&gt; posted online for business trade-ins (which may have different standards than consumer trade-ins), the company details its processes for inspecting products like iPhones and Macs. Under the display portion, the document says “a device is considered ‘Damaged’ if the display: is cracked, fractured and/or shows signs of delamination; does not function as designed (displaying single colors, lines, flickering); is scratched such that it affects readability.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBOjNq"&gt;However, no mention of white spots can be found in the document, nor did Phobio mention that issue in its facility tour. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qNVP4joUclPK7XMznmZq9Oz1Wuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424867/Phobio_inspection_guide.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Phobio&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7tCAz7"&gt;You could chalk up these bad customer experiences with Phobio to the sheer volume of products Apple’s trade-in program likely deals in or discrepancies in the level of diligence of its individual employees. But that doesn’t explain the mystery of the white spots, and why we’ve seen perfectly functional MacBook computers have their trade-in value cut in half — or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tkXyB"&gt;What we do know about the white spots scenario is that it typically involves an Apple laptop in seemingly good condition quoted at one price, only for the trade-in estimate to be knocked down by more than 50 percent upon inspection. The common response from Phobio is that the display suffers from “3 or more white spots.” In McGloin’s case, these apparent spots were not detectable by a human eye before or after Phobio inspected the device. It doesn’t add up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VX65hJ"&gt;So we felt it necessary to ask Phobio if they had a reasonable explanation for cases like these that went beyond the standard “screen spotting,” “dead pixels,” and other general LCD damage that would be perceptible by looking at the screen yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kWmAfK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We struggled to find any form of contact information for Phobio’s public relations department&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WV8jKe"&gt;Phobio did not have a media contact line or any other form of public-facing public relations department we were able to locate for this story. We did, however, contact a third-party PR representative for Phobio, who forwarded our questions to the company. We repeatedly asked for the opportunity to speak on the record with an official Phobio representative about our findings, but we were ultimately denied. We instead sent a series of questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUyglY"&gt;Phobio would not comment directly on the white spots issue, and it would not offer an explanation as to what tools it uses to evaluate MacBook displays or why it seems some customers have had their trade-in quotes adjusted because of the alleged white spots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFr7ZU"&gt;When asked, Phobio would not say how long it’s been Apple’s trade-in partner or if it is Apple’s only US trade-in partner, and the company would not comment on the financial terms of its contract, including whether Phobio or Apple gets to keep and resell the devices customers send in. Phobio would also not say whether it receives any guidance from Apple on how to inspect products and make adjustments to trade-in quotes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9nqeB"&gt;Phobio would also not tell us how frequently it negatively adjusted Apple trade-in quotes by up to or more than half. It would also not say how often customers accept these lowered adjustments versus rejecting them and asking for the product back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEa4Ce"&gt;In the end, Phobio would only provide this statement: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1HGUEE"&gt;We carefully assess each device sent to us, and only change the initial quote if the device we receive or its condition differs from what was initially indicated by the customer. We document our findings at every step of the way with photos that are shared with the customers. The customer can then agree to the revised quote, or if they do not, we express ship it back to them at our expense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErGZy4"&gt;We specifically train our support team to see the trade from the point of view of the customer, with empathy, and to advocate for the customer. If devices are damaged in transit or we make a mistake in the inspection, we seek to fix it immediately. We strongly believe in giving full and fair value to customers for their trade ins. This helps fuel the circular economy, and sustainability, and it is part of our corporate purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FksqvY"&gt;Apple declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QE2ADB"&gt;As for McGloin, he’s not sure what’s he’s going to do now with his returned MacBook. “I actually have no idea. I’m not really aware of alternative trade-in options,” he says, adding that he has in the past opted to donate used products or gifted them to a friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="zQaJqH"&gt;For now, the computer sits packed up in Phobio’s shipping box, with no visible white spots and no explanation as to how a perfectly functional Apple laptop from four years ago could now be considered worth less than a pair of AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODp9ej"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rode Connect lets you mix up to four USB mics at once</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ldBx23CKJoeFsO5LDQfECE1hvC0=/0x140:1000x807/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69123679/RODE_RODE_CONNECT_INSITU_4_NT_USB_MINI_MACBOOK_DARKMODE_1000x1000_RGB_1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XeEDXO"&gt;USB microphones are great for creators starting out in podcasting — until they have to mic more than one person in a room. There hasn’t been an efficient way to simultaneously record multiple USB mics on one computer, so now Rode is introducing an app that starts to offer a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpoFeU"&gt;Rode’s new app, Rode Connect, lets you record multitrack or mixed stereo audio when plugging up to four USB microphones into your computer. There’s one big catch, though: for now, you can only do this with one model of USB microphone — Rode’s $99 &lt;a href="https://www.rode.com/microphones/nt-usb_mini"&gt;NT-USB Mini&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahLRUd"&gt;You can think of the app as a virtual version of Rode’s $599 hardware mixer, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/8/18294629/rodecaster-pro-review-podcast-studio-xlr-microphones"&gt;Rodecaster Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to plug in multiple XLR microphones, play audio clips, and record locally. The Rode Connect does that in an app on your computer with USB mics, which can come in handy for those who do not have an external mixer or professional microphones. But since the app is locked into Rode’s USB microphone ecosystem, it’s hard to take full advantage of it. The NT-USB Mini is also not necessarily the best-sounding USB microphone that even Rode has to offer, so you are pretty limited on sound quality as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xL9d9z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Live-streaming seems to be an ideal use case for the new app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j5KAyO"&gt;Rode says the NT-USB Mini’s digital signal processing is the reason it’s the only microphone to work with this system. The processing lightens the load on the computer by having internal EQ and compression presets work inside the microphone instead of running through your computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2wg43"&gt;According to Rode, there may be more models of its microphones added to the Rode Connect capability list. The company says, “We are actively looking at how we can expand the selection of microphones available for use with Rode Connect, and where possible we will integrate other Rode mics into the solution.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hBYF9d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10444245"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tsmC9t"&gt;Like the Rodecaster Pro, live-streaming seems to be an ideal use case for the new app. Rode Connect allows you to also add system audio to the mixer — which lets you mix in any sounds playing from your computer or a single application like FaceTime, Skype, Zoom, YouTube, and so on. If you have a streaming setup in something like OBS, you can select the aggregate sound device that Rode creates as your audio input, and the complete mix from Connect can be used in your stream, without having to play with the finicky OBS audio mixer controls or adding more CPU-intensive plugins. Having a separate audio-focused mixer program for more granular settings can significantly increase the production value on a live stream. This also opens up the possibility of mixing audio virtually into your Zoom call or perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22362980/clubhouse-social-audio-facebook-twitter-android"&gt;some new social audio app&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHsi4g"&gt;Rode Connect seems to be an efficient way to use software to solve the problem with recording a bunch of USB mics with one device, but the product looks more like a way to convince consumers to buy multiples of Rode’s new microphones for the time being. As an audio engineer, I wouldn’t normally recommend someone buy four USB microphones for their roundtable podcast. If you bought four of these, it would cost $400. And at that price tag, you might as well buy a separate multichannel recording interface and plug in a couple of Shure SM58s. Then you can free up a couple of ports on your computer. As a reminder, the 2020 MacBook Air only has two ports.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Urbanista is the latest company to take a swing at solar-powered headphones  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1XQ4uJAhlDKIJtYo6_olrnchzLo=/1x0:2439x1625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69123674/5.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At a glance, the Los Angeles look similar to any other pair of headphones.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Urbanista&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MNiXSN"&gt;Urbanista’s new wireless noise-canceling &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.urbanista.com%2Fuk%2Flosangeles%3Futm_source%3DSkimlinks%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26cjevent%3Dbb805ad99d0911eb83c600fd0a180512&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F14%2F22383302%2Furbanista-los-angeles-solar-powered-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Los Angeles headphones&lt;/a&gt; have a solar panel integrated into the length of the headband, allowing them to draw power from both indoor and outdoor light, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/urbanista-los-angeles-solar-powered-active-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Although its built-in 750mAh battery can be charged traditionally via USB-C and offers up to a respectable 50 hours of battery life, the real appeal to these headphones is the solar charging. They’re due to ship in early summer for £169 (around $232), according to &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHzbjl"&gt;Although Urbanista’s site promises “infinite playtime” from the headphones, the exact amount of power these headphones can generate while solar charging varies. One hour spent in the sun should generate enough power for three hours of playtime, but on a cloudy day that drops to just two hours, the company says. In a worst case scenario on a long-distance plane flight, &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; notes you’d need around eight hours of light exposure to get an hour of listening.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UWIlER8k4zszOQX8wWYTmitOYWg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22443015/ezgif.com_gif_maker__4_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Urbanista&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The solar panel is built neatly into the headband.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4xDEYb"&gt;Beyond their solar-powered smarts, the Urbanista’s Los Angeles headphones are similar to its existing Miami range. They’ve got built-in microphones for use with voice assistants like Siri or Google Assistant, on-ear detection, an ambient sound mode, and they wirelessly connect over Bluetooth 5.0. In the box you get a carrying case, audio cable, and in-flight adaptor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dr4Na"&gt;JBL announced a very similar pair of solar-powered headphones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/17/21025797/jbl-reflect-eternal-solar-powered-headphones-release-date-price-news-features-indiegogo"&gt;back in December 2019&lt;/a&gt;, which was subsequently crowdfunded &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Fjbl-reflect-eternal-self-charging-headphones%2F%23%2Fupdates%2Fall&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F14%2F22383302%2Furbanista-los-angeles-solar-powered-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on IndieGoGo&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Reflect Eternal headphones aren’t yet available. In December 2020 the company posted an update on the project’s page saying the headphones were facing “major delays” due to the pandemic, and that it would be offering refunds to its backers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBTxzB"&gt;Both JBL’s and Urbanista’s headphones rely on the same Powerfoyle solar charging technology developed by a company called Exeger. “JBL were a bit unlucky with Covid hitting, and so Urbanista became lucky because we’re in the same city,” Exeger’s CEO Giovanni Fili told &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re looking forward to picking it up with JBL as soon as they can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IoFYeO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88H7Gz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBDJk8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s new PS5 update includes surprise improvements to HDR and 120Hz support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/umXFmBuBZICCduUaxCnLnZDd5IQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69123575/vpavic_4278_20201030_0247.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uLkoAV"&gt;Sony’s new PS5 software update is live right now, and includes some surprise improvements to HDR and 120Hz support. While Sony already detailed a big new feature to let players store — but not play — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381494/sony-ps5-april-update-games-external-usb-storage-social-features"&gt;PS5 games on an external hard drive&lt;/a&gt;, there’s also a new option to automatically switch video output to non-HDR when you’re using a game or app that doesn’t support HDR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D5HNUc"&gt;This is a key improvement for those using HDR on the PS5, as it now means you no longer have to dig into the settings menu to manually disable HDR when you’re viewing SDR content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7FWIlj"&gt;Alongside these HDR changes, this update also adds two new HDMI controls in the system part of the PS5 settings menu. You can now toggle one-touch play, which will automatically turn on a connected TV when you power up a PS5 and switch it to the correct input. You can also toggle power off link, which allows the PS5 to enter rest mode if you turn off the TV connected to your console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u5Rne7eyRD4k6Rvebci3JT603TA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22442998/VIBNQLh.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New HDR options on the PS5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v3QPR0fJCngFuJL087iSU0T2w38=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22443001/xsOq7mE.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New HDMI options for the PS5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7SU3aQ"&gt;Sony is also supporting more PC monitors with 120Hz in this update. If you have a 1080p PC monitor that supports 120Hz, it should now work at this refresh rate with the PS5. Unfortunately, Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support is still missing on the PS5, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsFbpu"&gt;This latest software update also includes better options for quickly disabling in-game chat, an option to search for purchased games, and the ability to hide games in a library.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next year’s iPhones will have 48-megapixel cameras and no mini option: Kuo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iWq6kGonFQK3rK2AwFJRrC7OjRo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69123372/vpavic_4279_20201107_0094.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1evF1E"&gt;The 2022 iPhone lineup will feature substantial changes to the camera system, according to analyst Ming-chi Kuo in an investor note reported on by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-2022-iphones-no-mini-upgraded-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/14/kuo-48mp-camera-with-8k-support-coming-to-iphone-in-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Kuo says the high-end iPhones — presumably the Pro range — will use a larger 48-megapixel sensor for the primary camera. Separately, the analyst suggests that 2023 iPhones may start to use Face ID sensors under the screen as a way to get rid of the notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnH08t"&gt;48-megapixel sensors have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/22/18192579/honor-view-20-48-megapixel-camera-review"&gt;common in Android phones for years&lt;/a&gt;, but this component will reportedly be larger than most. It’ll be a 1/1.3-inch sensor with a pixel size of 1.25µm, according to Kuo. That’s smaller than the 1.7µm pixels in the iPhone 12 Pro Max, but Kuo says that the equivalent pixel size will be more like 2.5µm when the sensor is used for 12-megapixel images. Kuo also expects the higher-resolution sensor to enable 8K video capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FZVE5e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple may ditch the iPhone mini in 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dwCn04"&gt;The 2022 iPhone lineup is going to see a reduction in screen size options, Kuo says; there won’t be a 5.4-inch mini any more, and Apple will stick to the 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays on other models. The mini has reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;not sold to Apple’s expectations&lt;/a&gt;, with the company said to have overestimated demand and cut production orders. The 2021 lineup, however, is expected to keep the same screen sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDY4ZP"&gt;Finally, Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-2023-iphones-under-display-face-id/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone will begin to use an under-display Face ID system in 2023. Kuo has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;previously claimed&lt;/a&gt; that Apple will replace the Face ID notch with a hole-punch camera in some models from next year, and that 2023 will also see under-display fingerprint scanners come to the iPhone. It’s not clear exactly which technologies will make it out when, or in which combination.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sony Xperia 1 III (left) and Xperia 5 III (right) | Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z6gPE7"&gt;Sony is announcing two new phones today, the Xperia 1 III and the Xperia 5 III. Both are the latest in Sony’s campaign to redefine the Xperia brand as a kind of sibling to its well-regarded Alpha digital cameras. As such, the camera system is once again the main focus, and Sony specifically is touting the “world’s first smartphone with a variable telephoto lens paired with a Dual PD sensor” and improvements to its already fast and accurate autofocus system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmODbj"&gt;Pricing was not announced, but they should both be available in the US “this summer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ss7nWW"&gt;Each phone has the basic specs you’d expect on a top-flight Android phone: three cameras on the rear, a Snapdragon 888 processor, and support for 5G. Actually, the 5G support is worth noting because these Xperia phones will be able to work on 5G networks in the US, something weirdly lacking on the last models. However, they’ll only work on the regular sub-6 networks on Verizon and T-Mobile, without support for AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network. As is fairly usual for Sony, these will be sold directly rather than via carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyTfUj"&gt;The phone also keep the Xperia design language Sony landed on with the original Xperia 1. They’re tall and narrow, with lots of glossy black and small curves on all the angles, giving them the most monolithic look of a smartphone today. I think they look great, but I’m also aware that they’re likely to cost a lot of money when Sony gets around to announcing the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keTqw8"&gt;In order to establish the Xperia brand, Sony has also been pushing a lot of other nice specs that are relatively hard to come by on other Android phones. The Xperia 1 III has a 4K OLED screen that now supports a fast (though locked) 120Hz refresh rate. There are dual speakers that are 40 percent louder and will work with Sony’s 360 Reality Audio format. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4mUop"&gt;Sony is also enabling a special mode for the USB-C port that allows you to use a special cable to take an HD-resolution video signal from an SLR camera so you can use it as a monitor – much like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22248440/sony-xperia-pro-5g-price-release-date-news-features"&gt;Xperia Pro can do with HDMI&lt;/a&gt;. That could also make them an interesting option for live streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6k4y8"&gt;They’ll come in both dual-SIM and SIM+microSD variants. And there’s even a good ol’ headphone jack and a shutter button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T6UIE3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10445216"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wi0KiD"&gt;There’s also the more standard fare, like wireless charging and a 4,500mAh battery. When plugged in and gaming the phones can redirect power away from the battery to reduce heat. Both phones will ship with Android 11, but as of right now there’s no clear commitment to future software updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDXZt6"&gt;If you step down from the Xperia 1 III to the Xperia 5 III, you’ll get a very similar set of specs with a few exceptions. It’ll be smaller, of course. The larger phone has a 6.5-inch 21:9 display while the 5 has a 6.1-inch 21:9 display — at 1080p resolution instead of 4K. But it still has support for the periscope-style variable lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="De7yL3"&gt;But again, the big push is on the cameras and here Sony has done quite a bit to improve the hardware. Sony is using three 12-megapixel sensors on the back, and both the main and telephoto lenses support OIS. (The Xperia 1 III also gets a time-of-flight sensor.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jj59YD"&gt;Sony says it has lenses that are the equivalent to 16mm (f/2.2 ultrawide), 24mm (f/1.7 wide), and 70mm (f/2.3 telephoto), but that the telephoto can also reach to an f/2.8 105mm equivalent. That extra telephoto zoom comes thanks to a folded periscope lens design, and the Xperia is physically moving the lens elements to get different focal lengths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01653k"&gt;The idea is that photographers will mostly stick to those focal lengths, but should they want to zoom further or use a zoom level in between the Xperia phones will utilize digital zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eNimmC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10445221"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fbyQND"&gt;Beyond the fancy hardware, Sony has iterated on its software. Unlike Google, Apple, and even Samsung, Sony is putting its emphasis on technical features rather than computational photography. It is claiming some improved low-light performance in some situations, but really the main emphasis is on features like autofocus and shooting speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKjGOt"&gt;These phones can take photos at up to 20fps with focus/exposure readings happening at 60fps. They also support 120FPS 4K in HDR. There’s still eye-tracking autofocus, but this year there’s real-time tracking for that autofocus. In a demo, Sony showed a subject turning around and when their eye was visible again, the camera adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QLRLA6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hardware is excellent, but it may only get noticed by enthusiasts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zqhm9U"&gt;Sony is finally integrating its pro camera app with the main camera app. There’s the “basic” mode like any smartphone, but it’s now quicker to get to the pro mode. Sony’s pro mode really is angled towards people who use Sony’s cameras, too: the interface is very similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nmNxE"&gt;On paper, all of this sounds really great. We’ll need to review them to see if these specs can translate to great experiences. Previous Sony Xperia phones have also had great camera hardware specs, but for taking quick shots they have often missed the mark. Treating a smartphone camera as a pro SLR-style camera could limit their appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJHp5Z"&gt;Sony’s tack with the Xperia line is to pack them to the gills with specs and features that will appeal to photographers and even videographers (there’s an excellent workflow-based video app included). In reality, however, Sony has struggled mightily to gain any measurable marketshare in the US. A lot of that has come down to higher prices than is the norm for even flagship Android phones, but some of it also comes down to availability. Without carrier partnerships or massive marketing budgets, these Xperia phones are more likely to appeal to camera enthusiasts than mainstream Android buyers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canon announces EOS R3 pro mirrorless camera in development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_5I8F-4sqPa9LkxkctrTQ1TnODM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69123207/eosr3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLALPV"&gt;Last month Nikon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22322684/nikon-z9-flagship-mirrorless-camera-development-announced-2021"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the development of its highest-end mirrorless camera to date, and now Canon has responded with the &lt;a href="https://global.canon/en/news/2021/20210414.html"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of the EOS R3, which ought to fit in a similar bracket. The R3 is still in development and details are thin, but it’s clear that it’ll be positioned above the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318398/canon-eos-r5-announced-8k-price-specs-release-date"&gt;EOS R5&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently Canon’s flagship mirrorless camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1PkjC"&gt;Like Nikon’s upcoming Z9, the EOS R3 looks to be a hefty camera with a built-in vertical grip for shooting in portrait and landscape orientations. The body design and control layout is broadly similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21054254/canon-eos-1d-x-mark-iii-professional-dslr-announcement-news-price-specs-ces-2020"&gt;EOS-1D X Mark III&lt;/a&gt;, Canon’s highest-end pro DSLR, and the body features dust and water resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1YASK"&gt;Canon says the EOS R3 will be the first camera to use a new 35mm full-frame stacked CMOS sensor with backside illumination, and its image processor and electronic shutter will allow for 30fps shooting with AF and AE tracking. Canon is touting the EOS R3’s autofocus capabilities, too. It’s the first digital camera from the company with eye-control AF, and a deep-learning algorithm has been used to improve recognition of human subjects from the torso up, which is said to help its performance in challenging situations like sports photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VboGJ1"&gt;That’s about it for details from Canon; the company hasn’t given any detailed specs, let alone a price or a release date. But together with Nikon’s Z9 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250448/sony-alpha-1-camera-announced-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Sony’s new A1&lt;/a&gt;, the pro mirrorless camera wars are heating up — and the EOS R3’s name implies Canon may have something even higher-end in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ludwig ends his 31-day stream by breaking Ninja’s all-time sub record</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x_hJP-4_bvzHZvKLCvV5DI0UgZI=/229x0:2640x1607/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69123034/Screen_Shot_2021_04_13_at_9.04.34_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g6Hjph"&gt;Near the end, Ludwig Ahgren slept a lot. Nestled in his race car bed with a blanket over his face and something new playing in the bottom corner of his screen, Ahgren exuded exhaustion. It was after all another day in the streamer’s Twitch subathon; he’d been live &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352226/ludwig-subathon-twitch-live-two-weeks-straight"&gt;since March 14th&lt;/a&gt;, and now there was less than an hour left on the clock. Though as he knew, this had happened before. A number close to zero was no guarantee that the stream would end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sp1vah"&gt;Except this time was different, because he’d finally reached the limit he’d set for himself — 31 straight days of streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwBsrt"&gt;Since he started his subathon, Ahgren had become the most subscribed to streamer on Twitch. On the 13th, the day before he took his subathon live, he’d amassed 1,730 subs, per the stat site &lt;a href="https://twitchtracker.com/subscribers"&gt;Twitch Tracker&lt;/a&gt;. By April 1st, he had 160,138. As of April 4th, that number had jumped to 183,191. By the 13th, he had just shy of 262,000. When the stream ended on April 14th at 12AM ET, as more than 225,000 people watched, he had more than 282,000 subs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrZEVh"&gt;At one point early on, Ahgren’s channel became the most viewed on the entire website while he was sleeping. It didn’t seem like the accolades were worth much, with 38 or so minutes remaining on the clock once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wtm9ay"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ludwig had been live since March 14th&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jyL7S5"&gt;Though that was always subject to change at the whims of his fans, whose number had ballooned because his stunt had gone viral. Every subscription to his channel added 10 seconds to the clock, though anyone who tried to donate more than 100 subs was instantly banned. Ludwig had also said that the stream would end after 31 days no matter what — because I think he knew that given the chance the Twitch community would keep him live forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RiHCNW"&gt;Users in the chat swung between wanting him to stay live and wanting to free him; either way, the subathon had slipped into the realm of performance art by the time Ahgren woke up on April 1st, blinking slowly and taking in his fate. By the end of the day it was clear he would have to spend another night on air. On April 2nd, as the clock ticked down from 15 minutes, Ahgren’s mods were playing a digital marble race on stream with some of the 60,000-odd people in chat. On the morning of April 4th, as the timer hovered just under ten minutes, Ahgren slept while a lo-fi remix of Zelda’s Lullaby played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZqOJX"&gt;On the afternoon of the 13th, the final day, Ahgren’s sub count ticket upward again — he was trying to break Tyler “Ninja” Blevins’ all time subscription record of 269,154. The money from this day’s subs was pledged to the Humane Society and St. Jude’s, while a dollar from every single sub from the first 29 days of Ahgren’s stream had been pledged to the charity No Kid Hungry.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LXKbCB"&gt;And then he did it. “Relax! It’s fine now,” he said, listening to a speech from a football movie that was intended to hype up his viewers. This was it. This was the end. He’d done it, whatever it was he’d set out to achieve. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Overwatch League is bringing back some live matches with a trio of events in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qY6-nlNd9QU77-tTPmHtkOlNkAc=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69123020/NYXL_Fan_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A 2020 &lt;/em&gt;Overwatch&lt;em&gt; League match at the Hammerstein&amp;nbsp;Ballroom in New York.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: steadyprime&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;NYXL.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ao1T5G"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League kicks off its fourth season this week, and while the majority of matches will be played remotely, today the league announced plans to hold multiple live events in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Or9Cj6"&gt;There will be three events spread across three cities — Hangzhou in June, Shanghai in July, and Guangzhou in August — and the league says they will take place in venues with reduced capacity “in order to comply with local safety requirements.” The events will be something of a hybrid between online and in-person competition. Here’s how OWL describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MVt7Ip"&gt;The five China-based teams — Hunters, Charge, Spark, Valiant, and Dragons — plan to travel to each of the events to compete onstage, while the three Korea-based teams — NYXL, Fusion, and Dynasty — are not expected to travel. Matches taking place between a China-based team and a Korea-based team will feature the Chinese team competing onstage while their opponent competes from Korea remotely on our cloud tournament server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="H24x3x"&gt;Like most esports leagues, OWL was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21229380/overwatch-league-remote-cloud-production-studio-esports-blizzard"&gt;forced to pivot last year to online competition due&lt;/a&gt; to the ongoing pandemic; even the championship match &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21324550/overwatch-league-owl-esports-grand-finals-championship"&gt;featured pro teams playing remotely&lt;/a&gt;. The change was particularly big for OWL, as the league — which features 20 squads based in 19 cities across North America, Europe, and Asia — was preparing for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21122974/overwatch-league-season-3-preview-youtube-hero-pool-china-travel"&gt;its first season where teams would play matches in home venues&lt;/a&gt;. While the majority of the 2021 season is still expected to take place remotely, today’s news is an important step for OWL getting back to its original goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcSQoK"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League’s 2021 season begins on April 16th, with &lt;a href="https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/schedule"&gt;a huge slate of matches&lt;/a&gt; throughout the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next Oculus Quest 2 update brings native wireless PC streaming and a 120Hz mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2agmEsdLvOaxP3_N7oh0SeRVYus=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69122363/akrales_200904_4160_0135.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nEXegS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fintroducing-oculus-air-link-a-wireless-way-to-play-pc-vr-games-on-oculus-quest-2-plus-infinite-office-updates-support-for-120-hz-on-quest-2-and-more%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus is announcing&lt;/a&gt; that wireless PC streaming, a 120Hz refresh rate, and improvements to Infinite Office will be coming to the Oculus Quest 2 with the v28 software update, which the company says will be rolling out soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYFi3f"&gt;Infinite Office is a feature that Oculus includes as part of Oculus Home, which lets users work in a virtual environment. With the v28 update, Infinite Office will have an experimental feature that allows users to add a virtual desk where their real-life desk is, letting users know where they can sit and put real-life physical objects down without having to leave VR. The Quest 2 will also be able to show a virtual representation of the Logitech K830 keyboard, though Facebook says that support for visualizing more keyboard models will be coming in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4zs3e"&gt;Another feature coming with the update is the ability to stream games or applications from your desktop PC wirelessly. Oculus calls its wireless streaming feature Air Link, named after the Link cable that can be used to connect the headset to a PC. The feature will only work well with some network setups — the instructions to turn it on are pretty clear that you’ll need good Wi-Fi to get an acceptable experience, and that the Link cable will still provide the best visual quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LlEM1"&gt;Facebook says that it hasn’t ruled out the possibility of bringing Air Link to the original Quest at some point in the future, but it does say that it’s “focused on optimizing Air Link to be the best possible experience for Quest 2 first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zfbBCd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use your Oculus Quest 2 to play any PC VR game wirelessly","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0hDalX"&gt;We do know that the original Quest hardware is capable of wireless PC streaming, because indie developer Guy Godin has built it into his app, Virtual Desktop. The app gives users a virtual space to use their computers in, and it also supports streaming games over Wi-Fi. This is, however, where we have to talk about the controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAyS5e"&gt;If you thought the description of Virtual Desktop sounded a little like Facebook’s Infinite Office, you’re not alone — Godin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"&gt;has been talking about&lt;/a&gt; how Facebook has been essentially building his app idea into its own Oculus experience then offering it for free for a while now. His case may have been helped by the fact that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301151/oculus-store-virtual-desktop-native-pc-vr-game-streaming-quest-2"&gt;Facebook blocked the update that allowed Virtual Desktop to be used wirelessly&lt;/a&gt; until early this year, requiring users to go through a complicated sideload procedure to get the functionality working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwGvg0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-quest-air-link-120/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; talked to Godin&lt;/a&gt; about Facebook introducing Air Link, and got this comment from him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZxUTGH"&gt;“In 2017, Facebook copied the base functionality of Virtual Desktop on Rift and incorporated it in their platform, essentially making my app obsolete. I’m not surprised to see them do this again on Quest. They copied the fitness tracking app YUR last year and released Oculus Move; essentially killing the company. They also released App Lab as they saw how popular SideQuest was. That’s what they do. If you have a popular app on Quest today, expect Facebook to copy you and leave you in the dust. As for the fate of Virtual Desktop on Quest, we will have to see how Facebook’s solution competes. Judging by the number of issues plaguing Oculus Link today, I’m confident Virtual Desktop will remain a valuable solution for a while. I’ve also got a lot of cool features in the works that I can’t wait to share with the community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KDku86"&gt;Despite the warnings about Facebook copying ideas, he still seems confident in his ability to compete. It’s an open question as to how well Air Link will work initially, and how fast improvements will come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hVu8K1"&gt;The update also includes an experimental mode for 120Hz refresh rates, up from the current 90Hz, and the original 72Hz. It’s a slight delay from Oculus’ &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/facebook-hints-oculus-quest-2-120hz-refresh-rate/"&gt;original estimated March launch&lt;/a&gt;. Oculus’ post hints that you many not immediately get to try it out — the Quest 2’s software will still run at 90Hz, so you won’t get to see what it looks like until developers release builds of their games and software that can run at the higher refresh rate. The wait may not be that long, though: Guy Godin &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VRDesktop/status/1382116851551899648?s=20"&gt;has already tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that he’s got a 120Hz update for Virtual Desktop ready to go when v28 becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
