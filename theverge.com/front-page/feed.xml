    <title>YouTube’s ‘supervised experiences’ help parents choose what content their kids can see</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJa41hIVcbnlTRHHbR5oRdm5YjE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867114/Supervised_Experiences.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5nPYd3"&gt;YouTube is announcing “supervised experiences,” a new set of restrictions that allows parents to better control what content their children can access on the streaming video platform. According to a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supervised-experiences-for-families-on-youtube"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube hopes the filters will help parents slowly introduce their older children to age-appropriate content and features outside of the YouTube Kids app. The program will launch first with an early beta, with a wider beta rolling out “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="psHndH"&gt;Parents have three levels of strictness to choose from, which determines the content a child is allowed to view on their account. There’s the “Explore” level, which YouTube says is “generally suitable” for kids nine and up’ “Explore More,” which is meant for kids 13 and up; and “Most of YouTube,” which is pretty much everything except age-restricted content. In the US, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409#zippy="&gt;and most other countries&lt;/a&gt;, people over the age of 13 can make their own unsupervised YouTube accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h0p8OAQ5nQ_TrCUvkoYNedOn8XM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324445/Supervised_Experiences_Content_settings.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parents choose a content level for their children’s account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EpUbXH"&gt;It isn’t clear exactly what content will be allowed at which levels, but YouTube says the “Explore” level will have “vlogs, tutorials, gaming videos, music clips, news, educational content and more.” As the name suggests, the “Explore More” level will have a wider range of videos, as well as live streams for the aforementioned “Explore” categories. The company says that “Most of YouTube” will contain “sensitive topics that may only be appropriate for older teens.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9lClh"&gt;For all its promise, YouTube’s supervised experiences is still a system that relies on user input, human review, and machine learning. YouTube knows it won’t be perfect, admitting that it “will make mistakes,” which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/culture/2017/11/21/16685874/kids-youtube-video-elsagate-creepiness-psychology"&gt;we’ve seen happen with the Kids app&lt;/a&gt;. As such, parents shouldn’t think of it as a “set it and forget it” solution. They’ll still need to remain vigilant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmQEq9"&gt;Nevertheless, the new content options should help parents with children who feel too confined by the Kids app (which YouTube still recommends for younger kids) but are too impressionable to be exposed to the full YouTube experience. YouTube can be a dangerous place full of misinformation and conspiracy, so it’s good to see Google giving parents tools to help ease their children into it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring’s new Video Doorbell Pro 2 captures a taller image and has enhanced motion detection</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zrbI4rsqudgtwZfu9Zn77VuHzzc=/132x0:1770x1092/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867093/Ring_Video_Doorbell_Pro_2_intro_desktop_1456x546_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RyNQEl"&gt;Ring has announced the latest model in its line of video doorbells, the Video Doorbell Pro 2. The Pro 2 is a new top-of-the-line model that comes with a number of enhancements over its predecessor, including a taller field of view and enhanced motion detection capabilities. It is available to preorder for $249.99 starting today, with shipments expected to begin on March 31st, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wwPOU"&gt;The most significant update for the Pro 2 is its new square video capture. First popularized by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17312166/nest-hello-yale-lock-smart-home-review"&gt;Google’s Nest Hello&lt;/a&gt; and adopted by many other video doorbells, this field of view makes it possible to see who is at your door from head to toe. It also makes it possible to see when packages are left on the ground in front of the doorbell. The Pro 2 captures a 1536 x 1536 pixel image and is the first Ring model to not use the traditional 16:9 wide view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbeAwA"&gt;The second big upgrade is in the Pro 2’s motion detection. Ring is calling this new feature “3D Motion Detection” and says it allows you to “pin point the location and time a motion event begins.” In addition, a new Bird’s Eye View shows you a top-down image of the motion detected, letting you see where someone traversed your property from above. Ring says it’s possible to customize the specific point where the new motion detection and video recording begins, thanks to new radar sensors on the Pro 2. You can also customize other motion and privacy zones, much like you can do with Ring’s other cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FHDBOgFOEw9-aCe7C9nhYd1h4WE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324548/ring_video_doorbell_wired_pro_head_to_toe_desktop_715x883_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Video Doorbell Pro 2 captures a square video image, allowing you to see someone head to toe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NHTqH-liv8YBvpftqUbjJSKS3c8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324552/card_app_timeline_doorbell_pro2_469x469_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pro 2 has a new motion detection system that gives you a top-down view of detected motion events.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0P1ZCY"&gt;Ring also says the Pro 2’s audio features have been improved with an array microphone, and new preset replies can be set for when you’re not home. Those who subscribe to a Ring Protect Plan can utilize &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22279020/alexa-ring-doorbell-greeting-quick-replies"&gt;Alexa Greetings&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a more advanced answering machine service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvxvIy"&gt;Like the prior Video Doorbell Pro, the Pro 2 is a wired model and does not use a battery. That means you need to have doorbell wiring in place or be willing to wire power to it if you want to install it at your door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iOFJ2"&gt;Competition in the video doorbell space has heated up a bit in the past few years, with a number of new entrants bringing innovative features to the space. Ring, which can be credited with popularizing the idea of a video doorbell, has mostly been criticized for its privacy policies and police partnerships over the past few years. That hasn’t stopped it from being the most common video doorbell and the de facto brand when people think of this product category. The Pro 2 is Ring’s answer to a lot of those new competitors, and it will be interesting to see how it performs once we’re able to give it a test.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP is buying gaming accessory brand HyperX for $425 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q1M6Wly11Dc6tj33nCDS-g3M6a0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68866993/cfaulkner_201016_4245_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3O5w1x"&gt;HP has announced that it is &lt;a href="https://press.hp.com/us/en/press-releases/2021/hp-inc-to-acquire-hyperx.html"&gt;acquiring gaming peripheral company HyperX&lt;/a&gt; for $425 million. The purchase will give HP a major foothold in the gaming accessory market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2Sna6"&gt;This transaction will result in HP buying the HyperX brand from Kingston, the current owner, but HP notes in the announcement post that “Kingston will retain the DRAM, flash, and SSD products for gamers and enthusiasts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdivnM"&gt;HP has been making strides to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21274815/hp-omen-gaming-mice-vector-essential-x1000-wireless-pc-ps4-headset"&gt;enter the gaming peripheral space&lt;/a&gt; for the last several years under the Omen brand, but it has not gained much traction compared to competitors such as Corsair, Logitech, and Razer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2BHrb"&gt;HyperX is one of the most notable brands in this market, with gaming accessories including its line of &lt;a href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/unitedstates/us/headsets"&gt;Cloud headsets&lt;/a&gt;, which are among the bestselling gaming headsets right now. Gaming headsets aside, HyperX’s portfolio has a variety of gaming accessories from gaming keyboards to microphones. Most recently, HyperX announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22203383/hyperx-alloy-origins-60-percent-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-price-release-date"&gt;first 60 percent mechanical gaming keyboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon’s 25th anniversary: celebrating more than two decades of pocket monsters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nI9iJAYdP9jfkq-00bnDjpwjQos=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68866986/ddeahl_170722_1861_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Still haven’t caught ‘em all&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="4NOWN6"&gt;In 1996, a pair of cute monster-collecting roleplaying games launched on the Game Boy, giving birth to one of the biggest entertainment franchises on the planet. Over the last 25 years, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; has continued to be a massively popular RPG series, but it has also spawned plentiful spinoff games, movies, shows, and more — from the early days of &lt;em&gt;Red&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Blue&lt;/em&gt; to the phenomenon of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; to the surprise hit &lt;em&gt;Detective Pikachu&lt;/em&gt;. At &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, we’re using this anniversary as a chance to explore how &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; evolved over the years and where it may be headed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon makes an intimidating genre approachable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EwOXQiJEegiK9Pb17QJIrwjCL4g=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68866945/akrales_160226_0960_0069_A.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G8jKAg"&gt;Roleplaying games represent some of the most beloved titles ever created. Series like &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls&lt;/em&gt; are filled with huge, immersive worlds and deep lore to be explored. Yet, that scale and complexity can also make the genre seem overwhelming. What makes &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;stand out is its ability to attract a wide audience. It’s a perfect entry point for an otherwise intimidating genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OVNhw"&gt;As the series turns 25 years old this year, the charm found in the first installments has been preserved and retained throughout the eight generations of the franchise. The format has stayed consistent; unlike typical RPGs with their elaborate and grandiose narratives, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;maintains a very relaxed pace with a clear goal in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gf80LF"&gt;Each &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game starts the same: you’re a child looking to begin your adventure as a pokémon&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;trainer. Immediately, developer Game Freak makes it clear that you are about to begin an epic adventure, and you have some freedom on how you proceed — from the starter pokémon you select at the beginning to the type of creatures you choose to have on your team as you make your way through the region. The ultimate goal in each game is typically to become the Pokémon&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;League champion. But how you go about it is entirely up to you. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Avut8rF6vUnkN2-FCbRmBg1_yoo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6128567/akrales_160226_0960_0036_A.0.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even 25 years later, Pokémon Red and Blue are still good entry points to the RPG genre.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9gfOiJ"&gt;The combat in the game takes all of the core elements from turn-based RPGs like &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; and streamlines it into “types.” Each pokémon has at least one type filled with strengths and weaknesses. The strategy is to figure out which pokémon is affected by certain types and use it to become victorious in your battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHOj71"&gt;RPGs can be intimidating for two reasons: one they’re long, typically spanning dozens of hours. The core &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; adventures are comparatively brisk. But games in this genre also tend to have complicated systems, in terms of how the combat mechanics work as well as the characters that aid you on your journey. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;gets around this not only by streamlining many of the systems, but also by giving players clear directions. From type advantages to the differences in the level of your team, players will learn most of the key concepts in the early moments of your game just by talking to characters. One of the series’s most important features — the pokédex — is a clever tool that teaches players about the game while also encouraging them to explore the world further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="r9yuDA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pokémon has yet to lose its sense of relevancy because of its approachable nature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JoitTP"&gt;What makes &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; so great is you can also learn about it &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of the game. For the multiplayer aspects of the game, you can learn things by talking with friends, which plays into how &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; is cleverly disguised as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22289300/pokemon-25-anniversary-red-blue-gameboy-nintendo-co-op"&gt;a single-player game, emphasizing multiplayer through socialization&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; has also expanded into other forms of media, most notably the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/8/17835396/pokemon-pikachu-20-year-look-back-1998-childrens-television"&gt;anime series&lt;/a&gt;, which does a superb job of explaining the core concepts of the game, while also maintaining its own identity and quirks that keep it from being a carbon copy of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jb53MH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;is often criticized for how slowly it evolves from one game to the next, but this relative simplicity remains one of its biggest strengths in the series. As the franchise has continued to spawn new entries, it continues to add on to its already accessible gameplay mechanics while still managing to retain the straightforward and easy approach to turn-based RPG gameplay. Within this accessible framework, there are so many ways to master the experience. It’s this freedom to choose how you play that makes it so beloved by different types of players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZMDJD"&gt;Over the last 25 years, roleplaying games have expanded in all sorts of ways, with new subgenres and features like online play, but &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;has yet to lose that sense of relevancy because of its approachable nature. That’s what lured me to the series as a five-year-old girl playing on the Game Boy — and I haven’t stopped playing RPGs since.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s new hacking label has already been hacked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qVkCVarBVOoFMknYX5VKJnojBqE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68866891/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pQU4et"&gt;Twitter has started to label some tweets with a warning about materials “obtained through hacking.” This new label is appearing on some news stories that Twitter believes are based on hacks and leaked documents, but Twitter users have found an easy way to hack a URL together to make it appear on any tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6zvM3"&gt;The new label appeared on a story from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheGrayzoneNews/status/1363275582784552962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1363275582784552962%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Ftwitter-hacked-materials-warning-label%2F"&gt;independent outlet &lt;em&gt;The Grayzone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week. If you share the URL of this particular story, it will generate the warning. But Twitter also displays the warning if you trick it into doing so by using a specially crafted link to a genuine URL combined with the flagged one. This tricks Twitter’s card-based system into accidentally flagging tweets with this new warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IdtIY6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/YfzHLKh4Ya"&gt;https://t.co/YfzHLKh4Ya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1364549361389174785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CufRkK"&gt;The warning trick works on both web and Twitter’s mobile apps for iOS and Android, and it even appears to crash the Android version if you attempt to like a tweet that includes this new label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQgzN2"&gt;Twitter’s new controversial hacked materials warning comes after the company was criticized for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519133/twitter-changing-hacked-materials-biden-dorsey-election"&gt;blocking links to &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; stories about Joe Biden’s son&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter quickly reversed its decision to block links and put a policy in place to use these warning labels instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6Q9Io"&gt;This appears to be one of the first times we’ve seen this label in action as part of &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/hacked-materials"&gt;Twitter’s hacked materials policy&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter has also used similar labels for combating misleading COVID-19 information and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271207/twitter-donald-trump-fact-check-mail-in-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-california"&gt;Trump’s myriad of misleading and false tweets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeGXXJ"&gt;We’ve reached out to Twitter for comment on when the company will fix its new label, and we’ll update you accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now embed Pinterest Pins in Microsoft Word and OneNote</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WR9dXJ"&gt;Microsoft is now allowing Word for web and OneNote users to embed Pinterest Pins into their documents. The new feature lets Pinterest users paste a URL of any Pin into a OneNote page or Word document to render it as interactive content. This adds a new way to create pages, sections, or notebooks full of Pinterest content in OneNote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmuNnl"&gt;The embeds also work in Word, but only on the web version right now. You can embed Pinterest content into a Word document online, and it will be displayed when you open the document on the mobile or web versions of Word.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pinterest integration in OneNote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jMsh73"&gt;Microsoft is targeting this new feature at schools and students, particularly the OneNote embeds for Pinterest. “Over the past few years, we have heard many requests for a Pinterest integration with OneNote,” &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/education-blog/pinterest-pins-can-now-be-interactively-embedded-into-onenote/ba-p/2147687"&gt;explains Mike Tholfsen&lt;/a&gt;, a product manager on Microsoft’s education team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OG2iNn"&gt;The Pinterest support for Word and OneNote follows similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262098/microsoft-edge-sidebar-search-pinterest-integration-features"&gt;integration in Microsoft’s Edge browser&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft built Pinterest support directly into its new Collections feature inside Edge last year, allowing Pinterest users to export these collections of links, images, and text directly to Pinterest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXBrg5"&gt;Microsoft has also reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22277845/microsoft-pinterest-acquisition-azure-cloud-services-rumors"&gt;been trying to acquire Pinterest recently&lt;/a&gt;. The&lt;em&gt; Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;reported earlier this month that the software maker had approached Pinterest in recent months about a deal but that talks aren’t currently active.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Echo Show 10 review: Alexa’s next move</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The new Show is the first smart display that can follow you around&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6UFUZ4"&gt;Since its inception in 2015, Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant has always been a disembodied digital form trapped in a box of electronics. The original Echo was a cylinder, later models have had a spherical shape, and the Echo Show devices are effectively wedges with screens on the front. Alexa behaves in the same way on all of them: you ask it to do something, then it provides a polite response and does that thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcNdJF"&gt;The new $249.99 Echo Show 10, which starts shipping on February 25th, is the first Alexa-powered device that is more than just a speaker or a screen sitting on your shelf. It is, simply put, an Alexa device that moves — just a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLy078"&gt;The Echo Show 10’s motorized base allows Alexa to spin the screen around so it is facing you, and the built-in camera and tracking algorithms allow it to keep the screen pointed in your direction whenever you’re using it. It’s a little glimpse into a future Alexa robot that could become much more than a voice powered remote control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJYk58"&gt;It’s just a glimpse, though, and Alexa in the new Echo Show 10 is largely the same Alexa you get on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17944022/new-amazon-echo-show-review-2018-alexa-speaker-video-camera"&gt;prior Echo Show&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16161058/amazon-echo-show-alexa-dot-which-one-to-buy"&gt;every other Alexa-powered smart display&lt;/a&gt;. You ask it for information — a weather report, a favorite playlist, news, calendar appointments, and so on — and it will give you a polite response and show the requested information on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J54TY7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10358206"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/82YXK0b6B3tWq2Oty8yKeQgmpEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324183/dseifert_210219_4433_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon says the Show 10’s ability to move makes it easier to follow a recipe with it&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="2xeMCC"&gt;Unlike the prior Echo Show models, which all share a similar wedge shape, the Echo Show 10 has a completely new design, with a floating touchscreen above a cylindrical base. This allows the Show 10 to do two things the prior version couldn’t: tilt its screen and spin around nearly 360 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyNgWV"&gt;Tilting the screen requires you to manually pivot the screen forward or back, but the spinning happens automatically thanks to the silent brushless motor inside the base of the Show 10. Both of these capabilities make it much easier to position the screen just right, whether you are using it to watch &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; on Netflix (yes, the Echo Show supports Netflix now!) or place a video call to a family member across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzepe0"&gt;Along with that motor, the base houses three speakers: a 3-inch downward-facing woofer and two 1-inch tweeters, which are positioned just below the screen. This ensures that whenever the screen is facing you, the speakers are as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnkwEN"&gt;The display is the same 10.1-inch, 1280 x 800 touchscreen from the prior model. It’s certainly far from the highest resolution screen in your home, but it’s vibrant and bright enough to see from a few feet away. Around the display is a chunky bezel, which isn’t a problem I will care about until Amazon comes out with a model that has a thinner, more modern bezel that immediately makes this one look silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nP3xuXiiAj2g0xXJ6jcfzSqLwsw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324186/dseifert_210219_4433_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The top edge of the Echo Show 10 has a slider to block the camera, as well as volume and mute buttons&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F4XEAxjPv5vqSogVyKyJqX6mo6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324185/dseifert_210219_4433_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;From the side you can see the Echo Show 10’s base, which houses the motor and all of the speakers.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6Nawrb"&gt;The top edge of the screen has a mute button, volume up and down, and a shutter that you can use to block the view of the camera. The prior 10-inch Echo Show didn’t have a physical shutter, though Amazon did add it to the smaller &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="as9xdE"&gt;In the upper right corner of the bezel is a new 13-megapixel camera. The camera is a central component for the Echo Show 10’s ability to track your position and move itself accordingly. Amazon tells me it uses echolocation and computer vision to place your location and spin the screen around to face you, even as you move throughout the room. All of this processing happens locally on the device — unlike voice commands you say to Alexa, which are primarily processed remotely on Amazon’s servers. You can turn off this movement in the settings or with voice commands or simply slide the shutter closed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-pPU4QIQAp-zFnjLpO4DdYKCZwg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324187/dseifert_210219_4433_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Echo Show 10’s camera has been upgraded to 13 megapixels and can digitally zoom and pan to keep you in view during video calls.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EJM5Pk"&gt;This new design, which you can get in either a dark charcoal or light gray color, means you have to be more conscious of where you place the Echo Show 10 to get the most out of it. Whereas the prior model’s shape encouraged you to shove it in a corner of a countertop, the new Echo Show needs room to do its spinning dance. You can limit the range of motion it has depending on where you place it, and if the Show hits an obstacle while moving, it will ask if you want it to remember that obstacle is there and limit its movement accordingly. But if you want to let the Show spread its wings as much as possible, you won’t want to put it in the corner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPuGpJ"&gt;Those requirements make the Echo Show 10 a much more obvious device in your home than before. It has to sit out in the open to really benefit from its unique abilities and its miniature vintage iMac looks command a bit more attention than the older model. The best position I could find for the Show 10 in my home was on the standing height countertop that separates the kitchen from the dining room. From there, the Show 10 could spin relatively freely and follow me as I moved from the kitchen to the dining room and back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U-YExrNRqCd5cBLlVLAV7RKxUHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324184/dseifert_210219_4433_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The screen is the same as before, but now you can tilt it to adjust the view.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="hlJlW7"&gt;The Echo Show will only move when you interact with it, so don’t expect it to be a little robot with personality sitting on your counter. That was the biggest draw for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682780/jibo-death-server-update-social-robot-mourning"&gt;ill-fated Jibo, which was &lt;/a&gt;designed specifically around its robotic personality and would “wake up”, turn towards you and greet you whenever you enter the room. The Echo Show 10 will remain stationary and dormant until you ask it for something or touch the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEmGzR"&gt;Once you utter a voice command or tap the screen, the Show 10 will come to life, rotating itself so that it is always facing you. If it is playing music, a video, a recipe, or any other ongoing thing, it will continue to rotate itself automatically as you move around the room. Amazon touts this as being particularly useful when following a recipe, as the screen is always visible to you as you move around gathering ingredients and following steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwC45z"&gt;It’s also much easier to use for video calls than the prior Echo Show, which always had a fixed field of view. Now the Show will use its much higher resolution camera to digitally zoom and track you when on a video call (just like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling"&gt;Facebook Portal&lt;/a&gt;) to keep you in frame. Add the ability to tilt the screen and the motorized movement and video calling is a much better experience than before. Amazon says this subject tracking works across group calling, Skype, and will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;work with Zoom&lt;/a&gt; when support for that comes out. The effect is subtle, but it will generally try to keep you in the center of the field of view and roughly the same size (about from your head to your waist), even when you move away from the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xP4uy"&gt;You can also tap into the camera’s feed from the Alexa app wherever you have an internet connection, turning it into a makeshift home security camera. You can even remotely pan the camera around the room using the motorized base. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Google’s Nest Hub Max smart display&lt;/a&gt; has a similar security camera feature (minus the motorized movement) and Amazon says it plans to bring it to older Echo Show devices, as well. You can also use the camera’s people detection abilities to trigger routines through the Alexa app, such as for automatically turning lights on or controlling other smart home gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Ij7xRrLwnJA6EbdREc6aZD79JU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324190/dseifert_210219_4433_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Echo Show 10 supports video calling to phones via the Alexa app, as well as Skype. Zoom support is coming later, according to Amazon.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fHQoU6"&gt;But beyond just moving the screen so it faces you as best it can, the experience of actually using the Echo Show 10 isn’t much different than the prior versions. This is still very much a voice-first experience — you say “Alexa,” ask it to do something, and it does it. Amazon has made some minor tweaks to the software so the screen will sometimes show you more information than it used to, but for the most part, it isn’t as transformative to use in practice as it might seem on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EKvhO"&gt;The movement also makes the Show behave in weird ways. It’s difficult to touch the screen or use the volume buttons on the top edge whenever the Show 10 is playing something because the camera’s view easily gets blocked and the Show will wiggle side-to-side to try and get you in frame again. If you do successfully touch the screen or adjust the tilt angle while it’s moving, the Show will sometimes complain that an obstacle was in its way and will cease motion until you toggle the feature off and back on again. Amazon says both of these things are by design, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/66l8vfDIkAP_7XBqOSsFqz4jXEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324193/dseifert_210219_4433_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;News reports are accompanied by a visual animation on the Echo Show 10.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CbSOIE"&gt;And despite Amazon’s claims that the Echo Show 10 is always in view when you need it, the reality is that pivoting the screen around a fixed point doesn’t really make the Show 10 any easier to use when cooking or actively moving around a room. Sure, it might be facing me a little more directly when I look over my shoulder while going from the refrigerator to the counter, but it’s not that hard to see what’s on the screen on the prior model from an oblique angle. Until the Echo Show 10 can actually get up from its spot and move around — or even float, &lt;em&gt;Jetson’s&lt;/em&gt;-style — it still requires that you walk up to it to interact or really see what it’s trying to show you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cr8YtH"&gt;Still, there’s something weird and disconcerting about a screen that follows my movement as I go from the kitchen to the dining room. The Show 10’s tracking abilities will lose me if I walk too fast or if I go outside of its (surprisingly generous) range, but for the most part, if I’m in view of the screen when it’s playing something, the screen is pointed in my direction, looking at me with its one eye. It takes getting used to and I’m not sure I’m there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="WGRWhp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10358289"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8SOt3J"&gt;Thanks to that new three-speaker system, the Echo Show 10 does sound good for listening to music. It can fill a room with ease, though the bass tends to get boomy, like most other Echo devices. A quick adjustment to the EQ in the Alexa app takes care of that easily enough, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zNcNB"&gt;I was less impressed by the trick of making sure all of the speakers face you all the time — there just wasn’t much of a difference in sound quality between when they &lt;em&gt;weren’t&lt;/em&gt; exactly pointed in my direction and when they were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJfUmw"&gt;Amazon has borrowed some features from its competitors to improve the display. Most notably, it has the ability to tune the screen’s colors to the lighting in the room, which should improve how photos appear on the screen. It’s not as good as the Google Nest Hub at this trick, but it’s better than it used to be. The big limitation with using the Echo Show 10 as a digital photo frame remains that you have to have your images in Amazon’s Photos service or uploaded to Facebook, neither of which are things I personally use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmHC74"&gt;Since the last iteration of the 10-inch Echo Show was released almost three years ago, Amazon has increased the number of video services that you can watch on the screen. The big recent addition is Netflix, but you can also watch Hulu or Amazon Prime video on it. Sadly, it’s still lacking access to other services, including HBO Max, Apple TV Plus, Peacock, YouTube TV, and more, despite the fact that Amazon supports most of them on its Fire TV devices. Watching YouTube videos also remains a laughably bad experience that involves launching the Echo Show 10’s built-in web browser with a voice command, then manually searching for a video you want to watch. There’s still no way to cast a video from your phone to the Echo Show 10, which remains an annoying limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8cRrzCbJztw9-ZtIvY7D1hVmj-o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324191/dseifert_210219_4433_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;You can disable the Echo Show 10’s motion via voice or touch controls.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="WtOkcy"&gt;I have lived with an Echo Show in my kitchen for over three years and even though I find its functionality limited, my family and I do get a lot of value out of it. We manage our shared grocery list through it, we get weather and news reports from it, we listen to music from Spotify on it, we control smart home gadgets with it, and we ask it for answers to random trivia whenever the mood strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPH19s"&gt;I had hoped that the new Echo Show, with its new pivoting screen and tracking abilities, would add even more to that experience. But for the most part, the new Echo Show isn’t much better than the prior model at all of the things that we use it for. The one area that the updated model has notably improved is video calls, but as I said earlier, that’s just not something we use the Echo Show for in my home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAV6PF"&gt;The real value of the Echo Show 10, then, is that it’s neat. It’s a new spin on the smart display that we haven’t seen before, and it’s fun, if a bit awkward at first, to watch it do its thing. But I wouldn’t call it necessary, and if you have the prior Echo Show, you don’t gain much by upgrading. (If you really want the camera shutter, a little electrical tape goes a long way.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sB3fIJ"&gt;I’m more excited about where Amazon will go next — after all, rumors the company is working on an Alexa-powered robot have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/23/17270002/amazon-robot-home-alexa-echo"&gt;been around&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691540/amazon-home-robot-high-end-echo-report-bloomberg"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps I’ll wait for Alexa’s next move.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="dl1riq"&gt;Swedish electronics house Teenage Engineering, best known for its range of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495233/teenage-engineering-ob-4-radio-speaker-rewind-loop-feature-price-release-date"&gt;beautifully designed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538171/teenage-engineering-pocket-operator-capcom-mega-man-street-fighter-price-release-date"&gt;audio products&lt;/a&gt;, is working with Nothing on its upcoming product releases. Nothing is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22250653/nothing-brand-oneplus-carl-pei-announcement-consumer-technology-smart-devices"&gt;new consumer tech brand&lt;/a&gt; from ex-OnePlus exec Carl Pei. Pei says that Teenage Engineering is one of Nothing’s founding partners, and will drive the design aesthetic at his new company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjVJai"&gt;Pei says that he’s already worked with Teenage Engineering to create a product roadmap “that’s unique and true to Nothing’s vision.” Nothing’s first product is a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274087/nothing-carl-pei-true-wireless-headphones-smart-devices-summer"&gt;wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, due for release this summer. It’ll be curious to see what design cues they take from Teenage Engineering’s &lt;a href="https://teenage.engineering/products/op-z/m-1"&gt;M-1 headphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ig7RdH"&gt;Nothing says that Teenage Engineering’s co-founder and CEO Jesper Kouthoofd will serve as creative lead and “visionary behind Nothing’s design world,” while Tom Howard, Teenage Engineering’s vice head of design, will be Nothing’s head of design. “After months of research and development, we are now in a place where I believe we will have something exciting to show to the world,” said Kouthoofd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTbtt2"&gt;As a reminder of the kinds of products Teenage Engineering has put out over the years, check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495233/teenage-engineering-ob-4-radio-speaker-rewind-loop-feature-price-release-date"&gt;the OB-4&lt;/a&gt;, a radio/instrument/speaker hybrid which had an endless looping tape built in, letting you manually rewind anything played on the speaker. There was also its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538171/teenage-engineering-pocket-operator-capcom-mega-man-street-fighter-price-release-date"&gt;range of $89 mini synths&lt;/a&gt; with sounds from retro Capcom titles, or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/18/18188626/teenage-engineering-debuts-pocket-operator-modular-synthesis"&gt;modular synthesizers&lt;/a&gt; it released the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok removed more than 300,000 videos for election misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mE2qh-OXSgNSRxlvPZ506r4PKYk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68866522/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WgLmpN"&gt;TikTok removed over 340,000 videos in the US for breaking the platform’s rules on election misinformation, manipulation, or disinformation, according to a Wednesday &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources/transparency-report-2020-2&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;transparency report&lt;/a&gt; covering content from the second half of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sl5NX3"&gt;A few months before the 2020 presidential election, TikTok announced that it would pair with fact-checking organizations as part of a broader effort to combat election and COVID-19 misinformation. At the time of the announcement, TikTok was under immense pressure by the Trump administration and lawmakers for its alleged ties to the Chinese government. Microsoft and Oracle were among some of the companies bidding for ownership over TikTok from ByteDance, a Chinese firm. A final deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276090/tiktok-oracle-deal-biden-trump-ban-china-bytedance-white-house"&gt;between Oracle and TikTok&lt;/a&gt; is still on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TfZtVA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A final deal between Oracle and TikTok is still on hold&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5ytt3Z"&gt;“TikTok is a diverse, global community fueled by creative expression. We work to maintain an environment where everyone feels safe to create, find community, and be entertained,” Michael Beckerman, TikTok’s vice president and head of US public policy, said &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktoks-h-2-2020-transparency-report"&gt;in a statement Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “We are committed to being transparent about how we keep our platform safe, because it helps build trust and understanding with our community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUAiKr"&gt;Outside of the videos deleted for breaking election rules, TikTok announced Wednesday that over 441,000 videos were removed from the platform’s recommendation algorithm, or the For You Page, for spreading misinformation. Shortly before the 2020 election, TikTok rolled out an election guide &lt;a href="https://www.ballotready.org/"&gt;powered by BallotReady&lt;/a&gt;, a voting information tool. That guide was available on the Discover page, and election-related videos, hashtags, and political accounts. It was visited 18,000,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsD7If"&gt;TikTok also removed 1,750,000 accounts used “for automation” throughout the course of the 2020 US election. “While it’s not known if any of the accounts were used specifically to amplify election related content, it was important to remove this set of accounts to protect the platform at this critical time,” the transparency report reads.&lt;/p&gt;
