    <title>The Google Pixel 6 Pro may have been leaked in a brief hands-on video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google’s new Pixel 6 phones, regular and Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SAHQ3fry4N3AD_R8tjhn_Eu_z2g=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890456/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WVVTzX"&gt;Google got ahead of any possible news leaks about the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;announcing the phones&lt;/a&gt; back in August, including that they would run on the company’s long-in-development Tensor chip. But it’s possible that some leakers have recently got hold of an actual unit. A video posted to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1440385355258028032"&gt;Twitter by @thisistechtoday&lt;/a&gt; may be showing off a pre-production version of the Pixel 6 Pro, complete with its triple rear camera array. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOCKvP"&gt;Of course, Google hasn’t been coy about sharing what the device will look like — even installing &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/first-look-google-puts-pixel-6-and-6-pro-on-display-at-its-nyc-store"&gt;dummy units in its NYC store for people to ogle&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, the device that’s spun around in this short clip looks like what we’ve seen so far — the strange Google logo placeholder notwithstanding. The phone in this video appears to have a hole-punch selfie camera, and all of its buttons are located along its right edge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G1CaYO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I think this may be the first hands on video leak of a Google Pixel 6 Pro. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FYI: The logo would indicate that this is likely an early production test unit, so that means there may be some differences between what you see here and the actual production device. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/teampixel?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#teampixel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/4QSvdktqA7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4QSvdktqA7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— M. Brandon Lee | THIS IS TECH TODAY (@thisistechtoday) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1440385355258028032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6hP7jt"&gt;Just like the Pixel 6 Pro renders that Google shared, the phone in this video appears to have a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0w_6uZBFl8F94sDwJAiydSFMAr4=/0x0:3840x2160/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:3840x2160):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755095/Pixel_6_Pro_Group_Image__Transparent_.png"&gt;metallic and glossy rail&lt;/a&gt; surrounding its raised camera bar, as opposed to the Pixel 6’s &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lGTDiRqYZ_v7B0qBMCPFTj6yxMo=/0x0:3840x2160/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:3840x2160):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755096/Pixel_6_Group_Image__Transparent_.png"&gt;darker, matte-textured &lt;/a&gt;rail. Admittedly, it’s tough to tell for sure in this footage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWDObJ"&gt;So while it isn’t as if we haven’t seen what the phone looks like, what’s notable in this video is that the display is powered on, which is an angle on the Pixel 6 or 6 Pro that we &lt;em&gt;haven’t&lt;/em&gt; seen much of, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664341/google-pixel-6-real-world-photos-october-19th-launch-date-rumor"&gt;outside of this new ad&lt;/a&gt;. Admittedly, though, it’s a rather boring glimpse, showing the same screen you see during the Android 12 setup process. The Pixel 6 Pro will have a 6.7-inch QHD+ screen with a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kA26HW"&gt;We still don’t know exactly when Google plans to fully take the wraps off the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro or when it will share prices and a release date. But it ought to be soon, perhaps sometime in October, if previous years are any indication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>At pivotal points in human spaceflight, NASA undergoes major reorganization </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SpaceX And NASA Prepare For Next Launch Attempt On Saturday, After Weather Delays Wednesday Launch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Xa0SIIWHq5JZHiSZDVl6oD4-Ho=/33x0:3000x1978/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890291/1227593491.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EOCGlv"&gt;The body of NASA tasked with managing human spaceflight is being split into two distinct directorates, the agency’s chief announced on Tuesday, embarking on a major reorganization that past officials have tried and failed to execute for years. The move comes as private companies like SpaceX demonstrate leaner methods of putting people in space and as NASA pushes ahead with ambitious plans to build settlements on the surface of the Moon in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hi8IRI"&gt;The breakup of NASA’s human exploration wing, called Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, will spawn two new bodies: first, the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, which will manage NASA’s most ambitious development programs like the Artemis program that are still in formative and testing phases. The second will be the Space Operations Mission Directorate, which will handle more routine, operational programs like the International Space Station and the Commercial Crew Program. Agency officials say categorizing programs based on levels of development rather than areas of expertise will help refine NASA’s focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qGp4mX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Two heads are better than one.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0BbX7G"&gt;The organizational shakeup was a “strong” recommendation from President Biden’s transition team, Nelson told reporters during a press conference on the changes. One major advantage of the change involves NASA’s budgeting process, which is often fraught with complexity and frequently faces pushback from members of Congress who complain NASA doesn’t provide enough clarity on its exploration plans. With the broad human exploration program now split in two, complex and sometimes ambiguous programs won’t be as intermixed with NASA’s more routine programs. And the two bodies will have separate leaders rather than a single official whose workload has seen steep growth in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h1rWW99bvkNKPxDL5jdB6mNTs_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867738/51399128214_36009d4571_k.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;(NASA/Bill Ingalls)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA’s human exploration chief, Kathy Lueders, will now lead a new directorate focused on space operations.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fQfBmw"&gt;“Two heads are better than one,” Kathy Lueders, the current head of NASA’s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, said during a town hall in Washington, DC, with the agency’s workforce on Tuesday. Lueders, who previously led NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, will move from her post as human spaceflight chief to helm the Space Operations Mission Directorate. Jim Free, a former deputy associate administrator who held senior roles in NASA’s Orion capsule program, will lead the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcbdqU"&gt;But not everyone in the space industry will be happy with the change. Lueders, seen by many as a champion for commercial space because of her experience leading the Commercial Crew Program during its formative years, won’t be as involved in the agency’s biggest development programs like Artemis anymore. Critics of the reorganization are also likely to see it as more red tape and a new burden of coordination between the two offices that will have to stay in touch on related space programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mcYu7W"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“as easy of a decision as falling off a log”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jdIgNP"&gt;“We’re actually not adding a whole new layer of people,” NASA deputy administrator Pam Melroy told reporters after the town hall, addressing critiques of the move. “There are very few additional positions that will be required... the challenges that we have in coordinating across organizations is exactly the same as it is today.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="496HUu"&gt;“Both of these people are extremely qualified,” Nelson told reporters. “It was obvious, it was common sense, that Kathy’s success should continue in the space operations mission directorate.” Employing a southern colloquialism, he added his decision to pick Lueders and Free for the roles “was as easy of a decision as falling off a log.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8kXMW"&gt;Studies conducted by NASA’s senior leadership under the Trump administration, when Nelson’s predecessor Jim Bridenstine was leading NASA, recommended a similar idea: NASA should spin-off elements related to its ambitious Artemis program into a separate directorate with its own leadership, giving it the focus and resources it’d need to execute an ambitious timeline of putting astronauts on the Moon by 2024. That advice was shelved at the time, current and former officials say, partially because it subtracted resources from other directorates, which frustrated members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPnKgM"&gt;But now, growing activity in the commercial space arena and the increasing cadence of human space travel, as SpaceX’s recent all-civilian mission to orbit last week showed, warrant changes to how NASA has managed its biggest human spaceflight programs for nearly a decade, NASA’s senior leadership say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="20yM5I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How are we going to manage this huge change in scope?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yJkDjk"&gt;“The last decade has seen extraordinary change and growth,” Melroy said at the town hall. “The impact that NASA has had on commercial space has created new capabilities that we didn’t even know we could rely on.” Citing future development plans with NASA’s long-delayed and over-budget Space Launch System, which is poised to launch for the first time later this year or early next year, Melroy added: “This is exactly the time for us to take a deep breath and say, ‘Wow, we have a chain of development programs, no longer just one monolithic program. How are we going to manage this huge change in scope?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTgxG2"&gt;NASA’s Artemis program includes a wide range of technologies that fall under the now-decentralized human exploration directorate. SpaceX is developing its Starship system to send NASA’s first astronauts to the surface of the Moon by 2024 (that will probably get delayed). A new space station called Gateway that will orbit the Moon is in the works by a team of international partners. Lockheed Martin is building NASA’s Orion crew capsule to help astronauts get to the Moon. NASA’s Space Launch System, a behemoth rocket largely managed by Boeing, has been under construction for more than a decade to launch the Orion capsule to Gateway, where SpaceX’s Starship will pick up astronauts and land on the lunar surface. Artemis is a multibillion-dollar fandango, and until today, all of it sat next to other routine programs like the ISS, a $100 billion orbital research post that has housed rotating crews of international astronauts for over 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRFYTy"&gt;“This approach allows one mission directorate to operate in space, while the other builds space systems,” Melroy said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Paramount Plus announces new streaming bundle with Showtime included</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oq7oCIktf5EbPocBStxir0Mk8Dg=/32x0:992x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890216/ParamountPlus_Showtime_Hero_1024x640.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Paramount Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CZi8L7"&gt;Paramount Plus announced today that it’s launching a new streaming bundle for both its ad-supported and premium tiers that include Showtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcanPs"&gt;Paramount Plus offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299615/paramount-plus-launch-date-price-cbs-all-access-shows-movies"&gt;two subscription options&lt;/a&gt;: a pared-down essential plan with limited ads for $5 per month and an ad-free premium plan for $10 per month. ViacomCBS’s Showtime is offering the bundle at special introductory pricing of $10 per month and $13 per month, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfmTG8"&gt;Like other services similarly looking to lure subscribers by offering, for example, limited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685091/netflix-free-android-plan-kenya"&gt;free-to-stream content&lt;/a&gt; or slashed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22544099/apple-tv-plus-one-year-free-ending-three-months"&gt;promotional pricing&lt;/a&gt;, Paramount Plus hopes the package will help it win new customers. Tom Ryan, president and CEO of ViacomCBS streaming, said the company expects the “competitively priced bundle to only further expand the reach of both services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9x59t"&gt;It is, to be clear, a pretty good deal — at least at the bundle’s promotional pricing. Showtime’s own ad-free streaming service costs $11 a month after a 30-day trial period. It’s unclear how much the bundle will cost after the introductory fees, though. A spokesperson said post-promo would be announced at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWPh6W"&gt;In any event, if you do happen to be paying for Paramount Plus and are looking to swipe Showtime at a pretty steep discount, now’s your chance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get iOS 15 right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k4621G9VcG1A83UwdytSuZtJWvI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890176/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MvuWwU"&gt;iOS 15 is finally here, and while it can’t be called a revolutionary update, there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;enough cool new features&lt;/a&gt; that you may not want to wait until Apple notifies you that the update is ready. It’s easy enough to get the update without waiting, though. Here’s what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JN0zOp"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22673693/iphone-apple-backup-ios-icloud"&gt;Your phone is backed up&lt;/a&gt;, right? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mdmYBQ"&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “General” &amp;gt; “Software Update.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7duHTw"&gt;Give it a moment. If the update is ready for you, it may appear on your update screen. In that case, tap on “Install Now.” You’ll probably be asked for your passcode and will have to agree to Apple’s “Terms and Conditions.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your update to iOS 15 may be waiting for you." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NwBlhb7wPAfb-e43zShyRdsfrgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867904/IMG_0B14C4232371_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your update to iOS 15 may be waiting for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll have to agree to Apple’s “Terms and Conditions.” " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mqhwew1GrHnrbZIA-mooQyPfI3Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867905/IMG_A3F1E73A0B91_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll have to agree to Apple’s “Terms and Conditions.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="elnD7Z"&gt;If you don’t see the update, look toward the bottom and tap on “Upgrade to iOS 15” &amp;gt; “Download and Install.” (The latter may appear automatically.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BUQygG"&gt;Type in your passcode if prompted, agree to those “Terms and Conditions,” and wait while the upload begins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="OK6qhj"&gt;It will take a while to update your iPhone. So put the phone down, go do something relaxing, and then come back in a little while to your brand new OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8sY8Xy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 review: foundational fixes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Twitch is finally making some friends in the music industry</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SVqXVu1F7pFy_rz2cHhAYXHCsck=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890137/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bTdSQo"&gt;Twitch is attempting to mend fences with a big pillar of the music industry by announcing an agreement to “work together” with the National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA). Details are vague right now, but the agreement says they plan to “build productive partnerships between the service and music publishers” after a year of conflict over music rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXHKXS"&gt;Twitch has long had a contentious relationship with the music industry, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534983/riaa-copyright-twitch-streamers-licensing-letter"&gt;has accused the company&lt;/a&gt; of allowing streamers to play copyrighted music without the appropriate licenses. Streamers have come under the eye of music publishers as well, with some being subject to waves of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562372/twitch-soundtrack-riaa-music-youtube"&gt;Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notices&lt;/a&gt; that resulted in Twitch deleting content from their channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKp9nF"&gt;The Amazon-owned streaming service is now attempting to appease both groups, with the agreement suggesting there could be new business opportunities for publishers down the road and fewer takedown notices for streamers. Neither is guaranteed, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HoNNNc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a new reporting process rights holders can opt in to&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vCU2nK"&gt;The one tangible announcement here is a new — and potentially more forgiving — reporting process that music publishers can use to flag songs being used without a license in someone’s stream. The idea of this, in part, is to “address when creators inadvertently or incidentally use music in their streams,” according to a press release. This process starts with a warning instead of immediate penalties, according to Twitch, which could address critiques from streamers who had their content deleted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BuhzG"&gt;That said, this new process is &lt;em&gt;separate&lt;/em&gt; from the one in place for the DMCA, and it does not change Twitch’s rules about how music can be used on the platform. And &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9633425/twitch-nmpa-music-publishers-agreement"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Twitch isn’t paying for additional music licenses as part of the deal, so it’s unclear exactly how much will change as a result of this new partnership. If publishers opt in to the new process, it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; resolve DMCA issues. But since that requires the rights holders to opt in and use it instead of the traditional takedown notice, we just don’t know yet if that will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ptWik"&gt;The rest of the deal promises some grand partnerships — “from virtual shows to studio sessions, the partnerships stemming from this agreement will connect the Twitch community in many ways to the music they enjoy” — but we don’t have a great idea of what it all amounts to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9y4Cs"&gt;The agreement indicates Twitch is at least attempting to resolve some of the issues with licensed music on the platform — and, ideally, ease some of the burden from streamers who get punished for playing music on their channel. But right now, we just don’t know how much of an impact the deal will have.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is reportedly closing in on its biggest acquisition ever — the Roald Dahl catalog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q0Q6WAWoZOdi0eRhr1bmOt0bZ1Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890125/RD_NETFLIX_LH_V009__0_00_07_21_20181127_5885_fizs41.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0888VS"&gt;Nearly three years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18114572/netflix-animated-adaptations-willy-wonka-matilda-bfg-roald-dahl-books"&gt;Netflix signed a deal with The Roald Dahl Story Company&lt;/a&gt; to create a universe of animated features based on the author’s books,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-21/netflix-is-said-to-be-nearing-deal-to-buy-roald-dahl-catalog"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports the streamer is in talks to buy the works outright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ElJ737"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reed Hastings and the Giant Acquisition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w8zHLF"&gt;There’s no word on exactly how much it costs to own Willy Wonka, the BFG, Matilda, and all the rest, but in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/netflixs-roald-dahl-deal-could-create-tv-universe-1164419/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter &lt;/em&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; sources claiming that simply licensing 16 titles from the catalog cost Netflix more than $100 million. A deal for this catalog would likely rank as Netflix’s largest, and if it’s close enough that an announcement is possible within “days,” as the report suggests, we could hear more during Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641142/netflix-tudum-fan-trailers-interviews-announcements-date-movies-shows"&gt;Tudum fan event this weekend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OB1nK0"&gt;Under the current deal, Taika Waititi is &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/taika-waititi-netflix-charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-animated-series-willy-wonka-oompa-loompa-1203524577/"&gt;working on Roald Dahl animated series projects for Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, covering &lt;em&gt;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory &lt;/em&gt;and its sequel, &lt;em&gt;Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator&lt;/em&gt;. That’s in addition to two different versions of Matilda, including a film version of &lt;em&gt;Matilda the Musical&lt;/em&gt; and an animated series, plus plans to make a&lt;em&gt; The BFG&lt;/em&gt; cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9mWcX"&gt;At those costs, it’s clear why Netflix might be ready to pay whatever it costs to secure rights to those properties long-term. If the deal is closed, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;notes it will happen despite the shadow cast by Dahl’s history of antisemitic statements and sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2018/11/i-d-still-read-roald-dahl-s-books-my-children-we-can-t-forget-he-was-anti-semite"&gt;misogynistic storytelling&lt;/a&gt;. The Dahl Family and the Roald Dahl Story Company &lt;a href="https://www.roalddahl.com/global/rdsc-and-family-notice"&gt;released an apology&lt;/a&gt; for the remarks in 2020, saying, “We hope that, just as he did at his best, at his absolute worst, Roald Dahl can help remind us of the lasting impact of words.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 won’t stop older PCs, but it might make you sign this waiver</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fJrKyASnXL6ZlXdEAyK6l9bFvQQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69889997/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_9.54.09_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DLpxf2"&gt;Today, Microsoft officially reinstated its PC Health Check app for anyone to download, letting you easily see whether your computer is ready for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; ahead of its October 5th debut. (The company had previously removed the app because it was somewhat misleading, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22644194/microsoft-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-processors-changes"&gt;when a more robust version returned in late August&lt;/a&gt;, it was only available to Windows Insiders.) You can find the app at the very bottom &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fwindows-11" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;of this page&lt;/a&gt; if you scroll down, or &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/GetPCHealthCheckApp"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t mind direct downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9Vzdk"&gt;But in some ways, the new PC Health Check app is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; misleading because it suggests my perfectly good 7th-gen Core i7 desktop gaming PC isn’t ready for Windows 11, despite the fact that I’ve already installed Windows 11 and am running it with no major issues. In fact, I took this screenshot of my system that “doesn’t currently meet Windows 11 system requirements” &lt;em&gt;from inside Windows 11 — &lt;/em&gt;a beta version that’s just a stone’s throw away from final. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p5uh9SRZohO5jKenDWvIQUXhJCc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867880/health_check_sean.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My 7th-gen i7 might be more capable than a supported 8th-gen i3, but no official support for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ur4lQT"&gt;This is a long-winded way of saying what Microsoft revealed to us in August: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22644194/microsoft-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-processors-changes"&gt;Windows 11 will not block PCs with older CPUs from installing Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; just because those CPUs aren’t on its whitelist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqT1SZ"&gt;Instead, Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22646035/microsoft-windows-11-iso-workaround-no-update-guarantee"&gt;reserving the right to deny you Windows Updates&lt;/a&gt;, up to and including security updates, if those CPUs become a problem down the line. That brings me to the waiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q2sxBV"&gt;When I recently tried to upgrade my system to the Windows 11 beta, the installer popped up an unusual message: a press-button-to-accept acknowledgment that my PC would “no longer be supported” and that I might even be voiding my PC’s warranty if I were to continue. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ItjuyT2m5N2LVVyxDHQSzA3X0yk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867844/waiver_windows_11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows 11 upgrade waiver I spotted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OafLZ8"&gt;I’ve asked Microsoft for more information on the waiver but haven’t heard back yet. I’ll let you know what we hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tb9MUa"&gt;The PC Health Check app &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;handy if you aren’t sure about some of the other Windows 11 requirements, particularly ones that might make you dig into your BIOS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;to turn on your TPM 2.0 module or Secure Boot&lt;/a&gt; — things that your system might totally already have and are fairly easy to switch on but are often turned off by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="u6MQBI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Windows 11 upgrade situation just got less and more confusing","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22643275/windows-11-upgrade-system-requirements-pc-health-check"},{"title":"Microsoft is threatening to withhold Windows 11 updates if your CPU is old","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22646035/microsoft-windows-11-iso-workaround-no-update-guarantee"},{"title":"Why Windows 11 is forcing everyone to use TPM chips","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OcIARz"&gt;Microsoft will hold a Surface event tomorrow, September 22nd. We’ll be live, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671271/microsoft-surface-event-pro-8-surface-book-4-rumors"&gt;here’s what to expect&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple updates macOS Safari with a new look, but you can turn off the big changes  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ClwxmS1tx6h35I4zaLj-NSLsmnU=/72x0:3033x1974/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69889701/Screen_Shot_2021_09_21_at_10.13.17_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f7yYKY"&gt;Apple has released a redesigned version of Safari for macOS Big Sur and Catalina. The update, announced as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;the upcoming macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, was released the same day as iOS and iPadOS 15, bringing the web browser’s new look and features across Apple’s platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FhGyTy"&gt;To update to the new Safari 15, you can go to System Preferences &amp;gt; Software Update, where it should automatically refresh and show up. Unlike updates to macOS, you shouldn’t have to reboot your computer after updating Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifbP7h"&gt;The development behind this version of Safari has been interesting. The full OS update that it was originally a part of, which also brings features like Universal Control and Quick Notes, isn’t here yet, but Apple decided to ship the new Safari anyway. For those who have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;upgraded to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, that’s a good thing — it means that you can immediately use tab groups across all your devices. The update &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacos%2Fmonterey-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F21%2F22686070%2Fapple-macos-safari-tab-groups-redesign-change-back" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also includes features&lt;/a&gt; like better tracking protection and automatic switching to HTTPS for sites that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K1ya7BytHYBoR43IHnYVerGzVSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867613/Screen_Shot_2021_09_21_at_9.13.23_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s original vision for Safari 15, which has been toned down slightly over the beta period.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pPxAad"&gt;While the Safari update brings new features, it also brings a new design. Apple’s made several changes to it since it was announced (though not as many as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629183/ios-15-beta-safar-address-bar-fix-options-accessible-controls"&gt;it’s made to Safari for iPhone&lt;/a&gt;), tweaking it to be less starkly minimal. Looks-wise, it’s still a major change from Safari 14, but there are preferences that you can tweak to walk back some of the more distracting changes. If you don’t want websites to be able to change the color of your tab bar, you can go to Safari’s preferences &amp;gt; Tabs, and uncheck “Show color in tab bar.” If you want your tabs to be on their own row, you can switch from Compact mode to Separate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7gw4O1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10765531"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5BhnTyGRWTeUiCyHZHXIlGTEjqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867568/Screen_Shot_2021_09_21_at_9.50.16_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “I prefer the old Safari” config.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CBUpAT"&gt;Unchecking “Automatically collapse tab titles into icons” turns the tab bar into a sort of carousel when you have too many of them. I certainly don’t prefer it, but it’s an option if that’s your sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhpaRgyCNx2coIns0bGV37hs-JM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867576/Screen_Shot_2021_09_21_at_9.52.35_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unchecking the “automatically collapse tab titles” box hides the true chaos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ux5zvl"&gt;While Safari 15 takes a bit to get used to (I'm still getting over the learning curve myself), Tab Groups is a great feature to share between my iPhone and computer. Safari 15 also comes with the &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212816"&gt;usual host of security updates&lt;/a&gt;, though none seem too severe. After you update, be sure to let us know what you think of the new design — is it a breath of fresh air or just another refresh that you’ll grudgingly get used to?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos just fixed the main drawback of its excellent Roam portable speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Np87jLGt21bxcuhrd-2RAbTvtT0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69889511/RoamSidetable.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7aDukN"&gt;I’m generally a big fan of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22368487/sonos-roam-bluetooth-speaker-review-features"&gt;Sonos Roam&lt;/a&gt;, but in the months since the portable speaker was released, I’ve definitely come across one downside: subpar power management. When the device is sitting around idle, its battery drains much faster than I’d like — and more rapidly than most Bluetooth speakers. Sometimes that means a dead Roam at the very moment you want to use it most. This has led me to completely power off the speaker when it’s not being used, which is less than ideal for something that’s meant to slot into a multi-room sound system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aa8NZQ"&gt;Thankfully, today, Sonos has made some improvements to address battery drain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPXwm3"&gt;After installing the latest software update (with the Sonos app on Android or iOS), the Roam should last longer on a charge when it’s not doing anything. “We’ve improved Roam’s power management to help extend Roam’s battery life when it’s not actively being used,” Sonos said in its update notes for the Sonos S2 13.3 update. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ORZBUs5UAHQfPO5KtvUNUWlvfqY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422266/RoamFrame.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Roam’s playback buttons can now wake it from sleep.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P7dKpd"&gt;The update also makes it possible to wake the Roam from sleep by pressing any of the buttons on top; before, this could only be done with the power button around back. And the Sonos app will now notify you if the Roam is connected to a charger that isn’t providing enough juice to actually charge the battery. Last, Sonos says two Roams that had been stereo paired will now automatically relink if one of them briefly loses connection to the network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bj12a"&gt;To install the update, make sure you’ve got the latest version of the Sonos app installed on Android, iOS, PC, or Mac. On mobile, you should automatically be prompted to update your devices when you open the app. If not, you can still manually check for the update by tapping on the gear tab, choosing system, and then system updates.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZsDOKu"&gt;Mercedes-Benz just announced the pricing of its all-electric luxury sedan, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;the EQS&lt;/a&gt;, and not surprisingly, it starts north of $100,000. What is surprising, though, is that the starting price is cheaper than a gas-powered S-Class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRvyJ2"&gt;When it arrives at dealerships this fall, the EQS will start at $102,310. By comparison, the 2022 Mercedes-Benz S-Class starts at $111,350. This is a rare case of an electric vehicle selling cheaper than its gas equivalent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DyAoO2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is a rare case of an electric vehicle selling cheaper than its gas equivalent. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MsnTct"&gt;Mercedes is offering three trim levels: Premium, Exclusive, and Pinnacle. Each trim comes in two versions, depending on the size of the infotainment screen: the 450+ sedan with a 12.8-inch portrait touchscreen; or the 580 4MATIC (yes, I know, these brand names are inscrutable) with the 56-inch Hyperscreen. Both versions of each trim come with Mercedes’ MBUX voice-activated assistant as standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YB3k2"&gt;Here is a glance at the features that come with each trim level:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2smZFH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588587/mercedes-benz-electric-ev-2030-caveat"&gt;As we’ve noted previously&lt;/a&gt;, Mercedes is interested in testing out whether customers are willing to pay more for added features, even after buying the vehicle. The company is offering various add-ons, like an increased steering angle for the rear wheels, which customers can pay to unlock and then receive as an over-the-air software update. It’s easy to see how the initial cost can rise steadily as owners decide they want more unique features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9utUbt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 2022 Mercedes-Benz EQS is a declaration of maximum electric luxury","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8ZnPwu"&gt;Still, it’s clear that Mercedes is trying to make a statement by pricing the EQS cheaper than the S-Class. The company has said it wants to shift to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588587/mercedes-benz-electric-ev-2030-caveat"&gt;EV-only sales by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. To get there, it will need to price its vehicles in a way that will make its wealthy customers think twice about replacing their old S-Class with just another gas-powered vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
