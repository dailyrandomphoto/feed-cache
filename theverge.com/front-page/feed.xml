    <title>Epic needs to tarnish Apple’s App Store halo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_dbuH7j00UhHKuAGNbEG0UMwpE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69249704/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D3Yc8Y"&gt;At the beginning of this week’s &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, Apple described Epic’s lawsuit as an “assault” on the entire iOS philosophy. One of the iPhone and iPad’s defining features is a curated ecosystem (or, from a different perspective, a walled garden). A loss for Apple could require it to allow side-loaded apps and alternative app stores, potentially including Epic’s own Epic Games Store. Apple says that would damage the privacy and security that iOS is known for, making Apple spend more money to fix new problems that crop up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qes3P"&gt;Epic spent the fourth day of trial offering its counter-narrative: the iOS App Store isn’t actually very good. Calling two Apple executives to the stand, Epic’s attorneys took jabs at everything from the update review process to Apple allegedly leaking Marshmello’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; concert playlist. They pushed Apple to justify its claims about privacy and security by producing hard research demonstrating threats and breaches — which Apple largely didn’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JAdN3U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic is making the case that the app store just isn’t very good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QOrmnw"&gt;After a short examination of Epic’s online business strategy head Thomas Ko, Epic called on Matt Fischer, App Store vice president and the first witness employee from Apple. Epic’s attorney peppered Fischer with anecdotes from frustrated developers — calling the iOS in-app payment system a “joke,” the refund policies “awful,” the review process “arbitrary and unpredictable,” and the entire store “plagued with outdated, low-quality apps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Spju9Q"&gt;Apple’s App Store has some clear problems. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;my colleague Sean Hollister wrote last month&lt;/a&gt;, you can find ridiculous stories about iOS apps that appear to swindle users yet maintain unbelievably high review stories — and aren’t removed even months after a formal complaint. Eric Friedman, an Apple employee who is set to testify, has been quoted saying the app review team is “more like the pretty lady who greets you with a lei at the Hawaiian airport than the drug sniffing dog” or “bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qssmJ"&gt;But Epic’s questioning today didn’t capture the kind of drama that implies. The attorneys spent much of their time trying to catch Apple executives in contradictions, and while they quoted disgruntled developers like the ones above, they rarely delved into the substance of their complaints. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers became audibly irritated with Epic repeatedly producing documents to establish a “state of mind” about the App Store rather than hard facts, since the files would be uploaded for public viewing. “Non-lawyers don’t understand the difference between something being admitted for its truth and being admitted for some other evidentiary purpose,” she told an attorney. Apple countered one negative review snippet simply by having Fischer read the line above it, where the writer said they were still giving the App Store a high rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YzD79T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic has vividly established the consequences of getting banished from the App Store&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qj6Fko"&gt;There’s one plausible reason Epic doesn’t have more specific stories: many developers are &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/google-and-apple-scare-us-app-makers-tell-congress.html"&gt;reportedly scared to criticize Apple&lt;/a&gt;. That’s been a running theme in congressional scrutiny of Apple, and Epic has vividly established the consequences of getting banished from the App Store — even if developers try to return via Apple’s Safari browser, they’ll be denied access to things like push notifications and AR features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiaM2i"&gt;Epic also still has witnesses who could poke holes in Apple’s narrative. Friedman is scheduled to appear over the next two weeks, and so is an executive from Match Group, which spoke critically of Apple in front of Congress. Epic’s attorneys left a big question hanging about whether Apple &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/06/apple-hulu-special-api-access/"&gt;offers special terms to some developers&lt;/a&gt; — something Fischer denied, but wasn’t heavily pressed on. In any case, this trial hinges on much more than the precise quality of Apple’s developer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fP4keM"&gt;But today demonstrates the difficulty of discussing large-scale moderation without opening yourself up to charges of dealing in mere anecdotes. Judge Rogers made clear that she’s interested in whether Apple is better or worse than its alternatives, not simply whether it’s ever had problems. And while Epic can point to individual screwups, Apple will try to argue that it’s doing its best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvs9pg"&gt;“It’s a human process. We do make mistakes,” said Apple’s marketing manager Trystan Kosmynka, the day’s last witness. “But we certainly try to rectify those mistakes when we learn of them.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: Don’t drive while you are on a Zoom meeting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Man at steering wheel checking messages on smart phone while driving car on road." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dC-BMpjgSuxNumo3e0Wy0J1Nytc=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69249448/923335020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;It’s better not to be distracted while driving | Photo by: Arterra/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VyYANj"&gt;Who among us has not tried during the pandemic to conceal the background of our home offices during a Zoom call for work— lest we reveal a messy bedroom, or get ragged on by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ratemyskyperoom"&gt;RoomRater&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDnJdr"&gt;For Republican state Sen. Andrew Brenner of Ohio, the green screen betrayed him during a video call this week, making it clear he was driving a car even though his background image &lt;a href="http://ohiochannel.org/video/ohio-controlling-board-5-3-2021"&gt;showed what looked like a home office&lt;/a&gt;. That wouldn’t have been a big deal except it was the same day that Ohio’s legislature was considering a bill that would have toughened the state’s rules on driving while using an electronic device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKgpfz"&gt;One could argue that a video call might be a significant distraction while driving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NSA6o"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2021/05/03/ohio-state-sen-andrew-brenner-attended-government-meeting-via-video-while-driving/4929012001/"&gt;Brenner told the &lt;em&gt;Columbus Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he was parked for most of the video call, was not distracted, and was listening to the meeting. He also noted he was wearing his seat belt and paying attention to the road while he was driving. But as &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/politicians-zoom-background-cant-hide-fact-that-hes-act-1846835103"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, throughout the video Brenner turns his camera on and off, and continually adjusts the background as if he’s not happy with how it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mjifQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA134-HB-283"&gt;Ohio House Bill 283&lt;/a&gt; would enhance the state law on distracted driving, “to a general prohibition against using an electronic wireless communications devices.” Hands-free and voice-operated devices would be allowed, and there’s an exception for emergencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqaCkE"&gt;At the very least, Brenner adhered to&lt;a href="https://publicsafety.ohio.gov/static/HSY7742.pdf"&gt; Ohio’s seat belt law&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe for the next meeting he should keep it in park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXUDrA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: An earlier version of this story stated that the Zoom meeting Brenner attended was where the distracted driving bill was discussed. In fact, the bill was being discussed the same day in the Ohio legislature. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5FMbrl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ThpsP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihUjqx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1LEss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvVrKy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tJ7Ec"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4u7qE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A61wE3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing a new Tip Jar feature for sending money to your favorite accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ajljYICFX84AjiO6tkC0zcvnAvA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69248373/acastro_170726_1777_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j1g4b2"&gt;Twitter has started &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-tip-jar.html"&gt;rolling out a new Tip Jar feature&lt;/a&gt; on its Android and iOS apps, which (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399984/twitter-tip-button-jar-great-tweets-profiles"&gt;as rumored&lt;/a&gt;) will allow users to send money directly to their favorite accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WVUWS"&gt;To use the tip jar, simply tap on the freshly added dollar bill icon next to someone’s username when viewing their profile on one of Twitter’s mobile apps. Users will be able to toggle the tip jar feature, too (for those individuals or organizations that don’t want people just sending them cash out of the blue). Android users will also be able to send money in Twitter’s Clubhouse-like Spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uWH8v"&gt;Tip Jar supports a variety of payment options and links: Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, Paypal, and Venmo. Twitter is using those services’ external payment processors for transactions; it doesn’t take a cut. All English language Twitter users can send tips starting today, but only a select group (including “creators, journalists, experts, and nonprofits”) can turn on the feature to accept money for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3xme8z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;show your love, leave a tip &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;now testing Tip Jar, a new way to give and receive money on Twitter   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;more coming soon... &lt;a href="https://t.co/7vyCzlRIFc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7vyCzlRIFc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter (@Twitter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1390396166496522247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cY25Va"&gt;Users have been using Twitter to solicit tips or Patreon follows for years — ending viral threads with a shoutout to a SoundCloud account is practically a meme at this point. So it makes sense that Twitter would be looking to streamline the feature as part of its own app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMinK6"&gt;Notably, the only way to access Tip Jar right now is through navigating to a user’s profile. That means sending someone some money for a truly fantastic tweet will still take a bit more effort than, say, just liking or retweeting it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13beBE"&gt;There are already some issues that Twitter will have to work out. As spotted by Rachel Tobac, sending tips through Paypal using Tip Jar currently allows whoever is sending the money to see the recipient’s address, which is a worrying security issue that Twitter and Paypal will hopefully resolve soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p02t7P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Huge heads up on PayPal Twitter Tip Jar. If you send a person a tip using PayPal, when the receiver opens up the receipt from the tip you sent, they get your *address*. Just tested to confirm by tipping &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yashar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@yashar&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter w/ PayPal and he did in fact get my address I tipped him. &lt;a href="https://t.co/R4NvaXRdlZ"&gt;https://t.co/R4NvaXRdlZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/r8UyJpNCxu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/r8UyJpNCxu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rachel Tobac (@RachelTobac) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RachelTobac/status/1390409874006183936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3gRtp1"&gt;In an update later Thursday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1390451333602422787?s=20"&gt;Twitter’s Support account&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged the issue, tweeting that it was “updating our tipping prompt and Help Center to make it clearer that other apps may share info between people sending/receiving tips, per their terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpclYz"&gt;Twitter also promised there was “more coming soon,” so it’s likely that we’ll continue to hear more about how Twitter is implementing tipping in the coming weeks and months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aetg0L"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 6th, 5:30pm: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information on Paypal address security issues using Tip Jar. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9OrdM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 6th 8:27PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added additional detail from Twitter about shared information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is giving a laser company that builds some of its AR tech $410 million</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1aRyl5MrUP2oO6_aV2UEnNRwpXI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69249312/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C0IJlY"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-awards-an-additional-410-million-from-its-advanced-manufacturing-fund-to-ii-vi%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F6%2F22423827%2Fapple-ii-vi-advanced-manufacturing-fund-award-ar-vr-faceid" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s awarding Pennsylvania-based optical technology company II-VI with $410 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Apple CEO  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1390378601690791938"&gt;Tim Cook tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s tech helps power Apple’s FaceID, Memoji, and Portrait Mode. The company also manufactures lasers that are used in the LIDAR scanner found in the iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro, technology that Apple touts as being key to augmented reality experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGxtFF"&gt;Finisar, which was &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/09/finisar-acquisition-iivi-aapl-fnsr.html"&gt;later acquired by II-VI&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced “two-six”) r&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/13/16771246/apple-finisar-iphone-laser-investment"&gt;eceived $390 million&lt;/a&gt; from Apple’s fund back in 2017. While this latest investment likely shows that Apple intends to keep FaceID (which is powered by II-VI’s vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers) around for a while, it could also be another sign pointing to Apple’s future with AR and VR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3seH3"&gt;Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;has publicly said&lt;/a&gt; that he believes AR is “critically important” to Apple’s future, and II-VI manufactures devices that help computers see the world in 3D. The money could help develop more advanced version of the technology already found on Apple devices, potentially for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;the rumored mixed reality headset&lt;/a&gt;. II-VI’s CEO says in Apple’s press release that the partnership with Apple “sets the stage for a new wave of breakthrough technologies that we believe will enable a wide range of applications that will benefit our world for decades to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuvtMT"&gt;The press release states that II-VI will use the funds to expand manufacturing capacity, create jobs, and “accelerate delivery of future components for iPhone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAHqVj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article had II-VI written as II-IV throughout. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton says it ‘could take months’ to bring treadmill back after recall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JHoLVnpdhcp4VHzdU2y3xP9Ln-s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69249172/akrales_190328_3240_0105.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aWCTpt"&gt;Peloton expects it to be a number of months before either of its treadmills are offered for sale again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;after a recall was issued&lt;/a&gt; on both models yesterday. One of the models posed the risk of “injury or death,” Peloton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4mY00"&gt;The more expensive Tread Plus treadmill, which has been on sale since 2018, “could take months” to return to market, said Peloton CEO John Foley on a call with investors this afternoon. Peloton needs to develop a hardware solution to prevent people, animals, and objects from getting sucked underneath the machine and then get that solution approved by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). A six-year-old child died recently after being pulled underneath a Tread Plus, the commission said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdiQF5"&gt;The cheaper machine, the Tread, could be up for sale again as soon as July, Foley said. He said the timeline for a fix to be approved could be six to eight weeks. Fixing the Tread will be simpler, he said, since it largely involves making a change to screws and washers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Dsi9C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We expect them to be the best products by far in the market and the safest products.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="naNm7U"&gt;Peloton recalled both treadmill models yesterday due to concerns they could injure owners or others near them. The Tread Plus had the most serious problems, with more than 70 recorded incidents of adults, children, pets, or objects being pulled under the treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuzOhd"&gt;The issues were less severe for the lower-cost Tread model. The CPSC said there were 18 incidents of the Tread’s touchscreen falling and causing minor cuts and bruises in the UK and Canada, where it’s primarily for sale. That model has only been sold in limited numbers in the US, but it was supposed to go on sale widely starting May 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NwT0c"&gt;Foley told investors the company’s treadmills would return with safety in mind, saying the company needed to be a “leader in safety in the industry.” He said the company’s repaired products would be “one of the safest if not the safest treadmills in the world” and that “when we bring them back to the market, we expect them to be the best products by far in the market and the safest products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQa9y5"&gt;Peloton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388707/peloton-fighting-recall-treadmill-child-death"&gt;initially resisted&lt;/a&gt; the CPSC’s urge for a recall. In a note yesterday, Foley said that was a mistake. “We should have engaged more productively with [the CPSC] from the outset,” Foley wrote. “For that, I apologize.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google remembers Wear OS long enough to add a new keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/opKbAX3v7mKsxtcZh5-Mo4rKK64=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69249052/awhite_20200305__3923_0239.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Avery White for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aw45Wp"&gt;In what feels like an increasingly rare occurrence, Google announced that &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/wearos/thread/108870878/new-gboard-app-arrives-on-wear-os?hl=en"&gt;it’s updating Wear OS&lt;/a&gt; with a new feature today — but don’t get too excited, it’s just a keyboard. In this case, Google is porting over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/22/11287220/google-keyboard-iOS-search"&gt;Gboard&lt;/a&gt;, the swipeable, predictive text-powered keyboard that it offers for Android, iOS, and Android TV, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/06/wear-os-gboard/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEp0eW"&gt;Like the larger phone version, Gboard for Wear OS supports multiple input methods on a keyboard that’s slightly more finger-friendly than the old version the operating system used. You can type by tapping, swiping, or speaking. The keyboard also has easier access to emoji and “enhanced suggestions” above the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qqsxVN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Message the way you want to with the new Gboard ⌨️ on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WearOSbyGoogle?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WearOSbyGoogle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Multiple ways to message like voice, QWERTY keyboard or gestures ✔️&lt;br&gt;Enhanced suggestions and corrections ✔️&lt;br&gt;Multi-language support ✔️&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See what’s new: &lt;a href="https://t.co/RjjtZO23Tv"&gt;https://t.co/RjjtZO23Tv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/dggR6HxsFc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dggR6HxsFc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Wear OS by Google (@WearOSbyGoogle) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WearOSbyGoogle/status/1390338114833588230?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J0RhsX"&gt;Along with the new keyboard, Google says it’s also introducing multi-language support for all of the languages offered on Wear OS. To switch languages, Gboard for Wear OS has a language shortcut at the bottom of the keyboard that will pull up a menu with options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkJJkr"&gt;The update is minor, but Google is at least paying attention to an operating system that’s mainly received minor updates for a while. Google opened up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525335/google-wear-os-tiles-widgets-new-feature-announced"&gt;Tiles&lt;/a&gt; on the OS to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/13/22328909/google-third-party-developers-tiles-wear-os"&gt;third-party developers earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, and before that, promised to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366514/google-wear-os-fall-update-smartwatch-faster-apps-weather-pairing"&gt;improve to CPU performance&lt;/a&gt; in August 2020. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371782/google-io-2021-date-announcement-virtual-online-event-date-android"&gt;Google I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt; — the company’s developer conference — on the horizon, there’s a possibility Google has more improvements to share for Wear OS, but until then, be happy you can at least swipe to type on your wrist.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chinese rocket falling to Earth this weekend poses ‘extremely low’ risk to people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TOPSHOT-CHINA-SPACE-SCIENCE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z9gIg_rXr3OLRX4tYV3qT_sdw28=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69248923/1232586805.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by STR / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AvW0zb"&gt;Another “out-of-control” Chinese rocket stage in orbit has spawned a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/04/politics/chinese-rocket-earth-scn/index.html"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/may/04/out-of-control-chinese-rocket-tumbling-to-earth"&gt;cycle&lt;/a&gt;. But for people on Earth, there’s not much to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yP3EE3"&gt;The 100-foot-tall, 22-metric-ton corpse of a Chinese Long March 5B rocket that launched the first chunk of Beijing’s new space station last week will reenter Earth’s atmosphere sometime this weekend, and there’s an extremely high chance that pieces of the rocket will splash down in the ocean, analysts say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkmUnT"&gt;“Much of the earth is covered in water, so there’s almost no risk,” said Dan Oltrogge, founder of the Space Safety Coalition and top policy expert at AGI’s Commercial Space Operations Operations Center. The risk to the public isn’t zero, he said, “but it’s a whole lot less” if it’s heading for the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tERdtG"&gt;The US Space Command, which helps track the roughly 27,000 human-made pieces of junk in orbit, is tracking the location of the Long March rocket stage, “but its exact entry point into the Earth’s atmosphere cannot be pinpointed until within hours of its reentry,” it said in a statement, estimating the rocket will reenter this Saturday, May 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N5yZbE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The likelihood of any human being getting hit is quite low. It’s extremely low, let’s call it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ChemEE"&gt;Most core rocket stages don’t enter orbit. They usually splash down in the ocean right after launch after boosting another smaller rocket stage into orbit. But China’s Long March 5B rocket has a unique design that puts the entire first stage into low-Earth orbit to deliver its payload — a 22.5-metric-ton Tianhe module that will serve as living quarters for China’s new space station in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgfoAp"&gt;The rocket body is now dead, and it can’t be maneuvered or controlled. It’s orbiting Earth diagonally at a 41.5-degree inclination (or tilt) from the equator. That means it passes over a large swath of Earth, anywhere as far south as Chile and the top half of New Zealand, and as far north as New York and Madrid. But a majority of that orbital swath covers international waters, indicating chances of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/31/16830890/chinese-space-station-tiangong-1-debris-falling-to-earth"&gt;reentry over a populated area is slim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pKfnJ"&gt;“The likelihood of any human being getting hit is quite low. It’s extremely low, let’s call it.” Oltrogge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzTD7G"&gt;There are still some valid concerns about space safety. Launching a massive rocket stage into low-Earth orbit, where traffic between satellites and space junk is sharply increasing, is risky. And it is possible for parts of the rocket to survive the fiery plunge back through Earth’s atmosphere. Pieces of a Long March 5B rocket &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21256484/china-rocket-debris-africa-uncontrolled-reentry-long-march-5b"&gt;fell from the sky over&lt;/a&gt; Côte d’Ivoire in Africa last year after sending an experimental satellite into space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5EqFPv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I expect significant pieces to reach the surface of the Earth”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lyKruN"&gt;“Objects reenter almost every day, and once every few months there’s some stuff that reaches the ground,” Harvard-based astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell said in an email. “But this is only the second time (after last year’s reentry of the same rocket type) in 30 years that something this massive has reentered uncontrolled.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k44siL"&gt;Tiangong-1, China’s first prototype space station that launched in 2011, was another massive object that uncontrollably reentered in 2018 but mostly broke up in the atmosphere over the South Pacific Ocean. “By the time of reentry it was 7 tonnes, so it was significantly smaller than” the size of Long March 5B upon its expected reentry, McDowell said. “I expect significant pieces to reach the surface of the Earth - maybe up to several 100 kg [220 lbs] fragments,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jk3dfc"&gt;Though reentries are super common, and most objects never survive their trip through the atmosphere, they’re somewhat hard to predict, Space Force commander Gen. John Raymond told reporters on Thursday during an unrelated call about his military branch’s digital capabilities to track objects in space. “As we get closer, that data will get refined. But space command’s tracking this, they’re all over it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69FHFR"&gt;In the unlikely event a fragment of the Long March stage &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;hit land — and that’s not to say that land will inevitably be populated — it may have international legal ramifications. Under the 1972 Space Liability Convention treaty, countries are liable for the objects they launch to space. But “engaging the Liability Convention is as much a foreign policy decision as a legal one,” says Chris Newman, a professor of space law at Northumbria University in the UK. “The ‘victim’ state may be heavily dependent on the ‘liable’ state for infrastructure or investment and might not wish to rock the boat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qlv3pF"&gt;The US would expect China to pay for any damage caused by its rocket stage, a US State Department spokesperson said in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FndDp7"&gt;“China, like the United States, is Party to the Liability Convention and as such, would be liable to pay compensation for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight,” the spokesperson said. “We encourage all States to operate transparently and responsibly in conducting their space activities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGZfhv"&gt;In the meantime, there are a billion other things you can worry about besides China’s rocket stage, like the current &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22396522/us-climate-change-commitment-paris-agreement-joe-biden"&gt;climate crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/business/boba-shortage.html"&gt;pandemic-induced shortage of Boba Tea&lt;/a&gt; (if you’re into that), or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22401253/elon-musk-hosting-saturday-night-live-miley-cyrus-tesla-spacex"&gt;Elon Musk’s potentially cringe-worthy appearance&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7lbyCY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, May 6th, 6:10PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This story was updated to add comment from a State Department spokesperson. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9V6wV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhC3pY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>IBM’s first 2nm chip previews the processors of tomorrow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KAWsJFiAiOJWM17WxlZnSXDzkGY=/0x180:2700x1980/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69248769/IBM_Research_2_nm_Wafer.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;IBM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EwTV4A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-05-06-IBM-Unveils-Worlds-First-2-Nanometer-Chip-Technology,-Opening-a-New-Frontier-for-Semiconductors#assets_all"&gt;IBM has revealed&lt;/a&gt; what it says are the world’s first 2nm process chips, giving a brief preview of the technology that might eventually power the smartphones, laptops, and gadgets of the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PnCvr"&gt;The big jump here is in transistor count. Compared to today’s 7nm chips, the new IBM technology features dramatically more transistors, thanks to the more compact design. That means chips built using that process can potentially offer big gains in performance and battery life: IBM says its 2nm chips are “projected to achieve 45 percent higher performance, or 75 percent lower energy use, than today’s most advanced 7 nm node chips.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wlm0ac"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’ll still be years before you can get one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CM9iaI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16656/ibm-creates-first-2nm-chip"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, IBM’s new 2nm chip features about 333 million transistors per square millimeter (MTr/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). For comparison, TSMC’s most advanced chips, built using its 5nm process, feature about 173 million transistors per square millimeter (MTr/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), while Samsung’s 5nm chips feature about 127 MTr/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsFUva"&gt;While that all sounds great, it’s important to remember that IBM’s 2nm chip is largely just a proof of concept and that processors build on the 2nm node are still likely years away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOjriw"&gt;TSMC and Samsung, as mentioned before, produce 5nm chips right now. Intel is still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/23/21336356/intel-7nm-chips-next-gen-delay-q2-2020-earnings-amd-10nm-tiger-lake-desktop-laptop-cpu"&gt;struggling to get its 7nm node&lt;/a&gt; out the door. And even TSMC doesn’t expect to get to 2nm for some time: it’s currently planning to start early production of its 4nm chip process by the end of the year, with mass production in 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16639/tsmc-update-2nm-in-development-3nm-4nm-on-track-for-2022"&gt;per &lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Its 3nm node isn’t expected until the second half of 2022, with 2nm chips still in relatively early development. And all of that assumes that semiconductor companies don’t run into delays — just ask Intel, which has seen any number of manufacturing hiccups over the past decade or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GvMtHM"&gt;Still, it’s a tantalizing glimpse at the future of semiconductor technology, and even though it may take some time to achieve on a mass-production scale, IBM’s announcement shows that there’s still plenty to be excited about when it comes to new chips. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon delivery drivers were told to turn off safety apps to meet quotas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Amazon Prime delivery van is seen in Seattle. The..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vcLlN0OTR7GzqMd1Oe31NIjSwRM=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69248765/1232586538.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Toby Scott/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ml5kie"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgxx54/amazon-drivers-are-instructed-to-drive-recklessly-to-meet-delivery-quotas"&gt;According to a &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, some Amazon delivery drivers are instructed by their employers to turn off Amazon’s safe driving monitoring app, so they can drive faster and get their deliveries done. The drivers don’t work for Amazon directly, but instead for companies known as Delivery Service Partners, and they report that their managers or dispatchers ask them to turn off Amazon’s Mentor app after leaving it running long enough to get a good score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYvi5E"&gt;Mentor, the app made by a company called eDriving, gives delivery drivers a safe driving score based on variables like their braking, acceleration, speed, and distraction throughout the course of their 10-hour shift. Many drivers report that the score that the app gives them is factored into their bonuses (and the bonuses and incentives paid to the delivery companies contracted to Amazon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nRwWMo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The app’s reviews have titles like “inaccurate and they don’t care”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qqgqch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reports that some of the delivery companies will have the drivers keep the app on for part of the day to try to trick Amazon and the Mentor app, with one company sending drivers messages like “everyone needs to be logged into Mentor for at least 2 hours no more no less.” A driver in Michigan said the company wanted the app turned off to improve delivery times. “They were harsh on drivers that weren’t going as fast as they wanted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwJHa3"&gt;An Amazon spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; that the behavior is unacceptable and that it “does not adhere to the safety standards that [Amazon expects] of all Delivery Service Partners.” They also said that “more than 90% of all drivers are able to complete their deliveries before the scheduled time while following all safety procedures.” (Amazon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on how it collected and validated that statistic.) As &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; points out, it’s Amazon’s software that determines the delivery routes and Amazon that sets the productivity targets the drivers are incentivized to hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYCUZd"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;’s report, Mentor is also buggy when it’s on, with drivers reporting that it dings them for distracted driving when they haven’t touched the phone. The app’s reviews on the App Store have titles like “inaccurate and they don’t care,” “Frustration personified,” and “inaccurate data will cost us our jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="felU36"&gt;Delivery companies also reportedly ask employees not to report damage to vehicles to Amazon, instead electing to fix the vans themselves to avoid them being taken out of commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDafVy"&gt;It’s unclear how Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22347945/amazon-delivery-drivers-ai-surveillance-cameras-vans-consent-form"&gt;recent introduction of AI-powered monitoring cameras&lt;/a&gt; will change this dynamic between the Delivery Service Partners and their drivers. One could imagine that having a camera in the van would make it easy to determine if employees were turning off other monitoring devices. One could also imagine there are other ways to ensure safe and quick deliveries that don’t require an Orwellian work environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkKPga"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on if it tracks which companies make these requests of drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The David After Dentist meme is now an NFT — and yes, this is real life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NYllnBTe1b6vsmIGd4px1h2g1HE=/0x45:1331x932/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69248508/david_dentist.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;David After Dentist is now an NFT | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txqiwrbYGrs&amp;amp;ab_channel=booba1234" target="_blank"&gt;David Devore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P5ZSWh"&gt;David DeVore was seven years old in 2008 when a trip to the dentist left him feeling “funny” afterward. His dad, David Sr., recorded his son’s post-anesthesia musings (“Is this real life?” “You have four eyes” “I feel funny”), and when he uploaded it to YouTube a few months later — intending to share it with friends and family — the video went viral within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqvHPR"&gt;Now, 140 million views and 11 years later, David After Dentist is becoming the latest mid-2000s meme to go up for auction as an NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CydfH4"&gt;“It kind of feels like 2009 all over again,” the elder DeVore said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “NFTs are like the wild west right now, it’s like back when we went viral and social media was in its infancy.” &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/davidafterdentist"&gt;The auction for the David NFT&lt;/a&gt; goes live today, and DeVore said he expects it will conclude sometime on Friday afternoon. (It’s officially open for 24 hours but could be extended for late bids.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zp4x00"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/txqiwrbYGrs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SELTRh"&gt;DeVore says while his family dealt with their share of trolls — some who questioned his parenting — the meme has been a positive thing for their family, helping pay for his kids’ tuition. He didn’t get into the latest amounts, but he &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/where-are-they-now-david-after-dentist-family-rolling-in-150000-2010-6"&gt;estimated in a 2010 interview&lt;/a&gt; that the family had made $150,000 in merchandise, licensing, and from YouTube revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wugDn"&gt;Compared to other creators of that era like Disaster Girl and Nyan Cat, he said he felt lucky he was able to retain some control of the meme. “They had less control, if any at all,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5W3gRl"&gt;But those creators are seeing things come full circle now as well. Disaster Girl, whose real name is Zoe Roth, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410070/disaster-girl-popular-meme-nft-500000-dollars"&gt;went for $500,000&lt;/a&gt;, and Nyan Cat’s creator Chris Torres sold &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/nft-nba-top-shot-crypto.html"&gt;it for nearly $600,000&lt;/a&gt;. A ton of classic memes from back in the day have been auctioned as NFTs, including &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bad-luck-brian-meme-nft-crypto-art-blockchain-ethereum-foundation-2021-3"&gt;Bad Luck Brian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/grumpycat/grumpy-cat-5467"&gt;Grumpy Cat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/keyboardcat/play-him-off-keyboard-cat-5553"&gt;Keyboard Cat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L4sDdH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6iZwQe"&gt;David Jr. is 20 now and attending the University of Florida where he’s studying computer science (not dentistry, to this writer’s disappointment), and he has perfect teeth, his dad says. The response to the NFT has been mostly positive, DeVore Sr. added, in part because the creator economy has become more sophisticated since David After Dentist debuted more than a decade ago. “I think it plays into the strong empathy people have for creators,” he said. “People want to see them get rewarded.”&lt;/p&gt;
