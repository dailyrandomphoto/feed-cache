    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SJLghf"&gt;Ahmad Fawad Yusufi, a refugee from Afghanistan and father of three, was shot and killed last month in San Francisco during what &lt;a href="https://sfist.com/2021/12/08/potrero-avenue-shooting-victim-identified-as-father-of-three-who-helped-u-s-army-in-afghanistan/"&gt;police said was a botched robbery attempt&lt;/a&gt;. His family says Yusufi, a former interpreter with the US Army who lived in Sacramento, was in San Francisco to drive for Uber, a job which was their sole source of income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VkI7B"&gt;The ride-hailing company has said &lt;a href="https://www.abc10.com/article/news/crime/family-seeks-answers-afghan-refugee-shot-in-car/103-09455a67-69bf-4788-861d-248743a8fc47"&gt;Yusufi appeared to be “offline”&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the shooting, meaning he was not on duty, but his brother Ilyas says Yusufi worked all night Sunday driving for Uber, which was his reason for being in San Francisco at the time of the shooting early on a Monday morning. He’s written a letter to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, chief legal officer Tony West, and senior VP for marketing and public affairs Jill Hazelbaker, demanding $4 million in aid for Yusufi’s family — which he says the company has an “ethical obligation” to provide — and access to Yusufi’s disabled Uber account. Ilyas believes the account may provide more information about the circumstances surrounding his brother’s death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjAdoF"&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Ilyas said it feels like Uber doesn’t care about what happened to his brother. “He worked for them, but they don’t want to help us,” he said, adding that Yusufi’s wife doesn’t speak English and is unable to work, so the family is in danger of losing their home. “Right now, we don’t know what to do. But when his kids ask me what I did for their father, I have to tell them I tried. I need to try to make a good life for them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3wurT"&gt;In his letter, Ilyas points to &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/supporting-afghan-refugees/"&gt;Khosrowshahi’s September blog post&lt;/a&gt;, where he wrote about being an Iranian refugee as a child and pledged that Uber would support Afghan refugees. The CEO announced Uber had added an in-app donation button that sends funds to refugee resettlement programs of the International Rescue Committee and added Pashto and Dari language support to its Uber Driver app. “We want to make it even easier for Afghan refugees to access economic opportunities, if and when they are ready to do so,” Khosrowshahi wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wyZcR8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“...you are turning your backs on us in our time of need”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6uqzdD"&gt;But Ilyas said he and hundreds of other Afghan drivers often sleep in their cars while driving for Uber. “And now, after all the work we did for your company, you are turning your backs on us in our time of need,” he writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTsTv6"&gt;In reply to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Uber spokesperson Austen Radcliff said in an email that the company was “saddened by this senseless act of violence that took Mr. Yusufi’s life. Our hearts go out to his family during this difficult time.” Radcliff added that Yusufi was not online or on a trip at the time of the incident, that his last trip was the previous night. Uber has been in touch with the family to offer its condolences, Radcliff said, and is working to provide them access to the account. He pointed to an article from the &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Sacramento-man-shot-and-killed-in-S-F-identified-16683093.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in which police said Yusufi was with a friend near a park at the time of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MB9TVu"&gt;Uber has a history of trying to defer responsibility for incidents with its drivers — who are not considered employees of the company but independent contractors — if the drivers weren’t actively working at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3WuZR"&gt;Perhaps the best-known test of this position is a 2013 incident where a driver who said he was working for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/28/5350660/lawsuit-uber-accident-death-girl-liability-insurance"&gt;Uber in San Francisco struck a family in a crosswalk&lt;/a&gt;, killing six-year-old Sofia Liu. The company maintained, however, that while the driver was an Uber “partner,” he was not “providing services on the Uber system during the time of the incident.” A lawyer for Liu’s family said the driver was logged in to Uber’s app at the time seeking fares, even though he didn’t have a passenger in the car when he struck Liu. The company eventually settled with the family out of court, and the incident prompted a new state law requiring ride-hail drivers and companies to have liability insurance coverage whenever they’re using a ride-hailing app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kClxf9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yusufi is not the first Uber driver to be killed while on the job&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IxKJTx"&gt;And Yusufi is not the first Uber driver to be killed while on the job; two recent incidents include &lt;a href="https://abc7chicago.com/chicago-carjacking-uber-driver-killed-shooting-police/10445793/"&gt;Javier Ramos, who was shot and killed&lt;/a&gt; during an attempted carjacking in Chicago in March, and Timothy Perkins, who was &lt;a href="https://www.wilx.com/2021/01/31/teens-charged-in-uber-drivers-death/"&gt;beaten and stabbed to death In Detroit&lt;/a&gt; in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ye2XG"&gt;Driving for the company’s Uber Eats delivery platform can be hazardous as well; &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/teens-get-maximum-sentence-death-uber-eats-driver-n1273276"&gt;Pakistani immigrant Mohammad Anwar was killed&lt;/a&gt; after an attempted carjacking in Washington, DC, in March. Two teenagers pleaded guilty to murder charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKgZmI"&gt;Cherri Murphy, an organizer with Gig Workers Rising, a Bay Area organization supporting Yusufi’s family, said Uber drivers sleeping in their cars was not uncommon in the area and criticized the company, which she said “washed their hands” of him and his family. “That’s simply unacceptable. We stand in strong solidarity with Ahmad’s family and for workers everywhere who are endangered or killed on the job.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Px0dX6"&gt;Ilyas, who also drives for Uber, says he and his brother came to the US in 2017 and usually made the trip from Sacramento to San Francisco every weekend to earn money on the ride-hailing platform. Included in his letter to the Uber executives is a demand that the platform pay its drivers better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62AiIN"&gt;“When my brother and I drove to San Francisco every weekend, we could never afford a hotel room after delivering your customers around the city all night,” Ilyas wrote. “We drop people like you off to your multi-million dollar homes every day. We deserve a safe, hospitable place to sleep at night afterwards.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Chrome’s last-minute holiday shopping tools track prices and abandoned carts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q6D22QNwytUyCDd8hdOiV0pRNto=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70281759/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="srD6OS"&gt;With time ticking away before shipping deadlines put a stop to your online holiday shopping, Google is highlighting a few new Chrome features that might help you out. Still, it’s not lost on us that these features used to keep track of stuff to help you shop are also useful for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770569/alphabet-google-market-cap-hits-2-trillion"&gt;nearly $2 trillion company&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747193/google-q3-2021-earnings-record-revenue-profit"&gt;makes most of its money from serving up relevant advertisements and making sure shoppers hit the “buy” button&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="c7q7IQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the shipping deadlines to get your holiday gifts there on time ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22833986/ups-usps-fedex-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target-shipping-deadlines-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oNQsFi"&gt;But you will probably use Chrome anyway, so you should know that a new feature in the mobile browser on Android will show updated pricing for items inside your open tabs grid, so you’ll know if the prices suddenly drop. Google says iOS Chrome browsers will get the feature “in the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Chrome price tracker on Android" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rmHZAPLTKVMV_rj3NKb2kwfvP_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23101433/_Chrome_Shopping_Inline_No_shell_V2__1__800.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Chrome price tracker on Android&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QBZMMI"&gt;Another handy tool for Android browsers is the ability to search the internet for something you’re already looking at in real life, using Google Lens inside Chrome. The Lens icon will pop up in the toolbar, and you can use the camera to identify something on a shelf or in a window and start searching without typing. This is also coming to desktop browsers soon, where you can right-click (unless it’s an NFT and you’re trying not to be rude), then select “Search images with Google Lens” and use the mouse cursor to draw over whatever is catching your eye in the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8yivY"&gt;The other new element is available for Windows and Mac desktop Chrome users in the US, where it will keep an eye on shopping carts you haven’t checked out yet. If you open up a new tab page, there’s a “Your carts” card that will hold sites where you’ve added items, and Google says that at some stores, there may be a discount waiting when you come back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ latest true wireless earbuds offer noise cancellation for $99</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/okbTRFLEISgenYk-aiOXjOuipts=/30x0:1410x920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70281630/image.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Buds Z2 in black and white.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uVNUnN"&gt;OnePlus’ latest pair of true wireless earbuds are the $99 OnePlus Buds Z2. They’re double the price of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515636/oneplus-buds-z-earbuds-announced-features-price"&gt;$49.99 OnePlus Buds Z&lt;/a&gt; from last year but now benefit from active noise cancellation, a shorter stem, and a more lightweight construction. They’re available now in the US and will release in the UK and EU on December 20th for £99 and €99, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdarED"&gt;Although the Buds Z2’s price sits halfway between the Buds Z and OnePlus’ more premium $150 Buds Pro, it actually has better battery life than both of them. Battery life from the earbuds themselves is around five hours with ANC turned on, rising to seven hours when you turn it off, and combined with the case you get up to 38 hours total (dropping to 27 hours with ANC on). In comparison, the Buds Z offered five hours from the buds and up to 20 hours including the case. The Buds Pro offer seven hours of playback with ANC off, five hours with it on, and up to 31 hours when combined with the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4Wlb4v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Buds Z2 offer up to 38 hours of battery life with their case&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1RSCot"&gt;Elsewhere, the Buds Z2 match many of the specs of the Buds Pro, despite their more affordable price. They offer the same 94ms of latency when used in their “Pro Gaming mode,” there are still three mics in each earbud, they come in either black or white, and they even have the same 11mm drivers as the Buds Pro. But the Buds Z2 don’t offer wireless charging, a feature present on the Buds Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAuFTC"&gt;The $99 price point is proving to be increasingly competitive for true wireless earbuds equipped with noise canceling. Most notably, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;Nothing’s Ear 1 earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which come from OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei’s new company, offer noise cancellation as well as wireless charging support at that same price point. Increasingly, you don’t have to pay much more than $100 to get a feature-rich pair of true wireless earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BorIhn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQF8Bu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo says test vehicle was in manual mode when it struck a pedestrian in San Francisco</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/waXbatJxvDwDk9MpXCM7JMxFMlc=/311x0:3689x2252/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70281606/qcxxlr3tsu581.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A Waymo vehicle apparently struck a pedestrian in Lower Haight in San Francisco | KWillets on &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/rhlcg8/our_neighbor_was_hit_by_a_selfdriving_car/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IJ7ZkG"&gt;A Waymo autonomous vehicle struck a pedestrian in San Francisco Wednesday night, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/rhlcg8/our_neighbor_was_hit_by_a_selfdriving_car/"&gt;according to a post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. A spokesperson for the Alphabet-owned company confirmed the incident on Twitter but clarified that the vehicle was in manual mode at the time of the collision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hl1Y4Z"&gt;The incident took place in the Lower Haight neighborhood of San Francisco, where Waymo has been testing its vehicles since last summer. The Reddit user KWillets, who claims to have witnessed the collision, posted a photo of a Waymo vehicle stopped in the middle of the road with the driver-side door open. A firetruck is parked to the side, while a number of firefighters and bystanders are gathered in front of the vehicle. According to KWillets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eqF9rZ"&gt;Just when we thought 2021 couldn’t get worse, we heard a thump. I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zsehg4"&gt;Our neighbors had gotten out of a ride share on the far side and one crossed while the other stayed behind apparently taking a picture. An SFPD patrol stopped to say something to her about being careful crossing the street(?), when a Waymo passed in the near lane and hit the one who had already crossed, as I think he returned. The victim was conscious and standing afterwards, but went to SFGH for a more accurate diagnosis. Hope he’s OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWGAX8"&gt;You can say there’s no such thing as Waymo, but as for me and Grandpa, we believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xZRTW8"&gt;Asked by a commenter whether the person who was hit was jaywalking, KWillets clarified some details: “They both got out somewhere near the upper left. One crossed to the right with many seconds to spare but apparently returned and was Waymo’ed. The other one ironically did not cross, but was accosted by a patrol car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sRFHNm"&gt;When contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;KWillets noted that they only “heard” the incident and then replayed it on closed-circuit television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="723CIi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are aware of this incident involving a Waymo vehicle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="beqHyv"&gt;The incident was picked up by Omar Qazi, a Tesla fan who tweets under the handle WholeMarsBlog. Katherine Barna, a spokesperson for Waymo, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kathbarna/status/1471449449146822657"&gt;responded to Qazi’s tweet&lt;/a&gt;, stating, “We are aware of this incident involving a Waymo vehicle, which was being driven in manual mode, and are continuing to investigate it in partnership with local authorities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vihi4k"&gt;In a follow-up email, Barna said that the collision took place on Haight Street, midblock between Webster and Buchanan. “The pedestrian was treated for injuries at the scene and was transported to the hospital in an ambulance,” Barna said. “The trust and safety of the communities in which we drive are paramount to us, and we will continue investigating this incident in partnership with local authorities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3EQq9"&gt;A spokesperson for the San Francisco Fire Department referred questions to the city’s Police Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDu2HL"&gt;AV operators are required to &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/"&gt;report crash incidents&lt;/a&gt; to California’s Department of Motor Vehicles, which oversees AV testing in the state. The department recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834496/pony-ai-av-test-permit-suspend-california-dmv-crash"&gt;suspended the license&lt;/a&gt; of AV startup Pony.ai after one of its vehicles was involved in a single-vehicle crash while in autonomous mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyOYr9"&gt;Waymo has a better safety record than most AV companies, but the company has still been involved in a number of incidents. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21538999/waymo-self-driving-car-data-miles-crashes-phoenix-google"&gt;Waymo published 6.1 million miles of driving data&lt;/a&gt; in Arizona in 2019 and 2020, including 18 crashes and 29 near-miss collisions. In those incidents where its safety operators took control of the vehicle to avoid a crash, Waymo’s engineers simulated what would have happened had the driver not disengaged the vehicle’s self-driving system to generate a counterfactual. The company has also made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/21/20822755/waymo-self-driving-car-data-set-free-research"&gt;some of its data available to academic researchers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvhoYZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 16th, 11:52AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated to include a comment from Waymo’s spokesperson. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The House is a creepy stop-motion anthology coming to Netflix in January</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rmvDbkc8h1i3wcmxreGFNMxyAzk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70281494/The_House_Chapter2_00_45_54_23.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="58dteY"&gt;Once the holidays are over, and the &lt;em&gt;Home Alone&lt;/em&gt; marathons are done, you might be looking for something a little gloomier to watch — and it looks like Netflix has just the thing. The company just revealed the first trailer for its upcoming stop-motion anthology &lt;em&gt;The House&lt;/em&gt;, which debuts next month. It’s described as an “eccentric dark comedy about a house and the three surreal tales of the individuals who made it their home” that also has talking cats and mice for some reason. Each episode of the anthology is helmed by a different director — that includes Emma de Swaef and Marc Roels, Niki Lindroth von Bahr, and Paloma Baeza — and it’s produced by Nexus Studios. It also looks like it has quite the cast, with voice talent including Helena Bonham Carter, Matthew Goode, and Mia Goth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9ROd6"&gt;All three episodes will be available to stream starting on January 14th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple delays full office reopening and is giving every employee a $1,000 bonus</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WsOlSF"&gt;Apple has indefinitely delayed the date on which corporate employees will have to return to the office, according to a letter that CEO Tim Cook sent to staff on Wednesday. The letter, a copy of which was obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, said the company’s date for returning to work, was “yet to be determined,” and he encouraged all employees to get the coronavirus vaccine and booster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HLBgb"&gt;“Our offices remain open and many of our colleagues are coming in regularly, including our teams in Greater China and elsewhere,” Cook wrote. “As we look forward to more of our teams being together again, we will continue to make decisions based on local conditions and will be sure to notify you at least four weeks before beginning the pilot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awDSvn"&gt;The news was first reported by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1471237100255252484"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1471236946160619524"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News’&lt;/em&gt; Zoe Schiffer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKPsQi"&gt;Cook also announced Wednesday that Apple would be giving all employees $1,000. “These funds are intended to help you with your home workspace and can be used as you see fit,” Cook wrote. Apple spokesperson Nick Leahy confirmed the $1,000 bonus to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and says it will apply to every Apple employee, including retail workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgiBNs"&gt;An internal message to Apple employees said the $1,000 would appear in their next paychecks, and be subject to tax and withholding. “Keep in mind that when you return to the office, you’ll be bringing your Apple-owned equipment back, so you should consider what you’ll want for your home workspace,” the message reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YjAOP"&gt;The delay comes as COVID-19 cases rise and the omicron variant begins to spread. Workers were previously set to return to offices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"&gt;on February 1st&lt;/a&gt; in a hybrid work pilot announced internally in November. That itself was already delayed, and it’s not the first time Apple has announced such a delay; the company has shifted its pandemic-related return-to-office plans in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633616/apple-delays-mandatory-office-return-january-covid-surge"&gt;past&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfoFF4"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838172/apple-stores-close-retail-covid-19-cases-infections"&gt;closed three retail stores&lt;/a&gt; this week in response to growing COVID-19 infections. On Tuesday, it began requiring customers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834419/apple-retail-store-mask-requirement-december-2021-omicron-covid"&gt;wear masks&lt;/a&gt; while inside its retail stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y94C8m"&gt;Cook told workers in the letter that he was “grateful” for their flexibility and resilience. “You continue to prove how much we can accomplish when we take on our challenges with boldness, creativity and — most importantly — together.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpPMjd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 16th, 10:54 AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds details from Cook’s letter to employees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comcast adds a Ring-style video doorbell to its Xfinity Home package</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xfinity Video Doorbell" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hUUPDRudzs8-yns2uNLCnJZJrpk=/200x0:1280x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70281307/xfinity_video_doorbell.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xfinity Video Doorbell&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Comcast&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uVvPSw"&gt;For customers who’ve chosen to trust Comcast with their home security, it’s &lt;a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-launches-new-video-doorbell-for-xfinity-home-customers"&gt;adding a new Xfinity Video Doorbell&lt;/a&gt; that pops up a notification both in your Xfinity app and on your TV through a Flex or X1 box when someone is at the door. There are many options for video doorbells these days, but Comcast’s includes HD video quality, two-way audio so you can speak to visitors even if you’re not at home (or don’t want to get off of the couch), motion alerts, and 24/7 video recording.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Xfinity Video Doorbell" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DdeAdUpwNBFasnQVirmn0XWVmSg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23101215/xfinity_doorbell_pics.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Comcast&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xfinity Video Doorbell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l8KSDO"&gt;If you want a video doorbell but have already gone the Ring, Nest, or Wyze smart home route, it’s unlikely to sway you, but it’s an option that slots in with the rest of the company’s security packages, and this is the first video doorbell available for Xfinity Home customers. The Xfinity Home package already offered security cameras with video clips and live monitoring, so the lack of a video product for your front door was a noticeable omission next to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Fdevices-help&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F16%2F22839444%2Fxfinity-video-doorbell-comcast-automation-smart-home-security" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its sensors, thermostats, keypads, and the rest&lt;/a&gt;. For the rest of its pitch, Comcast also touts the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18167912/comcast-xfinity-xfi-advanced-security-internet-protection-price-ces-2019"&gt;xFi Advanced Security package&lt;/a&gt; that comes for free with its security monitoring to keep an eye on your connected devices.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s no word on how many features still work during a service or internet outage, but the overall Home products include battery backup, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837637/aws-west-is-down-twitch-outage-amazon"&gt;given the reliability of AWS lately&lt;/a&gt;, it’s hard to say who may have better uptime.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok says it’s varying For You recommendations to avoid harmful content holes  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GhbkC_kY9luK4rGRz51C3pQr4sc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70281303/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kJ16Lk"&gt;TikTok is changing its For You Page algorithm to prevent users from seeing too many similar videos that could be harmful when viewed in clusters, the company &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-on-our-work-to-safeguard-and-diversify-recommendations"&gt;said today&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to steer users away from clusters of videos that might “reinforce a negative personal experience,” listing extreme dieting, sadness, and breakup content as examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2L9kK"&gt;“At TikTok, we recognize that too much of anything, whether it’s animals, fitness tips, or personal well-being journeys, doesn’t fit with the diverse discovery experience we aim to create,” the company says in its release. The For You feed uses metrics like how long a viewer &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/inside-tiktoks-highly-secretive-algorithm/investigation-how-tiktok-algorithm-figures-out-your-deepest-desires/6C0C2040-FF25-4827-8528-2BD6612E3796"&gt;lingers over content&lt;/a&gt; to recommend videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NISK3R"&gt;TikTok’s personalized recommendations algorithm has been the subject of scrutiny. An investigation by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;demonstrated how the app can push young users down &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-algorithm-sex-drugs-minors-11631052944?mod=article_inline"&gt;rabbit holes of sex and drugs&lt;/a&gt;, showing similar content repeatedly. Health experts say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808011/tiktok-health-impact-research-plan"&gt;more research is needed&lt;/a&gt; on the app, which surpassed 1 billion monthly users in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2XMVL"&gt;The company also announced it was working on features that would allow users more ways to customize what content isn’t shown to them. Users would be able to choose hashtags and words related to content they don’t want to see on the For You feed. Users already have the option to signal they’re not interested in a video, and TikTok says similar content will be shown less often.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can soon rate your favorite podcast on Spotify</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BCbCj6waOzLM3LAazP9cmcu9qG8=/471x0:1296x550/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70281175/Pod_Ratings_FTR_1920x733_1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rlaumz"&gt;Spotify is coming for Apple Podcasts’ star rating system with one of its own. The company &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-16/show-your-favorite-podcasters-you-love-them-with-spotifys-new-star-ratings-for-podcasts/"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s launching a five-star rating system for podcasts. Listeners will be able to leave a rating after they listen to a show for at least 30 seconds, and the average rating will be displayed on a show’s landing page once at least 10 have been submitted. Spotify says the feature is meant to make it “easier for listeners to decide when to try out a new podcast” and that these ratings will “serve as the first chance to draw new listeners in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvkqpB"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://blog.anchor.fm/updates/spotify-podcast-ratings"&gt;explicitly encourages&lt;/a&gt; podcasters to shout out Spotify and tell listeners to rate them there. This is likely the primary motivator for Spotify. The trope of “rate and review” on Apple Podcasts is silly but also a real driver for people to go to an app. If, instead, podcasters shouted out Spotify, maybe even just a few people would download the app or at least open it and figure out how to listen to a podcast there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zm7RSq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cAtqGt"&gt;At the same time, reviews often open platforms and their users up to harassment. They do indeed offer a helpful first impression of a show but are also easy to game. I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20835812/podcast-review-bomb-apple-castbox-one-star"&gt;a story two years ago&lt;/a&gt; about angry fans review bombing shows on Apple Podcasts. In a year, I could probably write the same about Spotify. (The opposite can always be true, too, of a podcaster review bombing themselves for good.) Does that mean we shouldn’t have ratings? Probably not. But does that mean I hope Spotify has a good bot detection system or even one to detect broad harassment? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2uNwt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyundai’s new four-wheeled robot is designed to carry anything you want it to</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3wQuQFroXGARLt4U53K_-TGKP_o=/58x0:793x490/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70281166/hyundai_robot.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tz7K8f"&gt;South Korean automaker Hyundai is used to making machines that move, but the company is now tackling the problem of mobility on a much smaller scale than usual. Instead of new cars, it’s announced at CES this year &lt;a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3467"&gt;a four-wheeled robot named MobED&lt;/a&gt; that’s designed to carry, well, anything you like — from parcels to people; TV screens to trays of drinks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZuP3X"&gt;MobED is about the size and shape of a dolly you might find in a workshop or garage. It’s 67cm long and 60cm wide, with four 12-inch pneumatic tires that can be controlled independently via a trio of motors at the end of each axel. A complex suspension system means its central platform can be tilted in any direction, letting MobED keep goods level when driving up or down a ramp and adjust the angle of its cargo (which would be handy if the robot is carrying a camera or screen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jX9AhO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10927257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IqXAe9"&gt;What exactly MobED will be used for is an open question. Hyundai is calling the device a “mobility platform,” and an official &lt;a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3467"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; suggests it wants to sell MobED to industrial partners who will then adapt it for specific use cases. Prices are unknown, and judging by some flashy videos from Hyundai, it’s imagining some very varied applications. MobED could become a personal caddy, for example, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22685649/gita-gitamini-cargo-carrying-robot-piaggio"&gt;Gitamini&lt;/a&gt; — toting packages and shopping. And future versions might even be strong enough to carry people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzhyfu"&gt;“MobED can be used as a mobility device for the elderly or the disabled when the platform is sufficiently increased for people to mount it,” said the company in a press release. “It can also be used as a stroller or leisure vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xJbJSq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_9JTjO4cn4U?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dOt8sn"&gt;The robot has a top speed of 30km/h (18mph) and can drive for four hours on a single charge. How exactly it navigates is unknown, though. Hyundai makes no mention of sensors at all, whether cameras or lidar, nor does the company say whether it comes with any autonomous driving software — which would be very onerous for partners to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZiS1T"&gt;Interestingly, Hyundai isn’t the only car manufacturer branching out into this sort of generalized robotics. Toyota and Honda are both investing heavily in this area, developing machines that might &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/6/9680128/toyota-ai-research-one-billion-funding"&gt;one day work in care homes&lt;/a&gt; or be used as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16745340/honda-robot-concepts-mobility-empathy-ces-2018"&gt;personal mobility devices&lt;/a&gt;. Evidently, as self-driving technology develops, many car manufacturers are seeing new areas to apply this newly acquired expertise. MobED is just the latest example of this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
