    <title>Fortnite adds some melange with new Dune crossover</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gMij9QI8R2BYJPeQDOnhSwxLa9Y=/0x0:1532x1021/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017727/fortnite_dune_loading_screen_jpg_1920x1080_3581f4b9432f.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lo8Ia7"&gt;Epic Games is once again proving that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;no brand is safe from &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by adding two playable characters from &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; to its hit battle royale shooter. Starting Tuesday at 8PM ET, you’ll be able to buy &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/paul-atreides-and-chani-travel-from-planet-dune-to-the-fortnite-item-shop"&gt;virtual &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; avatars of Paul Atreides and Chani&lt;/a&gt; modeled after Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, the actors who play them in the upcoming movie. There are a handful of other &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;-themed items you can pick up as well, including an ornithopter glider and a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KohxK0_agqg"&gt;Sand Walk emote&lt;/a&gt; that mimics how the characters walk to avoid detection by gigantic sandworms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8VhuX"&gt;The tie-up arrives just a few days before &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;’s premiere &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551728/dune-movie-release-date-delayed-again-warner-bros"&gt;in theaters and on HBO Max on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. While it doesn’t seem as if sandworms will actually be making an appearance in the game (to my great disappointment), there’s plenty of new spooky stuff to check out during &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s newly announced Halloween event, which runs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733240/fortnite-fortnitemares-2021-halloween-event-ariana-grande"&gt;from Tuesday until November 2nd&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is ready to admit it was wrong about the future of laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m12jFAfSID_WEfiedS0EpLEa7mE=/1x0:1911x1273/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017538/Apple_MacBook_Pro_Ports_10182021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ports, ports, glorious ports.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3hjCdN"&gt;There’s plenty to be excited about when it comes to Apple’s new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros. As well as souped-up Pro and Max versions of the already capable M1 chip that Apple debuted last year, they also include numerous quality of life improvements like the return of MagSafe, a row of function keys rather than an OLED Touch Bar, and of course, a full selection of ports that won’t have users reaching for a dongle if they just want to import some photos from an SD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYTmsh"&gt;In fact, Apple was so enthusiastic about these “new” features, you’d be forgiven for forgetting that it was the one that killed most of them off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13490774/apple-macbook-pro-review-2016-13-inch-laptop"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CN7cuC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple finally listened to the pros","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ecOgaI"&gt;“Users value the full-height function row on the standalone Magic Keyboard, and we’ve brought it to the MacBook Pro,” Apple’s Shruti Haldea said &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/exM1uajp--A?t=1957"&gt;as she explained the decision to ditch the Touch Bar&lt;/a&gt;, the touchscreen OLED strip Apple so enthusiastically introduced five years ago. “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/exM1uajp--A?t=1989"&gt;Having a wide range of ports can make life a lot easier for pros&lt;/a&gt;,” Haldea continued, concisely summarizing what professional users have been saying for roughly half a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ZNF2i9fNRbLByiY1cLh5Kwg-9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939123/msedge_gtjccFwnty.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Mac product line manager Shruti Haldea introduces the new MacBook Pro — including a physical function row!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nxLP4M"&gt;MagSafe, the convenient magnetic charging connector, is also returning to laptops after Apple stopped including it on its laptops in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="97eR2f"&gt;Although it’s obviously backtracking, I think Apple is absolutely making the right call with all three of these changes. For the vast majority of users, a proper function row is far more useful than a software-based Touch Bar that failed to catch on with developers; a bevy of easily accessible ports make life easier for Pros and average Joes alike, and MagSafe is faster to connect than a USB-C cable and can prevent your laptop from being damaged when someone trips on the power cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DwJg1e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All three features feel like the right call&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pL4riF"&gt;But it’s hard to ignore the broader context of these improvements, which is that they effectively bring the company’s 2021 MacBook Pros back in line with the features they were already offering from 2012 to early 2016. Arguably, the primary reason these new MacBooks are being greeted with overwhelming enthusiasm now is that Apple made the wrong bet on where laptop design was headed back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RppqPt"&gt;The MacBook’s transition to USB-C arguably started with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/9/8372335/12-inch-macbook-review"&gt;2015 13-inch MacBook&lt;/a&gt;, which included just two ports: one USB-C port to handle charging, display output, and connecting of any and all accessories and one 3.5mm headphone jack. But it was with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/27/13436750/apple-macbook-pro-announced-laptop-price-release-date-specs"&gt;2016 refresh of the MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s commitment to an exclusively USB-C laptop future became truly apparent. Rather than the collection of Thunderbolt, USB Type-A, HDMI, and SD card ports that previous models had included, the 2016 MacBook Pro lineup included a choice of either two or four USB Type-C / Thunderbolt ports, alongside a headphone jack. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/5/13523372/usb-c-macbook-adapter-donglelife-problems-thunderbolt"&gt;dongle era&lt;/a&gt; had begun.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="macbook pro 2016" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8VEWSXvGr9NzOdoclpv_oiaLnzY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7390289/vpavic_161031_1256_0096.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro, and its sadly necessary USB-C adaptors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rD7InI"&gt;Apple was one of the earliest adopters of what was, at the time, a very new connector. And going all-in on USB-C was basically unheard of. At the time, USB Type-A was still dominant on laptops and desktops, while Android manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/2/12344688/samsung-galaxy-note-7-announced-price-release-date-specs"&gt;like Samsung&lt;/a&gt; were only just starting to switch away from Micro USB in their flagship phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OSJjQ"&gt;Most people know what happened next: owners were forced to invest in adapters for all their old peripherals. Their laptop itself may have gotten slightly slimmer and lighter, but for pro use on the go, any space or weight saved in a backpack or briefcase was tempered by the added bulk and complexity of the extra accessories you needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z1fiCu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An end to adapters&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bHiVKJ"&gt;We all know what ended up happening, but I think an interesting question to ask is what Apple &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; was going to happen after it transitioned wholesale to USB-C. For what it’s worth, the company seemed, at the time, to have been genuinely caught off guard by the anger from users having to buy endless adaptors to connect basic accessories and, shortly after the release of its 2016 MacBook Pros, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/4/13524272/apple-cutting-usb-c-adaptor-prices-macbook-pro"&gt;cut prices across swathes of its USB-C adapter lineup&lt;/a&gt; to help users “transition” to the new standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sgIaW"&gt;To me, this suggests Apple thought #DongleLife was going to be a temporary transitional phase rather than the new normal it eventually became. For an example of the kinds of accessories it thought would become commonplace in the future, take a look at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/27/13440158/apple-event-lg-ultrafine-5k-displays"&gt;5K display from LG&lt;/a&gt; it announced onstage at the same event, which it said was designed to pair with the new MacBook Pro. The display used a single Thunderbolt 3 cable for video, power, and data and also acted as a USB hub, thanks to a trio of additional USB-C ports. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sEP4cX8xXGWzaN321Mhlyhf2RTo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938876/HKN62_AV5.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s 5K monitor, announced onstage alongside the MacBook Pro 2016.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pshcOR"&gt;Had monitors like these quickly become commonplace, we would have ended up with a future where users could dispense with many of these bulky dongles and adaptors and have the convenience of plugging into a static desk setup with just a single cable. But while some monitors did, what generally happened was that monitors continued to ship with a mix of HDMI and DisplayPort connectors, and users were forced to use adapters whenever they wanted to connect. Not to mention, plenty of people happily use the same monitor for far longer than the laptops they plug into them, particularly when they’re secondary displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAHSZx"&gt;Apple isn’t the only company to have made a bet on USB-C that didn’t quite pay off. In 2018, a consortium of companies that included AMD, Nvidia, Oculus, Valve, and Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/17/17583362/virtuallink-vr-headsets-oculus-valve-microsoft-connect-usb-c-cable"&gt;announced VirtualLink&lt;/a&gt;, a USB-C connection standard for VR headsets that could allow them to be powered and broadcast data over a single cable. But although the USB-C port appeared on Nvidia’s 20-series graphics cards, the standard was beset by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525827/valve-index-virtual-reality-usb-c-virtuallink-dongle"&gt;silly dongles and adaptors&lt;/a&gt; (sound familiar?) and had been dropped by the time the 30-series rolled around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAkeRP"&gt;It’s easy to see Apple ditching ports as a cynical cash grab in an attempt to drive sales of its own dongles and USB-C accessories. But a more generous reading is that Apple got its bet on the future wrong. It thought it could outsource a laptop’s ports to desk-based accessories like monitors and docks to make its laptops slimmer and more compact. But that ecosystem never seems to have taken off or become ubiquitous, and what happened instead was that people were forced to carry around endless adapters for simple tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wouG49"&gt;I have a couple of theories why Apple’s vision never became a reality. One is Macs just don’t have the market share to force a change like this across the whole industry, so manufacturers of monitors and peripherals were forced to stick with older standards from Windows machines for their most mainstream devices. Another is the confusing mess of standards supported by USB-C cables and accessories. Between Thunderbolt and USB’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/27/18243425/usb-3-2-standard-names-connectivity-cables-innovators-forum"&gt;smorgasbord of different versions&lt;/a&gt;, it can be difficult to know if a cable is even capable of making the most out of your device’s charging and data transferring capabilities, or — particularly early on — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/4/10916264/usb-c-russian-roulette-power-cords"&gt;whether it’s going to fry its internals&lt;/a&gt;. It’s far from the easy plug-and-play future Apple seems to have had its sights on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EVCHz"&gt;Or, maybe people are more attached to their older PC accessories than Apple anticipated, particularly when it comes to expensive professional equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x0ViRR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s bet on wireless audio on the iPhone paid off in ways its USB-C laptop bet didn’t&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tUHPZy"&gt;It’s interesting, in retrospect, to compare Apple’s decision to switch wholesale to USB-C on the MacBook with its decision to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7. This was another decision that generated an equal amount of jokes about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/8/12852098/belkin-apple-iphone-7-plus-adapter-dongle-charge-music"&gt;adaptors and dongles&lt;/a&gt; at the time and raised similar suspicions that the move was a cash grab to help the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/8/12839758/apple-is-biggest-winner-from-killing-headphone-jack"&gt;sell more Bluetooth headphones&lt;/a&gt;. But, five years later, Apple’s decision appears to have been vindicated, with its competitors following suit. There’s now a thriving ecosystem of third-party wireless headphones, and I couldn’t tell you the last time I saw someone using one of Apple’s Lightning to 3.5mm adaptors (though, with wired headphones &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/wired-headphones-cool-airpods-b1936746.html"&gt;reportedly making a retro-styled comeback&lt;/a&gt;, that could change soon). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aar6yt"&gt;Whether that’s because Apple is more dominant when it comes to smartphones or just because the benefits of wireless audio were more obvious to people than USB-C accessories, people seem to have been far more ready to roll with Apple’s annoying headphone jack decision. There’s a valid debate to be had about whether Apple kicked off a trend towards wireless audio or whether its move just turbocharged one that was already taking place, but either way, Apple made a bet that the future of smartphone audio was wireless, and for all intents and purposes, it seems to have paid off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5LB8D"&gt;Although Apple stopped short of calling out its past MacBook designs, this week’s announcement was Apple’s biggest mea culpa &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15175994/apple-mac-pro-failure-admission"&gt;since the Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; trash can. The event completed the company’s backtrack on basically every controversial decision it’s made with recent MacBooks, after already having made the decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;ditch its controversial butterfly keyboard&lt;/a&gt; in favor of more traditional scissor switches. Apple made the wrong call in 2016, but this week, it thankfully got itself back on track. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Which AirPods model should you buy?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HTnTmHh7T5K_RBCFmA7qmJUhEWo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017465/cwelch_191031_3763_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Pro still sells for $249.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zz3GG9"&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;new MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; on October 18th, Apple finally also introduced its&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22435385"&gt; third-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, which are set to ship on October 26th for $179 and are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22429684"&gt;available for preorder now&lt;/a&gt;. Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733184/apple-second-generation-airpods-wired-charging-case-price-cut-129"&gt;lowered the cost&lt;/a&gt; of the now-entry-level AirPods 2 from $159 to $129 and will now only sell the version that comes with a wired charging case. As a result, the AirPods lineup now consists of four models of AirPods: the $129 AirPods 2, the $179 AirPods 3, the $249 AirPods Pro, and the $549 AirPods Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVI0Qf"&gt;With such a wide range of AirPods available at various price points, it can be overwhelming to try to figure out which one you should purchase. That’s why we’ve put together this guide comparing the models to each other — so you can find the right fit for you. Note that while we have reviewed most of the AirPods in the lineup, we’ve not yet tested the AirPods 3, but we will soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mTJiJM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple AirPods second-gen review: even more wireless","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"},{"title":"Apple AirPods Pro review: perfect fit","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"},{"title":"Apple AirPods Max review: luxurious sound for a luxury price","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="IaSfdt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10815614"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aNdTt1"&gt;The AirPods 3, like the AirPods 2 and AirPods Pro, are in-ear wireless earbuds. The AirPods 3 weigh about the same as the AirPods 2 – 4.28 grams and 4 grams, respectively. At 5.4 grams, the AirPods Pro are only slightly heavier. The wireless earbuds all measure about the same as well, with the AirPods 2 offering the greatest length (40.5mm x 16.5mm x 18.0mm). While the AirPods 3 (30.8mm x 18.3mm x 19.2mm) measure about the same in length, they’re wider than the AirPods 2. The AirPods Pro (30.9mm x 21.8mm x 24mm) are wider than both the AirPods 2 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KuKtX"&gt;The AirPods 3, like the AirPods Pro, are sweat and water-resistant, unlike the AirPods 2 (and the Max). That means you don’t need to worry about them during an intense workout or when it rains. The AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro also offer shorter stems than the AirPods 2, while the AirPods Pro come with replaceable silicone ear tips in three different sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lW6egp5N9OIM9pMgY8cw5eZ_Qxg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938958/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_8.26.33_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Pro versus the AirPods Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hq12um"&gt;In contrast to the small plastic AirPods earbuds, the AirPods Max are a large over-ear pair of headphones that offers stainless steel earcups with a curvy mesh headband. They weigh in at 384.8 grams and measure 187.3mm x 168.6mm x 83.4mm. While the earbuds only come in white, you can buy the Max in a variety of different colors, including silver, space grey, sky blue, pink, and green. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TogjVJ"&gt;Each device comes with a Lightning-to-USB-C cable and a charging case. However, the kind of charging case differs. The AirPods 2 include a wired charging case (53.5mm x 44.3mm x 21.3mm) that can only be charged with a Lightning cable. Meanwhile, the cases for the AirPods 3 (46.4mm x 54.4mm x 21.4mm) and the Airpods Pro (45.2mm x 60.6mm x 21.7mm) can be charged wirelessly or with the cable. The AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro also now support MagSafe technology, the same magnetic attachment and charging system you can use with the iPhone. Meanwhile, the AirPods Max have their own Smart Case, which is designed to preserve battery charge by putting the headphones into a very low power state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EM0hCC"&gt;All of the AirPods are compatible with the latest iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macs. However, the AirPods 2 are also compatible with older devices, like the iPhone 5s, iPad mini 3, iPad mini 2, and the 6th-generation iPod touch.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods 3 will be available on October 26th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1HiQiX"&gt;All of the AirPods in the current lineup are powered by Apple’s H1 headphone chip now that the AirPods 2 — and not the first-generation, which offered a W1 chip — are the entry-level model. As a result, all support Bluetooth 5.0, and you can launch Siri via a voice command on all of the devices. You’ll also be able to automatically switch between your various Apple devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pG2LyU"&gt;The over-ears AirPods Max come with a Digital Control knob borrowed from the Apple Watch and another button you can use to alternate between the Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency modes. However, there is no power button. In contrast, the earbuds rely solely on touch controls — and even in this, they can differ. To play a tune, skip forward, or answer a phone call on the AirPods 2, you need to double-tap. However, with the AirPods 3, AirPods Pro, and the Digital Crown on the AirPods Max, you just need to click once to pause, play, or answer a call. Meanwhile, you can press twice to skip forward and three times to skip back. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vub7LogNg805GYpulKIm1syQA_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938895/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_8.31.44_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods 3 offers spatial audio with dynamic head tracking and Dolby Atmos in Apple Music.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ou6uo5"&gt;Audio features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AKhVkZ"&gt;As we’ve noted in our reviews — with the exception of the AirPods 3, which we’ve yet to test — all of the AirPods in the lineup offer great sound quality. Each new earbud model offers iterative improvements that enhance the audio experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJP2Ec"&gt;Of course, the AirPods 3, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max offer a lot more in comparison to the older AirPods 2 when it comes to audio technology. All three of the newer models boast support for spatial audio, which should result in an immersive, theater-like sound quality experience. While the AirPods 2 featured limited spatial audio through Apple Music only, the other three include spatial audio for group FaceTime calls, Netflix, and other content as well. The AirPods 3 also offer spatial audio with dynamic head tracking across all Apple devices, as well as Dolby Atmos in Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgwRuU"&gt;The AirPods 3, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max all boast features like Adaptive EQ, which customizes your audio experience, and an intuitive force sensor for media control. Apple says the custom high-excursion Apple drivers found in all three also deliver powerful bass. Meanwhile, the AirPods Max are built with H1 chips in each ear cup, so you get ample bass. The three models also include a custom high dynamic range amplifier that offers clear sound and lengthens battery life (the AirPods Max lacks this latter feature). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8fSD5"&gt;The AirPods Pro and AirPods Max offer Active Noise Cancellation, which silences background noises so you can better focus on what you’re listening to. These models are also the only ones that offer the option to switch to Transparency Mode, which makes it possible to hear the sounds around you. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YuNGcz8IBVQajdFqVk6GHwUE70=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173866/DSCF2681_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max offers 44mm drivers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6GEHBn"&gt;As far as call quality is concerned, the AirPods 2, AirPods 3, and AirPods Pro all offer dual beamforming microphones — in other words, every set has two mics in each ear cup, with technology designed to reduce outside noises and better focus on your voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKs86B"&gt;However, unlike the AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro, the AirPods 2 doesn’t offer inward-facing microphones. That means it’s not able to listen inside of your ear to reduce internal sounds. The AirPods Max, meanwhile, offer nine microphones: eight for active noise cancellation and three for voice pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mVJwTVLkFjyToscJgHNl1jB0Aoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19336093/akrales_191030_3763_0378.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Active noise cancelation option on an iPhone paired with the AirPods Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QEKtUN"&gt;The AirPods 2, AirPods 3, and AirPods Pro all offer motion-detecting accelerometers that detect taps and speech-detecting accelerometers. The latter recognizes when you’re speaking, working with the beamforming microphones to silence outside sounds and pick up only your voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjWSfZ"&gt;Both the AirPods 2 and AirPods Pro offer dual optical sensors that help detect when they’re in your ears, although the AirPods 3 doesn’t. Instead, it offers a skin detect sensor, which uses your skin to determine whether your AirPods are in your ears or not and, thus, whether it should play or pause audio. On the other hand, both the AirPods 3 and the Airpods Pro offer an intuitive force sensor for media control — something the AirPods 2 lacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ5nyc"&gt;The AirPods Max include an optical sensor and accelerometer in each ear cup. The headphones additionally come with a position and a case-detect sensor for each ear to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;automatically detect when they are on a user’s head. The left ear cup also has a gyroscope; all of these sensors combined make it possible to combine dynamic head tracking with spatial audio.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max from above" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cMZYNzByXtWocPciu5DPaLatDJo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159223/npatel_201209_4332_0019sq.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max offers an H1 chip and sensors in each ear cup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sFRSTg"&gt;As might be expected, the AirPods Max overwhelmingly outperform the rest of the AirPods when it comes to battery life. Apple says they offer up to 20 hours of listening time on a single charge with Active Noise Cancellation or Transparency mode on. With spatial audio enabled, the AirPods Max also offers up to 20 hours of movie playback on a single charge. Meanwhile, Apple says five minutes of charging provides around 1.5 hours of listening time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhi7XR"&gt;In contrast, Apple claims the AirPods 2 offer up to five hours of listening time on a single charge, while the AirPods 3 offer six hours. The tech giant also says the entry-level AirPods offer over 24 hours of listening time with the charging case, just like the AirPods Pro. Despite being cheaper than the AirPods Pro, the AirPods 3 beat them and the AirPods 2, offering up to 30 hours. The AirPods Pro also offer the least amount of listening on one charge — only 4.5 hours and up to five hours with Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency turned off. The Pro additionally offer up to 3.5 hours of talk time with a single charge, while the AirPods 3 offer up to three hours of talk time. In contrast, the AirPods 2 beats both, offering up to five hours of listening time with one charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzO40w"&gt;When it comes to charging case battery life, the AirPods 3 also differ from the AirPods 2 and AirPods Pro, offering up to 30 hours of listening time as opposed to the Pro and AirPods 2 providing over 24 hours of listening time. The AirPods 3 also offer up to 20 hours of talk time versus over 18 hours of talk time for the Pro and up to 18 hours of talk time for the AirPods 2. Apple claims both the AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro, however, take five minutes to provide about an hour of listening time or an hour of talk time. In contrast, the AirPods 2 need to be in the case for 15 minutes to provide up to three hours of listening time or up to two hours of talk time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="OjwqrU"&gt;Which should you buy?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="s4fzuv"&gt;No matter which you buy, each model in the AirPods lineup should offer great sound and call quality. However, which model you should purchase depends upon your needs and budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uDRQK"&gt;Off the bat, if you want over-ear headphones, obviously the AirPods Max are the ones you should buy. They are also the top choice for sound quality and offer features the others don’t, ranging from active noise cancellation to an H1 chip and sensors in each ear cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjmy7B"&gt;On the other hand, if you’re looking for a great pair of earpods, pick up the AirPods 3 or AirPods Pro, especially if you often engage in intense workouts, both of which offer sweat and water resistance. And if you’ve had trouble in the past with earpods slipping out of your ears, you may want to choose the AirPods Pro for their replaceable and customizable ear tips, which is something the AirPods 3 don’t offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ly2Hgf"&gt;If you’re on a tight budget, however, and want something under $200, consider the AirPods 3. Unless you’re truly strapped for cash, it’s worth forking out an extra $50 for the extra perks the AirPods 2 don’t offer, like a MagSafe charging case, greater spatial audio support, improved battery life, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senators call on Facebook to shelve Novi cryptocurrency project</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aHFeW2FGBZgjMAtBllEcTfg6cBI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017250/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qLWLJd"&gt;Senate Democrats called on Facebook to end its digital wallet and cryptocurrency project in a letter to chief executive Mark Zuckerberg Tuesday, saying that the company “cannot be trusted to manage cryptocurrency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UreiCB"&gt;The letter comes hours after Facebook launched Novi, a new digital wallet, as part of a “small” pilot program in the US and Guatemala. Facebook first announced its plans to enter the cryptocurrency industry over two years ago, but the digital currency project, called Libra, was halted after heavy criticism from lawmakers and regulators. The Libra currency was later rebranded as “Diem,” which has yet to be released alongside the new wallet product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ye2gMB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The letter comes hours after Facebook launched Novi&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3MKUj"&gt;In their letter, Sens. Brian Schatz (D-HI), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and others wrote, “Facebook is once again pursuing digital currency plans on an aggressive timeline and has already launched a pilot for a payments infrastructure network, even though these plans are incompatible with the actual financial regulatory landscape — not only for Diem specifically, but also for stablecoins in general.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XELpfy"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Tuesday, a Novi spokesperson said, “We look forward to responding to the Committee’s letter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uthzU7"&gt;Without its own currency, Facebook’s Novi wallet will allow users to send and receive money using the Paxos stablecoin in a partnership with Coinbase. Coinbase serves as the custody partner, holding the actual funds involved with the pilot program. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidmarcus/status/1450447443250728962?s=20"&gt;In a statement issued Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s David Marcus, head of F2 (Facebook Financial), said that the company still plans to launch Novi with Diem “once it receives regulatory approval and goes live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDEkVH"&gt;In 2019, the House and Senate hauled Zuckerberg in to provide testimony on the Libra project after weeks of back and forth with lawmakers who were largely skeptical of Facebook’s project. The hearing came only a year after Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20929313/mark-zuckerberg-hearing-congress-libra-calibra-facebook-maxine-waters"&gt;lawmakers questioned the company’s credibility&lt;/a&gt; in light of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofoyEF"&gt;In Tuesday’s letter, the senators invoked these same concerns. “Facebook cannot be trusted to manage a payment system or digital currency when its existing ability to manage risks and keep consumers safe has proven wholly insufficient,” they wrote. “We urge you to immediately discontinue your Novi pilot and to commit that you will not bring Diem to market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UckzVd"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen&lt;/a&gt; came before the Senate Commerce Committee to testify on the harms Facebook and its other products can inflict on users. Republicans and Democrats shared concerns over how platforms like Instagram could hurt teenagers, and Haugen’s testimony has already been met with legislative proposals to regulate the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="voDoaq"&gt;The Novi criticism from lawmakers also arrives as Facebook is bracing itself for more disclosures from Haugen, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1450154004730707972?s=20"&gt;a Monday Facebook Newsroom tweet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mP0XzE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 10/19/21 at 4:55PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a statement from Novi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sinclair TV stations experienced a massive outage during ransomware attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBG)..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DC9WWSqjCGL69m7FFqRo5b3-y0U=/0x14:3848x2579/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017024/1234599696.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hDAxHo"&gt;Sinclair, the broadcast group that runs some of the most popular local channels across the US, experienced a nationwide outage during a ransomware attack on October 16th (via &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/sinclair-tv-stations-disrupted-across-the-us-in-apparent-ransomware-attack/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Viewers initially were informed technical difficulties caused the disruption, but the &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912752/000119312521300540/d245680dex991.htm"&gt;US Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; published a filing from Sinclair two days later, identifying ransomware as the source of the outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u06cks"&gt;“Certain servers and workstations in its environment were encrypted with ransomware, and that certain office and operational networks were disrupted,” the report reads. “Data also was taken from the Company’s network. The Company is working to determine what information the data contained and will take other actions as appropriate based on its review.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzF4Ic"&gt;A person close to the situation tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that as of yesterday, employees still had problems accessing email or signing into systems, but today, those things are restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fLWMg5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US Treasury identified over $590 million in suspected ransomware-related transactions between January and June&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cgvhnG"&gt;Sinclair’s report also notes the company still isn’t up and running at 100 percent. While it’s trying to resolve the issue, there may still be “disruption to parts of the Company’s business, including certain aspects of its provision of local advertisements by its local broadcast stations on behalf of its customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJ2vof"&gt;Sinclair operates a massive number of local TV stations, causing the attack to prevent the company from broadcasting local news shows, sports games, and other scheduled content. According to &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;, the attack could’ve been much worse, as the bad actors weren’t able to compromise something called the “master control.” Having access to this tool let Sinclair replace some scheduled shows with a national feed — that way, not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of its channels were completely down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsxaop"&gt;And as &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt; notes, the ransomware attack was preceded by a &lt;a href="https://www.ftvlive.com/sqsp-test/2021/7/7/sinclair-cyber-attack"&gt;call for a password reset across all of Sinclair&lt;/a&gt; following the discovery of a “potentially serious network security issue.” It’s unclear whether that security issue has anything to do with the attack that just transpired. There still isn’t an official count of how many stations were shut down, as well as who exactly was responsible for the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tez70y"&gt;Ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly common; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428996/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-apology-investigation"&gt;Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616882/gigabyte-technologies-ransomware-attack-data-leak-112-gb-ransomexx"&gt;Gigabyte&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446388/cna-insurance-ransomware-attack-40-million-dollar-ransom"&gt;CNA Financial&lt;/a&gt; are just some of the high-profile companies targeted this year. According to a report by the US Treasury, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728765/us-treasury-ransomware-payout-numbers-reports-2021-first-half-cybercrime"&gt;ransomware payouts in 2021 are on track to beat the combined payouts from the entire past decade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wyze captures the banality of suburban life in its newest video doorbell ad (and it’s not pretty)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0m1MvHPvP9stEne2ErshzvSL0oI=/131x0:1115x656/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016997/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_2.07.45_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CL3BLJ"&gt;The typical sell for a video doorbell is: “You need to see what’s going on at your front door from your phone so no one steals your Amazon packages.” Smart home company Wyze has gone a step further, warning its prospective users: “You need a video doorbell so your neighborhood kids don’t put flaming bags of poop on your doormat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ekgfov"&gt;In a frankly hilarious video promoting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734238/wyze-video-doorbell-pro-price-specs-shipping"&gt;new Wyze Video Doorbell Pro&lt;/a&gt;, the company invites you to purchase its newest doorbell so you can keep a watchful eye over the bonafide war zone that is the classic suburban neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gk0yzv"&gt;The video opens with a soothing James Earl Jones-style voiceover discussing the magnificence of the American “Front Porch” as a young boy runs joyfully along the path to his front door. But as we zoom in, the child is revealed to be a grubby little turd who is playing Ding Dong Ditch on a soon-to-be angry dad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNABxg"&gt;We see him pushing the Wyze doorbell frantically and peering menacingly in through the fisheye lens on the homeowner’s Wyze app. As the man leaps up and chases the kid down his front path, he clips a delivery driver, who responds by kicking the package he was delivering onto the porch with all the finesse of an NFL kicker. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BD3tpOZuyA1FCwwzHVXq47ZBNFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939494/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_2.07.45_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wyze’s video promoting its new video doorbell reflects on the realities of why you might want one — such as neighborhood kids leaving flaming bags of dog poop on your porch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jGBVsv"&gt;All the while, the soothing narrator is telling us about the benefits of Wyze’s new doorbell — including package detection and pet detection — as, on cue, the family’s small terrier runs out to attack the mail carrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eayyat"&gt;As the voiceover waxes lyrical on neighborly neighbors bringing by a basketful of freshly picked garden zucchinis, the husband is pelted with eggs by an entire gang of neighborhood kids. When his wife comes out to save him, one of those dastardly kids puts — what we can only assume by her face as she stamps it out — a bag full of flaming dog poop on the doormat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQN6l5"&gt;It’s clearly a send-up of video doorbell company Ring’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Fe7SJ_LxZro"&gt;own marketing push&lt;/a&gt;, which is focused on how neighborly we all are and how we are all looking out for each other and our packages. In the end — sad as it is to say — Wyze is probably painting a slightly more realistic picture of the storied American neighborhood — and of why you might actually want a video doorbell.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat says the Pixel 6 is ‘the fastest phone to make a Snap’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Quick Tap to Snap feature" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pG5ug9t9h16_IfC8jQ_0YMV0Cq4=/0x47:1112x788/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016898/snapchat_quick_tap_snap.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Snapchat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EwgD1Q"&gt;At today’s Pixel event, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;Google &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;dove&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt; into the details about the Pixel 6 series devices&lt;/a&gt; and outlined a brand new feature that will make sending Snaps even faster. The new feature, called Quick Tap to Snap, adds a camera-only version of Snapchat directly to the lock screen of the Pixel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vo7NeY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Us   &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snapchat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6&lt;/a&gt; is the fastest phone to make a Snap thanks to Quick Tap to Snap!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And check out Pixel lenses and other exclusive features too!&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6Launch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6Launch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/94trIxzHzk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/94trIxzHzk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Made By Google (@madebygoogle) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1450516328763232261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EWTrw3"&gt;To access it, all you have to do is tap the back of your phone twice, and the Snapchat camera will open. From there, you can snap a picture all without unlocking your device — you’ll only have to authenticate your identity when you go to send the Snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Obcgex"&gt;In addition to Quick Tap to Snap, Google is also working on exclusive augmented reality Lenses, as well as incorporating live translation into Snapchat. This means that users will be able to have their conversations translated in real-time while using the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1Y6qN"&gt;Google’s partnership with Snapchat doesn’t come as much of a surprise, considering that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/15/5106950/google-snapchat-4-billion-buyout-rumor"&gt;Google actually attempted to buy Snapchat in the past&lt;/a&gt;. Now that Snapchat is sort of built into the Pixel, Google might see that as a small victory. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The biggest announcements from Google’s Pixel 6 event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gdcUY04juykf3dUZuLQ_fPyEcas=/152x0:1768x1077/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016892/lcimg_e5568f90_70f5_4d74_938b_5d1c34060e11.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B3AjPT"&gt;Google just wrapped up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733532/google-pixel-6-pro-event-live-blog"&gt;its Pixel 6 Fall Launch event&lt;/a&gt;, where it announced two new phones as well as a wealth of features that are supported by its new Tensor processor. Here are the biggest things Google announced during its live stream.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qYkC6nm2kiiK0khVjc2DFmxtpp8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755114/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AEQ0zz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Google finally shows off the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i7vkhn"&gt;After months of leaks, we got the full details on Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro phones — the Pixel 6 will sell for $599 and the Pixel 6 Pro for $899. Both will feature Google’s Tensor processor and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;a 50-megapixel camera&lt;/a&gt; (which bins images down to 12.5-megapixels during processing). The phones also feature an ultra-wide camera, and the Pro adds a telephoto camera and gives the selfie camera an upgrade with a wider lens and higher-resolution sensor. The Pro model is also physically larger, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;it’s not a massive difference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IaquUxERUcc8HTWAYqEYbuZ_yU8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939252/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_1.08.09_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="H0EQpd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22710844/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-ai-speed-specs-details"&gt;Google’s new phones are powered by its Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NrRCfR"&gt;Much of Google’s event focused on the Google-designed Tensor processor that powers the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Google showed off how the machine learning prowess of its chip would be able to help with tasks like voice recognition, making photos less blurry (and even automatically erasing unwanted people from the background), and real-time captions and translation. Outside of ML, Google says that it should be competitive with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon processors when it comes to overall CPU and GPU performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WedQNW"&gt;Google also emphasized how the Tensor could help its phones be more personalized to you but didn’t go into much detail on how exactly that would work. Thankfully, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;we have our hands on the new phones&lt;/a&gt;, so we’ll be able to poke around at them. Speaking of those phones...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IjF24v"&gt;Google showed off the results of its camera inclusivity work with Real Tone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6F6T72"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442515/google-camera-app-inclusive-image-equity-skintones"&gt;At Google I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Google announced it was working on making its cameras and photo processing better for people with darker skin, and today, we got to see some of those results. Google’s Real Tone tech, which will work both in its camera app and third-party ones, will try to accurately depict people’s skin tones instead of doing weird things with exposure and contrast like old phones used to do. Google’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/WNarpiGz3Kk?t=2775"&gt;before-and-after presentation&lt;/a&gt; was impressive, but we’ll have to see how it actually performs in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Pixel tap to Snap" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FcX26u6qXSONrM0yotcIULtTH9M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939407/google_pixel_tap_snap.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The fastest phone to make a Snap”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QwUH07"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22499034"&gt;Snapchat gets a special place on the Pixel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qtFb6N"&gt;You’ll be able to quickly access Snapchat’s camera by tapping the back of the Pixel, even from the lock screen. Of course, you’ll have to log into the phone to actually send the Snap to your friends, but it’s quite possibly the quickest way to send a Snap that we’ve seen yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="rzqJfm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22498413"&gt;Google’s trying to make phone trees suck less&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="na3Wsr"&gt;Google announced a new Pixel phone feature, which aims to make calls to customer service lines less awful by trying to estimate how long you’ll have to wait on hold and giving you a written list of the phone tree options, so you don’t have to go “wait, what number do I press for this again?” Google’s also expanding its feature that lets you have your phone wait on hold for you to more countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="qxpSs0"&gt;Google didn’t announce it during the event itself, but it’s also launched Pixel Pass alongside the new phones. Pixel Pass lets you bundle a phone (and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/store/answer/7528518?hl=en"&gt;Google’s Preferred Care repair plan&lt;/a&gt;), cloud storage, YouTube Premium, and Google Play Pass, all in one monthly payment. Google’s charging $45 per month for the plan with a Pixel 6 and $55 a month for the Pixel 6 Pro plan. According to the company, you’ll end up paying off your phone over the course of two years, and if you cancel Pixel Pass, you’ll have to pay off the remaining balance on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIfpRT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-pixel-pass/?_ga=2.47950050.454935072.1634662818-63996501.1634662818"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; that subscribers to Google Fi, its cellular plan, will get $5 off their monthly bill for subscribing to Pixel Pass. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how the Pixel 6 compares to the Pixel 6 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h-JP5RqG0K2_Zvw2q3b_1-Pbu8Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016830/bfarsace_211014_4802_0105.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sote5c"&gt;There’s a lot that we already knew about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; ahead of their debut at Google’s October 2021 event. Some of the key specs, including the Tensor processor and the camera details, were made publicly available by Google itself. But of course, we know a lot more now than we did before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dv7Xm"&gt;Check out my colleague Dan Seifert’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;big hands-on with both phones right here&lt;/a&gt;. It dives into the design, features, and he talks about how this is a big moment both for Google to prove that its Tensor processor is as good as it claims to be and that it knows how to make flagship phones that people want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="j9ykUg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sundar Pichai and Rick Osterloh think the Pixel 6 is Google’s breakout phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oOL3J0"&gt;If all that you’re curious about is raw specs, we’ve got that below. Given that the design differences between the Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6 are minor, we’re focused instead on what’s inside of them. There are just a couple of differences internally, but you deserve to know what they are. To be exhaustive, we’ve also compared them to other Pixel phones that you can easily buy these days, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xmqcf3"&gt;We’ll add more specs to this table should they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8yT6YJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10815633"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p id="DqywpW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734748/google-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"&gt;Pre-orders for Google’s new line of phones&lt;/a&gt; started at the same time as their launch event, but for most of us, trying to buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; has meant seeing nothing but error screens. Some unsteadiness is to be expected given the sudden demand, but at 1PM ET, the doors opened and Google’s store seemed to fall flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="feOHQ5"&gt;Since then things have improved, but more than an hour later, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisPirillo/status/1450522739442262018"&gt;most of us&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1450527567593758721"&gt;only seeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1450507803504881666"&gt;one error code after another&lt;/a&gt;. If you can get through, you can select to use the new Pixel Pass or add on a 30W phone charger. The fast wireless charging &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22732918/google-pixel-stand-23w-wireless-charging"&gt;Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt;, however, says it’s “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmY7tH"&gt;A quick scan of social media reveals that some people have been able to complete purchases for the new Pixel 6. For the rest of us, at least we’ve had time to learn patience while searching for a PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch OLED, RTX 3090, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727969/xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-price-release-date"&gt;Xbox Series X refrigerator&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yXs2J"&gt;On Twitter, the Made By Google account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1450525148583399430"&gt;offers an apology&lt;/a&gt; for the issues, saying “We will let you know when it’s back up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kvfIWe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our Google Store went down during the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6Launch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6Launch&lt;/a&gt;. We apologize and are working on it. We will let you know when it’s back up.&lt;/p&gt;— Made By Google (@madebygoogle) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1450525148583399430?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
