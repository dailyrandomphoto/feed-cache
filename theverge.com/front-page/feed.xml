    <title>HBO Max will debut its cheaper, ad-supported tier in June</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/72RJIb4KLLpfbo417F3_kQS6pTw=/0x0:1725x1150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68955404/Screen_Shot_2021_03_12_at_10.18.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="syNyc9"&gt;WarnerMedia is set to launch an ad-supported tier for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548253/hbo-max-netflix-hulu-streaming-cable"&gt;HBO Max streaming service this June&lt;/a&gt;, and executives are hoping that having a cheaper option will help boost subscriber growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ahQku"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T didn’t provide additional information in a press release sent out, including price or exact launch date, but noted that &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=JuneCheaperAd031221"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; will also launch in about 60 markets outside of the US in 2021. WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar recently spoke about the incoming advertisement supported tier at the Goldman Sachs conference, noting that “most people on this planet are not wealthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxWx86"&gt;“And so if we can wake up and use price and be able to kind of invent and do things elegantly through advertising to reduce the price of a service, I think that’s a fantastic thing for fans,” he said, as &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/warnermedia-jason-kilar-movie-windows-hbo-max-avod-1234921633/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mscVHC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Most people on this planet are not wealthy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Dwp4X"&gt;Executives seemingly have a lot of hope that an ad-supported tier will help subscriber count skyrocket. AT&amp;amp;T is raising subscriber targets for both 2021 and 2025, and the company now expects to end 2021 with roughly 67-70 million subscribers worldwide and end 2025 with anywhere between 120 and 125 million subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxHLG0"&gt;That’s a massive increase compared to what executives touted previously — 75 to 90 million — in October. HBO and HBO Max ended 2020 with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252069/hbo-max-subscribers-wonder-woman-1984-att-earnings"&gt;combined 41 million subscribers, but with one giant asterisk&lt;/a&gt;. Of the 37.7 million cable HBO subscribers, less than half actually activated their free &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=JuneCheaperAd031221"&gt;HBO Max &lt;/a&gt;upgrade.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D5yh9I"&gt;Two of the biggest issues impacting HBO Max from the get-go were price and awareness. With the company trying to figure out a better approach to communicating what HBO Max is (and how it differs from HBO), and a cheaper plan soon available, executives are clearly expecting things to pick up. Of course, that’s on top of measures taken to boost subscribers, including dropping new movies in 2021 on&lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=JuneCheaperAd031221"&gt; HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; the same day they’re available in theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C83TFR"&gt;The real question now is whether people on the ad-supported tier will have to watch original HBO programming with ads. For anyone who’s never experienced watching a syndicated HBO show on a different network, it’s certainly a strange experience. Kilar is expected to announce more information about the plans during today’s AT&amp;amp;T investor and analyst event. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How modders rebuilt Resident Evil 4’s graphics from scratch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Resident Evil 4 HD Project" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/odAVoAo43ufv_olKiEHmRTgy2us=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68955352/re4hdprojectlede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from the Resident Evil 4 HD Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WqjleW"&gt;Albert Marin has taken some very specific vacations. In Wales, he visited Raglan Castle to snap pictures of its stone wall. At the Palau Güell in Barcelona, he took meticulous photos, not of the building itself, but of the marble floor and its unique veins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FbRZC"&gt;His trips followed in the steps of Capcom, which put bits of real-world architecture found across Europe into &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;, which was originally released over 16 years ago. “I collected a great number of locations the game’s developers use as source material,” Marin told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zm8OQE"&gt;Fast forward to 2021, and Marin is now seven years into a project to remaster &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;’s blurry GameCube-era graphics into crisp HD, in part using high-resolution photos he’s taken of everything from surfaces and doors to general architecture that seemed to have made their way into the original game. Even though Capcom published its own PC remaster in 2014, it wasn’t Marin’s idea of a true HD version of the game, so he and a small team have been poring through the game’s files to faithfully update every texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YgNYYU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10371794"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9TShUG"&gt;In some cases, they work with what Capcom already made, sharpening the images with a mix of off-the-shelf apps and custom-built tools. Other times, Marin is making hand-crafted textures based on high resolution stock photos or pictures that he’s taken himself. If you own the &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/254700/Resident_Evil_4/"&gt;Ultimate HD version of the game on Steam&lt;/a&gt;, you can actually test out an &lt;a href="https://www.re4hd.com/?page_id=6064"&gt;in-progress version of the texture pack&lt;/a&gt; right now. Eventually, every rock, wall, button, and dial will have been retouched by this small team of modders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPBWU5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.re4hd.com/"&gt;The fan-funded &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 &lt;/em&gt;HD Project&lt;/a&gt; is almost at the finish line and should be wrapped up later in 2021. Marin says he’s amassed over 4,500 Photoshop files and put in more than 9,000 hours of work (just on his part) to get to this point.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4OnIZ"&gt;I spoke with Marin over email about his experience tackling a project of this scale, balancing expectations from fans who are just as passionate about the game, how the team was able to deconstruct the game’s files, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0WdJRA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How exactly do you remaster the visuals? Do you redraw textures from the ground up, or have a specialized way to increase the resolution of the original without degrading their quality?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vb9yLg"&gt;Most textures are re-created from scratch using some texture library images as a base. The original textures need to be analyzed several times in order to make sure the new source images match in terms of color, lighting, and even the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3DcmK"&gt;For example, a rock texture: It may sound like an easy challenge, and it is, if you don’t have an original texture you need to be faithful to. You can’t imagine how complicated it can be to find a rock surface that matches with the original among the hundreds of different kinds of rocks nature has to offer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kwpWNl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10371800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E14C5b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What sorts of applications and tech do you use to accomplish your goals with this project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NjmRO"&gt;A talented modder and coder, “Son of Persia,” helped us a lot: He developed most of the tools I use to edit 3D models, lights, effects, collision data, and much more. I found out how some files work, but I needed to edit in a hexadecimal editor manually. This means a single light/effect would take hours to edit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxwkPM"&gt;“Son of Persia” took all my findings about these files and generated automated tools that would make this work &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; easier. And he also deciphered how other files of the game work and what they do, and he generated the needed tools to edit these kinds of files as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6E5WZT"&gt;We also use Photoshop, 3ds Max, and dozens of custom tools courtesy of “Son of Persia” and other modders. These tools unpack and convert all the game files into editable data (mostly understandable .txt files and 3D files that can be opened with most 3D editors). Once the data is edited it can be repacked again with the same tools. But I have to admit sometimes I manually edit a few things in a hexadecimal editor, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wHs7KG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Modding and remastering this game is also a game for me”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c7Nc9T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it intimidating to make certain adjustments to a game that has such a passionate fanbase, or are you confident in your changes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4T5HW"&gt;We are on the safe side because one of the main goals of this project is to be faithful to the original. And here is where subjectivity plays an important role: Low resolution textures leave a lot to the imagination, and you know... every person’s imagination is different!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65Vc67"&gt;Sometimes we receive complaints even when we use the exact same texture, but in HD resolutions, because the low-res textures looked like it was dirtier or muddy or something like that. But the HD re-creation looked too clean in comparison, depending on what the person interpreted when looking at the low-res surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njTJpY"&gt;And then we have all the lighting and effects changes I’ve done. Most of them are well-received, but I’m aware my personal taste is playing a role to some degree, so I’m always open to feedback and this is the reason I post all those videos and comparison images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBLUYb"&gt;I’ve changed a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of things because of the feedback we receive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NIzyhkbI3M48r9q7kzhQeGriQN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342353/image__2_.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Albert Marin standing in front of Raglan Castle, specifically, in front of the wall he says is used in a few &lt;/em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;em&gt; titles.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rdkjAO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of the biggest and smallest changes your team has made to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RE4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; during this project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sI5TZh"&gt;The biggest change by far is an entire piece of area created from scratch in the Separate Ways mini-game. The transition between one room and the other made no sense. I combined the 3D structure of the connecting areas and I found out a portion of the path was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlwVJL"&gt;The smallest changes are any small texture and small 3D improvement done here and there. In fact, there are hundreds of small edits I’m sure most people won’t ever notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="beoa84"&gt;As an example, I remember some design changes in certain ammo boxes. This PC port has a HD textures option. The HD textures are 95 percent an upscaled and filtered version of the original [GameCube] textures, but some of the textures are redone or slightly adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jz-Qy3vpUHZKv15LIFYJ_3d7F1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342376/COMPARISON_DETAIL.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Albert Marin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marin’s team restored some of Capcom’s original texture work that had been lost in later ports, then enhanced it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GhYJpj"&gt;In the image (above) you can see how they altered the TMP ammo box design. The “J” and the wolf drawing on the side are different. So, while I was upscaling that texture I took the opportunity to restore the original design from previous versions of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0prUe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have been your favorite sections of the game to upscale textures for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOwKk5"&gt;The castle area, by far, because I used a lot of pictures I took myself during the trips I did around Spain and Wales. It was really satisfying to identify and improve all those architectural surfaces!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nFQF2N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10371810"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c8MsLx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What section(s) of the game required the most amount of work to remaster? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfebLy"&gt;The laboratory and factory areas on the island are probably the most time-consuming in terms of texture and 3D retouching, because there are tons of weird and blurry control panels, medical and military devices, and cables. Any small inaccuracy becomes really apparent, unlike the organic textures of the village or the old architectural surfaces in the castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GvTBSh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is your HD project focused strictly on visuals, or has there been work done to the sound quality and other parts of the game as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PCjQW"&gt;Unfortunately I do not have enough sound knowledge to remaster the game’s audio. Although I fixed some bugs, mostly related to wrong sounds playing in the wrong moment or low quality sounds during the Separate Ways campaign (shipped as part of the PS2 port and all ports following it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5FouL"&gt;I also fixed some stage collision issues here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshots showing versions of a texture from the game. On the left is the HD Project, in the middle is the original texture, and on the right is a version upscaled by AI." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/caaGWI02NTi04UFoPbuNyNEPTxg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22365098/re4remake2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Albert Marin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI upscaling looks far better than the original texture, but not as good as what Marin and the team eventually accomplished manually.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fdvyOw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You currently accept donations to help fund the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RE4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; HD project, but do you plan to sell the finished project once it releases?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nSAGr"&gt;No, it will be for free. Modding and remastering this game is also a game for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XazxXL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What sort of reception have you gotten from this project, and who do you hope to reach with it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJR2ar"&gt;It surpasses anything I’d imagined. I guess some people, sites, and communities have spread its existence. But after all, &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; has a huge fanbase, so I guess it’s quite understandable a few thousands of this fanbase is interested in the remaster process of one of the best games of all history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOB6TW"&gt;About our target audience, I’d say, everyone who likes the remasters for the sake of the visual pleasure; or playing their favorite game you like with no trace of blurriness, or simply the people who like this kind of fan project but don’t like the game at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMDleT"&gt;Because this project is more about the journey than the final result. After all, it can’t compete with any next-gen game in terms of visuals, no matter how crisp the textures are or how round the models look.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qi8UtMOI3OQMFo12nfZYFuNvTMg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342368/LAB.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Albert Marin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;One of &lt;/em&gt;Resident Evil 4’&lt;em&gt;s laboratory environments, with upscaled textures applied.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DcULTk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you worked in any capacity with Capcom (or any of its current or former employees) on this project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTGiqY"&gt;No. We were in contact with them at the beginning. Someone at Capcom was interested in our project, and he took the time to send a planning document, but I guess the other Capcom people in Japan were not interested because the communication ended there. Other than that, there was no help on making the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIE4aM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given that Capcom recently released the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RE3 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;remake, it’s likely that an &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RE4 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;remake is in development. Does your team worry about Capcom eventually stealing your thunder, so to speak, with an improved version of the game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWGFfr"&gt;No, the remakes are really different games. Even now, the original &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 2 &amp;amp; 3&lt;/em&gt; receive their own mods and visual improvements (&lt;a href="https://www.reshdp.com/re2/"&gt;Resident Evil 2 and 3 HD Seamless Project&lt;/a&gt;) They are different and complementary experiences. Just think about any Hollywood remake. Most of them don’t hurt the original movie, and they are alternative visions of the older title.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 phones are up to $500 off today at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DuVknOc6e6k01dOiJQ9njDvk87o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68955182/vpavic_200807_4133_0116.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LCjHi3"&gt;Woot has discounted Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 line today, with up to $500 in savings available depending on which phone you buy. You can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/samsung-galaxy-note-20-note-20-ultra-5g-128gb-unlocked" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Note 20&lt;/a&gt;, which comes in mystic green and features 8GB of RAM and a 6.7-inch 1080p LCD screen for only $600. Alternatively, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/samsung-galaxy-note-20-note-20-ultra-5g-128gb-unlocked" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; for $200 more, which comes in mystic bronze and features 12GB of RAM and a 6.9-inch 1440p OLED screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrrvzO"&gt;These prices are for the unlocked versions, and both include 128GB of storage; however, only the Note 20 Ultra features a microSD slot, allowing you to expand your storage if you choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7uC8mL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10388305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5OWAIF"&gt;Best Buy has discounted &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734693986308675785#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Western Digital’s 14TB 3.0 external hard drive&lt;/a&gt;. You can get it for only $220; that’s $90 off its usual $310 price tag. Although we have seen this particular configuration go down to under $200, this is still a good deal considering all the space you’re getting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQRPs3"&gt;Western Digital’s 14TB Elements external desktop hard drive connects via USB but still requires a power cable to function (included with the purchase) and features speedy desktop storage transfers with rates up to 5GB per second in USB 3.0 mode. Additionally, this product uses the same drives as Western Digital Red NAS, meaning &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApvLyorr3g"&gt;you can take out the internal SATA drive&lt;/a&gt; and place it inside your desktop or a NAS setup of your own.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZaTBA9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9526252"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pWOwQl"&gt;In case you missed it earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/sony-sony-ps5-dual-sense-white-sony-dual-sense-wireless" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot has knocked $10 off the DualSense&lt;/a&gt; game controller. A successor to the PS4’s DualShock 4, the DualSense is included and designed for the PS5; it includes a built-in microphone, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback technologies that aim to deliver better in-game feedback while playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="zPidmY"&gt;When it comes to wired gaming mice, we think Logitech’s G502 Hero is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22244488/gaming-gear-recommendations-favorite-nintendo-logitech-microsoft"&gt;one of the best on the market right now&lt;/a&gt; for PC gaming. At $50, it is already a good deal, but right now, this gaming mouse is down to $40 at several retailers, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G502-Performance-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B07GBZ4Q68?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734691689465182851#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Here’s what it’s like to craft live on stream&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="YJKxpk"&gt;PmsProxy, a &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pmsproxy"&gt;partnered Twitch streamer&lt;/a&gt; who has 147,000 followers, was tired. Tired of streaming &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto &lt;/em&gt;roleplay, and of streaming herself playing games more generally — something she’d been doing nearly every day for around six years. “I didn’t just want to sit and play games all day, I realized,” she says when I reach her by Discord. “I want to either tell a story through roleplay or just do something that made it feel fulfilling, and roleplay wasn’t that.” So she decided to make a change: instead of streaming herself playing games, she’d stream herself making things for her &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fca%2Fshop%2FKiKiCraftedByHand&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22303070%2Ftwitch-makers-crafting-diy-woodworking-leatherworking" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;business&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eY5HxT"&gt;That business was leatherworking. Proxy made the jump from full-time game streamer to full-time crafting streamer at the beginning of this year; it was a nerve-wracking but ultimately necessary step. “It’s been unbelievably different in the best way possible,” she says. “My viewers have gone up, my subs have gone up. And I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that my community members are seeing me be happy, right? They’re seeing me do something that I love.” The people who stayed, she says, want to buy her work and learn how she makes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UBRMMO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=GrossHumbleCurlewPoooound-Jbl0hxt8yVyeycWh&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FlBbez"&gt;Twitch is usually thought of as a place for streaming video games. And while that reputation is deserved — yes, a lot of people stream their gaming on Twitch — the site also has a surprising breadth of channels. Makers &amp;amp; Crafting is one of them; &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2018/09/26/introducing-tags-and-new-categories-new-ways-to-discover-streamers-on-twitch-33744ef7b04f/"&gt;the category was created in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, after Twitch renamed “Hobbies &amp;amp; Crafts” to better represent the many pros who streamed in it (in their words). According to Twitch Tracker, a website that logs Twitch statistics, the category averaged 520 viewers in September 2018, the month it was created. As of January 2021, Makers &amp;amp; Crafting was averaging 1,520 viewers, or about three times more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4iftRD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Makers &amp;amp; Crafting streamers are calmer. Less frenetic. The vibe is aggressively wholesome&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7mLafP"&gt;The people who stream in the category do everything from embroidery to woodworking; it’s mesmerizing to bounce among them. Makers &amp;amp; Crafting is a warm, welcoming category that feels a little intimate. The streams can run long — I mean, they’re making physical goods — but every streamer I’ve seen seems to vibrate at a slightly different frequency than the people who stream on the rest of the site. They’re calmer. Less frenetic. The vibe is aggressively wholesome. In other words: it’s about as close to an oasis as you can get online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="d6ReXH"&gt;
&lt;p id="cfYHps"&gt;Streaming anything is difficult. In every broadcast you have to be a host, producer, audio engineer, and video technician — all at the same time. Streaming your crafts, however, is harder: making things for an audience is a special kind of difficult, especially if the products you’re making are eventually going to be sold. What’s perhaps more interesting is how learning crafts has changed with the accessibility of the internet. Proxy and another streamer and woodworker I spoke to, WorkedLettuce3 — whose handle was chosen by the Xbox gamertag gods — both learned their crafts from the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mF3cEk"&gt;“I watched a lot of YouTube videos,” he says. “I just never thought it would be something I would take up. Because, you know, a lot of woodworking YouTubers in particular, they like to flex their shop, they like to flex all the hundreds of thousands of dollars they spent on their tools, right? And, yeah, I mean, that was never gonna be me.” Even so, he found a channel that he says motivated him to be a woodworker — one that emphasized that you didn’t need tons of gear to pick it up as a hobby. “I’m very, very glad I found it because I’ve been loving just messing around woodworking, hanging out with people in the garage like we’ve been doing now,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oO2ZR4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=SpicyAbstruseDolphinTooSpicy-7Rl3RlN9FW2uVeor&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FLZfe4"&gt;Proxy also learned some of the tools of her leatherworking trade from the internet. Her foray into the Makers &amp;amp; Crafting section coincided with the first time she tried her hand at leatherworking. “I started leather crafting January of this year. Like my first time really getting my hands on my own stuff was in January,” she says. “But I spent the last year researching. So starting in 2019 and all through 2020, I did nothing but watch YouTube videos and Instagram videos. I did tons of research.” Proxy says she’s always been gifted in working with her hands. Leatherworking is just the most recent outlet. (She also went to art school.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b09l6D"&gt;Lettuce is in a similar position; before six months ago, he’d never sawn a board in half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdraEa"&gt;He’d never streamed before, either. His first streaming setup was just streaming directly to Twitch from his phone; these days, he’s got a dedicated PC in his garage, a couple webcams, and the TV from his living room to read chat on. And his chat is important: among his viewers are veteran woodworkers and other crafters, along with people who’ve just stopped by to watch. The woodworkers help him when he’s stuck; he says there are people there who have coached him through his entire woodworking career. That kind of interaction is unique to Twitch, and to the Makers &amp;amp; Crafting section in particular. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oFpFaH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lettuce is in a similar position; before six months ago, he’d never sawn a board in half&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t7cmmx"&gt;Even so, he says he finds woodworking on stream scary sometimes. “Like, before the first time I turned my table saw on, I was terrified. Before I turned my router on for the first time, I was terrified. Before I ran a circular saw for the first time, I was terrified,” he says. And he did fall into some bad habits — like reading chat from his phone while working on things. “My chat would see me reading the chat from my phone. And a couple people in there just like stepped in and they were like, ‘Yo, like, for real. You can’t be doing that.’” He credits chat with keeping him honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYgl5Z"&gt;“No one is coming in to backseat you,” says Proxy. “They’re not like, ‘Oh, you should go here and you should do this. And oh, you didn’t kill my favorite boss.’” Viewers are there to watch someone make something, and maybe learn a little in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VPOwdk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Proxy also makes just about everything in her store live on stream&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2ay8dB"&gt;Proxy also makes just about everything in her store live on stream. Which she says is intimidating but also rewarding — because viewers (who are also buyers) can see exactly how much labor goes into making what they’ve bought. “They get to see what work is actually being put into this,” she says. “It’s not just, you know, a quick two hours, and it’s done. It’s a grueling two hours. Like everything is hand cut, and hand stitched and glued and stamped.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QY32j3"&gt;Not everyone sells what they make on stream. Another crafter I spoke to, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lasergeekcreations"&gt;LaserGeekCreations&lt;/a&gt;, says that he doesn’t usually create the things that show up in his shop on stream. “Mainly because a lot of the stuff that’s on my Etsy shop is like, quick and easy to make,” he says. “It’s kind of boring to make a lot of the time.” (He assuages this boredom by &lt;a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/ThoughtfulExpensiveConsoleHotPokket?tt_content=url&amp;amp;tt_medium=clips_api"&gt;creating things like a giant wooden dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;, which he also destroyed on stream.) LaserGeekCreations also happens to be the streamer who raided Lettuce when he was just starting out — which gave Lettuce his first real start on Twitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="66K84U"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=DeliciousTawdryAlligatorDeIlluminati&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="0wng9J"&gt;
&lt;p id="a0cP5n"&gt;It’s not all fun and games on Twitch. The larger viewer community can sometimes be brutally toxic to people who don’t fit its notions of who can and can’t be a streamer; recently, Twitch partner &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/negaoryx"&gt;Negaoryx&lt;/a&gt; lamented, at Twitch’s 2020 Participation Ceremony event, that the chat was targeting presenters with tons of hate speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CdVYXy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There's more than 42,000+ viewers watching the Twitch Participation Ceremony on the offical &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Twitch&lt;/a&gt; channel now. Users in chat are spewing hate speech &amp;amp; harassing the guest streamers. 3 mod names in the chat list but since I've been watching, have seen ZERO messages get deleted.&lt;/p&gt;— negaoryx (@negaoryx) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/negaoryx/status/1353109188709212160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0ty08p"&gt;Makers &amp;amp; Crafting &lt;em&gt;feels &lt;/em&gt;different, though. It’s smaller, for one thing. But all the people I’ve spoken to who’ve been involved with the category think it’s a uniquely welcoming space nestled within the larger Twitch community. “It was almost like — it’s gonna sound fucking hilarious — but it was almost like walking into a warm hug,” says Proxy. “It was just like everyone was so welcome.” During her first week in the section, Proxy says she went from getting around 100 viewers to getting more than 500. They were leatherworkers and other crafters; they dropped tips and ideas and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLUrUZ"&gt;Lettuce had a similarly warm experience. “The Makers &amp;amp; Crafting community is — I’m gonna say in my opinion, but I’m pretty sure it’s a fact — that they’re the most welcoming and loving community-minded community I’ve ever seen in my entire life.” Once the pandemic is over, Lettuce says, he’s considering driving from Las Vegas, where he lives, to New Jersey, where his parents are, and visiting his friends from Twitch on the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNr4Dg"&gt;“I don’t think I’ll ever leave Twitch. I mean, live-streaming and the community in general,” he says. “The stream will still be a thing, but I think interpersonal communication and hanging out and, you know, giving someone a firm handshake is my end goal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ke63nj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t think I’ll ever leave Twitch.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q29o6J"&gt;LaserGeekCreations has been streaming crafting for longer than Lettuce and Proxy, and he confirms their assessments of the community. “The makers community is such an amazing community. I think you’ve probably heard that from other people already,” he says. “Because it doesn’t matter what you’re making. We’re all makers, we all like seeing what other people are doing. Everyone’s so supportive of each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Krx3XS"&gt;That kind of supportive community feeling can be invaluable if you’re trying to finish something. As anyone who’s tried to make anything knows, creating things is hard because going from idea to reality requires a number of steps, which sometimes aren’t particularly obvious. On Twitch, the Makers &amp;amp; Crafting community makes it just a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ziqk9h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sen. Marco Rubio endorses Amazon warehouse union drive in surprise op-ed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Foreign Relations Committee Examines Nomination Of Linda Thomas-Greenfield For UN Ambassador" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JRTuZxL2VBCpWbY84ZXWkvJumks=/0x0:3752x2501/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68954949/1230817185.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fw10BS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/03/12/amazon-union-not-helping-working-class-economy-column/6947823002/"&gt;Writing in &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) made a surprise endorsement of a fledgling union at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama. In the op-ed, Rubio frames the union drive as a necessary response to the encroaching power of Amazon, a longtime target for Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xaxpGb"&gt;“When the conflict is between working Americans and a company whose leadership has decided to wage culture war against working-class values, the choice is easy — I support the workers,” Rubio writes in the op-ed. “And that’s why I stand with those at Amazon’s Bessemer warehouse today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x6NteO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rubio says Amazon “wages culture war against working-class values”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gPyrHA"&gt;Workers at the Bessemer warehouse are in the process of voting on whether to unionize, as overseen by the National Labor Relations Board. Amazon had sought to delay the vote or require in-person voting, but both efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. The election process will conclude at the end of the month, with a simple majority required to certify the union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zg8E4D"&gt;The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which will represent the Bessemer workers if the union drive is successful, applauded the op-ed. “We welcome support from all quarters,” said RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum in a statement. “Senator Rubio’s support demonstrates that the best way for working people to achieve dignity and respect in the workplace is through unionization. This should not be a partisan issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Opyt0o"&gt;Amazon has mounted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;an aggressive campaign&lt;/a&gt; in opposition to the union drive, posting materials on the worksite and running digital ads across &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301352/twitch-removes-amazon-anti-union-ads"&gt;a variety of platforms&lt;/a&gt; highlighting the benefits of a union-free workplace. In one incident, Amazon managers worked with local county officials to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287191/amazon-alabama-warehouse-union-traffic-light-change-bessemer"&gt;alter the timing on a streetlight near the warehouse&lt;/a&gt;, a move union organizers believe was made in order to hamper the union campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eVXRR"&gt;Coming from a conservative Republican, the endorsement will surprise many — but it’s not the first time Rubio has offered measured support to labor unions. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/help-working-class-voters-us-must-value-work/578032/"&gt;In an &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; essay in December 2018&lt;/a&gt;, he wrote “any discussion of the dignity of work should mention unions,” referring back to his father’s experience with the Culinary Workers Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBiQr7"&gt;Notably, the op-ed stops short of a general endorsement of organized labor, maintaining that “adversarial labor relations are generally harmful.” Rubio also frames his support for the union in conservative terms, presenting it as a bulwark against cultural liberalism in the workplace. “Today it might be workplace conditions,” the Senator writes, “but tomorrow it might be a requirement that the workers embrace management’s latest ‘woke’ human resources fad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4UE0ns"&gt;The op-ed comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306952/amazon-union-biden-statement-bessemer-alabama-warehouse"&gt;a video statement from President Biden earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, which expressed broad support for workers’ right to unionize at the Alabama site and elsewhere, warning employers against anti-union efforts in a phrase that many saw as aimed at Amazon. “There should be no intimidation,” Biden says in the video, “no coercion, no threats, no anti-union propaganda.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJpPmA"&gt;The fight over the Bessemer union drive is due to come before Congress as soon as next week. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ryanobles/status/1370358825535074306?s=20"&gt;invited to testify&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday before the Senate Budget Committee next week, on the same day a worker from the Bessemer plant is scheduled to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LIHAi"&gt;The committee is chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT), one of the earliest Congressional supporters of the Bessemer organizing campaign. “It cannot be overstated how powerful it will be if Amazon workers in Alabama vote to form a union,” Sanders &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1358861752579014657"&gt;said in February&lt;/a&gt;. “If they win, it will not only improve wages and working conditions in Bessemer, but it will also send a shockwave around the country.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>When games are hard on their hands, some players turn their voices into controllers  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration showing a person speaking and a door opening before them." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a7HPRPeitD2FcU1HQQnd6kWh2fQ=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68954801/VRG_ILLO_4423_DIY_VoiceGaming.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Laurent Hrybrk&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Voice control provides unique opportunities for accessibility — and some complicated setup&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Zzd014"&gt;As both a software engineer and an avid player of strategy games, chaosparrot struggled to reckon with the damage his work and hobbies had done to his hands. By 2017, the consistent pain of his repetitive stress injuries was bad enough that he could no longer type comfortably or enjoy the games he loved to play. While searching for solutions, he came across a video of someone using speech recognition software to code. He decided to try using the same tech — not for coding, but for playing games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEUO47"&gt;“I started the process of trying to play the old games that I couldn’t play anymore with sounds instead,” chaosparrot says. The project started in Python, which he used to create a full voice control program that enables him to play games hands-free. And it worked: he was able to reach just one tier below the rank in &lt;em&gt;Starcraft&lt;/em&gt; he had attained before his injuries, and he also beat &lt;em&gt;Hollow Knight&lt;/em&gt;, a twitchy game that’s likely to frustrate players even with a traditional controller, using just his voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q9Kv0t"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HwN5ttEm7nc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zOu3iX"&gt;Games have slowly gotten more accessible over time, but when features are missing or controls don’t work, the onus falls on disabled players to find their own ways to play. Many disabled players use a combination of adaptive hardware — such as mouth-operated controllers and specially designed joysticks — and various apps to enable features like eye tracking, screen resizing, or voice control. Chaosparrot’s use of voice is just one of the many customizable, bespoke solutions players have turned to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1XIFI0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have to make it ourselves”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RvnJLg"&gt;“That’s like life when you have a disability. Anything that I kind of want, or need, and it’s not available, we have to make it ourselves,” says Kyle Abbate, who runs &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZVtZMQ7UB4EgSi862BYBug"&gt;onehandmostly&lt;/a&gt;, a YouTube channel focused on accessibility in games. That might be a cup holder for his wheelchair, attachments for his keyboard and mouse, or the software setups he uses to play games. “A lot of stuff for disabled people is trial by error, and making your own accessible tech, and whatever works for you, and experimenting and trying to find what’s best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaalB3"&gt;Chaosparrot’s program, Parrot.Py, was inspired by &lt;a href="https://talonvoice.com/"&gt;Talon Voice&lt;/a&gt;, a freely available voice recognition software for writing, coding, and theoretically any other computing task. By teaching Parrot.Py specific clicks, hisses, and clucks and associating them with button inputs in a game, chaosparrot is able to vocalize commands — selecting units in &lt;em&gt;Starcraft&lt;/em&gt; or attacking and dashing in &lt;em&gt;Hollow Knight &lt;/em&gt;— in addition to using eye tracking for movement. He hopes to get it working in a variety of game genres, and has even tested it while playing &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, though that involved explaining to friends why he was hissing into his mic on the way to electric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NFYo3h"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CkF6nlC86so?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=4567&amp;amp;start=4567" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OQJdBg"&gt;There are other players who use older, preexisting voice control programs like &lt;a href="https://voiceattack.com/"&gt;VoiceAttack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://baykovr.github.io/gavpi.html#"&gt;GAVPI&lt;/a&gt; as viable alternatives to typical controllers. But regardless of the program, there are still hurdles that come with voice as a control method. Voice controls create a time delay between giving a command and the move being executed in the game, which makes for a more difficult gameplay experience, especially in games that call for fast reaction times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecRQ74"&gt;There’s also more mental labor involved in setting up voice commands before diving into a game. Both VoiceAttack and GAVPI require more tech literacy than just running a game by itself, and Parrot.Py requires at least a basic familiarity with coding. Using any of these programs involves extra steps on top of the existing barriers that come with playing as a disabled person. “It’s gonna be hard to bridge that gap,” says chaosparrot. Like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAaJMHQah0E&amp;amp;t=158s"&gt;Abbate has done for VoiceAttack&lt;/a&gt;, he plans to make videos explaining how to use his program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPiJFz"&gt;Beyond the quirks of setting up voice controls, some games are just more difficult to play than others. A game like &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt;, which requires fast decision-making and movement, presents a challenge, but is more playable &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/43kadm/celeste-assist-mode-change-and-accessibility"&gt;thanks to a built-in assist mode&lt;/a&gt; that allows for adjustments in speed, stamina, and invincibility. For games without an assist mode, adjusting elements like health or attack damage with a program like &lt;a href="https://www.cheatengine.org/index.php"&gt;Cheat Engine&lt;/a&gt; can make the game adapt to the player, meeting them in the middle between what they’re capable of and what the game requires. “I think if you look at the future of accessibility, I think [an assist mode] is a great thing to add, at least to single-player games,” says chaosparrot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nouw2u"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qxc2xOJF6r0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rrZ0ed"&gt;Inclusive design requires time, careful consideration, and a willingness to solicit feedback from people with a variety of disabilities. Developers don’t always have adaptive play styles in mind, and don’t necessarily have the best track record for considering how disabled people might interact with their games, from button-mashing triggering chronic pain flare-ups to flashing lights &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163783/cyberpunk-2077-epileptic-seizure-warning-permanent-fix-cd-projekt-red"&gt;potentially causing seizures&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYwSyT"&gt;Improvements in gaming accessibility have often been the result of disabled people advocating for themselves. Microsoft’s&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/17/17363528/xbox-adaptive-controller-disability-accessible"&gt; Xbox Adaptive Controller&lt;/a&gt; was developed with guidance from advocacy groups like &lt;a href="https://ablegamers.org/"&gt;AbleGamers&lt;/a&gt; to better address the needs of disabled players. A letter from a disabled player is what pushed Naughty Dog’s team to consider accessibility in their games. They &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21274923/the-last-of-us-part-2-accessibility-features-naughty-dog-interview-ps4"&gt;prioritized accessibility in &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as a result, and the game was praised for its wide range of customizable options like remappable controls and audio cues for players with low vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5OfDq7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The disabled community on social media has been growing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vlREc6"&gt;Those pushes for more accessible features are also found on social media platforms, where disabled people band together to bring awareness to what’s missing in games and what fixes have been made. “The disabled community on social media has been growing and becoming more and more vocal,” says Courtney Craven, founder of &lt;a href="https://caniplaythat.com/"&gt;Can I Play That&lt;/a&gt;, an accessible game review site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPvyPj"&gt;Players continue to advocate for accessibility in games by reaching out to developers and showcasing and sharing the kinds of solutions they use. Chaosparrot’s Parrot.Py is designed to address his needs, but he and other players know that accessibility will never be one-size-fits-all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="UHu5Qd"&gt;“I encourage devs to take a look at their game and their mechanics, and then think about ‘how do we make these accessible,’’’ says Abbate. “And then when you’re making your next game, ‘how can we iterate again, and make those changes, make it even better.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPtJ4t"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hP9BMF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s Moon program survived a transfer of power, so what’s next?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Holds Virtual Call&amp;amp;nbsp;To NASA JPL Perseverance Team" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7rs35AsirwKOnuJVOOlkaJKyrJw=/0x0:8192x5461/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68954731/1231520649.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;President Biden has been silent on his plans for NASA but excited about the agency’s recent successes — here, he virtually congratulates the team that landed NASA’s Perseverance rover on Mars last month.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3uRe0n"&gt;The Trump administration’s Moon-to-Mars program has already dodged the fate of many past presidential space programs: cancellation under new leadership. Last month, White House press secretary Jen Psaki announced the Biden administration’s support for Artemis, NASA’s flagship lunar agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R06M3H"&gt;It was a rare passing of the baton between two administrations at odds with one another in virtually every other area. And it quelled some industry fears that Biden would shelve the moonshot plan entirely. While still in its infancy, the Artemis program unleashed a wave of industry momentum, partially thanks to an energizing, yet wildly unrealistic target date of 2024 for planting boots on the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ne2EFI"&gt;To get a sense of what’s next for Artemis and NASA&lt;em&gt;, The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Bhavya Lal, NASA’s acting chief of staff and currently the agency’s most senior Biden appointee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UZD7rY"&gt;Artemis survived the transfer of power — what now? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P7N9Hx"&gt;The program is getting a thorough review. The group of eight scientists and space policy experts tasked with reviewing NASA for Biden’s transition team lifted the hood on Trump’s speedy moonshot plan, announced by then-Vice President Mike Pence in early 2019. The experts came up with a list of things within Artemis that should stay &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;and things that should stay &lt;em&gt;out &lt;/em&gt;to inform the NASA team’s review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LxvvtO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We weren’t going to just throw away everything that had happened in the last many years and start over.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lf57br"&gt;“One thing that was absolutely in was continuity of purpose,” says Lal, who has advised past administrations on space policy and was the Biden team’s top space expert during the transition. “We weren’t going to just throw away everything that had happened in the last many years and start over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVa489"&gt;Lal joined NASA in February and is now helping lead the ongoing Artemis review inside the agency, carrying out the guidance she helped draft during the transition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0AFyb"&gt;That review covers every pillar of Artemis, including the agency’s long-delayed and staggeringly over-budget Space Launch System (SLS), the behemoth rocket that will launch the first astronaut crews to the Moon in the Orion capsule. It also includes reviewing the program’s timeline, international partnerships, and coming up with a budget that Congress will like. The review will also refine planned activities on the Moon and identify spots where more commercial activities can get involved, Lal says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVH1EI"&gt;Nothing is set in stone yet. The review is ongoing, and Biden, almost two months into his presidency, has yet to pick his NASA administrator. That’s no surprise — it took Trump nearly eight months to nominate his administrator, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240908/jim-bridenstine-nasa-chief-transition-artemis"&gt;Jim Bridenstine&lt;/a&gt;, and almost another eight months to win Senate confirmation. It was four months before Barack Obama named Charles Bolden, and about ten months before George Bush tapped Sean O’Keefe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="M0kGwn"&gt;Getting to the Moon — just not by 2024&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="elexfg"&gt;NASA aims to continue its investment in SLS and Orion while keeping an eye on private sector rockets for help if needed. “SLS and Orion will be providing initial transportation to and from lunar orbit beyond Artemis, and any proven commercial transportation can make up gaps if there are any,” Lal says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2itjO3"&gt;By the time the Boeing-built SLS flies for the first time (likely sometime next year, almost three years later than planned), the agency will have spent nearly $20 billion on the program, NASA’s inspector general reported last year, with each launch thereafter coming out to about $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUOJBa"&gt;Cheaper commercial rockets built by firms like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and the United Launch Alliance exist but currently are only poised to launch uncrewed pieces of the Artemis program to space. SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket will launch the first two elements of NASA’s Lunar Gateway, a planned space station orbiting the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4TMi2"&gt;Where possible, NASA needs to “maintain multiple providers of launch vehicles, landers, spacecraft, across the enterprise so the US isn’t overly reliant on one system or provider,” Lal says. That’s the spirit set out in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258815/nasa-moon-lander-awards-biden-spacex-blue-origin-moonshot"&gt;NASA’s human lunar landing system&lt;/a&gt; program, the centerpiece of Artemis that aims to pick two different landers capable of ferrying astronauts to the lunar surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v1bX2d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With short funding from Congress, “2024 wasn’t realistic.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zlGYJt"&gt;But Congress, though roundly supportive of the Artemis program, balked at the Trump administration’s request for $3.3 billion to fund speedy development of those landers. Instead, it gave NASA $850 million for lander development, pounding the last nail in the coffin for Trump’s 2024 goal, which many in the space industry viewed as unachievable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0RofGi"&gt;Biden’s NASA will set a more manageable timetable, Lal says. “One of the transition team findings was that 2024, given the appropriations from Congress at least in the last two years, 2024 wasn’t realistic.” Setting a new date is tied to coming up with a palatable budget for Congress, “which is a question mark” at this point, Lal says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fdZWri"&gt;International partnerships, with Artemis and beyond&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GmXFV7"&gt;“Honoring commitments made to international partners” was a key principle of the transition team’s findings, says Lal, whether on the International Space Station or in the Artemis Accords, a set of multilateral agreements with US allies that aims to set legal standards of behavior in space. Those partners include Russia, a US adversary but a longtime NASA partner on the ISS, where the shared goal of keeping an orbital laboratory healthy supersedes the messy tensions back on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2dhobS"&gt;But the NASA-Russia relationship is changing. Roscosmos, Russia’s space agency, has been reluctant to extend its alliance with NASA to the Moon, and last year the US sought to exclude Russia from early talks on the Artemis Accords. This week, Russia made good on its claims to ditch Artemis by announcing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321114/lunar-moon-space-station-russia-china-agreement-nasa"&gt;new agreement with China&lt;/a&gt; to build a rival Moon base and space station in lunar orbit, cementing a new front in an increasingly polarized race into deep space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETc8lS"&gt;NASA is courting its own allies for Artemis, but it’s barred from collaborating with China, thanks to a 2011 law called the Wolf Amendment, named after the now-retired Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA). But as Beijing ups its game on the Moon, some of Biden’s space advisors have argued against the Chinese exclusion policy. “Trying to exclude them I think is a failing strategy,” former astronaut Pam Melroy &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/20/biden-china-space-448529"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; last year, before joining Biden’s NASA transition team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CszFKq"&gt;Lal tamps down prospects of NASA-China cooperation under Biden’s NASA: “I don’t expect China collaborations, at least on the Artemis program, in any way shape or form.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsERgx"&gt;She says the NASA-Russia relationship, on the other hand, should continue for the foreseeable future. “There’s no reason we shouldn’t be collaborating with them in deep space activities.” Despite Russia bowing out of NASA’s Lunar Gateway program, NASA said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Wednesday that “they did offer to continue exploring interoperability and we welcome such a discussion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sudb0x"&gt;International relations could extend to NASA’s climate science operations, a quieter side of the space agency that is expected to grow under Biden. Last month, NASA’s Acting Administrator Steve Jurczyk had a phone call with Russia’s space chief Dmitry Rogozin, where Jurczyk discussed NASA’s “focus on climate change studies with the help of space technology,” according to a Roscosmos statement. Rogozin “supported the idea of cooperating in this field,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZQLRN"&gt;Lal says it is too early to discuss what specific plans are in the works for boosting NASA’s role in Biden’s sweeping climate agenda. But she says it’s not just about expanding current programs or upping the workload for NASA’s existing fleet of weather satellites — it’s also about starting new programs on both domestic and international fronts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyvQ2w"&gt;“Climate is an area where we’re joined at the hip,” she says. Like the space station, where astronaut safety overrides geopolitics, “it may be necessary to even work with some of our adversaries” on an agreement for sharing crucial climate data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best wireless earbuds to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bYiolYMHc_o81A5Rh272VmcNUGo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67005648/budsguide.6.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Whether you’re looking for an everyday pair or something for fitness, these are the best picks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="96Mp4M"&gt;The true wireless earbuds market has never been more crowded than it is in 2021. With so many to choose from, finding the best earbuds can seem daunting. But the vast selection is actually a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing: not only are there excellent picks for everyday buds to carry in your pocket, but you’ve also got a slew of options that prioritize things like noise cancellation, fitness, lengthy battery life, and comfort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktn8kt"&gt;Even if you don’t consider yourself any kind of audiophile, it’s important to find a set of earbuds that sound good to you. This means different things depending on the person: do you want head-rattling bass or something more balanced with an immersive soundstage? You’ll want to find a pair with a good, reliable Bluetooth connection — all of the below picks check off that box — and enough battery life to last you through a normal day of intermittent listening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZpkO2"&gt;Remember that getting the most out of earbuds requires a good seal in your ear. Always try the various ear tip sizes that come with whichever buds you purchase — and don’t be afraid to experiment with different sizes in each ear. Ears are funny like that. Many of these earbuds have apps you can install on your phone to further personalize their sound and controls the way you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c35LSu"&gt;If you’re looking for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds, you’ll be very happy with Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds. They have best-in-class noise cancellation and sound great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PcI69T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386455"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tVD5bj"&gt;But if you’ve got other priorities, there is a range of great options from Apple, Beats, Jabra, Sennheiser, and Ultimate Ears that won’t disappoint. This guide covers higher-end wireless earbuds. If you’re on the hunt for more affordable options, check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"&gt;the best cheap wireless earbuds to buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="pNy3BT"&gt;The best wireless earbuds in 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="4hCfqL"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ds_HnWvvgrCsv6J7sKcYODjSnto=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21946559/IMG_0720-1.0.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds are the best noise-canceling wireless earbuds you can get.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cp52EH"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation"&gt;Bose QuietComfort Earbuds&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="f3y5ZM"&gt;Best noise-canceling earbuds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JzPVlZ"&gt;The QuietComfort Earbuds offer very powerful active noise cancellation, but what’s equally nice about them is how customizable the ANC is. You can choose between 11 different levels of noise cancellation (based on how much of the outside world you want mixed in) and set three favorites to cycle between when you double-tap the left earbud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6H0xo"&gt;Bose’s premium earbuds put out fantastic audio with punchy bass. Their transparency / ambient mode is second only to Apple in how natural it sounds. And even the voice mics work well, so you really get the whole package — as you should for this kind of money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mJvWk3"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Pro remain the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners because some of their best features only work with other Apple products.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ht0eFb"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;Apple AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QpmRPm"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for the iPhone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lNbhRr"&gt;There’s no beating the interplay between AirPods and Apple’s other devices like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The AirPods Pro don’t offer the best sound quality of our top picks, but it’s perfectly satisfactory to many people. And the active noise cancellation is right up there with Bose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMXRmM"&gt;But it really all comes together if you’re in Apple’s ecosystem and also own a Mac or iPad. The AirPods Pro can automatically hop between devices based on which one you’re using, and on iPhone or iPad, spatial audio delivers immersive surround sound when watching streaming video apps. They’re fantastic for making calls with, and Apple continues to pull ahead of competitors when it comes to ease of use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3Tv5p"&gt;Here’s a tip: if none of the included ear tips get you a perfect seal, I recommend a set of memory foam tips like those from &lt;a href="https://www.complyfoam.com/products/app-comply-foam-tips-compatible-with-airpods-pro/"&gt;Comply&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1565954-REG%2Fdekoni_audio_etz_app_md3_airpods_pro_tips.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21309820%2Fbest-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dekoni&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jabra Elite 75t are the best wireless earbuds if you want to pair with two devices simultaneously.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W40xtb"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative"&gt;Jabra Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="uDVgDy"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for multitasking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6ukiqM"&gt;Jabra is pretty much the only company making true wireless earbuds that support “multipoint” for two simultaneous Bluetooth connections. So you can pair them up with a phone and your laptop or tablet at the same time. Jabra’s mobile app offers a ton of customization over the controls, EQ, and even includes bonuses like white noise or nature sounds if you’ve got situations where they’d be handy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h8gk6p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWBz4q"&gt;The newer Elite 85t earbuds add more effective noise cancellation to the mix, but the 75ts are on sale so frequently that they’re still the go-to pick if multitasking is important to you. They pack a wallop when it comes to bass — but not to the point where it overwhelms the rest of the mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2B4Zz0"&gt;Jabra backs them with a two-year warranty in the event you experience any hardware issues. (I’ve had a 75t bud stop taking a charge out of nowhere, so it can happen.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="K2kK8C"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Powerbeats Pro have been around for some time now, but they still rank as the best wireless earbuds for fitness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MMAYVS"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8xKAQg"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for fitness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="H4ocO9"&gt;Nothing has managed to unseat the Powerbeats Pro as the best fitness earbuds since their release in 2019. Their ear hook design keeps them planted on your ears during intense exercise, they can endure your sweatiest workouts, and the nine hours of continuous battery life should get you through just about any marathon. And the sound quality is killer, with plenty of bass to keep you motivated and moving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QnM1Ez"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386623"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QtSWeK"&gt;And since Beats is owned by Apple, the Powerbeats Pro can also take advantage of features like audio sharing, auto device switching (like the AirPods Pro), and a dead-simple pairing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kRmMjq"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus can last for up to 11 hours on a single charge, which blows away many competitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="D3Jb3n"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mRgq3W"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KxKFD0"&gt;They can last 11 hours on a single charge. That’s what I consider marathon battery life for true wireless earbuds, and few other companies have managed to keep up with the longevity of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus. They lack active noise cancellation, so that helps them keep playing for longer, but even then, 11 hours is quite a feat. Like the Jabras, these are often on sale and easy to grab at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N4SqQ0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386734"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2 are the best wireless earbuds in terms of sound quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Imv4sR"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230931/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review-earbuds-headphones-sound-specs-battery-life-price"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Oe6jW4"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for sound quality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VBO6Vu"&gt;Sennheiser’s second swing at true wireless earbuds improve on the original Momentums with a more comfortable fit and the addition of active noise cancellation. But everything about these earbuds is second fiddle to their sound quality: the Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds put out dynamic, expressive, and wonderfully detailed audio. They’re the sort of buds that will bring out things in your favorite music you haven’t noticed before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdAurp"&gt;But that upgraded sound quality comes for a hefty $300 price. If you want arguably the best sound that true wireless earbuds can deliver, these are it. But all of these other picks sound plenty good in their own right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Bd9TxW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386636"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’re not going to find any silicone ear tips that can match the UE Fits and their custom tips, which mold to match your ear shape in seconds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ldQHSa"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537150/ue-fits-review-wireless-earbuds-review-custom-fit-ear-tips"&gt;UE Fits&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4qWQZj"&gt;Best wireless earbuds if comfort is everything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Wq4SD9"&gt;If you often have difficulty finding ear tips that fit your ears comfortably, it doesn’t really get better than the UE Fits. These earbuds include special tips that mold to the shape of your ear during a 60-second fitting process that you activate with UE’s app. They get warm during molding (but not uncomfortably so) and you can feel them adapting to the contours of your ear canal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZxyrc"&gt;Once the process is done, you’re left with custom earbuds with a fit that’s as close to perfect as you’ll ever find — unless you visit your local audiologist for a professional mold, and that gets expensive fast. Ultimate Ears has a fit “guarantee” and will send you a second set of tips should your first molding attempt go awry. The UE Fits are quite good, last for up to eight hours of continuous playback, and they’re rated IPX4 for water resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These LED dice could electrify your next DnD campaign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lCPNP7fXvDSm6mD5YVeP-olD1_4=/0x0:575x383/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68954375/4bd809d32eab0a5b57fb7a635770f0b5_original.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dice are equipped with RGB lights and can communicate via Bluetooth.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Systemic Games / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixels-dice/pixels-the-electronic-dice/" target="_blank"&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="esToTz"&gt;Sometimes it’s nice to get away from technology for a bit, settle down with some friends, and play an entire role-playing game using just pen, paper, and lots of dice. But if that’s a little low-fi for you, then there’s always &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixels-dice/pixels-the-electronic-dice/"&gt;Pixels&lt;/a&gt;, a new set of electronic dice with built in Bluetooth and RGB LED lighting. The dice have launched on Kickstarter, with prices starting at $39. As of this writing, over 14,000 people have already backed the project for a total of over $2 million pledged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NmClN"&gt;The main attraction here is obviously the colorful RGB lighting, which creator Systemic Games promises will be customizable and programmable via a companion app. The Pixels are also waterproof, charge wirelessly via companion charging cases, and can go for around five hours on a charge, or more if you’re willing to live without the lighting. A range of die styles are available, including D20, D12, D10, D8, D6, and D4.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5V5XEXRz5a8Ho0amjh3ZZoDHePI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22365024/2tKpnK0BehxWS_wI2JARGQp0rY_D5oAmdLvANrmVhl4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Systemic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;RGB lighting illuminates the dice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UALxwR"&gt;But for me, the most interesting thing about the dice is how they’ll apparently be able to communicate with Roll20, Foundry, and other online platforms that let you play tabletop games over the internet. At the moment a service like Roll20 relies on either virtual dice rolls, or rolling a traditional dice and then reporting back to your games master. In contrast, the Pixels could offer the best of both worlds, by letting you roll a physical die and automatically reporting the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgyML8"&gt;Yes, there are a lot of obvious jokes to be made about not being able to play a pen-and-paper RPG because your dice aren’t charged. But if you like the thought of having Bluetooth-enabled dice that light up like Christmas trees, then the Pixels are available to back on Kickstarter until April 8th. One die (including charger) starts at $39, or you can get a set of seven dice and a charging case for $199. All of the usual warnings about backing Kickstarters apply, but if all goes to plan the Pixels &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;ship in around 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
