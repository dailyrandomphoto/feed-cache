    <title>You can now save $20-$36 a year on YouTube Premium and Music Premium with new annual plans</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K8BTJH"&gt;If you’re a new or existing user of YouTube Premium and Music Premium, which let you watch and listen ad-free, you might be able to save up to $36 a year with &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/11417260?hl=en&amp;amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;amp;oco=0"&gt;Google’s new annual plans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/18/youtube-premium-music-annual/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. From now until Sunday, January 23rd, users can receive an extra discount with the promo rate, but the new annual plans cost less than the current monthly rate either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlEdJC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium/annual"&gt;YouTube Premium’s new annual plan&lt;/a&gt; is currently selling for $107.99, roughly $36 less than you’d pay for a year at its current monthly price of $143.88.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lf2PuU"&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/musicpremium/annual"&gt;YouTube Premium Music&lt;/a&gt; subscribers, the annual rate is currently $89.99, but will be priced at $119.88 after Sunday — still nearly a $30 savings over paying monthly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UrrVNQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"After years of false starts, YouTube is now serious about music streaming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/25/17391686/youtube-music-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JVhxao"&gt;Users are still able to sign-up for a month-to-month subscription, too — $11.99 for YouTube Premium and $9.99 for YouTube Music Premium, the same price as they were before. Both services offer a 7-day free trial period for new users before the user is charged for the full month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzCaAR"&gt;Though the annual subscription offers a one and done option for YouTube Music Premium users, it might not make sense if you’re grandfathered into an earlier, cheaper plan. You’d be paying 11 cents more for an annual plan if you’re currently paying $9.99 a month for YouTube Music, and it’s an even worse deal if you still have the old $7.99 plan, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdO524"&gt;With an annual plan, you have to pay for either service upfront, and YouTube says it won’t automatically renew at the end of one year. For existing subscribers, you may need to change your plan to qualify: It’s not available for those on family and student plans, and existing individual users on monthly subscriptions have to cancel their current plan before they can purchase the annual service. The plans are also only available in the US, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Turkey, Germany, Thailand, India and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyGfbb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT meta-review: even desperate gamers should think twice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S8o9vWSs3oHgObLq32plMh6u-Fg=/0x0:1446x964/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410587/rx_6500_xt.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nPHaQF"&gt;You’ve heard that PC graphics cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22698588/falcodrin-gpu-hunters-nvidia-amd-graphics-card-tricks-bots-scalpers-miners-gamers"&gt;are nearly impossible to find&lt;/a&gt;, or that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22797788/price-ps5-xbox-nvidia-amd-rtx-gpu-scalpers-ebay-update"&gt;you’ll have to pay exorbitant sums&lt;/a&gt;. But if you were hoping the $200 budget AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT was about to change that, we have some very bad news. Reviewers are &lt;em&gt;positively ripping it a new one&lt;/em&gt;, and not just because of its cost, or the fact &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891092/amd-4g-vram-claim-gpu-launch-rx-6500-xt"&gt;it only has 4GB of VRAM&lt;/a&gt; — but apparently because this brand-new GPU is laughably bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEyanU"&gt;“[T]his is the worst GPU release since I can remember, and I’ve been doing this job for over two decades,” &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/2398-amd-radeon-6500-xt/"&gt;writes &lt;em&gt;TechSpot’s&lt;/em&gt; Steven Walton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzKJD8"&gt;“AMD RX 6500 XT is worse than 2016’s GPUs,” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFpuJqx9Qmw&amp;amp;t=2s"&gt;declares &lt;em&gt;Gamers Nexus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jLfKH"&gt;“WTF AMD!?” and “WTF is AMD thinking?,” ask &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArW4-mkGHSw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hardware Canucks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmE8iZWaLWE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KitGuruTech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; respectively. “A GPU you might be able to buy... but shouldn’t,” writes &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYp6pEDm4E8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linus Tech Tips&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Worst GPU,” declares &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5_oM3Ow_CI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hardware Unboxed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DJ21h"&gt;“Gigabyte’s RX 6500 XT Gaming OC card gives us our first bitter taste of what a ‘budget’ GPU means in 2022,” writes &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review-benchmarks/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, adding “as a modern graphics card it looks like pretty weak sauce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fD05Sv"&gt;“The year 2022 just started, and this potentially looks to be the most insufficient graphics card series of the year,” concludes &lt;a href="https://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/radeon_rx_6500_xt_review,28.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guru3D&lt;/em&gt;’s Hilbert Hagedoorn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZihzB"&gt;I don’t think I’ve ever seen a graphics card dragged this hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PI0PZI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Radeon RX 6500 XT really shows the world everything that’s wrong with the current state of the GPU market” — Tom’s Hardware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ehccNL"&gt;Even relatively respectful outlets offer few compliments, with &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/605952/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review-affordable-graphics-cards-are-back.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCWorld&lt;/em&gt;’s Brad Chacos suggesting&lt;/a&gt; that AMD may be able to tap “an unserved market” if it can actually hit $199 and calling it “a capable budget option” for medium to high settings at 1080p. &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review-xfx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; thinks&lt;/a&gt; $199 is optimistic, though. “At least buying an RX 6500 XT guarantees you’re getting a brand-new card, which can’t be said for the various used GPUs being sold on eBay and other second-hand markets,” writes Jarred Walton, damning with faint praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMexno"&gt;According to reviewers, the problem is multifaceted but fairly simple to sum up: AMD cut serious corners on a GPU while also failing to improve performance. They point out that performance is roughly equivalent to the card’s direct predecessor, the RX 5500 XT — a card that came out two years ago, &lt;em&gt;for less money, &lt;/em&gt;with more video outputs. (Here, you only only get one HDMI and one DisplayPort.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKdg4I"&gt;And if you look further back, like &lt;em&gt;Gamers Nexus&lt;/em&gt; and others did, you might notice performance hasn’t meaningfully improved over AMD’s RX 580 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060 — mid-range cards from 2017 and 2016 respectively. (The RX 580 seems to beat it in some of the benchmarks I’m seeing — if AMD sometimes loses to a five-year-old card that originally retailed for $229, that seems bad, no?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y77WxI"&gt;But it gets even worse if you’ve got an older PCIe 3.0 motherboard, some point out, because AMD reportedly decided to limit the card’s bandwidth to 4x, instead of the full 16 lanes of bandwidth, when it’s plugged into a PCIe 3.0 slot. &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/2398-amd-radeon-6500-xt/"&gt;Here’s TechSpot again&lt;/a&gt;, talking about testing &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; using one of those older boards: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mQkgAC"&gt;The average frame rate also fell by 28% and this saw the 6500 XT go from 65 fps to just 47 fps. It also meant although it was able to match the &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/1961-radeon-rx-5500-4gb-vs-8gb/"&gt;5500 XT&lt;/a&gt; when using PCIe 4.0, when installed in a PCIe 3.0 system you’re looking more at base GTX 1650 performance, which is worse than the &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/1411-radeon-rx-570-vs-geforce-gtx-1060-3gb/"&gt;RX 570&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="N7kGgn"&gt;Here are some other choice quotes from reviewers attempting to find a silver lining in the RX 6500 XT (power consumption seems to be a bright spot):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m32jHD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review-xfx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="tSEIwR"&gt;Of the six games with ray tracing that we tested — and admittedly, we used more demanding RT games, as otherwise the effects are largely wasted — only one qualified as even remotely playable: &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. And even it wasn’t without trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OZQtF4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/605952/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review-affordable-graphics-cards-are-back.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PCWorld&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AUJnro"&gt;But the modest GPU and bizarre memory configuration mean you’ll need to be careful about the settings you use. If you crank visuals up to ultra or run into a game with especially high memory demands, the limited memory capacity and bus width could result in jarring frame-time spikes when your PC exceeds the 4GB barrier and needs to tap into your system’s general RAM pool for help. Don’t push this GPU harder than it’s intended for and you should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6RyCSK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review?page=4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HotHardware:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yCCv3v"&gt;The new Radeon RX 6500 XT is one of the more power-friendly GPUs of the bunch. Despite offering much better performance (more often than not) then the GeForce GTX 1650, the 6500 XT consumes only slightly more power. In comparison to the Radeon RX 5500 XT and Radeon RX 570, however, the new 6500 XT uses significantly less power when under load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="e1ltnQ"&gt;Maybe sit out this one. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how to clean your $19 Apple cleaning cloth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OUWNdpAMJQaWMPg0BN1He4njZkE=/143x0:1859x1144/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410545/MM6F3_AV2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can’t just throw it in the wash.&lt;/em&gt; | Image of cloth: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fkw4NC"&gt;Here’s the scenario: you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878673/apple-polishing-cloth-in-stock-online"&gt;managed to get your hands on&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s hottest product, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733198/apple-polishing-cloth-clean-devices"&gt;$19 polishing cloth&lt;/a&gt; meant for cleaning nano-texture screens and other Apple devices. But oh no! Instead of hanging it up with the rest of your priceless artifacts, you accidentally used it to actually clean something, and now it’s &lt;em&gt;dirty&lt;/em&gt;. Thankfully, Apple has bestowed us with a guide on how to make our cloth good as new, and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/19/apple-explains-how-to-clean-its-polishing-cloth-without-buying-a-new-polishing-cloth/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; has brought those instructions to our attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="howto-title"&gt;Are you ready? Here’s how Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210229"&gt;“How to clean the nano-texture glass on your Apple display” support article&lt;/a&gt; describes the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="p6tXWq"&gt;1. Hand wash the polishing cloth with dish soap and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxbtus"&gt;2. Rinse thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJZx08"&gt;3. Allow the polishing cloth to air dry for at least 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vuuGd8"&gt;The instructions have been on Apple’s website for at least a few months, according to the WayBack Machine, but despite a handful of &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-polishing-cloth"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/26/apples-cleaning-cloth-is-sold-out-through-january----get-this-instead"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; mentioning them, I hadn’t come across them. That’s really a shame — other people who also hadn’t known about the instructions might’ve been throwing away their priceless polishers all because of a little grime, wasting $20 simply because the cleaning instructions are buried on a support page instead of being included on a tag, or embossed on the cloth itself. (I would also settle for prime placement on the Apple home page, where all people of the cloth spend their day.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Of0Mv0"&gt;The instructions themselves are also a little disappointing — ultimately, Apple is telling us to wash the cloth like we would any other delicate fabric. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878673/apple-polishing-cloth-in-stock-online"&gt;At least it’s back in stock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Bowl 2022 won’t stream in 4K on NBC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hollywood Exteriors And Landmarks - 2022" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axVrAuCls7r8ogh3DIuWRNr4cxA=/0x74:3100x2141/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410509/1237814418.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YXemvT"&gt;The 2022 Super Bowl won’t be broadcast or streamed in 4K again this year when the game takes place on February 13th, NBC Sports has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The lack of a 4K stream marks the second year in a row that the big game won’t be available with the higher level of picture quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcHBIK"&gt;“The game will not be in 4K,” Dan Masonson, a spokesperson for NBC Sports, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erBWxf"&gt;NBC, which is hosting the big game this year, has never actually aired an NFL game in 4K or HDR before, despite hosting the nationally televised Sunday Night Football game every week during the regular NFL season. NBC, for what it's worth, isn’t the only network: CBS doesn’t produce any of its games in 4K (the network cited COVID-19 issues for the lack of a 4K Super Bowl in 2021), nor does ESPN with Monday Night Football. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZ5zep"&gt;Fox Sports started broadcasting some of its Thursday Night Football games in 4K in 2019, and three seasons later is still the only broadcaster to offer NFL games 4K/HDR quality. And even that has limitations: Fox only does it for select Thursday night games — and Super Bowl 2020, the only Super Bowl to date that has been broadcast in 4K — and its footage is actually shot in 1080p and HDR, then upscaled to 4K for broadcast, rather than true, native 4K video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOvnAG"&gt;Still, there was some hope that NBC would manage to pull off Super Bowl LVI in 4K, given that the network has started to slowly expand its 4K sport offers. Last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.nbcolympics.com/4k"&gt;Tokyo Olympics&lt;/a&gt; had an (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22589928/peacock-2020-olympics-streaming"&gt;extremely messy&lt;/a&gt;) slate of 4K programming, and the network has already announced plans to air large portions of the upcoming Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics in 4K, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSKi0v"&gt;Part of the problem is that NBC still doesn’t have a 4K distribution method for the vast majority of fans; last year’s Olympic broadcasts &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; in 4K and HDR (some events event had Dolby Atmos), but the 4K programming wasn’t actually available in any of NBC’s apps (including the regular NBC app, the NBC Sports app, and &lt;a href="https://imp.i305175.net/c/482924/828265/11640?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacocktv.com%2Fhelp%2Farticle%2Fcan-i-watch-content-in-4k-on-peacock&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt;). Rather, the 4K broadcasts were limited to partners like Altice, Xfinity, Fubo TV, YouTube TV, DIRECTV, Dish, and other cable and over-the-top service with 4K support. And even then, coverage was limited to specific events at specific times in specific TV markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNOUop"&gt;Plus, as the lone 4K Super Bowl in 2020 showed, actually airing one of the biggest sports games of the year to the millions of fans who tune in is a huge undertaking: there’s the dozens of cameras and slow-motion shots for instant replays, the graphics packages, and of course, the halftime show and the slew of commercials, all of which need to be turned into a cohesive, 4K and HDR package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKkf0k"&gt;There is some good news on the horizon for football fans, though: 2023’s Super Bowl LVII is set to be broadcast on Fox, which could potentially return us to a 4K game day — if we’re lucky!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="X0QXYO"&gt;Panic, the maker of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview"&gt;quirky Playdate handheld&lt;/a&gt;, has released a public beta of its &lt;a href="http://play.date/pulp"&gt;Playdate Pulp in-browser game builder&lt;/a&gt;. The company describes it as “a friendly tool for making tiny but visually and narratively rich games for Playdate,” &lt;a href="https://play.date/pulp/docs/"&gt;in its developer documentation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylH5GS"&gt;In the Pulp editor, you’ll be able to do things like make pixel graphics, build levels, write music, and even create custom fonts. As you’re working on your game, you can test it right in your browser, and when you’re ready, you can export your game as a .pdx file (a clever reference to Panic’s Portland roots) so you can load it onto a Playdate handheld. You don’t have to write any code to make a game in Pulp, but if you do want to try your hand at some coding, you can use the &lt;a href="https://play.date/pulp/docs/pulpscript/"&gt;PulpScript scripting language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8LKlYR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Playdate Pulp is now available in public beta!! Pulp is a super fun (and free!) game making tool for Playdate. With a few clicks, anyone can turn a game idea into Playdate reality. &lt;a href="https://t.co/cWPGcxFDhi"&gt;https://t.co/cWPGcxFDhi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/C1qtbJpgGd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/C1qtbJpgGd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Playdate (@playdate) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playdate/status/1483905526652026886?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 19, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgjIM1"&gt;I’m no game developer, but Pulp seems relatively easy to use in my few minutes of messing around with it. I already figured out how to turn the player sprite in the default game Pulp loads with into a big letter J, which of course will be totally necessary for my future masterpiece. I’m really looking forward to seeing what people cook up with the tool once they spend some time with it, and have my fingers crossed for some off-the-wall, &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;-style games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPQ33v"&gt;Releasing the public beta of Pulp now could also mean that the Playdate will have a bunch of fun games for people to try when the device comes out. Panic has so far only announced one curated season with 24 games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609923/playdate-handheld-crank-panic-game-season-one"&gt;and you’ll only get two new games per week&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to Pulp, though, you might have a lot of other games to choose from that you can side-load onto your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeGocZ"&gt;Panic says it expects to deliver its first shipments of the Playdate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776649/panic-playdate-delay-2022-handheld-battery-chip-shortage"&gt;in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. You can still pre-order the device, though Panic cautions on &lt;a href="https://shop.play.date/"&gt;its Playdate store page&lt;/a&gt; that pre-orders placed now won’t ship until late this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney is putting a Disney Plus exec in charge of Hulu </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney Plus ESPN Plus Hulu bundle" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OWj2KRl76cUpfmyhyd8hNxrkF2M=/0x55:1396x986/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410341/disney_plus.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gVfAKR"&gt;Disney has named Joe Earley, a former EVP of its tentpole streaming service Disney Plus, to the position of president of Hulu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7cVQ2"&gt;Earley previously served as EVP marketing and operations at Disney Plus and is headed to its sister service after joining the company in January of 2019. In the new role at Hulu, Earley will be tasked with building on the service’s brand and will liaise with its various content studios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZTmjK"&gt;The announcement comes as &lt;a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-creates-international-content-group-to-expand-pipeline-of-local-content-and-continue-to-grow-its-global-direct-to-consumer-business/"&gt;part of a reorganization&lt;/a&gt; as Disney continues to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514728/disney-streaming-reorganization-plus-espn-hulu-studios-movies-network-tv-shows-pandemic"&gt;rally resources&lt;/a&gt; around its streaming business. Earley will report to Michael Paull, who the company has appointed to the role of president of Disney’s overall streaming business. In this newly created position, Paull will oversee the company’s ESPN Plus, Hulu, Disney Plus, and Star Plus streaming services. Paull will report to Kareem Daniel, chairman of the Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kCH5S1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Disney is reshuffling the leadership for its streaming business.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ii8lFJ"&gt;In addition to Earley and Paull’s expanded roles, the company announced that Rebecca Campbell was named as chairman of its international content business, having previously served as chairman of international operations and direct-to-consumer. The new role reports directly to Disney boss Bob Chapek. Campbell has held various roles with the company for nearly 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffTLm3"&gt;As part of the executive shuffle, Disney will need to find a replacement to fill Paull’s old role leading Disney Plus. Having joined Disney through its acquisition of Bamtech Media, at which he was chief executive, Paull was integral to the growth of Disney’s streaming business. He formerly held an executive role with the Channels arm at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JntCby"&gt;“Michael Paull has deep experience in the world of streaming and is an accomplished leader with a passion for this business and a proven track record of building and expanding our streaming operations,” Daniel said in a statement. “Bringing Disney’s streaming platforms together under Michael’s expert leadership will allow us to create an even more compelling value proposition for consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google launches beta of Android games on Windows PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ALBSbxdQ_pJBjaKE0lONx1hpxuw=/162x0:1886x1149/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410225/googleplaygames.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iEZCX6"&gt;Google is launching a limited beta of its app to bring Android games to Windows PCs. Google Play Games will be available in beta in Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan today, allowing Windows PC owners to play popular Android games like &lt;em&gt;Mobile Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Summoners War&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;State of Survival&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Three Kingdoms Tactics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSwl7J"&gt;Players in Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan will be able to &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/googleplaygames?pcampaignid=PR-Global-oo-gpgbeta-DevBlog"&gt;sign up to access the beta&lt;/a&gt; and access Google’s standalone app on Windows PCs. Google is promising “seamless gameplay sessions between a phone, tablet, Chromebook, and Windows PC,” suggesting that you’ll be able to easily resume games between multiple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eh6Pub"&gt;“Players can easily browse, download, and play their favorite mobile games on their PCs while taking advantage of larger screens with mouse and keyboard inputs,” says Arjun Dayal, group product manager for Google Play Games. “No more losing your progress or achievements when switching between devices; it just works with your Google Play Games profile!”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W8y4M0bgsjP9LgOERaQy-PWUNdQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23178854/googleplaygames.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Play Games syncs gameplay sessions across multiple devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QMGKoo"&gt;Google Play Games will also include Play Points that can be earned while playing Android games on PCs. Google only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22827037/google-android-games-windows-pc-google-play-games"&gt;announced its plans to bring Android games to PCs&lt;/a&gt; a month ago, but it’s still not clear what technology the company is using to get Android games running on Windows PCs. The Google Play Games app will be a native Windows app that won’t involve game streaming, though, and Google is &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/games/playgames"&gt;opening up a developer site today&lt;/a&gt; that should start to provide more information for game developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uzth3r"&gt;Google’s announcement comes months after Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736528/microsoft-android-apps-windows-11-test"&gt;started testing Android apps on Windows 11 PCs&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft has built an underlying Windows Subsystem for Android, which is capable of running Android apps from a variety of sources. Microsoft uses it in partnership with Amazon to allow native installs of games and apps from the Amazon Appstore on Windows, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22748319/google-play-store-windows-11-android-apps-microsoft"&gt;despite workarounds&lt;/a&gt;, Google Play isn’t officially supported yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple TV Plus teases its WeWork series with Jared Leto</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qaqc5gTRluquHR5cZVdYm-1xw40=/0x0:4664x3109/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410005/Apple_TV_WeCrashed_key_art.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JTUWwi"&gt;A new trailer gives us a glimpse of Apple TV Plus’ &lt;em&gt;WeCrashed&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming miniseries about the real-life buildup and dramatic downfall of WeWork, the coworking space with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20806366/we-company-wework-ipo-adam-neumann"&gt;weirdly bombastic public filing&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975831/wework-layoffs-ipo-adam-neumann-softbank"&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt; thousands of employees while later giving its brash CEO a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20926583/wework-founder-adam-neumann-softbank-takeover-payout"&gt;huge golden parachute&lt;/a&gt;. The script practically writes itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urg8uV"&gt;Jared Leto stars as WeWork’s former eccentric CEO, Adam Neumann, while Anne Hathaway takes on the role of his wife, Rebekah Neumann, who served as the company’s chief brand and impact officer and was former CEO of WeGrow. The trailer opens with Leto reimagining a run-down building as a vibrant office space — and then making that vision a reality. Leto and Hathaway are then seen leading a “WeWork” chant in front of a crowd, emphasizing the almost hypnotic energy of the company and its leaders. The company managed to secure a $47 billion valuation before ultimately plummeting to just $9 billion as the company went public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQ1hC4"&gt;The series is based on the &lt;a href="https://wondery.com/shows/we-crashed/"&gt;Wondery podcast &lt;em&gt;WeCrashed: The Rise and Fall of WeWork&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and is set to debut on Apple TV Plus on March 18th, with new episodes airing every Friday until April 22nd. Last year, Hulu created a documentary that followed the WeWork rollercoaster ride, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22358602/wework-documentary-adam-neumann-hulu"&gt;called &lt;em&gt;WeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fe9Z1y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEQP4VVuyrY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PwKHAI"&gt;Also coming to Apple TV Plus is &lt;em&gt;Severance&lt;/em&gt;, a series that depicts the ultimate balance between work and home. Adam Scott plays Mark Scout, a manager at Lumon Industries, who undergoes a procedure called “severance.” The procedure splits Scout’s (and his co-workers’) personal and work-related memories — when he’s at the office, he has no memory of his home life and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLrnjA"&gt;The trailer shows what seems to be Scout’s verbal acknowledgment of the procedure’s risks. It also previews the robotic interactions that take place between him and co-workers, as well as hints at a darker mystery brewing inside the workplace. &lt;em&gt;Severance&lt;/em&gt; premieres on February 18th and is produced by Ben Stiller.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The battle between the FAA, AT&amp;T, Verizon, and airlines over 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-Xzg8u4OPAGaRV_gkHXYUO1OyU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70409844/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;C-band’s rollout has endured months of controversy&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="u8qDaU"&gt;When AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon spent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;tens of billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; for the rights to use the C-band spectrum for their 5G service, the carriers saw it as a way to expand their networks and make them faster. Those plans, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;sparked a feud&lt;/a&gt; with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which warned that the cell signals could interfere with the altimeters that pilots use to land in conditions with low visibility. (&lt;em&gt;Could&lt;/em&gt; is a keyword — if everything is working correctly, there shouldn’t be problems, but with jets that can hold hundreds of people, it’s understandable why the FAA and airlines would want a lot of wiggle room.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSD8JL"&gt;Before the carriers activated their C-band equipment, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822875/5g-faa-rule-c-band-landing-airport-bad-weather-visibility"&gt;FAA created rules around&lt;/a&gt; how airplanes could land in low-visibility conditions. The carriers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;agreed to delay their rollouts in November 2021&lt;/a&gt;, pushing the date to January 5th, and also said they’d &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22801008/verizon-att-midband-5g-c-band-lower-power-six-months"&gt;run their equipment at lower power around airports for six months&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/8/22873765/faa-verizon-att-airport-5g-carriers-buffer-zone"&gt;creating buffer zones&lt;/a&gt; and allowing the regulator more time to analyze the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFrZ9z"&gt;Then, the FAA requested another delay. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863964/faa-fcc-verizon-att-c-band-5g-airports-proposal-rejected"&gt;The carriers initially rejected it&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;cutting a deal&lt;/a&gt; to push the date back to January 15th. As that deadline neared, there was a flurry of activity. A coalition of airlines and shipping companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;claimed that the rollout could cause “catastrophic disruption”&lt;/a&gt; if it went through, and the carriers announced that they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;put further limits on their rollout around airports&lt;/a&gt; but lambasted the FAA in their statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SH2ca3"&gt;The same day, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890080/5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan"&gt;several international airlines announced&lt;/a&gt; that they were canceling flights to certain airports in the US. (The president of Emirates &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/business/emirates-5g-quest/index.html"&gt;had some scathing remarks&lt;/a&gt; about how the situation was handled, calling the rollout “one of the most delinquent, utterly irresponsible issues [...] I’ve seen in my aviation career” and saying that the airline didn’t have vital information until a few days before the rollout.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9p4oBF"&gt;On the 19th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891286/att-5g-rollout-select-metro-areas-faa-delay"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891284/verizon-c-band-5g-ultra-wideband-now-available"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; activated their cell networks, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891725/faa-radar-new-altimeter-clearance-5g-c-band-rollout-airlines-boeing-777"&gt;FAA cleared additional altimeters&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it should allow “an estimated 62 percent of the U.S. commercial fleet to perform low-visibility landings at airports where wireless companies deployed 5G C-band.” The story is continuing to evolve as airlines announce delays or that they’ll be continuing service. You can follow the story as it continues to unfold here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Crypto.com CEO confirms hundreds of accounts were hacked, hedges on other details </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ulIH2UG6mRv0JWDnAJ0QX3b-yk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70409618/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BpexxI"&gt;The CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com, Kris Marszalek, has finally confirmed that hundreds of user accounts were indeed compromised by hackers and had funds stolen as a result, though details of the exact method of breach remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PongJw"&gt;Marszalek &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BloombergLive/status/1483841347824099330"&gt;acknowledged the hack&lt;/a&gt; in an online interview with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; Wednesday, stating that around 400 customer accounts had been compromised. He also told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that he had &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-19/crypto-com-ceo-says-regulators-haven-t-reached-out-after-hack"&gt;not received any outreach from regulators&lt;/a&gt; since the attack was first disclosed but would share information if official inquiries were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jtkN8e"&gt;Previous statements from Marszalek and other communications from Crypto.com have been criticized for being vague and unclear. Official messaging from the company &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjb3zq/cryptocom-says-alleged-dollar15-million-hack-was-just-an-incident"&gt;referred to a security “incident,”&lt;/a&gt; and an early Twitter post mentioned only that a small number of users were “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cryptocom/status/1482936866001207296"&gt;reporting suspicious activity on their accounts&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2GRKK7"&gt;Marszalek followed up by tweeting that “no customer funds were lost” — a statement some commentators interpreted as meaning that the exchange would take the financial hit rather than passing it on to customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Some thoughts from me on the last 24 hours:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- no customer funds were lost &lt;br&gt;- the downtime of withdrawal infra was ~14 hours &lt;br&gt;- our team has hardened the infrastructure  in response to the incident&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We will share a full post mortem after the internal investigation is completed.&lt;/p&gt;— Kris | Crypto.com (@Kris_HK) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Kris_HK/status/1483277350683185155?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GGBgzN"&gt;Shortly afterward, security company PeckShield posted a tweet claiming that, in reality, Crypto.com’s losses &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1483246262371557378"&gt;amounted to around $15 million in ETH&lt;/a&gt; and were being sent to Tornado Cash to be “washed.” Tornado Cash is a cryptocurrency privacy tool known as a “mixer” that can hide the final destination of ether being sent into it: a service that has legitimate uses but can easily be used to launder the proceeds of theft and other crypto-related crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVxU2v"&gt;The Crypto.com exchange has become one of the most recognizable brands in the cryptocurrency world due to a number of prominent sponsorship deals with sports teams, notably a $700 million deal that renamed the Los Angeles Lakers’ stadium — formerly known as the Staples Center — to the Crypto.com Arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxpUhg"&gt;The exchange has also inked deals with the UFC fight league, the Philadelphia 76ers NBA team, the NHL’s Montreal Canadiens, and, most recently, &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/australian-women-s-football-team-secures-75m-deal-with-crypto-com"&gt;with the Australian Football League&lt;/a&gt;, deals worth as much as $1.5 billion in sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fQSXC"&gt;As the size and user base of the cryptocurrency industry continues to grow, exchanges remain some of the most high-value targets for hackers to compromise. According to NBC News, there were more than 20 exchange hacks &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/bitcoin-crypto-exchange-hacks-little-anyone-can-do-rcna7870"&gt;where the hacker escaped with more than $10 million&lt;/a&gt; in profit over the course of 2021, with six cases exceeding $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;
