    <title>Adobe releases Apple Silicon version of Premiere Pro in beta</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1pSOOnlCu8CTFOf7nfR1F0j2pY=/0x0:749x499/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68559369/PPro.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r6qYc8"&gt;Adobe has released an Arm version of Premiere Pro for macOS, allowing owners of new Apple Silicon M1 Macs to run the video editing software natively. The program is still very much in beta for now, however, and the &lt;a href="https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-beta/discuss-premiere-pro-on-apple-silicon-m1/td-p/11691346?page=1"&gt;Adobe post announcing its availability&lt;/a&gt; lists a host of known bugs and missing features. News of its release was &lt;a href="https://the8-bit.com/adobe-premiere-pro-for-m1-macs-now-available-to-public-beta-testers/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;The 8-Bit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/21/premiere-pro-premiere-rush-audition-for-m1-beta/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; adds&lt;/a&gt; that Adobe’s Premiere Rush and Audition have also been updated to run on the new machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkSxYy"&gt;Adobe says it’s porting Premiere Pro’s features over in phases, starting with its core editing functions and workflows, as well as popular codecs like H.264, HEVC, and ProRes. Third-party integrations will need to be updated by their respective developers to work on Apple Silicon. Adobe advises that users can run the current release version of Premiere Pro on M1 Macs using Rosetta 2 emulation while the Arm version is still in development, though some third-party integrations may not work in this mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaQRE2"&gt;Premiere Pro joins other Adobe apps including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571070/adobe-photoshop-arm64-beta-windows-macos-m1"&gt;Photoshop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571070/adobe-photoshop-arm64-beta-windows-macos-m1"&gt;Lightroom&lt;/a&gt; that have seen releases for Apple’s new Arm-based Macs. It’s a relatively quick turnaround for Adobe considering the new MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini were only released just over a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dozens of Al Jazeera journalists targeted in apparent iOS spyware attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CbJr-LdQ9t6mMic2yNHFwEeQFas=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68559162/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QGHkvY"&gt;36 personal phones belonging to Al Jazeera journalists, producers, anchors, and executives were hacked in a spyware campaign between July and August 2020, &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/"&gt;a new report from Citizen Lab&lt;/a&gt; alleges. The attacks reportedly used Pegasus technology provided by the Israeli firm NSO Group, and are thought to be the work of four operators. Citizen Lab says it has “medium confidence” that one is working on behalf of the UAE government and another for the Saudi government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1mZNr"&gt;The attacks are worrying not just because they appear to show politically-motivated targeting of journalists, but also because they’re part of a trend of using increasingly advanced methods that are harder to detect. According to Citizen Lab, the attacks seem to have used a zero-click exploit to compromise iPhones via iMessage, meaning the attacks happened without the victims needing to do anything, and leave much less of a trace once a device is infected. In July 2020, the exploit chain was a zero-day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="b4U0XN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iOS 14 is not thought to be vulnerable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xl91yS"&gt;Citizen Lab’s report says “almost all iPhone devices” which haven’t been updated to iOS 14 appear to be vulnerable to the hack, meaning the infections it found are likely to be a “miniscule fraction” of the total number. It has disclosed its findings to Apple, and the company is looking into the issue. Citizen Lab’s analysis suggests the spyware can record audio from a phone (including ambient noise and audio from phone calls), take photos, track location, and access passwords. Devices updated to iOS 14 don’t appear to be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUvkiT"&gt;Citizen Lab discovered one of the hacks after Al Jazeera journalist, Tamer Almisshal, allowed the organization to install a VPN on his device because he was worried it might have been compromised. Using this software, Citizen Lab, noticed that his phone visited a suspected installation server for NSO Group’s spyware. Seconds later, his phone uploaded over 200MB of data to three IP addresses for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwYgD5"&gt;As well as the Al Jazeera employees, Citizen Lab reports that a journalist with Al Araby TV, Rania Dridi, was also the victim of hacks using NSO Group’s spyware. These attacks date back to October 2019, and appear to include two zero-day exploits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0MCsi"&gt;This is not the first time allegations have emerged that spyware from NSO Group has been used to target journalists. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/dec/20/citizen-lab-nso-dozens-of-aljazeera-journalists-allegedly-hacked-using-israeli-firm-spyware"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the software has allegedly been used to target journalists in Morocco, as well as political dissidents from Rwanda and Spanish politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ewhJZ"&gt;When contacted for comment a spokesperson for NSO Group told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Citizen Lab’s report was based on “speculation” and “lacks any evidence supporting a connection to NSO.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJTXOs"&gt;“NSO provides products that enable governmental law enforcement agencies to tackle serious organized crime and counterterrorism only, and as stated in the past we do not operate them,” the spokesperson said. “However, when we receive credible evidence of misuse with enough information which can enable us to assess such credibility, we take all necessary steps in accordance with our investigation procedure in order to review the allegations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HhDZmC"&gt;As a result of its investigation, Citizen Lab is calling for more regulations over the use of surveillance technology, and for a global moratorium on its sale and transfer until safeguards are put in place to guard against its misuse.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The world’s first under-display selfie camera isn’t very good</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oG4ZqKZXbNTE6IF6MrurOOYVBDE=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68559011/DSCF7475.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;ZTE’s Axon 20 5G is a better phone if you don’t care about selfies&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="DHBPJf"&gt;In a perfect world, everything would fit under the surface of smartphone displays. That’s been the principle behind the past few years of phone design, at least, ever since the iPhone X escalated the bezel wars with its conspicuous notch. From in-display fingerprint sensors to pop-up selfie cameras, we’ve seen phone manufacturers take creative approaches to achieving the highest possible screen-to-body ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blwqBj"&gt;The latest advancement in the bezel wars is the ZTE Axon 20 5G, which goes on sale today and is the world’s first phone to integrate its front-facing camera underneath the screen. While in-display fingerprint sensors are commonplace now, doing the same for selfie cameras has proven to be more difficult. Companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18759380/under-display-selfie-camera-first-oppo-announcement"&gt;Oppo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650166/xiaomi-under-display-selfie-camera-weibo-teaser-mi-9-notch-hole-punch"&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt; have been showing off demos for years, but ZTE has beaten them to the punch with the first commercial device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUjZn6"&gt;In theory, the advantages are obvious. You get an unbroken display that doesn’t need to account for a notch or hole-punch, and you don’t have to build in a motorized mechanism for a pop-up camera module. Again, if the world were perfect, the camera would just magically exist under the display without compromising image quality on either end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBqPrU"&gt;Readers, the world is not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/65plfj17NdcpU5n3L8Fy7TbzGCk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22185694/DSCF7476.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SiU2sa"&gt;Before we talk about the camera, we should talk about the display that lies on top. I doubt this has anything to do with the camera technology itself, but the fact is that the Axon 20 5G is one of the biggest smartphones I’ve ever seen. The 90Hz OLED panel is a massive 6.92 inches diagonal, which means its 1080p resolution is a little less sharp than you’ll find on other phones. It’s not a problem in regular use, though, and the screen generally looks pretty good beyond some rough off-angle color shifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S1VWaA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It sometimes looks worse than a notch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AwiFjW"&gt;What does not look good is the comparatively huge “chin” bezel at the bottom. Even though it would have been considered extraordinarily slim just a few years ago, it really stands out on the Axon 20 5G considering the supposedly breakthrough nature of the device. I’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18715232/meizu-16s-hands-on-price-specs-design"&gt;phones&lt;/a&gt; that have managed to integrate conventional selfie cameras into thinner bezels than this, which kind of undermines the point of putting one under the display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VB7cfA"&gt;That feeling only intensifies when you go through the Axon 20 5G’s setup process, which  shows the camera in the worst possible conditions. The under-display integration is extremely noticeable on light backgrounds, like what you tend to see on settings screens. There’s a square patch of the screen that exhibits a clear dithering effect, making it appear much lower resolution than the rest of the panel. I will just say right now that I think it looks worse than a notch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1eWiNB"&gt;In more general use, it’s harder to notice. If you’re viewing photos or a full-color wallpaper, you can see the lower-resolution area if you look closely, but it isn’t quite as distracting. And as with other companies who’ve shipped Android phones with notches or hole-punches, ZTE’s default software uses a black background for the top part of the screen where status and notification icons are displayed, which does make the camera near-invisible. But really, if you need to resort to the same old notch-hiding techniques to disguise your under-display camera, what are we even doing here?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ny8TgkEmYfp4JvywJeSlQxmLx8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22185690/DSCF7470.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rXDOyId2Gufsvk43likwoVILZtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22185691/DSCF7468.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f5NbEO_pIxn41JwM22cLzctw-30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22185692/DSCF7472.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hUeGt6"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The above images show how visible the camera is on colorful, white, and black backgrounds.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="AFfALE"&gt;Of course, the next obvious question is how the camera actually performs. The news here is not great either. I don’t want to diminish the technical achievement of getting a halfway functional camera under an OLED screen at all — it involves new types of transparent materials, pixel filters, and demosaicing algorithms to make sense of the light that hits the 32-megapixel sensor. But the result, unfortunately, is a bad selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rf3Opi"&gt;In good light, the Axon 20 5G’s selfie camera takes hazy, soft photos with weak colors and blown-out highlights. Compare it to the Pixel 5 below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="lUrEbC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10243932"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0z8cxn"&gt;Just to be clear, that Axon 20 5G photo was taken with the portrait mode and smoothing filters turned &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RfPxRt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10243988"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pXgJn2"&gt;The disparity is just as stark in low light, with a ton of noise and obliterated detail. I turned off the Pixel 5’s night mode here to make it more of a fair fight, and it still crushed the Axon 20 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y31v2m"&gt;This under-display selfie camera is merely functional, and that’s being generous. It can capture images through the screen, yes, which is indeed a minor miracle. But you probably wouldn’t want anyone else to see them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BYaOmL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is otherwise a pretty credible phone for $449&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="r6q6SX"&gt;This isn’t the most effusive compliment I can give a phone with a supposedly breakthrough selfie camera, but the ZTE Axon 20 5G is actually a much better proposition if you don’t care about selfies or video calls. It’s otherwise a pretty credible phone for $449, though despite providing a dollar price ZTE says it won’t be available in the US or Canada for now. (&lt;a href="https://events.ztedevices.com/zte-subscription-page"&gt;It’s €449 in the EU and £419 in the UK.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="px9VQC"&gt;While the Axon 20 5G has a huge footprint, it’s still slim at just under 8mm thick, and ZTE has included a reasonably large 4,220mAh battery inside. The processor is a Snapdragon 765G with an integrated 5G modem, same as the Pixel 5 and the LG Velvet, and it can be configured to have up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeKuUA"&gt;Other specs include an optical in-display fingerprint sensor that works fine, 30W fast charging over USB-C, and a headphone jack. There’s a 64-megapixel main camera and a 16-megapixel ultrawide, along with 2-megapixel macro and depth sensors that you can probably ignore. The main areas where ZTE has cut corners are its mediocre haptics system and an unimpressive downward-firing speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="oN1L1Y"&gt;The fact that ZTE finally got a phone like this onto the market is a notable milestone, but I’m not sure who the device is really for. The under-display selfie camera often looks worse and more distracting than a notch, and the image quality is clearly compromised. It’s ironic that a phone might be more appealing to an audience that actively doesn’t care about its key selling point, but that’s where we’re at with the Axon 20 5G.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If your Cyberpunk 2077 save file becomes too big, it might get corrupted</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t55DGF"&gt;I can barely go anywhere on the internet without seeing yet another &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nickstatt/status/1339286036745232391"&gt;wild&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kgwqxa/just_another_lovely_morning_in_night_city/"&gt;hilarious&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VaultofKvlt/status/1337591912853749760"&gt;downright odd bug&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a buggy game, and developer CD Projekt Red has already released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22170547/cyberpunk-2077-update-hotfix-cd-projekt-red-epilepsy-risk-braindance"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189893/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-hotfix-bugs"&gt;hotfixes&lt;/a&gt; to try and shore up some of the problems. One issue that’s starting to pop up, though, isn’t funny at all: some players are reporting that their &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; save files are becoming corrupted if they exceed a certain file size (&lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amp/2020-12-20-gog-advises-cyberpunk-2077-players-to-keep-a-lower-amount-of-items-to-avoid-corrupting-save-files"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jxaz2F"&gt;If your &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; save is corrupted, you’ll apparently see this prompt when you try and load up the game: “saved data is damaged and cannot be loaded.” Here’s what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N61B7oNUEuK25mGcSo5lOHxbKPY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22186789/Save_damaged.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The prompt shown for corrupted saves in &lt;/em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WWd4yz"&gt;While it’s not clear what might be causing save files to be corrupted, it seems it can happen when the saves reach 8MB in size. Crossing that 8MB threshold is when the save file corrupted for one Redditor, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kfpwt5/psa_steampc_crossing_about_6_mb_in_your_save/"&gt;in their testing&lt;/a&gt;. There are also multiple people on CD Projekt Red’s forums &lt;a href="https://forums.cdprojektred.com/index.php?threads/save-files-are-corrupted.11052596/post-12416147"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://forums.cdprojektred.com/index.php?threads/save-files-are-corrupted.11052596/post-12418382"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://forums.cdprojektred.com/index.php?threads/save-files-are-corrupted.11052596/post-12421034"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; 8MB+ save files are corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGZURA"&gt;In a GOG.com support document about the corrupted saves prompt, &lt;a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016743298-Cyberpunk-2077-Saved-data-is-damaged-and-cannot-be-loaded-?product=gog&amp;amp;pp=d965a463ac183af4828302b14522bb3371cec49f"&gt;CD Projekt Red says that&lt;/a&gt; “unfortunately the save is damaged and can’t be recovered.” To avoid seeing the prompt, the company recommends using an older save and to “keep a lower amount of items and crafting materials.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AAVd2i"&gt;Theoretically, if your &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; save file is larger than 8MB, you’ve invested dozens of hours into the game and collected a lot of items. If I had a corrupted save in part because I picked up too much stuff (in a game that’s &lt;em&gt;littered&lt;/em&gt; with stuff to pick up), I know I’d be extremely disappointed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmlN56"&gt;CD Projekt Red says in the save file size limit “might be increased in one of the future patches” &lt;a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016743298-Cyberpunk-2077-Saved-data-is-damaged-and-cannot-be-loaded-?product=gog&amp;amp;pp=d965a463ac183af4828302b14522bb3371cec49f"&gt;in the GOG.com support document&lt;/a&gt;. But even if that increase happens, the save files that are currently corrupted will remain so, the document says. If you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; experiencing corrupted saves, a moderator on CD Projekt Red’s &lt;a href="https://forums.cdprojektred.com/index.php?threads/save-files-are-corrupted.11052596/"&gt;official &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; forums&lt;/a&gt; has offered some suggestions on how to load backup saves that you can try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzKsB6"&gt;The studio &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1338390123373801472/photo/1"&gt;has promised&lt;/a&gt; to release two large patches for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; next year: one in January and one in February. Perhaps the company will make changes in those patches to help prevent files from becoming corrupted. CD Projekt Red didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Bridgerton, Palmer, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fZShpCHvIFY6ai3whgaN086rHDM=/231x72:1634x1007/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68557464/Screen_Shot_2020_12_20_at_1.34.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DRK60L"&gt;Hi, I’m Jay! I’m subbing in for your usual trailers guide Kim Lyons while she takes a well-deserved holiday break. I’ve really been looking forward to writing this post. Trailers are fun! They’re like bite-sized movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KY1ma"&gt;Unfortunately, there weren’t a ton of trailers to choose from this week. I suppose studios don’t want to launch big trailers for upcoming blockbusters shortly before everyone takes off for the holidays. But there were still a few good ones to watch, including a trailer for a series launching on Netflix later this week. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="icRUIG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gpv7ayf_tyE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="q9TbTN"&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XCvNbh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; is Shona Rhimes’ upcoming British period drama for Netflix, the first series resulting from her &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/14/16142342/shonda-rhimes-deal-netflix-greys-anatomy-scandal"&gt;mega-deal with Netflix&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like it should hit a lot of the expected high points from a period drama, such as a budding relationship between two people of high society, lots of witty one-liners, and extravagant settings, dancing, and costumes. And I’m sure Rhimes’ influence will make the show all the more exciting. &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; will be released on Netflix on December 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7BExhw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8jVuOheTNGQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j6RMOS"&gt;Palmer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JafKlA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Palmer&lt;/em&gt; stars Justin Timberlake as a man trying to rebuild his life after being in prison. Soon after he returns home, he begins taking care of a small boy, Sam, whose mother has disappeared. The movie looks like it will focus on how the two help each other overcome their difficulties. The movie will be released on January 29th on Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LfOlfO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6sxCFZ8_d84?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bCBwY0"&gt;Nomadland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5yYPf8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; is about a woman, played by Frances McDormand, who hits the road in her van and becomes a nomad. It’s the third movie directed by Chloé Zhao, who also directed &lt;em&gt;Songs My Brothers Taught Me&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Rider. &lt;/em&gt;The trailer is beautiful and contemplative — the movie feels like it will be perfect for a quiet night curled up in a blanket. &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; is set for a US theatrical release on February 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v1SxkE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iwYhA5YvdNc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BtmiMn"&gt;Outside the Wire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fMhc1x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outside the Wire’s&lt;/em&gt; trailer has lots of athletic jumps, explosions, robots, and loud drumming, so I hope that translates to a fun and campy action movie. (Basically, it seems like the opposite of &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt;.) And Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/only-on-netflix/81074110"&gt;official description for the movie&lt;/a&gt; makes me even more intrigued: “Set in the future, Harp (Damson Idris), a drone pilot, is sent into a deadly militarized zone where he finds himself working for Leo (Anthony Mackie), an android officer, tasked to locate a doomsday device before the insurgents do.” Sweet, I’m in. &lt;em&gt;Outside the Wire&lt;/em&gt; will hit Netflix on January 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OFICxT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SntsSsMLUWA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3cHU9z"&gt;WandaVision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dir6hL"&gt;Disney has also released another short trailer for &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, its upcoming Disney Plus series from Marvel Studios. Elizabeth Olsen stars as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch and Paul Bettany as Vision. If you’ve been anticipating &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, you won’t have to wait long until you can finally watch it — the show premieres on January 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JI7aQo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFmMCq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNLx7C"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wM7igq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Frontline essential workers and the elderly next in line for COVID-19 vaccinations in US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2R5rpw52NVzbzu-7Taa43jtzQFs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68557248/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SmUTyq"&gt;Frontline essential workers and people 75 years of age and older in the United States should get COVID-19 vaccines in the next wave of immunizations, an independent committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended. That group includes about 49 million people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3V5XoR"&gt;After those groups are vaccinated, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) said doses should go to people between 65 and 74 years old, people between 16 and 65 years old with underlying health conditions, and other essential workers not in groups considered frontline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gi7toz"&gt;Vaccines will be in limited supply through at least the next few months. The CDC expects that there should be doses available to vaccinate 20 million people in December, 30 million people in January, and 50 million people in February. “In this setting, difficult choices have to be made,” Kathleen Dooling, medical officer at the CDC, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/slides-12-20/02-COVID-Dooling.pdf"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; to the ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLCOvt"&gt;States and local jurisdictions ultimately make the final decisions around the distribution and prioritization of vaccinations, but the CDC recommendations help shape their approaches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBsUq8"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21779433/covid-vaccine-priority-health-care-workers-long-term-care"&gt;first phase&lt;/a&gt; of vaccinations are going to health care workers and long term care facility residents. Those groups started to get vaccinated last week, and over &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html"&gt;500,000 people&lt;/a&gt; in the US have been vaccinated so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppZVEK"&gt;The ACIP balanced two main goals to make recommendations for the second wave of vaccinations: preventing death and disease and preserving societal function. Older adults over 75 have the highest risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Frontline essential workers — which the committee &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/slides-12-20/02-COVID-Dooling.pdf"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; includes firefighters, teachers, grocery store workers, manufacturing workers, and others — are unable to work from home and often have to interact with the public, putting them at risk of exposure to the virus. Keeping those groups healthy will help keep key services running. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GueTN6lQyz7VpYyAUB-saqQHXYs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22186150/EpsZq7oW4AEMBMj.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;CDC&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Slide from a presentation on vaccine prioritization. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SGOWqO"&gt;“This approach mitigates health inequities as racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented in many essential industries,” Dooling said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4ID0g"&gt;The third group the committee says should be vaccinated includes essential workers like people working in food service, construction, transportation, wastewater, and media. People between 65 and 74 are also at high risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19, as are younger people with underlying health conditions like cardiac disease or diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezxMHV"&gt;While the CDC has a list of workplaces that it considers frontline and essential, different states will set those designations in different ways. Various interest groups are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/20/nyregion/essential-worker-coronavirus-vaccine.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage"&gt;lobbying &lt;/a&gt;states to include their workers in early vaccination groups — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167583/uber-driver-early-access-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;, for example, asked states to prioritize its drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vd2VGy"&gt;Distributing vaccines to the second and third wave of priority groups will be difficult. It’s hard to determine eligibility, for example, and reaching essential workers (who may not be able to take time off of work, or may live in rural areas) is a challenge. Committee members stressed the importance of adequate funding for vaccine distribution. Money was funneled into vaccine development, which led to the overwhelmingly effective final products. Local health departments need the same level of investment in vaccination programs. The vaccines are Cadillacs, Jeffrey Duchin, a health officer in King County, Washington, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/megtirrell/status/1340702874775531525"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during the meeting. “But they’ve come with empty gas tanks,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKWqxf"&gt;Over 200,000 people are being diagnosed with COVID-19 in the US each day, and over 2,500 people are dying from the disease every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuUKQ9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ninja’s Fall Guys skin is now available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yurYvFQcTgRisOLeEBajLNaHAC8=/428x0:2732x1536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68556947/EpmxqCKXEAEN0h1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ninja Fall Guys skin.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Mediatonic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z8X1qY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; developer Mediatonic has added a skin based on the hugely-popular streamer Tyler “Ninja” Blevins to the game. The skin’s arrival follows a two-week charity bidding war &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21404149/fall-guys-twitter-bidding-war-in-game-costume-charity"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt; to have a custom skin added to the game. Blevins, G2 Esports, Aim Lab, and Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson pledged a combined $1 million to &lt;a href="https://www.specialeffect.org.uk/"&gt;Special Effect&lt;/a&gt;, which helps people with physical disabilities find ways to play video games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eu9LAq"&gt;Here’s a couple photos the Ninja skin in-game, courtesy of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1340626462987210753"&gt;the Fall Guys Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. It looks kind of like a jelly bean-sized version of the Ninja skin that was added to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068938/fortnite-ninja-skin-icon-series-metaverse-tyler-blevins-ultimate-virtual-world-star-wars"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SQsRU7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Surprise!&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ninja?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Ninja&lt;/a&gt; is now in the store and he only costs:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1 x   Top&lt;br&gt;1 x   Bottom&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So let's see some 100% Ninja lobbies  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;⭐️ We've also got a special show going live in 6 minutes of Ninja's favourite rounds! ⭐️&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where we falling guys??? &lt;a href="https://t.co/Yir0GX2PpG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Yir0GX2PpG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fall Guys ❄️ Season 3 Out Now! (@FallGuysGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1340626462987210753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 20, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NyVYoE"&gt;The Ninja skin isn’t the first crossover added to &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; — Mediatonic has already offered skins like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536473/fall-guys-godzilla-skin-bean-throwing-monster-mediatonic-branded"&gt;an adorable Godzilla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1304815102819004416"&gt;Gato Roboto from the game &lt;em&gt;Gato Roboto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and even skins based off of &lt;a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/fall-guys-ps4-half-life-alyx-skin/"&gt;iconic Valve characters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bT2tZv"&gt;It’s unclear when the skins based on G2 Esports, Aim Lab, and Donaldson will be added to the game. Mediatonic hasn’t replied to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKDq8t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; kicked off its winter-themed third season &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVNSct9atp8"&gt;on December 15th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stanford algorithm decided to vaccinate only seven of its frontline COVID-19 workers, out of 5,000 doses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GP Surgeries In Cornwall Join Covid-19 Vaccine Campaign" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rYLoUSLjjPqw8nyEc17BQChbwS0=/0x0:5908x3939/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68556775/1292266593.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Hugh Hastings/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2cbXZj"&gt;An algorithm determining which Stanford Medicine employees would receive its 5,000 initial doses of the COVID-19 vaccine included just seven medical residents / fellows on the list, according to a December 17th letter sent from Stanford Medicine’s chief resident council. Stanford Medicine leadership has since apologized and promised to re-evaluate the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaAqww"&gt;“We take complete responsibility for the errors in the execution of our vaccine distribution plan,” a Stanford Medicine spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our intent was to develop an ethical and equitable process for distribution of the vaccine. We apologize to our entire community, including our residents, fellows, and other frontline care providers, who have performed heroically during our pandemic response. We are immediately revising our plan to better sequence the distribution of the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzTQQg"&gt;The initial plan led to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CarolineYLChen/status/1340046920631394310"&gt;demonstrations from medical staff&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the letter sent by the chief resident council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d1jhRT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NEW: Stanford used an algorithm to decide who got the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#COVID&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/vaccine?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#vaccine&lt;/a&gt; first, and the result was only 7 of the first 5,000 slots went to residents... the same week they were asked to volunteer for ICU coverage in anticipation of a surge in COVID-19 cases.&lt;a href="https://t.co/tupAeyHudx"&gt;https://t.co/tupAeyHudx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/gr5CaPoV7G"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gr5CaPoV7G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Caroline Chen (@CarolineYLChen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CarolineYLChen/status/1340046920631394310?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjsYdR"&gt;“Stanford’s decision to de-prioritize residents and fellows is defenseless on the basis of science, reason, ethics, and equality,” the letter said. (&lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; has hosted &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20432343-stanford-letter"&gt;the full letter on DocumentCloud&lt;/a&gt;.) “Many of us know senior faculty who have worked from home since the pandemic began in March 2020, with no in-person patient responsibilities, who were selected for vaccination. In the meantime, we residents and fellows strap on N95 masks for the tenth month of this pandemic without a transparent and clear plan for our protection in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpCcCw"&gt;The residents’ letter also alleges that the error in the algorithm was found on Tuesday but that leadership opted not to make changes to the plan ahead of its December 17th release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eYhn6"&gt;Here’s how the algorithm reportedly worked, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/12/18/948176807/stanford-apologizes-after-vaccine-allocation-leaves-out-nearly-all-medical-resid"&gt;according to NPR&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="vK1lZS"&gt;According to an email sent by a chief resident to other residents, Stanford’s leaders explained that an algorithm was used to assign its first allotment of the vaccine. The algorithm was said to have prioritized those health care workers at highest risk for COVID infections, along with factors like age and the location or unit where they work in the hospital. Residents apparently did not have an assigned location, and along with their typically young age, they were dropped low on the priority list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FNsyVt"&gt;Stanford Medicine administration also sent an email to staff on December 18th apologizing for the initial plan and promising changes. “We are working quickly to address the flaws in our plan and develop a revised version,” the email said, which &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CarolineYLChen/status/1340080220569800706"&gt;was obtained&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; health care reporter Caroline Chen. “We are optimistic that a large shipment of vaccines will arrive next week, which will allow us to vaccinate a substantial segment of our community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7cCHg6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Email from Stanford administration this afternoon: &lt;a href="https://t.co/hJTyjgSTIN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hJTyjgSTIN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Caroline Chen (@CarolineYLChen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CarolineYLChen/status/1340080220569800706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ukabaQ"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has authorized two COVID-19 vaccines for use in the US. The vaccine developed by Pfizer / BioNTech was authorized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22158608/fda-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-emergency-use"&gt;on December 11th&lt;/a&gt;, and the one developed by Moderna was authorized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22185507/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-fda-authorized"&gt;on December 18th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cooking videos were one small savior of 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/czkdQnMAlPci8islJ_2EYJTHe1A=/165x0:2112x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68556333/remicruz.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e9q8dc"&gt;Early one morning, a week after the pandemic started, chef and food writer J. Kenji López-Alt strapped a GoPro to his head and filmed himself making breakfast. In &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dw2UyqIaik"&gt;the video&lt;/a&gt;, you can see López-Alt rummaging through his fridge, slicing and frying bacon, and peeling a bit of egg off a pan to give to his excited dog. There’s no recipe beneath the video, no voice-over instructions detailing what we’re seeing — it’s just a guy in a kitchen making breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9tqPq"&gt;Videos like these became both much-needed entertainment and valuable educational resources early in the pandemic, as a world of people realized they would be stuck at home indefinitely with their own (not necessarily stunning) cooking, and a little extra time to put into it. Food and drink streams surged in popularity on Twitch, doubling in hours watched year over year in August, according to &lt;a href="https://blog.streamelements.com/state-of-the-stream-august-2020-fall-guys-has-an-incredible-debut-shroud-returns-to-twitch-and-9689227dc972"&gt;StreamElements and Arsenal.gg&lt;/a&gt;. On YouTube, “cook with me” videos more than doubled in popularity starting in March and maintained that growth through October, YouTube told &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/youtube-babish-cooking-shows-virus-339e5283220590ab3c250ef54c946895"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pJjVo"&gt;“It gives [viewers] confidence to do stuff in the kitchen,” said López-Alt, author of &lt;em&gt;The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science&lt;/em&gt;. His own videos lack the polish and perfect cuts of a professional show and include the slip-ups he makes along the way. “It gives them permission to make mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3VWAve"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2zBtiYF5Gw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tX9Rt2"&gt;Cooking shows have been around for a century, but new formats online have revitalized the genre in recent years. On YouTube in particular, you can find step-by-step instructional lessons, personal “cook with me” vlogs, and stomach-churning food challenges like stuffing McDonald’s burgers and nuggets into an oversized burrito. On Twitch, chefs and home cooks broadcast themselves live from their kitchen as they prepare meals. And on TikTok, you can watch videos teaching you how to make a new dish in under a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSjXA4"&gt;Many hosts noticed a pickup in views and engagement as the pandemic went on. “It definitely has been skyrocket high with the views on things you can do at home,” Zahria Harvey, whose YouTube channel &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/XOZAHRIAAA/videos"&gt;XO. ZAHRIAAA&lt;/a&gt; is known for “cook with me” videos, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Harvey says one viewer wrote in about making an affordable date night meal featured on her channel for an anniversary dinner because she couldn’t go out to dinner. “It was like wow, these videos are actually helping a lot of people during this time,” Harvey said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eL6sih"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=v838587873&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dRAsrl"&gt;The influx of new viewers has also meant more live interaction for hosts on Twitch. “I find that the community is way more vocal and involved past March this year,” L.A., a photographer and former sushi chef who runs the channel &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thehungerservice"&gt;The Hunger Service&lt;/a&gt;, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. L.A.’s streams typically run for three to four hours and show him preparing and cooking a meal, talking through his process as he’s working. As he cooks, viewers ask questions about the process, like how sharp a knife needs to be or how to turn a recipe vegan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xt3q5P"&gt;For López-Alt, who’s known for his &lt;em&gt;Serious Eats &lt;/em&gt;column, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JKenjiLopezAlt/videos"&gt;his channel&lt;/a&gt; became a fun outlet for both him and his viewers. The format he locked into — strapping a GoPro to his head — is what made video finally click for him, and it helped him reach viewers who weren’t familiar with his writing. “The food I cook on my channel is stuff I was generally making for lunch and for dinner,” López-Alt said. “I could do it consistently, people seemed to like it, [and] I enjoyed making it.” Viewers told him the videos were a bright spot and were helping them learn how to cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9NKbuw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X8h2MO1vPRQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AJeJvX"&gt;Some creators have found that the surge in interest in their channels extends beyond cooking. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/RemLife/featured"&gt;Remi Cruz&lt;/a&gt;, a popular YouTuber who frequently features cooking on her two channels, said that people have been more interested in basically anything you can do at home. For “vlogmas,” she’s been using cooking to fill the gap where she’d normally vlog about outdoor activities and holiday shopping. “I’ve just been implementing some sort of cooking-related thing every day, and people genuinely love it,” Cruz told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Xwpkx"&gt;Viewers won’t always end up cooking what they see, but these videos can still make their time in the kitchen a bit more fun — or at least, distract them while they think about the great meals they’ll eventually go back out to a restaurant and order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKe0J2"&gt;“People are looking for some sort of comfort,” L.A. said. “Comfort food is a thing, and watching these shows can offer that comfort. You may not be making it at the time, but maybe you will.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing gave me structure in a shapeless year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j2YsVtH3tRH3CQHWbyUn7_F2g8c=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68556192/sc6lt8.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time may have felt sluggish in the real world, but Animal Crossing’s seasons have kept changing.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WW1o3n"&gt;I broke ground on my &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons &lt;/em&gt;island, Honkland, just three days before the UK’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the country was going into lockdown. I’d pitched up my tent, and I was just about to deliver a pile of materials to Timmy Nook to help him build the island’s general store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAngZd"&gt;I was enjoying my first &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;, but I hadn’t quite hit that point of “getting it” just yet. The menus were slow to navigate, and I wasn’t really sure what I was working toward. Mining the most material out of each of my island rocks involved a convoluted process of digging two holes and then hitting them repeatedly over the course of several seconds. Picking fruit involved first shaking a tree and then picking up each piece individually. It felt deliberately inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QQxqG7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A game best played in short bursts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VefAxe"&gt;“From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction: you must stay at home,” the prime minister said during his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJycNmK7KPk&amp;amp;t=28s"&gt;address on March 23rd&lt;/a&gt;. “You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say ‘No.’ You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine — and you should do this as little as you can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvLI1U"&gt;Inside the flat, we tried to make the best of the situation while we effectively had to press pause on our lives. Evenings out were replaced with marathon sessions of Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne. We’d watch films while simultaneously keeping a laptop open, running a Zoom call with friends we hadn’t seen in months. We bought elastic resistance bands and slung gymnastic rings over an old pull-up bar for group workouts on the weekends. And every evening, I booted up &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing &lt;/em&gt;to see what awaited me on Honkland. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C_1zWd0P_noidfeEmNLGejXtT7E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22181824/sc6lt7.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game’s chore-filled early hours were exactly what I needed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1HDxxt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing &lt;/em&gt;is a game best played in short bursts because the series has a unique approach to the passage of time. In most games, the time revolves around the player. It starts passing when the game starts and stops. Almost everything happens on your terms. But &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; takes place in real time, so if it’s the middle of the night on March 23rd in the real world, then it’s going to be the middle of the night on March 23rd in the game. (It’s possible to change your console’s built-in clock to “&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acnh-guide/2020/3/20/21168240/time-travel-next-day-tomorrow-faster"&gt;time travel&lt;/a&gt;,” but for me, it ruins the fun.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="f9fte6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Animal Crossing’ forced me to keep track of the day of the week&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0GeE1B"&gt;The approach makes it difficult to play indefinitely each day. Your island’s rocks eventually stop spitting out materials when you try to mine them, and you run out of fruit to pick from your trees. You can continue to do things like hunt down bugs and fish, but inevitably, you’ll come up against a task that needs to be done tomorrow. It’s a bold design that often forces you to wait, while other games often tempt you into playing just one extra hour. Ordinarily, I would have found the mechanic a little frustrating, but in a lockdown situation where time felt like it was standing still for weeks, it was exactly what I needed. I couldn’t lose track of time playing it for hours; instead, I had to keep a grip on what day of the week it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEgRrS"&gt;I got to work on my island. I pruned its weeds, moved more villagers in, and started collecting critters to populate my island’s museum. I sold fruit, earned bells (read: money), and spent them on building bridges and ramps to make my island’s rough terrain easier to navigate. It became a little hobby, something to check in with once a day, a little project that built up bit by bit over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxKL1t"&gt;I have considered myself incredibly lucky over the course of the past 12 months. I’ve thankfully been able to continue working from home, logging on to a computer at the end of my bed each day to chat with colleagues over Slack and conduct interviews over Zoom. Doing my small bit to help this year involved little more than staying at home as much as was physically possible. &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing &lt;/em&gt;made doing that a little bit more bearable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NZ4K7ePDOsxeBdHfbYf2ulDXAlU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22181825/sc836s.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multiplayer helped me feel connected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JhtNKU"&gt;It was &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;’s multiplayer elements that I most needed in those first few months of lockdown. It felt like the whole world was playing the game together, as Twitter and Reddit filled up with screenshots of people’s islands as well as requests to collaborate. At work, we set up a dedicated Slack channel to share our island’s turnip prices. Ordinarily, you can earn a small profit by buying and selling turnips on your own island, but you can make millions if you work as a team with other players, converging on another player’s island when it’s offering an especially good price for turnips on any given day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WCm6Yl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Time felt like it stood still for weeks on end this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qJbZk4"&gt;It’s strange how, in a year when so much history was continuously happening, time felt like it stood still for weeks on end. Five days of working in my bedroom, two days of relaxing in my living room. Rinse, repeat. People joke about time passing weirdly on the internet, when events that feel like they happened years ago actually took place just last week. This year, that weird sense of internet time seeped out into the real world. Without leaving my flat for anything more than a quick shop, it was hard to feel present in global events, no matter how important and life-changing they were for so many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xqt9LF"&gt;As the months went on and the internet’s interest in the game waned, a steady stream of new features and in-game events gave me a reason to keep visiting Honkland. Nintendo added hedgerows and diving and new characters like Redd, a huckster who occasionally visits your island with “artwork” to sell. Celebrations like Halloween were marked with in-game events that relied on playing the game on the right day to see their content. Between big events and new feature additions, every month saw the arrival of new bugs and fish, a gentle trickle of collectibles to find before they migrated away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqXyQ7"&gt;It was important to have something to do, but this year especially, it was important to me to feel like time was actually passing. Like many other people, I didn’t go on a summer holiday this year, and I didn’t attend any Halloween parties. I didn’t have a morning cycling commute to enjoy the country’s summer or to see its trees gradually turn an autumnal orange. Instead, checking in on Honkland each month gave me those small reminders that the seasons were still changing.&lt;/p&gt;
