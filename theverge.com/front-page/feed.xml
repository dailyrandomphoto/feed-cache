    <title>Is Elizabeth Holmes’ guilty verdict a wake-up call for startups?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/95fnbvvYrdMjDB7xqRUfvJpDpIk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70360343/Theranos_Thumb_3_alternate.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hEtYxA"&gt;After a long trial, former Theranos CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867505/elizabeth-holmes-guilty-fraud-investing"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes&lt;/a&gt; has been found guilty of four out of the 11 charges brought against her, including three counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud investors in her now-defunct blood testing company. The verdict caps a journey filled with both promises and disappointments, one that ultimately led to the downfall of what could have been one of the most successful companies, and entrepreneurs, to come out of Silicon Valley in over a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YH0t5"&gt;While the verdict is a milestone in holding startup founders accountable for false promises, it actually further complicates the difference between fraud and the “fake it til you make it” mindset of many startups. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s deputy editor Liz Lopatto breaks down the outcome of the trial and what to expect in the months to come. With Holmes’ business partner, Sunny Balwani, getting ready to stand trial later this month, the story is far from over. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea and Sonos’ second-gen Symfonisk bookshelf speakers get a light refresh</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LHVqBWyxF9C865OB0U2dm6AnQjU=/81x0:1713x1088/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70360295/Screen_Shot_2022_01_07_at_1.06.26_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SKHdqg"&gt;Ikea has quietly updated its Sonos-partnered Symfonisk bookshelf speakers with a &lt;a href="https://www-ikea-com.translate.goog/nl/nl/p/symfonisk-wifi-boekenplankspeaker-wit-gen-2-50506587/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US"&gt;second-generation version&lt;/a&gt; that’s already available in the Netherlands, &lt;a href="https://tweakers-net.translate.goog/nieuws/191418/ikea-en-sonos-brengen-vernieuwde-symfonisk-boekenplankspeaker-uit.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US"&gt;via Dutch tech website &lt;em&gt;Tweakers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbhVuU"&gt;Unlike the recently revamped Symfonisk lamp, which added a brand new design, the second-gen bookshelf speakers are a more minor update: they still feature the same basic shelf-style design and compatibility with Sonos’ speaker network and Apple’s Airplay 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHkEAZ"&gt;Tweakers reports that Ikea’s made some internal changes, though, adding a faster processor, more memory, and lowering power consumption when in standby mode. It’s also added a longer power cable, which should be helpful for anyone trying to mount them in awkwardly wired rooms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4LVB6"&gt;But the biggest change (biggest being a relative term here) is the buttons, where Ikea has lightly updated the layout from the first-generation model, swapping the volume up and play / pause buttons so that the two volume buttons are now next to each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N0ykTQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10966496"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mr9OT6"&gt;But aside from those tweaks, Ikea doesn’t appear to be messing with the formula here too much. The new Symfonisk, like the original, still comes in both black and white color schemes and can be paired up in stereo in conjunction with the first-generation models, too, which is good to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwYwcL"&gt;It’s not clear when Ikea will be launching the new Symfonisk speakers globally, but the second-generational models &lt;a href="https://www-ikea-com.translate.goog/nl/nl/p/symfonisk-wifi-boekenplankspeaker-wit-gen-2-50506587/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US"&gt;are already available from Ikea’s Netherlands site for 99 euros&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge Awards at CES 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A virtual trophy for the Verge Awards at CES" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qc2oysvWbodG6sbLnuGI04RfV6g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70360081/acastro_4959_220107_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Verge Awards at CES | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The things that got us most excited, bewildered, and delighted at CES 2022&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="99diuZ"&gt;CES was supposed to be in person this year. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and countless other outlets had hotel rooms confirmed and airlines booked. Companies teased cool gadgets that would have made CES feel exciting again after the muted all-digital affair of 2021. But COVID surged and CES saw massive cancellations. Some companies pivoted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;digital booths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22850502/ces-2022-exhibitors-dropping-bmw-ibm-mercedes"&gt;others canceled keynotes, and a few just withdrew altogether&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/31/22861669/ces-2022-ends-early-covid-january-7"&gt;CES even announced it would end a day early&lt;/a&gt;. The return to normal CES might have heralded never materialized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiQVvO"&gt;But something else happened: the news that came out of CES actually got us excited. For the last two years we’ve ruminated on what the point of CES even is. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21058850/ces-2020-verge-awards-best-laptop-tv-tech-pc-concept-gadget"&gt;In 2020&lt;/a&gt; we said CES was “a lot of show with not much very substance,” and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/16/22231489/ces-2021-verge-awards-best-laptop-tv-tech-pc-concept-gadget"&gt;in 2021&lt;/a&gt; that statement was still on our minds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VuzIXa"&gt;But after a very muted CES 2020, followed by the very weird all-digital CES 2021, we were surprised to find the show was still capable of surprising and sometimes even delighting us. We can’t be sure what CES will look like in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5z74MU"&gt;But this year we can celebrate the very cool, and the very weird, and sometimes the just plain goofy gadgets that had us nostalgic for former Januaries in the Nevada desert.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rc30cTanxgklIfs31HX6IJwdW0Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146138/Odyssey_Ark_side__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Odyssey Ark can be used in portrait orientation, which curves the screen above your head.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yqvUTd"&gt;Best in Show:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="n7kQJp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867790/samsung-odyssey-arc-curved-gaming-monitor"&gt;Samsung Odyssey Ark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="C9h0lC"&gt;It goes without saying that over the past two years, the humble&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;computer monitor has gained a new appreciation in many people’s eyes. It’s what makes working from home comfortable and productive; it allows us to play games from either our preferred consoles or a high-powered PC. It’s often the centerpiece of a home office setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jNIg1"&gt;So it’s no surprise that a monitor is what captured our attention at CES the most this year. Samsung’s Odyssey Ark is not just &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; monitor, though. It’s the combination of a number of trends in one package unlike any we’ve ever seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzBzOq"&gt;For starters, it’s huge: 55-inch screens may be commonplace on TVs, but they’re still rare for monitors. Second, it’s high res — its 4K resolution is enough for sharp text (at reasonable distances) and highly detailed imagery. And perhaps most importantly, it’s aggressively curved, wrapping the screen around (or, if you use it in the portrait orientation, above) you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQWeH7"&gt;It’s not Samsung’s first curved monitor — we’ve already seen multiple generations of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;Odyssey G9 and its wraparound view&lt;/a&gt; — but it is the largest, by a significant margin. The 16:9 aspect ratio makes it less ultrawide and more ultra large compared to monitors like the G9. Samsung’s demos of it in portrait orientation show it arcing above the viewer’s head, reminding me of how a Tesla’s windshield extends far beyond your line of sight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwNdr6"&gt;Though we don’t yet know the price (don’t expect cheap) or when Samsung will deliver this, it’s easy to envision the immersive experience you can obtain with it, without having to deal with fussy VR goggles. I’ll take two of them, side by side in vertical orientation, please. — &lt;em&gt;Dan Seifert, deputy editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Zephyrus G14" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-roaaPujzF3g5wlnVV42dPqs4Pw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142277/g14topdown.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0Mnl1r"&gt;Best Laptop:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="OiFGUB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22864968/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-g15-gaming-laptop-2022-webcam-amd-16-10-aspect-ratio-specs-features"&gt;ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tG5Nwu"&gt;Asus did it. It did everything we asked it to do. We in the laptop sphere have been giving the Zephyrus G14 crap for years about its lack of a webcam (and, therefore, its relative uselessness as a daily driver for many remote and hybrid workers), and Asus finally, &lt;em&gt;finally &lt;/em&gt;heard our pleas and stuck a webcam on the dang thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSDbJt"&gt;Asus also swapped out its RTX 3060 GPU for AMD’s Radeon 6800S. Armed with that chip and AMD’s new Ryzen 9 6900HS processor, it would not be at all shocking if this device was the top-performing 14-inch gaming laptop on the market this year with the best battery life to boot (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;the last all-AMD gaming laptop from Asus that I reviewed&lt;/a&gt; had unbelievable battery life and delivered the best battery gaming experience I’ve ever seen). Oh, and would you look at that — it even has a 16:10 aspect ratio, fixing basically the only other complaint I’ve ever had about the Zephyrus G14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlM90v"&gt;I know, I know — we’ve given Best Laptop of CES to a freaking Zephyrus G14 for two out of the past three years (and the third one was the Zephyrus G15, which is basically the same thing but slightly bigger). I fully understand if you are frustrated by how terribly predictable we’ve become. But I’m dead serious here — this has the potential to be the best gaming laptop that has ever hit the market. Previous Zephyrus G14 models have spent months at the top of our Best Gaming Laptop list, and that’s with a 16:9 aspect ratio and no webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QCfpzU"&gt;Now, there are still a couple ways Asus and AMD could break my heart. Most notably, they could put some absurdly high price tag on this device. (Please, Asus and AMD, &lt;em&gt;please &lt;/em&gt;do not do me like that.) Alternatively, these new chips could just be bad. I hope they’re not bad, and I don’t expect them to be bad. If they’re good — if they’re even remotely good — this is the laptop of the year. — &lt;em&gt;Monica Chin, reviewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kT_QU_GD_s2lxUHm4OJ8G96GIns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142431/2_way_Stand_A95K.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fezL5m"&gt;Best TV:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="EwzP9v"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865220/sony-a95k-qd-oled-qdoled-4k-tv-announced-features-explainer"&gt;Sony A95K QD-OLED 4K TV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="LbScmR"&gt;It’s not often that we see the debut of a new TV technology at CES that will find its way into actual products that same year, but that’s part of the excitement around Samsung Display’s QD-OLED displays: they’re coming to TVs and PC monitors in 2022. But oddly it’s not Samsung Electronics that’s leading the charge for a QD-OLED TV. Not yet, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AB7abY"&gt;At CES, Sony announced a flagship A95K QD-OLED 4K TV that’ll be available in both 65- and 55-inch sizes. It’ll combine the brand-new displays with Sony’s terrific image processing and best-in-class TV speaker system. And if QD-OLED delivers on its promise, the new TVs could outperform those from LG (and Sony’s own existing sets) at overall brightness, color consistency, and even viewing angles. And considering how phenomenal OLEDs already look, that’s no small feat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQrzOj"&gt;But flashy new tech is always accompanied by a very high price tag. While QD-OLED won’t demand nearly the same premium as something truly next level like Micro LED, it’s still guaranteed to cost significantly more than any 4K OLED TV on the market right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwaBWy"&gt;Will it be worth it? We’ll have to wait to see the A95K in person to know for sure. — &lt;em&gt;Chris Welch, reviewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KCGQKXnTXsJtn2ul1IeZMn0S2V4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146140/Odyssey_Ark_above.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A top-down view of the Ark monitor in landscape orientation lets you really see how aggressive the curve is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WzJksj"&gt;Best Monitor:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Pr7z37"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867790/samsung-odyssey-arc-curved-gaming-monitor"&gt;Samsung Odyssey Ark&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="wjqpjz"&gt;I was ready to write off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867790/samsung-odyssey-arc-curved-gaming-monitor"&gt;the Samsung Odyssey Ark&lt;/a&gt; as just another jaw-droppingly curved screen whose additional gimmick was a swivel so you could turn it on its side. I blame Samsung for that — the company provided only two pictures of this monitor to journalists covering the show remotely, and neither of them actually &lt;em&gt;showed&lt;/em&gt; the damned screen. They only revealed how the monitor curves like a scythe, which would be awesome &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/3/21047322/samsung-odyssey-g9-g7-curved-gaming-monitor-49-inch-qled-display-specs-ces-2020"&gt;if that were new&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkDLmh"&gt;Then, the pictures &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/qbking77/status/1478555909068505088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1478555909068505088%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22867790%2Fsamsung-odyssey-arc-curved-gaming-monitor"&gt;started coming in from the CES 2022 show floor&lt;/a&gt;, and I realized how wrong I was to lump it in with Samsung’s super-ultrawide monitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;like the Odyssey G9&lt;/a&gt;. The reality looks more akin to a cockpit, or a curved wall of surveillance monitors, that can also turn into a single 55-inch curved 4K TV — one that can run games and many films at their preferred 16:9 aspect ratio instead of uncomfortably stretching them across an atypical 32:9 expanse of pixels. The hardware dial to rotate your array of virtual monitors across that wall of screen looks awesome, too, reducing the need to rely on special windowing software to get work done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AWhxD"&gt;I’m deathly afraid of the price tag, given how even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv"&gt;Samsung’s $2,499 Neo G9 turned out to be something of a dud&lt;/a&gt;, but the Odyssey Ark looks destined to take the title of “ultimate monitor” if Samsung doesn’t screw it up. — &lt;em&gt;Sean Hollister, tech reports editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A BMW concept using e-ink to automatically change the paint color on a car from white to black and back again" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X8QFFhh5_RTkvqsw52yugZwPzAM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146442/37_SW_FinBMW_iX_eInk_Seite_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: BMW&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMW’s big reveal was a car that can change its paint to various shades of gray using E Ink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IHc2WE"&gt;Best Concept:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="oSi91o"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867090/bmw-color-changing-paint-electric-car-ces"&gt;E Ink paint found on BWM iX concept car&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="FWfm2l"&gt;A concept, by definition, is just a sketching of a cool future idea. What makes a concept the “best” is an execution. There needs to be more than 3D renders. Even if its just a one-off that’s more smoke and mirrors than reality, a concept needs to be at least a little tangible to get us excited. BMW’s “color changing paint” powered by the same E Ink technology found in the Kindle and Pebble, is tangible. There was a BMW at CES driving around and switching from “black” to “white” with ease. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klwtts/status/1478531775886286848?s=20"&gt;It looked so good&lt;/a&gt; you half wonder when you’ll be able to get a car painted in E Ink. That doesn’t mean it will ever actually come to fruition. E Ink is still a display relying on pigment suspended in liquid. One bad hail storm or a ding in the Walmart parking lot and the very stunning effect produced by this paint is toast. There’s no word on how it would handle the color or the heat. Heck, the stuff is still monochromatic! But imagine a world where E Ink gets good at color. Imagine being able to customize the paint job of your car with your phone instead of going to a guy with a special garage and a whole lot of pigment. That’s undoubtedly cool.

&lt;p id="NmLaJu"&gt;Normally, CES is awash with robot concepts, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16876086/sony-aibo-hands-on-video-ces-2018"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/9/18175168/ces-2019-robots-best-worst-delivery-butler-tablet"&gt;bipedal humanoid vaporware&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21054353/samsung-ballie-robot-ai-assistant-ces-2020"&gt;weird little balls with cameras attached&lt;/a&gt;. This year — with so few people attending — there’s less reason for companies to trot out their ideas for robots. Instead, there was just one robot that stood out and though it is not shipping anytime soon, it’s so simple and practical it has a better shot at becoming real than most of the concepts we see at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEqtus"&gt;It’s called the Labrador Retriever, and it’s simply a shelf on wheels that’s able to navigate around your house. It moves a little slowly, it doesn’t have lidar, but it can open a fridge and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22699251/amazon-astro-robot-cannot-fetch-your-beer"&gt;get you a beer&lt;/a&gt; (though only if you’ve added motors to the fridge door and put the beer on an accessible shelf). It does all this using off-the-shelf technology to solve a real problem: helping people with limited mobility move stuff around their house. Instead of shooting for the stars and landing on its face, Labrador has set an achievable goal to solve a real human need with technology that exists right now. — &lt;em&gt;Dieter Bohn, executive editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="9BuZ9X"&gt;In recent years, Garmin’s done a lot to expand its wearable lineup beyond hardcore athletes. However, its Vivomove line of hybrid analog watches has generally been a weird mishmash of stylish watches that were too expensive for casual users and too casual for serious athletes. It was disappointing, considering how Garmin’s hidden display is among the coolest for hybrid analogs. That’s why the entry-level Vivomove Sport is great. It’s a cute watch, affordably priced at $179.99, and still gets you the bulk of Garmin’s in-depth health and fitness tracking. It’s best suited for casual users, but it finally feels like Garmin’s got the right mix of features, style, and durability. — &lt;em&gt;Victoria Song, reviewer&lt;/em&gt;	&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Masonite door combines multiple smart home gadgets into one front door.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AOvJJh"&gt;Best Gadget for a Smart Home:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="bgZcL1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22858256/masonite-smart-door-ring-yales-ces-2022"&gt;Masonite Smart Door&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="arKi3W"&gt;What I love about the Masonite M-Pwr smart door is that it’s not &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; gadget, it’s &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;the gadgets. This smart door puts every device you need to control the main access point to your home in one. A video doorbell, a smart lock, motion-activated smart lighting, even door sense capability to warn you when it’s left open. And it’s powered by your home, not hundreds of disposable batteries you have to change every six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZd9ga"&gt;While it’s not perfect (who wants to use three apps to control their front door?), it has what CES is all about: a lot of potential. This is just the tip of the iceberg. There’s so much to imagine can be done from here and that’s largely because the M-Pwr is a collaboration between three companies to create a genuinely useful solution for the smart home. Collaboration and interoperability are key to creating the smart homes in which we might one day all live. You could even say they really &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDTuWA"&gt;Currently, the M-Pwr is only available for new homes, so you won’t be able to pop down to Home Depot and buy this anytime soon. Even without the smarts, front doors are expensive (like thousands of dollars expensive). But this type of integrated solution is where the smart home is headed. Sensors, connectivity, and power built into our walls and doors, that’s the home of the future. —&lt;em&gt; Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, reviewer &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="m7GiTZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868410/gm-chevy-equinox-blazer-ev-announced-ces"&gt;Chevy Equinox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="RYFNhv"&gt;There were a surprising number of new EVs announced this year: the ultra-lux, ultra-long-range &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22855555/mercedes-benz-vision-eqxx-ev-range-ces-2022"&gt;Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX&lt;/a&gt;; the very angry-looking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866219/bmw-ix-m60-electric-vehicle-range-specs-date"&gt;BMW iX M60&lt;/a&gt;; the aerodynamic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22862387/chrysler-electric-only-2028-airflow-concept-ces-2022"&gt;Chrysler Airflow&lt;/a&gt;; and, of course, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22863648/chevy-silverado-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;Chevy Silverado EV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P72xq1"&gt;But I’m giving the award for best new EV to a car that not only was announced months before CES but didn’t even physically appear at the show: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868410/gm-chevy-equinox-blazer-ev-announced-ces"&gt;Chevy Equinox&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGvXAj"&gt;There’s a perception that electric vehicles are luxury items, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that most of the new EVs announced over the past few years retail for well over $50,000. So when General Motors CEO Mary Barra said the Equinox, due out in 2023, would come with a $30,000 sticker price, it’s something worth noting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCSWQx"&gt;The Tesla Model 3 was supposed to be the game-changer, and in many ways it was. But the much-hyped $35,000 version only made a brief appearance before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569524/tesla-model-3-35000-price-stop-selling"&gt;vanishing into the good night&lt;/a&gt;. Now the cheapest Model 3 starts at $44,990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYTCVm"&gt;It will take more than one company to turn all 280 million cars and trucks in the US today into EVs. They can’t all be $105,000 trucks or $180,000 sports cars. We need electric Toyota Camrys, electric Kia Rios, and electric Mitsubishi Mirages. We need beaters, jalopies, and clunkers to go along with our sports cars and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;crab-walking Hummers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVsNv8"&gt;The Chevy Equinox is a good start. Let’s just hope GM doesn’t pull some shit and try to sell a $50,000 premium trim before eventually rolling out the base model. — &lt;em&gt;Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung is doing NFTs now because of course it is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yKVeR6"&gt;Most Samsung:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="6BwDI3"&gt;Samsung’s 2022 TV lineup has a lot of good additions (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22858577/samsung-frame-2022-tv-matte-antireflective-screen"&gt;like the Frame’s new matte coating&lt;/a&gt;), some weird additions (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22860390/samsung-eco-remote-2022-solar-rf-harvesting-charging"&gt;like its Wi-Fi harvesting remotes&lt;/a&gt;), and some strangely missing additions (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865220/sony-a95k-qd-oled-qdoled-4k-tv-announced-features-explainer"&gt;like a Samsung-branded set using the company’s new QD-OLED technology&lt;/a&gt;). And then there were the NFTs, which Samsung — for reasons known only to the company — is touting as a key part of its 2022 sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HhTAeN"&gt;Samsung’s NFT support would have been an odd addition if it was just enabling the ability to &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt; an NFT (which, in virtually all the cases that would make sense here, are still images or GIFs). But it’s the sort of thing that almost makes sense, if you squint at it hard enough. Its Frame TVs offer the feature of displaying art as a way to blend into the background, and what are NFTs if not very aesthetically awful and largely algorithmically generated art? But Samsung didn’t stop there. It added the ability to browse and buy NFTs, too. Nothing says a lovely evening on the couch like dropping hundreds of thousands of dollars on a pixelated JPEG using a TV remote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSjUud"&gt;The addition of NFTs to its 2022 CES announcements is quintessentially Samsung: big, flashy, weird, months late to a trend, and likely doomed to end up in the Bixby-sized trash bin of other hype-chasing CES additions. — &lt;em&gt;Chaim Gartenberg, senior reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="nhJz2L"&gt;In Apple’s iPhone XS event in 2018, it had a &lt;em&gt;Mission Impossible&lt;/em&gt;-style opening show to deliver a secret case to CEO Tim Cook… and at the end of the sequence there was a locked door that the agent could not access. Then up comes Apple VP of technology Kevin Lynch, who opens the door with an Apple Watch tap. Since then, the ability to actually unlock a door with just an Apple Watch has been close to impossible, but with the Schlage Encode Plus door lock it could be finally easy to live that dream. It’s the first deadbolt that supports Apple’s Home Key door access feature. It’s also good looking with various finishes and has an integrated keypad for more unlock options. — &lt;em&gt;Umar Shakir, Verge fellow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An OLED TV for smaller rooms, finally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wPuM7D"&gt;Best Thing We’ve Always Wanted and Was Finally Announced:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="9aCDi7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features"&gt;LG C Series 42-inch OLED&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="DuMc2T"&gt;LG finally gave us the smaller flagship OLED that we’ve wanted since it released the not too big but not terribly compact &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21051516/lg-new-oled-4k-8k-tv-gx-cx-bx-ces-2020"&gt;48-inch TV in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwQd0u"&gt;There are plenty of reasons for wanting a smaller, yet still high-end TV. At &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a lot of us dream about using it as a gaming monitor, and who could blame us? OLED looks stunning, and its fast pixel response times stack with the TV’s 120Hz refresh rate to make a gaming experience that feels buttery smooth (if you’ve got the hardware to run it). But that dream has always &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv"&gt;been slightly out of reach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJvuUA"&gt;Of course, gaming isn’t the only thing you’d want a 42-inch TV for. Some of us have pined for one because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640058/lg-42-inch-oled-tv-panel-delayed-ces-2022"&gt;we want a high-end TV that can fit in a small space&lt;/a&gt; or that won’t dominate a living room. Forty-eight inches felt close but not quiiite there (kind of like the iPhone 11 Pro did before the 12 Mini came out). Will 42 inches fit that sweet spot? Only time will tell, but there are a lot of people here who are at least considering finding out for themselves. — &lt;em&gt;Mitchell Clark, news writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TP-Link router that moves its antennas is most definitely a gimmick, but a cool gimmick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VDgE3t"&gt;Best Gimmick:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="yCuKwS"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22858926/tp-link-archer-axe200-omni-wifi-6e-ces-2022"&gt;TP-Link Archer AXE200 Omni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="wpcfMs"&gt;Does it actually matter which way you point the antennas on your router? After years of fiddling and even &lt;a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/455/"&gt;relying&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/answers/4-wi-fi-tips-from-former-apple-wi-fi-engineer"&gt;expert advice&lt;/a&gt;, I’m not sure, but a router that does the work on its own might be the best choice. The Archer AXE200 has four motorized blades that seek out the best signal possible, and even if that never adds a single megabit to download speeds, it looks cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUUOfw"&gt;Beyond the motorized party trick, the router is also ready for Wi-Fi 6E with a 6GHz radio on board, so there’s at least one legitimate reason to make the upgrade. Still, it’s probably better if I skip this one — I’ll burn those motors out within a week at the maximum. — &lt;em&gt;Richard Lawler, senior news editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="jf0as4"&gt;Best Thing We’d Buy If the Price Was Right:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="47Ky3z"&gt;Against the advice of my hair dressers, I bleached and dyed my own hair several times during quarantine. It left my sparkling white bathroom a poor imitation of a purple-and-pink Jackson Pollock painting. That’d have been fine if the result was nice. Reader, it was patchy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ld6zj1"&gt;That’s why I’m stoked about the L’Oreal ColorSonic. Even color application by brushing a gadget through your hair? Even a dingus like me can do that. Replaceable cartridges that can be used multiple times and wastes a lot less plastic? Sign me up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNzCOQ"&gt;Sure, I could go to a professional at a salon. But the last time I went I was quoted $600 and it wasn’t even at a super fancy place. Doing it at home is a pain, but it’s also under $100, and under $50 for touchups. I would, however, happily pay more for a gadget to make the process easier. We don’t know how much the ColorSonic will cost, but L’Oreal told me it’s set to launch under the L’Oreal Paris brand and is supposed to be the sort of hair care gadget you can buy at Target. I would 100 percent plunk down my hard-earned moolah if the price was right (aka, less than $600).  — &lt;em&gt;Victoria Song, reviewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865673/samsung-freestyle-portable-lifestyle-projector-not-olds"&gt;Samsung Freestyle Projector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="0XvBAk"&gt;Portable projectors aren’t anything new, but Samsung’s new Freestyle looks so fun and easy that it’s an immediate standout at CES 2022. It’s small enough that you can take it anywhere, making the potential use cases seem endless. Whether you want to stream Netflix on your ceiling, bring it on a camping trip, or use the Freestyle as a projector for your PC or laptop, it’s all doable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYlSAV"&gt;You can set the picture size anywhere between 30 and 100 inches. And the device automatically makes sure you’re getting the best image with auto-focus and auto-leveling. It comes with what Samsung claims is a “powerful” 360-degree speaker, and since it runs the same platform as the company’s smart TVs, you should be able to install a ton of apps on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MFHY7"&gt;Samsung seems determined to make the Freestyle &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than a mere projector; it’s also launching accessories that convert it into a moody smart light, as well as an adapter for plugging it right into a light socket for easy power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SY9ZCj"&gt;The Freestyle has all the makings of a fun-as-hell gadget. But the hurdle it’s facing is its price. At $899, it might be positioned in an awkward spot: too expensive for a fun toy and too cheap to cut it as a truly solid projector. — &lt;em&gt;Chris Welch, reviewer &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the Awesome Games Done Quick 2022 speedrunning marathon</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5JIRS1"&gt;Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ), the annual week-long speedrunning marathon for charity, kicks off on Sunday, and if this year’s schedule is anything to go by, the event promises to be another exciting event of jaw-dropping gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHwVRq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule"&gt;The lineup for this year&lt;/a&gt; has a great mix of old and new games that players will try to beat as fast as they possibly can. I’m personally excited to see &lt;em&gt;Chicory: A Colorful Tale&lt;/em&gt; beat in 35 minutes, &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; finished in just over an hour and a half, and the original &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; finished in an hour and 17 minutes on Legendary. Some of the races look like they could be great to watch, too, like the 26-minute three-way &lt;em&gt;Diddy Kong Racing&lt;/em&gt; race. (Will they &lt;a href="https://www.ignboards.com/threads/the-first-race-against-wizpig-in-diddy-kong-racing-n64-is-ing-impossible.178241589/"&gt;beat Wizpig&lt;/a&gt;? Tune in to find out.) And one of the final runs could be one of the event’s best: the hard-as-nails &lt;em&gt;Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice&lt;/em&gt; will be completed &lt;em&gt;blindfolded&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2RMe3"&gt;AGDQ 2022, which is online-only this year, kicks off on January 9th at 12PM ET, where it will be &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick"&gt;streamed live on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. It’s scheduled to end just after midnight ET on January 16th. Donations will benefit the Prevent Cancer Foundation; last year, the event raised more than $2.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Signal is playing with fire</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Signal logo seen in the..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3z-UB_XxfQEx1b7wbeTEgfGoRvM=/0x1:5000x3334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70360005/1230608869.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XHfG0y"&gt;Today, let’s talk about a little-discussed story that I worry could someday have big implications: the encrypted messaging app Signal’s introduction of anonymous cryptocurrency payments, and the opportunity it could create for regulators around the world who have been looking for an excuse to eliminate end-to-end encryption altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0M3oB"&gt;A year ago, &lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt; was the first to report that &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/-the-battle-inside-signal"&gt;Signal was considering adding cryptocurrency payments to the platform&lt;/a&gt;, and it started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370213/signal-payments-cryptocurrency-crypto-mobilecoin-wallet-mob-beta-feature"&gt;with MobileCoin&lt;/a&gt;. Signal CEO Moxie Marlinspike has served as an adviser to the MobileCoin cryptocurrency, which is built on the Stellar blockchain and is designed to make payments as anonymous as cash. As &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; described it in 2017, “&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/"&gt;the idea of MobileCoin is to build a system that hides everything from everyone&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0a11u2"&gt;Last year, Marlinspike told me Signal had merely begun some “design explorations” around a MobileCoin integration. “If we did decide we wanted to put payments into Signal, we would try to think really carefully about how we did that,” Marlinspike told me. “It’s hard to be totally hypothetical.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFFLrm"&gt;But in fact, work to integrate MobileCoin was already well underway — just as nervous employees had told me at the time. Signal &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-mobilecoin-payments-messaging-cryptocurrency/"&gt;announced a test of the integration in the United Kingdom in the spring&lt;/a&gt;, and it quietly rolled out to the rest of the world in mid-November. (The company’s typically chatty blog &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/"&gt;had nothing to say about it&lt;/a&gt;.) Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-mobilecoin-cryptocurrency-payments/"&gt;Andy Greenberg in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2znYO"&gt;MobileCoin founder Josh Goldbard confirmed the timing of the rollout, and says that it spurred massive adoption of the cryptocurrency, which now sees thousands of daily transactions versus just dozens before the global beta release. “There are over a hundred million devices on planet Earth right now that have the ability to turn on MobileCoin and send an end-to-end encrypted payment in five seconds or less,” Goldbard says, referencing reports of Signal’s&lt;a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/signal-statistics/"&gt; total download numbers&lt;/a&gt;. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80jWKe"&gt;Signal itself didn’t respond to &lt;em&gt;Wired’s&lt;/em&gt; requests for comment on the global rollout of the payments feature. But last April, Signal creator Moxie Marlinspike &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-mobilecoin-payments-messaging-cryptocurrency/"&gt;explained to WIRED&lt;/a&gt; that he wanted to add payments to the encrypted video-calling and texting app to match features from rivals like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger—while also bringing Signal’s lauded privacy protections to monetary transactions. “I would like to get to a world where not only can you feel [a sense of privacy] when you talk to your therapist over Signal, but also when you pay your therapist for the session over Signal,” Marlinspike said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="d6lLs0"&gt;There’s nothing sinister about putting payments into a messaging app, and Signal is not alone in adding crypto payments to messaging: the company formerly known as Facebook has undertaken a multiyear effort to create &lt;a href="https://www.diem.com/en-us/"&gt;a new currency&lt;/a&gt; and integrate it with WhatsApp and Messenger. What sets Signal’s effort apart is the combination of end-to-end encryption in messaging &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a cryptocurrency with privacy features designed to make any transactions anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VdZxnP"&gt;Last year, current and former Signal employees told me they were worried about what that combination would bring to the app. Anonymous transactions would likely attract criminals, they told me, and that in turn would attract regulatory scrutiny. Given that end-to-end encryption already faces legal challenges around the globe, they said, Signal’s addition of anonymous payments was a needless provocation. And it could give more ammunition to lawmakers who want to end encryption as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNWCYs"&gt;To make my own feelings clear: I’m in favor of end-to-end encryption, because in a world of ubiquitous surveillance and rising authoritarianism, I think it’s important that truly private communication systems are widely available. But I also support anti-money-laundering and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer"&gt;Know Your Customer&lt;/a&gt; (KYC) laws, which are useful in combating terrorists, murder-for-hire plotters, and other harms. If messaging apps are going to add crypto payments, it seems to me they at least ought to do so in a way that is consistent with those laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UUI7X"&gt;Other supporters of end-to-end encryption have privately lobbied Signal to be more cautious about its payment plans, I’m told. But Signal, which is funded by a nonprofit organization and relies on donations, has forged ahead anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2O145j"&gt;The question is how regulators might respond. India is already trying to implement &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/07/indias-draconian-rules-internet-platforms-threaten-user-privacy-and-undermine"&gt;rules that would require any messages sent on the internet to be “traceable,”&lt;/a&gt; effectively breaking encryption. Meta-owned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454381/whatsapp-indian-government-traceability-lawsuit-break-encryption-privacy"&gt;WhatsApp sued the Indian government last year&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the rules from taking effect; the case is still pending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zijjVW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the addition of pseudo-anonymous money transfer functions greatly increases their legal attack surface”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VXMsLO"&gt;The European Union &lt;a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/12/14/encryption-council-adopts-resolution-on-security-through-encryption-and-security-despite-encryption/"&gt;is also considering ways&lt;/a&gt; to limit or break encryption outright, if somewhat less aggressively than India is. In the United States, the encryption debate has essentially reached a stalemate: there are occasional calls for companies to introduce backdoors for law enforcement, particularly after high-profile crimes, but lawmakers have not pursued legislation on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPbrai"&gt;But the United States &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have anti-money-laundering and KYC laws. At the moment, you can’t buy MobileCoin from a US-based IP address. But the risk is that prosecutors could still use existing laws to put pressure on encryption — first on Signal, and perhaps later around the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUnl3w"&gt;“Signal and WhatsApp have effectively protected end-to-end encryption from multiple legal attacks at the state and federal level,” said Alex Stamos, who worked on encryption issues while serving as Facebook’s chief security officer. “But the addition of pseudo-anonymous money transfer functions greatly increases their legal attack surface, while creating the possibility of real-life harms (extortion, drug sales, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography"&gt;CSAM&lt;/a&gt; sales) that will harm them in court, legislatures and public opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIQs6S"&gt;Stamos predicted that a new attack on encryption could come from a state regulator, such as New York’s Department of Financial Services, using existing regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcsAEk"&gt;“In the US, the addition of payment functionality probably gives anti-encryption forces their best chance, as the First Amendment has never protected the anonymity of the movement of money, and payment processors have very serious federal and state laws they must comply with,” Stamos said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8nl0s"&gt;Signal did not respond to a request for comment. As for MobileCoin, a FAQ page on its website says this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bDSFGQ"&gt;People and entities misuse all types of financial platforms and instruments. Outside the US, MobileCoin can be purchased at &lt;a href="https://www.buymobilecoin.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.buymobilecoin.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which applies best practices of financial institutions around the world to prevent bad actors from obtaining MobileCoin. Any third-party entities that buy, sell, or trade MobileCoin apply their own standards and practices to vet persons or entities trying to purchase MobileCoin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wn0ood"&gt;For its part, the foundation now running Diem — the oft-rebranded, Facebook-created cryptocurrency — &lt;a href="https://www.diem.com/en-us/compliance-consumer-protection/"&gt;has committed to following anti-money-laundering laws&lt;/a&gt;. WhatsApp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825766/whatsapp-novi-digital-payments-us-pilot-paxos-stablecoin"&gt;launched a cryptocurrency payments test&lt;/a&gt; last month, though in keeping with the cursed nature of the project, Diem is not yet available on that platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLBigk"&gt;There are plenty of ways Signal could still head off any conflict with regulators. MobileCoin could add KYC features, or Signal could replace it with a more compliant currency. But little that the company has said or done over the past year suggests that it intends to do either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgElam"&gt;If that’s the case, then backers of encryption can only hope that any fallout from Signal’s choices won’t harm end-to-end encryption more broadly. Given the threats private messaging faces already, a high-profile fight over money laundering is the last thing we need.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ ROG Flow Z13 is a Surface Pro for gamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Flow Z13 in laptop mode on a small table. The screen displays the ROG logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yaDfY4jkAPe8ZzvWEk4C_5a-xOo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359985/akrales_220106_4956_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look familiar?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3jwA7c"&gt;Asus has announced its ROG Flow Z13, which it’s touting as the “world’s most powerful gaming tablet.” Yes, you read that correctly — it’s a tablet for gaming. Not mobile gaming, but PC gaming. It’s got an RTX 3050 Ti inside, and you can hook it up to Asus’ ROG XG Mobile external GPU for even more frames. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vt4ReS"&gt;I will caveat right off the bat that we don’t have a price for this thing yet, and it doesn’t seem like the type of thing we can expect to be super affordable, especially if you tack on the XG Mobile. Asus’ last crack at this sort of form factor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/7/18168263/asus-rog-mothership-surface-pro-gaming-laptop-zephyrus-s-gx701-ces-2019"&gt;ROG Mothership&lt;/a&gt;, started at $5,499. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9AmRP"&gt;But even if this ends up being a luxury product, it may be a glimpse into a form factor that will eventually make its way to a more accessible tier (as we’re starting to see with, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285164/asus-zenbook-duo-review-screenpad-plus-dual-screen-laptop-specs-freatures-price"&gt;dual-screen devices&lt;/a&gt;). We’ll find out more when the device is released in “Q1/Q2 2022.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Flow Z13 in laptop mode seen from the back with the kickstand out." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SSw7vLDXakEQ9j6HVCxNQj2t-wU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23151128/akrales_220106_4956_0078.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kickstand, activate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sKHq2m"&gt;Anyway, if you saw this device and thought, “Wow, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review"&gt;Surface Pro&lt;/a&gt;,” you’re not alone. After spending a bit of time with the ROG Flow Z13, I can confirm that it also feels like using a Surface Pro. It’s got a kickstand and a detachable keyboard, which pops on and off with little effort. It’s a generally nice-looking and well-made device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsl7U8"&gt;A couple things that might not be apparent from the pictures. First, it’s big. The primary benefit of these detachable devices is generally how thin and light they are. This thing is 2.43 pounds and 0.47 inches thick. It’s a chunky tablet, is what I’m saying — it’s a very different experience from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;using an iPad&lt;/a&gt; of any size, and it’s not something I’d want to necessarily carry around the house or hold while I was giving a presentation. (It’s still quite compact compared to the 10.5-pound Mothership, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhQNVL"&gt;Second, the keyboard is quite flexible. This was a problem I had with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10"&gt;earlier Surface Pro models&lt;/a&gt;, though Microsoft’s stiffened it up on the latest one. I have a light keystroke already, but each of my taps depressed this detachable deck. I’m not someone who normally notices keyboard flex at all, but even I was a little unnerved by how much this one was bouncing up and down all day. I’d probably recommend that people who really want sturdy keyboard decks wait for the next generation. With that said, I did really enjoy typing on this thing because the keys have a wild amount of travel (1.7mm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPiKU9"&gt;Elsewhere, I didn’t have too many complaints. The 13-inch, 3840 x 2400 touch display looked good and was responsive. There’s also a useful port selection (which you rarely see on these kinds of products) that includes a USB-C with Thunderbolt 4 and DisplayPort 1.4, a USB-A, and a microSD slot in addition to a headphone jack. Connecting the XG Mobile (which can now offer an AMD Radeon RX 6850M XT as well as a GeForce RTX 3080) will add a bunch more, including another DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.1, and RJ-45 Ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Flow Z13 closed, seen from above, on a wooden table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cVWro3vzqpGg86Q8JR0cbOmrd4o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23151126/akrales_220106_4956_0073.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neat little cover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Flow Z13 keyboard illuminated in red." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rgV19qVXs4NgreYKxtLloul8Jg4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23151122/akrales_220106_4956_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s even some RGB (well, R, at least).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TYlAeb"&gt;The factor that will make or break this device, of course, in addition to the price, is framerates. The Flow Z13 has up to a 12th Gen Intel Core i9-12900H, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage in addition to the RTX 3050 Ti. The Core i9 is the biggest unknown there — last year’s ROG attempt at a gaming ultraportable, the convertible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22249408/asus-rog-flow-x13-review-price-specs-features"&gt;ROG Flow X13&lt;/a&gt;, had a monstrous AMD processor inside, and we don’t know yet how this new Core i9 will compare. The X13’s battery life also wasn’t particularly good, so that’s a question mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pQ7z4"&gt;The Z13 does have an advantage over traditional clamshell laptops in that its bottom half isn’t pressed against the table. In theory, this could give it more room for cooling (and the Mothership &lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/asus-rog-mothership"&gt;ran cooler&lt;/a&gt; than many of its competitors). The device was noticeably warm during much of my non-gaming use, but I didn’t hear fans running. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Flow Z13 closed, upside-down, seen from above on a wooden table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8u6yblf8OAPM7zcypoLsUbt5B_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23151129/akrales_220106_4956_0096.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See you soon, Flow Z13.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Aspl3y"&gt;All told, the fact that there’s a tablet you can game on, and that it actually seems to work, is cool. It was a fun device to use, and I’m all for powerful devices getting thinner and lighter without needing to compromise everything else that laptop users want. The detachable form factor, if this year’s CES is anything to go by, seems like a strategy manufacturers are seeing as a viable way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Norton Crypto promises to turn your computer’s idle time into cash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q5Tvrk"&gt;Norton is facing criticism for including a crypto miner alongside its Norton 360 security software. Activists like Cory Doctorow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1478479483585933312"&gt;have claimed&lt;/a&gt; that the company “sneakily installs cryptomining software on your computer” and skims a commission on profits, and outlets like &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/hard-to-delete-cryptocurrency-miner-irks-norton-360-users"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Mag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/norton-360-now-comes-with-a-cryptominer/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krebs on Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/no-easy-way-to-uninstall-norton-crypto/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Trends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have also written about users expressing frustration trying to uninstall it. While there’s more than a grain of truth to these claims, we dug into it ourselves and found they’re being blown out of proportion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWpLRM"&gt;Last summer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/6/2/22465862/norton-360-crypto-mining-ethereum-coinbase"&gt;Norton very publicly announced&lt;/a&gt; it was adding a crypto miner to its Norton 360 security suite, pitching it as a safer alternative to trying to install complex, “unvetted” mining programs from the internet. It was initially only available to a limited number of users, but now seems to be available to anyone who installs the program — but in the six or so months since the announcement, there hasn’t been much discussion about the software until this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P7aOXE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is fucking wild. Norton "Antivirus" now sneakily installs cryptomining software on your computer, and then SKIMS A COMMISSION. &lt;a href="https://t.co/6s2otyCd78"&gt;https://t.co/6s2otyCd78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cory Doctorow (@doctorow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1478479483585933312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O5L9Z0"&gt;Now, it’s suddenly the center of a backlash, with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mAxius/status/1476968324672204801"&gt;some Twitter users&lt;/a&gt; accusing Norton of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnCalafin/status/1478214882281484288"&gt;installing a crypto miner on users’ computers&lt;/a&gt; without any warning. In a very technical sense, that’s true — my colleague Sean Hollister installed a copy of Norton 360 for himself and did indeed find that the mining app NCrypt.exe was included in the program’s directory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y19oj6"&gt;However, that doesn’t mean that Norton will automatically start mining on your computer, as some seem to believe. &lt;a href="https://support.norton.com/sp/en/aa/home/current/solutions/v138473899"&gt;Norton’s FAQ&lt;/a&gt; says that it won’t mine without permission and that “in addition to having a device that meets system requirements, you must also turn on Norton Crypto on your device.” Sean says that as far as he could tell, this appeared to be true; the feature didn’t surreptitiously activate after he installed Norton. It didn’t open until he asked it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3z4iT"&gt;The TL;DR is that yes, Norton does install a crypto miner with its software, without making that clear in the initial setup process. But it isn’t going to do anything unless you specifically opt in, so it’s not a situation where you’ll install the security suite and instantly start seeing your computer lag as it crunches crypto in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pUL3JA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can delete NCrypt.exe if you turn off the tamper protection feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dhOKY1"&gt;A NortonLifeLock spokesperson also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that you can completely remove NCrypt.exe by &lt;a href="https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/norton-360/current/solutions/v44151491"&gt;temporarily turning off Norton’s tamper protection feature&lt;/a&gt;, and then deleting the executable. We confirmed that ourselves, and it could be good news for anyone worried about Norton remotely activating the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1y7fr"&gt;We asked Norton if it would make a pledge that the feature would always be opt-in, and spokesperson Spring Harris told us that “[the] feature requires special device hardware and user consent to function. We are transparent about how our software performs on user devices and we have no intention of changing this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0amq8"&gt;None of this is to defend Norton’s inclusion of a crypto miner in its security suite — it’s simply to explain what is and isn’t happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDVIt9"&gt;As mentioned before, we installed Norton ourselves to get first-hand experience with the miner. While the service may be opt-in, Norton isn’t making it hard to find — when Sean installed the software, its control panel had a big green banner at the top with the text “Turn your PC’s idle time into cash.” Clicking the “show me how” button shows you a slideshow about the feature, a large “Agree and get started” button, and some smaller text letting you know that the feature you’re turning on is Norton Crypto.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Norton Crypto isn’t a hard feature to find.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mkxq4e_Zeh0T3c2NgI_xZ8J3waY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23150457/NortonSecurity_nGJT60fR6n.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Norton promises that it’ll only mine when you’re not otherwise using your computer (and you can manually pause it if need be).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VU9nwC"&gt;After you turn on Norton Crypto, it’ll set up a wallet for you, and immediately start using your computer’s GPU to mine Ethereum (its &lt;a href="https://support.norton.com/sp/en/aa/home/current/solutions/v133891548"&gt;system requirements&lt;/a&gt; say you need an Nvidia or AMD card with at least 6GB of memory). Any earnings will be periodically deposited in the wallet set up for you, and &lt;a href="https://community.norton.com/en/forums/my-crypto-wallet-doesnt-allow-me-withdraw"&gt;once you reach a minimum threshold&lt;/a&gt; you’ll be able to withdraw your earnings to Coinbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9skDm"&gt;Norton has incentive to get people using the feature. As &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/hands-on-with-norton-antivirus-ethereum-mining-the-good-and-the-bad/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BleepingComputer&lt;/em&gt; pointed out when it tried the software last year&lt;/a&gt;, Norton takes a whopping 15 percent of any earnings you make from mining. Without diving too deep into how mining works, Norton Crypto’s &lt;a href="https://www.nortonlifelock.com/content/dam/nortonlifelock/pdfs/eulas/licensing-agreement/NC-EAP-terms-en.pdf"&gt;terms of service&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) say it’s running a mining pool, which combines everybody’s computing power to increase the chances of mining a block — when that happens, everybody who contributed power gets a share of the reward. It’s that reward from which Norton is taking its cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVDpxV"&gt;Pool operators do often take a cut or fee for bringing everyone together. However, the fees are usually closer to 1 or 2 percent, which is obviously significantly lower. And, of course, there’s the elephant in the room: anyone using Norton’s software to mine has already paid the company a subscription fee for its security software (and after we purchased a copy, we &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;had to provide our payment information so that it could automatically renew itself every year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C8vw1h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Our tests pretty much exactly broke even when factoring in electricity costs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NvlSP4"&gt;Is the reward from mining good enough that you can ignore the high fees, or consider them a convenience cost for not having to figure out how to join a pool on your own (which is usually a reasonably technical process)? We tried it out for ourselves, measuring electricity consumption using a Kill-A-Watt power meter. The results? With the current difficulty of mining a block and Ethereum prices, we completely broke even for what we earned versus what we paid for power. In real numbers, a night of mining on an RTX 3060 Ti netted $0.66 cents worth of Ethereum and cost $0.66 in off-peak electricity. Norton took all the profit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uU6KilRNACTaBQkBbaOCyaEeWgs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23151249/image__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Norton tells you how much you’ve earned and gives you projected earnings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gkqDMe"&gt;Given &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s policy against holding cryptocurrency, we’ll be immediately divesting the fraction of an ETH we earned in our test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k93205"&gt;Even if you had stronger mining hardware and cheaper electricity, Norton’s model could end up being a rough deal. It deposits your cut of Ethereum into your Norton Crypto wallet, but if you want to use it or exchange it for fiat currency you’ll have to cash it out — currently, the only option for that is by transferring it to a Coinbase account. However, doing so will incur a transaction fee (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800995/constitutiondao-refund-progress-steep-gas-fees-cryptocurrency"&gt;also known as a gas fee&lt;/a&gt;) that’s charged by the Ethereum network itself. That could mean that you’d have to mine a lot of crypto before it’d make financial sense to withdraw it from your Norton wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqB0NJ"&gt;The deal looks a lot better from Norton’s end, though — as is often the case with crypto, scale is key here. While using the feature may not be particularly profitable for any one individual, if a lot of people try it out, Norton’s cut could add up to a significant sum. Whether it’ll be enough to make up for the PR hit the company’s taken from this feature is hard to say — but even ignoring Twitter, the users on &lt;a href="https://community.norton.com/en/forums/norton-crypto"&gt;Norton’s own Crypto forum&lt;/a&gt; don’t seem to be particularly happy with how it’s been going.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Justice Department cracks down on Amazon sellers’ DVD price-fixing scheme</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AethyZZGLWMyzWFi9vl4xJ5LPE0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359783/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hz30yV"&gt;The Justice Department has charged three men with a DVD and Blu-ray price-fixing operation run through the Amazon Marketplace. The men — Morris Sutton, Emmanuel Hourizadeh, and Raymond Nouvahian — &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-amazon-marketplace-sellers-plead-guilty-price-fixing-dvds-and-blu-ray-discs-ongoing"&gt;pleaded guilty yesterday&lt;/a&gt; to violating criminal antitrust laws under the Sherman Act for a scheme that lasted from 2017 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MUvdF"&gt;Sutton, Hourizadeh, and Nouvahian collaborated with each other (as well as other unnamed parties, at least one of which has also pleaded guilty) across several US states to make buyers pay more for movie discs from Amazon’s third-party Marketplace storefronts. A &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.tned.102099/gov.uscourts.tned.102099.4.0.pdf"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.tned.102053/gov.uscourts.tned.102053.4.0.pdf"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.tned.102100/gov.uscourts.tned.102100.6.0.pdf"&gt;plea&lt;/a&gt; agreements offer a few more details about the plot, which resulted in Sutton selling at least $360,000 worth of DVDs and Blu-rays over the course of two years while Hourizadeh and Nouvahian took in at least $1.1 million. The conspirators communicated with each other to eliminate competition and raise prices, a legal violation that carries up to 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joDqWG"&gt;In a statement, Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter called the plea deals part of a larger commitment to protecting competition in online sales. “As American consumers increasingly turn to e-commerce, it is critically important to deter, detect and prosecute crimes that prevent fair and open competition in online marketplaces,” said Kanter. “These charges demonstrate the Antitrust Division’s continued commitment to prosecuting anticompetitive conduct wherever it may occur.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9murR"&gt;Kanter is known as a prominent critic of potentially monopolistic online platforms. Before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786079/google-jonathan-kanter-justice-department-antitrust-division-facebook-lina-khan"&gt;being confirmed&lt;/a&gt; as the antitrust division head in President Joe Biden’s Justice Department, he represented Yelp and Microsoft in cases alleging anti-competitive behavior by Google, and alongside Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, he’s presided over government antitrust investigations of several “Big Tech” companies. The Amazon price-fixing charges illustrate another avenue for the department to crack down on pieces of these platforms, even when the companies behind them aren’t directly implicated.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: CES 2022 favorites, vaporware, and what may actually ship </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VhQnBShO9e1Df4Rzg5pLlHRJMVM=/144x0:759x410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359512/BMW_E_Ink.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cCaoMM"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdtL0C"&gt;Today, we published the first &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; of 2022 — and we’re starting off strong with a 90-minute show on nearly everything we saw from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces"&gt;Consumer Electronics Show this week&lt;/a&gt;. In what turned out to be a pretty decent CES (without even being there in person), Nilay, Dieter, and Alex Cranz run through all the gadgets, TVs, cars, and computers that point toward the future of consumer technology and some perhaps that were just an art installation or vaporware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RSzc7w"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP6433499017&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n8ai3g"&gt;There’s a whole lot discussed on this week’s show, so listen here or in your preferred podcast player to catch up on what you may have missed this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydUY8P"&gt;Keep listening for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s pick for best gadget at CES. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Swiss Army drops WhatsApp for homegrown messaging service, citing privacy concerns </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A picture of the Swiss flag" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OhuKDk_XlnceKx98nH6_O-GYLn0=/0x151:2048x1516/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359418/2346228148_28b0bacd6b_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://flickr.com/photos/jamescridland/2346228148/in/photolist-4zk2Ts-YFyXYj-5PyiGh-4UTMTp-ee5Kqj-wctj-bdfPTD-6H1nC5-XTC62M-9EnAV4-9dX9aG-df4Sv9-df4Sis-df4S86-8LMXY2-Grqrf-ACBYKP-2inhX8t-fjJqdd-C16UYo-B2wjBx-kfGuN-B2uciD-2jQA65h-2k7Si9A-C16tKY-4JZNiE-qHFJaq-4jEwh2-2mFKTu9-2iYUPmR-2jtQWSC-5KdrW9-WHvEVu-ceZfKj-ePcd4N-5jGKWU-5Aca3X-aDc1Wz-4JxkGu-2hG8fKh-2m6xrJg-2k4hXpi-4tMNHV-t8tab-gzdxv-gzd9j-nZh5XT-76kMDS-p3Q7gk" target="_blank"&gt;James Cridland / Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xurKRk"&gt;The Swiss army has banned the use of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, and other foreign encrypted messaging services by army personnel, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-europe-army-instant-messaging-d3c7c8fd54a78e8cc17fe930014d92d2"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, and instructed staff to use the Swiss-made Threema app instead. The announcement was made in a letter sent to top army staff in December, citing privacy concerns based on US authorities’ ability to access data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LX3EB0"&gt;The original letter reportedly told army chiefs that “no other messaging service will be authorized,” although a spokesperson subsequently seemed to tone down the strength of the decree, describing it to the &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; as a “recommendation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YfzNH"&gt;The primary concern seems to be the ability of authorities in Washington to access data stored by companies that fall under US jurisdiction, as &lt;a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/questions-to-ask-for-compliance-with-the-eu-gdpr-and-the-u-s-cloud-act/"&gt;described in the US CLOUD Act&lt;/a&gt;. The CLOUD Act obliges service providers under US jurisdiction to comply with search warrants, regardless of where servers are located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAhkBE"&gt;As a Swiss company with no servers hosted in the US, Threema would not be obliged to respond to such search warrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyRTPT"&gt;Given the strong privacy protections mandated by European GDPR regulations, privacy advocates and multinational corporations alike had hoped that records stored in the EU would be outside the purview of the US court system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKzHh8"&gt;However, in January 2020, a New York federal judge ruled that &lt;a href="https://www.crowelldatalaw.com/2020/01/burden-of-compliance-with-foreign-data-privacy-laws-does-not-justify-withholding-of-banking-records/"&gt;compliance with foreign privacy laws did not negate an obligation to produce documents in discovery&lt;/a&gt;, in a case related to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256407/telegram-cryptocurrency-shutdown-sec-gram"&gt;SEC’s pursuit of the Telegram messaging app&lt;/a&gt; for not adequately registering its cryptocurrency token sale.&lt;/p&gt;
