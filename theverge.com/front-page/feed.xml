    <title>Twitter brings NFTs to the timeline as hexagon-shaped profile pictures</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter NFT profile pictures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YEFh1Ul4rSgI6PGU7Y1NnVIRDeI=/66x0:1292x817/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413202/twitter_nft_hex.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter NFT profile pictures&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0WEXJy"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689806/twitter-bitcoin-lightning-tipping-nft-authentication"&gt;said in September&lt;/a&gt; that it would add a way for users to authenticate non-fungible tokens (NFT), and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1484226494708662273"&gt;now the feature is live&lt;/a&gt; — if you pay for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us"&gt;$2.99 Twitter Blue subscription&lt;/a&gt; and are using an iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jaqDlppdRPR0r8e0kb-WjRJ-wZ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182610/twitter_nft.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twitter animation showing the transition from regular profile picture to NFT-enabled soft hexagon" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EZyHXf9prLN8HoXNRjLlgpxxtpM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182589/twitter_nft_gif.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dv2qfL"&gt;On one hand, NFT profile pictures could be viewed as an incredible technology integration adding real utility for verified digital items. Alternately, it’s an unmissable signal pointing out the people that you should block or mute before they try to sell you some of their blockchain receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPWXuT"&gt;No matter what your opinion of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829383/matrix-nft-keanu-reeves-interview-carrie-ann-moss"&gt;easily reproduced&lt;/a&gt; digital trinkets is, Twitter is integrating them in a way that separates ridiculous images of cartoon apes that have been right-clicked from ridiculous images of cartoon apes that are connected to blockchain tokens by adding a special “soft hexagon” shape around them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwtH4B"&gt;At launch, Twitter is supporting several crypto wallets that users can connect to their profiles and verify that their tokens are of the no-fungible variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="la8n6r"&gt;Argent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="w7DhB0"&gt;Coinbase Wallet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ld2BLx"&gt;Ledger Live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yGHwCU"&gt;MetaMask&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sfF0Mi"&gt;Rainbow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2obJCp"&gt;Trust Wallet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="oh8au7"&gt;However, one side effect of limiting its interaction with the blockchain to a list of approved sources means that information on who owns what is not as decentralized as you may think. As researcher Jane Manchun Wong &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1484191510455533569?s=21"&gt;noted earlier Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, a database outage &lt;a href="https://status.opensea.io/incidents/88862t31ybw5"&gt;that knocked the OpenSea API offline for a few hours&lt;/a&gt; caused Twitter’s NFT collection pages to lose their information too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="DIU8cn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XbC9Zv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-labs#nft"&gt;This FAQ explains the process&lt;/a&gt; (while trying to make sure NFT owners avoid clicking a phishing link instead of Twitter’s official ones, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/7/22870912/nft-communities-boom-discord-hackers-cryptocurrency-webhooks"&gt;an all-too-frequent vector for NFT theft&lt;/a&gt;), and answers the question of what happens if you sell the NFT that’s in your picture. As it turns out, Twitter will continue to display the image, regardless of what the blockchain has to say about who owns it, however, it will revert to a common circle frame instead of the special crypto wallet-only hexagon shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sw6djT"&gt;If you see someone flashing one of these images and need to know more about their items, you can click on the hexagon profile pic. select ViewNFT details and find out information about the “NFT owner, NFT description, collection, properties, and additional details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TQLPK4"&gt;

Follow these simple steps to connect your crypto wallet and let’s see your NFT PFPs! &lt;a href="https://t.co/epSL7VXG5o"&gt;pic.twitter.com/epSL7VXG5o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Blue (@TwitterBlue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1484226540984356864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>TikTok marketing lead behind its NFTs and ghost kitchens no longer at the company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9S5LZrrL9hiP6fKz-ckSa56V7_U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413192/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TikTok has had some... interesting marketing campaigns recently.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vD606Q"&gt;Nick Tran is no longer TikTok’s global head of marketing, reportedly because the company was unimpressed with his “side-show” marketing campaigns, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/01/19/tiktoks-marketing-chief-ousted-after-going-rogue-with-bizarre-campaigns/?utm_campaign=iphone_nyp&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=twitter_app"&gt;according to the&lt;em&gt; New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the most notable “stunt-marketing” schemes he came up with included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/19/22845154/tiktok-kitchens-viral-food-ghost-kitchens"&gt;opening TikTok Kitchens&lt;/a&gt;, letting people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567220/tiktok-resumes-job-application"&gt;apply to jobs  at places like Chipotle or Target&lt;/a&gt; via TikToks, and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702871/lil-nas-x-tiktok-top-moments-nfts-auction"&gt;NFT collaboration&lt;/a&gt; with celebrities like Lil’ Nas X and Bella Poarch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URrPoo"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Post &lt;/em&gt;reports that the restaurant campaign, where ghost kitchens would cook and deliver recipes that went viral on TikTok, was the one of the last straws for Tran. “We’re not in the restaurant business and we shouldn’t pretend to be,” one executive reportedly said. Looking at some of the campaigns, it is a bit difficult to find a connection to TikTok’s actual business of hosting short form videos, or how they work to boost its image (apart from possibly just getting people to talk about TikTok at all, though it’s not like there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tiktok"&gt;been a drought of TikTok news&lt;/a&gt; in the two-ish years that Tran worked there). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ML9dVY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TikTok also had traditional ads&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1EFJcV"&gt;Not all of TikTok’s recent ads have been so tangentially related though. I genuinely enjoyed one of its &lt;a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2021/10/19/ad-the-day-tiktok-s-you-have-see-it-retells-shocking-story-hidden-apartment"&gt;“you have to see it” ads&lt;/a&gt;, which shows people (including Martha Stewart) talking about &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2021/03/nyc-apartment-tiktok-bathroom-mirror-viral.html"&gt;that series of TikToks where someone found an entire apartment behind their bathroom mirror&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYHKMV"&gt;Tran worked at Hulu before being poached by TikTok. According a 2020 profile in &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/40-under-40/2020/nick-tran/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;’s 40 under 40&lt;/a&gt;, he worked on a few strange ad campaigns there as well — he was involved with Hulu’s Super Bowl ad which used an egg to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/2/4/18209773/world-record-egg-instagram-hulu-super-bowl-ad-mental-health"&gt;tell people to “talk to someone” if they were struggling with mental health&lt;/a&gt;, capitalizing off the egg picture that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/14/18181806/instagram-most-liked-post-egg-kylie-jenner"&gt;became the most-liked post on Instagram at the time&lt;/a&gt;. The ad doesn’t heavily feature Hulu branding, but the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208265/hulu-world-record-egg-instagram-superbowl-ad-sponsorship"&gt;made a big deal about sponsoring the egg&lt;/a&gt; in the run-up to the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNWwFo"&gt;Tran also led an ad campaign called “Better ruins everything,” where &lt;a href="https://www.thedrum.com/creative-works/project/big-family-table-hulu-better-ruins-everything"&gt;a variety of celebrities tell you not to buy Hulu&lt;/a&gt; (it’s not quite like Patagonia &lt;a href="https://bettermarketing.pub/dont-buy-this-jacket-patagonia-s-daring-campaign-2b37e145046b"&gt;telling you not to buy their jacket&lt;/a&gt;, the celebrities are warning you that Hulu is so much better than TV that you’ll never be able to go without it after you use it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1g0oRZ"&gt;While Tran’s marketing stunts may have only vaguely related to TikTok, that’s not particularly abnormal for marketing these days — did seeing a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSeBuY9F2hE"&gt;baby version of Mr. Peanut&lt;/a&gt; make you hungry? Did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/12/22227043/swedish-metal-band-lenovo-legion-5i-review"&gt;seeing a heavy metal band growl-scream out an excerpt from one of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s reviews&lt;/a&gt; make you want to buy a Lenovo laptop? (Okay, that one was actually pretty awesome.) TikTok didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but confirmed Tran’s departure in &lt;a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/nick-tran-out-tiktok-global-marketing-chief/2393601"&gt;a statement to &lt;em&gt;Ad Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (though, as a note, he does list Global Head of Marketing at TikTok as his current job on LinkedIn). TikTok’s statement wished him well in his future endeavors — whatever they end up being, we’ll probably hear about them. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PlayStation 5 is available once again at Best Buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_iiAWxZ-Jif-ngtwfPFgzkhsaP4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413158/vpavic_4278_20201030_0247.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zg3za0"&gt;While there have been many restocks of Sony’s PlayStation 5 console as it slowly gets a little easier to obtain one, we’re sadly not out of the woods just yet. The PS5 is still hard to come by for a product that is over one year old. Thankfully, there’s another chance to pick one up today, care of Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldz2XY"&gt;Best Buy is opening up orders for the standard disc drive-equipped &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcljGhDR4o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 console, costing $499.99&lt;/a&gt;. Orders from Best Buy are usually based around store pickup orders, so it is very likely that you may need some luck on your side with a nearby location that has inventory. Whatever the case, the key is to try and stay persistent. Log into your Best Buy account, with billing and shipping info pre-filled, and click “Add to Cart” to join the queue. Once it is your turn the button may change and prompt you to verify your account. It’s after that point that you may find out whether a nearby store has stock or not. If not, you it doesn’t hurt to close the window and try again. Sometimes the stock for Best Buy stores is rolled out in waves, with restocks lasting up to, and sometimes over, one hour in length before everything is all sold out once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCzT2b"&gt;Hopefully you manage to get one today, but if not we’ll be here to let you know of the next restocks from Best Buy and other major retailers. If you did luck out, be sure to regularly check out our deals pages, where we often surface some of the best prices around on games and peripherals. You can even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe to our&lt;em&gt; Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, and get deals and promos right to your inbox. accessories you may need right off the bat, and &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk’s Neuralink is hiring a clinical trial director</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Gigafactory - Elon Musk" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LhQOTcc3R61JWW5bHXxO-AF56hY=/0x86:4978x3405/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413014/1234657348.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Musk says trials should start this year.  | Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ouhXKq"&gt;Elon Musk’s brain-machine interface company Neuralink has a new &lt;a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/neuralink/jobs/4723041003"&gt;job posting&lt;/a&gt; for a clinical trial director, a position that could help the company move towards its stated goal of testing its brain implant in actual people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQJVdc"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/27/15077864/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-interface-ai-cyborgs"&gt;launching publicly in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, Neuralink has demoed its brain implant in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406143/elon-musk-neuralink-ai-pigs-demo-brain-computer-interface"&gt;pigs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374749/elon-musk-neuralink-monkey-pong-brain-interface"&gt;monkeys&lt;/a&gt; but has yet to announce a start to the long-promised trials in humans. The company’s implant is a coin-like device with electrodes studded on thin, flexible wires. The wires are its main innovation over older brain-machine interfaces, which use stiffer needles that can damage cells in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRPM5W"&gt;The company needs to do trials in humans before it can get Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for general medical use — key for Musk’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406143/elon-musk-neuralink-ai-pigs-demo-brain-computer-interface"&gt;stated plan&lt;/a&gt; to use the devices to solve a number of neurological problems, from memory loss to addiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2WCP7"&gt;The clinical trial director job posting, first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/elon-musk-s-brain-implant-company-is-inching-toward-human-trials?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, says that the person in the role will be “working with Neuralink’s first Clinical Trial participants,” though it’s not clear if the company has started recruiting or working with participants at this point. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/elon-musk-sees-neuralink-implants-for-2022-says-ceo-is-a-made-up-title/"&gt;Musk said&lt;/a&gt; in December that the company aims to have the device implanted in the first human subjects in 2022. That’s not the first prediction he’s made, though — Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406143/elon-musk-neuralink-ai-pigs-demo-brain-computer-interface"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; he hoped to start trials in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkwpyt"&gt;The clinical trial process would start with a feasibility study to get a first look at how the device works in a small number of people. Then, because the device is high-risk and hasn’t been previously used in people, the company would need FDA approval to launch a larger-scale trial. According to the job posting, the clinical trial director would be responsible for interactions with regulators like the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hzqxr0"&gt;The person who takes the clinical trials director position will enter a scientific environment that ex-employees &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/25/elon-musk-neuralink-update-brain-machine-implants/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 was chaotic and was characterized by pressure to deliver scientific progress on unreasonably short timelines. They’d have to handle Musk’s consistent promises of timelines that haven’t previously panned out and his publicly-stated ambitions that still go beyond &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493224/elon-musk-neuralink-neuroscience-brain-machine"&gt;what scientists say are reasonable expectations&lt;/a&gt; for brain-machine interfaces. None of that is in the job description. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqp7DJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Netflix keeps cranking up its prices </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZGr6xr"&gt;Every year, the cost of streaming gets more and more expensive — and just last week, prices started going up again. Netflix announced that all of its tiers would get an immediate price hike for new subscribers, boosting its most expensive plan to $20 per month. It’s the third price increase since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O8oF40"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926"&gt;$15.50 per month&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix’s standard tier now slightly out-prices HBO Max ($15 per month) and the Disney Bundle (which includes ESPN Plus and Hulu for $14 per month), making it one of the most expensive on-demand streaming options among leading services. If you want 4K, it gets even pricier. That’s not an insignificant amount of money, considering people tend to have around four paid streaming subscriptions, according to &lt;a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/media-companies-strive-to-retain-subscribers-but-consumers-still-crave-social-connections-not-just-entertainment.html"&gt;recent data&lt;/a&gt; from Deloitte. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aToYzv"&gt;While the price hikes sting for consumers, it’s safe to expect they’ll continue — especially for Netflix. Growth opportunities have stalled, and the company’s spending on content continues to grow. To keep up, Netflix has to either increase the number of subscribers paying for its service or ask its existing customers for more money. And right now, Netflix knows it can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyAkK2"&gt;“They’re doing pretty well, but they’re going to continue to tighten up their finances as time goes by,” Parks Associates senior analyst Paul Erickson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This is the fundamental way in which they do that — small incremental price changes over time. Because they feel they are so well entrenched, and their customers are loyal, they feel that it’s not going to materially affect their subscribership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o2wFu5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The money has to come from somewhere.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WhVc2O"&gt;One of the big reasons Netflix needs money is to pay for new shows and movies. Streaming services are spending a frankly outrageous chunk of change on original programming, with global spend expected to exceed $230 billion in 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.ampereanalysis.com/press/release/dl/content-spend-sees-double-digit-growth-and-reaches-220-billion-in-2021-driven-by-svod-se"&gt;according to estimates&lt;/a&gt; from firm Ampere Analysis. Ampere positions Netflix as the third-largest investor in video content, surpassed only by Disney and Comcast — both of which the firm notes invest in pricey sports rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jiGOd"&gt;By dumping truckloads of money in original programming, streamers hope to not only hang onto their existing customers but lure in new subscribers as well. For Netflix, expanding its programming across genres and categories helps it be everything to everyone. Investing in an ever-growing portfolio of scripted, unscripted, animated, and live-action programming helps ensure that Netflix remains a monthly subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLhgMt"&gt;“The more that they can serve all the different aspects of different households — whether that’s language specificity, if it’s market and lifestyle specificity — the better,” Erickson says. This allows Netflix to justify positioning itself as a core, must-have entertainment service. And if its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238877/netflix-200-million-subscribers-q4-earnings-bridgerton-emily-paris-cobra-kai-queens-gambit"&gt;200 million-plus paid subscribers&lt;/a&gt; are any indication, the strategy is working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xcL2nR"&gt;&lt;div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8478791"&gt;&lt;script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iTmEnU"&gt;But there’s another reason Netflix has turned to price increases to raise more money. Even with its hundreds of millions of &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/netflix-automatically-canceling-inactive-accounts-1234613201/"&gt;active subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix’s subscriber growth &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394425/netflix-subscriber-growth-stalls-2021"&gt;has begun plateauing&lt;/a&gt;. The company continues to add subscribers, but the number of quarterly additions has dipped in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525428/netflix-earnings-q3-content-subscribers-pandemic-competition"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/netflix-q1-2021-media-earnings-1234955952/"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; (in some cases, even &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/netflix-q1-2021-subscribers-earnings-4165366/"&gt;falling below&lt;/a&gt; forecasted figures). Netflix’s content spend, meanwhile, only &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/964789/netflix-content-spend-worldwide/"&gt;continues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/blog/netflix-amortized-content-spend-estimated-at-13-6-billion-in-2021"&gt;to grow&lt;/a&gt;, with the company &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/netflix-2021-content-spend-17-billion-1234955953/"&gt;spending billions&lt;/a&gt; on programming every year. And with major competitors like Disney Plus and HBO Max entering the market, they’re only likely to keep growing so Netflix can remain competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3RZ0T"&gt;This is likely to come up in the company’s earnings call later today, as investors are worried about &lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/netflix-stock-price-earnings-subscribers-51642625439?tesla=y"&gt;slowing subscriber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/nflx-q4-fy-2021-earnings-report-preview-5216333"&gt;revenue growth&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to paying for the content it needs to continue scaling its business, Netflix also has to keep its antsy investors happy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PJnVAC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you use Netflix every day, then you kind of don’t pay attention.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HRLxTD"&gt;Without taking the highly maligned step of simply kicking all of us off our exes or parents’ plans — Netflix boss Reed Hastings &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325831/netflix-password-sharing-test-feature-piracy-security-streaming-video"&gt;has described&lt;/a&gt; shared accounts as “something you have to learn to live with” — Netflix has to figure out a way to counterbalance its debts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlis5r"&gt;“The money has to come from somewhere. A company can only pay off its debt and get to true profitability with hard cash,” Erickson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrKNJg"&gt;At the same time, small incremental price increases every year and a half or so probably won’t impact subscriber turnover for a service that customers use often or one that’s central to their cord-cutting portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SD2mN"&gt;“Does the consumer feel that Netflix is a good value at the price? If the answer is yes, overwhelmingly they can raise prices and pretty much nobody quits,” Michael Pachter, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If you use Netflix every day, then you kind of don’t pay attention.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hXRBK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884263/netflix-price-increases-2021-us-canada-all-plans-hd-4k"&gt;Historic trends for price hikes&lt;/a&gt; offered a clue that another was coming for US subscribers sometime soon. Additionally, Netflix COO and chief product officer Greg Peters said during an &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Netflix-Inc.-Q1-2021-Earnings-Call-Apr-20-2021.pdf"&gt;earnings call&lt;/a&gt; last year that by delivering what Netflix feels is “an amazing entertainment value” through content and user experience, the company can occasionally go back to its subscribers and “ask them to pay a little bit more to keep that positive cycle going.” In other words, a price increase was just as good as &lt;em&gt;promised&lt;/em&gt; by Netflix — but cracking the teens is still a pretty significant milestone for the streamer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uVRVZ"&gt;Setting aside the decade or so lead that Netflix has on its rivals for everything from viewing data to its catalog, pretty much every move Netflix makes is driven by making its streaming service as addictive as possible, which, again, costs money. Whether that’s expanding its &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-01-16/netflix-outlines-the-next-phase-of-its-sports-strategy"&gt;sports offerings&lt;/a&gt;, taking big swings with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22822107/dont-look-up-review-netflix"&gt;both critically adored&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/introducing-the-emerging-filmmaker-initiative-to-support-new-voices-in-genre"&gt;up-and-coming directors&lt;/a&gt;, or expanding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22770244/netflix-gaming-app-launch-android-ios-future"&gt;characters and worlds with gaming&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix is burning through cash to try to keep you hooked on its service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myngGD"&gt;“They’re going to continue to innovate because now that they know they’ve got to weight in the industry, weight for original content creation — it’s not just a fluke,” Erickson says. “It’s proving to be viable for them to continue to diversify what they’re doing content-wise, even if it means going outside of the traditional volumes and types of content that they’re used to delivering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drKuBO"&gt;Netflix enjoys an arguably unrivaled brand loyalty in the streaming space — it’s &lt;em&gt;synonymous&lt;/em&gt; with streaming. At the end of the day, Netflix is cranking up its price by a buck or two every couple of years simply because it can. It’s safe to assume it’ll continue doing so, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NYC Mayor Adams will convert his city paycheck to cryptocurrency via Coinbase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r3oZHzy0IyzzasH2tqiW4XaB8lw=/0x0:5253x3502/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70412593/1365216853.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HSZAf9"&gt;Following through on a plan he announced before he took office, New York City Mayor Eric Adams &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/041-22/mayor-adams-receive-first-paycheck-cryptocurrency"&gt;said Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that his first paycheck, which arrives on Friday, will be converted from US dollars into cryptocurrency. The transaction will take place on Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, and will convert Adams’ pay into Bitcoin and Ethereum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8Kjuj"&gt;“New York is the center of the world, and we want it to be the center of cryptocurrency and other financial innovations,” Adams said in a statement. “Being on the forefront of such innovation will help us create jobs, improve our economy, and continue to be a magnet for talent from all over the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdJ0UU"&gt;Adams tweeted on November 4th that he would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22764104/new-york-city-mayor-elect-eric-adams-announces-bitcoin-paycheck-miami"&gt;take his first three paychecks in Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; when he became mayor because “In New York we always go big,” he noted. The idea was part of a back-and-forth with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who said in November he’d take his next paycheck in Bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="huOvgd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In New York we always go big, so I’m going to take my first THREE paychecks in Bitcoin when I become mayor. NYC is going to be the center of the cryptocurrency industry and other fast-growing, innovative industries! Just wait!&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Adams (@ericadamsfornyc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericadamsfornyc/status/1456311827550384129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FTz5qd"&gt;US Department of Labor rules prohibit New York City from paying employees in cryptocurrency, however, hence the post-payment conversion on Coinbase. Suarez &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/miami-mayor-seeks-wider-crypto-use-after-taking-pay-in-bitcoin"&gt;reportedly converts his city salary into Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; using fintech exchange Strike. The two join a growing list of professional athletes— which includes Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers — &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/7-nfl-players-that-chose-crypto-over-cash-salaries"&gt;who take or convert their salaries in cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtRdT5"&gt;Both Suarez and Adams are pushing to make their respective cities DeFi hubs, with Suarez supporting crypto investments in the south Florida city and launching a &lt;a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/news+/130710/the-miamicoin-project-has-generated-22-5-million-for-the-city-now-comes-the-hard-part-using-it"&gt;token called MiamiCoin&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Many game developers hate NFTs, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oCv2PnCHqQRYh17FWOfPWMDm_mM=/0x90:2036x1447/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70412457/mobile_screens.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ubisoft’s NFTs, pictured here, received a critical reception when they were announced.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ubisoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cXIrEb"&gt;NFTs have been a contentious topic in the video game industry as of late. Fans did not respond well to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822410/ubisoft-nfts-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-breakpoint"&gt;Ubisoft’s NFT plans&lt;/a&gt;, and the outcry to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22834567/stalker-2-nfts-metahuman-dmarket"&gt;NFTs in &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was so vehement that the game’s developers decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840488/stalker-2-nft-metahuman-gsc-web3-canceled"&gt;cancel them entirely&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s not just video game fans that are skeptical of the new technology; many game developers have similarly strong feelings, according to the Game Developers Conference annual survey, which was released Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rj9zE2"&gt;“When asked how they felt about the possibility of cryptocurrency or NFTs in games, a few called it ‘the future of gaming,’” the survey said. “However, a vast majority of respondents spoke out against both practices — noting their potential for scams, overall monetization concerns, and the environmental impact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O2tQ5a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How this hasn’t been identified as a pyramid scheme is beyond me”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="45bmOh"&gt;Many quotes directly from developers were scathing. “How this hasn’t been identified as a pyramid scheme is beyond me,” one wrote. “I’d rather not endorse burning a rainforest down to confirm someone ‘owns’ a jpeg,” said another. “Burn ‘em to the ground. Ban everyone involved in them. I work at an NFT company currently and am quitting to get away from it,” said another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNi9rS"&gt;Not all were so critical. One positive response called cryptocurrency / NFTs “the wave of the future.” But according to the survey’s data, 70 percent of respondents said their studio had no interest in NFTs, which could indicate that we won’t see a lot of gaming NFTs in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6wOlV"&gt;The survey also showed growing support for unionization in the industry, a topic that has come to the forefront as workers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;have protested Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; and after Vodeo Games organized the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22834924/vodeo-games-first-video-game-union-north-america-code-cwa"&gt;first certified video game studio union in North America&lt;/a&gt;. Fifty-five percent of respondents said game industry workers should unionize — the highest amount in the 10 years GDC has conducted the survey and up from 51 percent in 2021 — and 23 percent said talks about unionizing have happened where they work. While only 18 percent believe the industry actually will unionize, 36 percent said their companies were supportive of union talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJkSGF"&gt;However, studios still have plenty of work to do to combat toxicity, according to the survey. Only 38 percent of respondents said their companies “reached out to them to start a conversation about how misconduct and toxicity are handled in the industry,” which means that 62 percent did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;. And some of the quotes from respondents were highly critical, calling company responses “tepid lipservice” and “woefully inadequate,” among other things. Even though some did have positive things to say about their company’s action, the survey data indicates developers feel more work needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zkrpFS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GDC is still set to be an in-person conference&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JhYnZv"&gt;GDC is releasing the survey just about two months ahead of the &lt;a href="https://gdconf.com/"&gt;physical GDC 2022 conference&lt;/a&gt;. Despite a recent surge in COVID-19 cases, the event is still scheduled to take in person from March 21st to the 25th at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CAarfA"&gt;“We’re committed to having an event in person as long as it’s safe and as long as we’re permitted to do so,” Katie Stern, VP of media and entertainment at Informa Tech, the company that organizes GDC, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview. To go to the conference, attendees &lt;a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2022-health-safety-and-travel-qa"&gt;must be&lt;/a&gt; vaccinated &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; have received a booster shot if an initial completed vaccination took place on or before September 14th, 2021. Attendees will also be required to wear a mask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgAbc4"&gt;Stern said GDC is expecting 15,000 to 17,000 attendees, which is down from the &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-03-26-gdc-2019-attendance-sets-new-record-at-29-000"&gt;29,000 that attended in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the last time there was an in-person GDC show. The DICE Summit is also still scheduled to take place &lt;a href="https://www.dicesummit.org/"&gt;in person in February&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870913/e3-2022-online-virtual-event-covid-19-pandemic-omicron"&gt;E3 won’t be an in-person conference this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is building an AR headset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google’s Clay Bavor introduces Daydream, google’s virtual reality platform during a press conference at Fisherman’s Wharf on Tuesday, October 4, 2016, in San Francisco, Calif." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-2LEToZNQU0z-o5qxXNGFxRvxg8=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70412429/1321751574.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Project Iris could see Google go up against Meta and Apple in the coming headset wars&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="y1Xb9n"&gt;Meta may be the loudest company building AR and VR hardware. Microsoft has HoloLens. Apple is working on something, too. But don’t count out Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlyyWL"&gt;The search giant has recently begun ramping up work on an AR headset, internally codenamed Project Iris, that it hopes to ship in 2024, according to two people familiar with the project who requested anonymity to speak without the company’s permission. Like forthcoming headsets from Meta and Apple, Google’s device uses outward-facing cameras to blend computer graphics with a video feed of the real world, creating a more immersive, mixed reality experience than existing AR glasses from the likes of Snap and Magic Leap. Early prototypes being developed at a facility in the San Francisco Bay Area resemble a pair of ski goggles and don’t require a tethered connection to an external power source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVUS4w"&gt;Google’s headset is still early in development without a clearly defined go-to-market strategy, which indicates that the 2024 target year may be more aspirational than set in stone. The hardware is powered by a custom Google processor, like its newest Google Pixel smartphone, and runs on Android, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22833801/google-augmented-reality-operating-system-ar-os-team-mark-lucovsky"&gt;recent job listings indicate&lt;/a&gt; that a unique OS is in the works. Given power constraints, Google’s strategy is to use its data centers to remotely render some graphics and beam them into the headset via an internet connection. I’m told that the Pixel team is involved in some of the hardware pieces, but it’s unclear if the headset will ultimately be Pixel-branded. The name Google Glass is almost certainly off the table, thanks to the early blowback (remember “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/31/5955973/we-are-all-glassholes-now"&gt;Glasshole?&lt;/a&gt;”) and the fact that it technically still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578691/google-meet-glass-ar-remote-assistance-rollout-open-beta"&gt;exists as an enterprise product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2FYcW5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Project Iris is a tightly kept secret inside Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lU3qDq"&gt;Project Iris marks a return to a hardware category that Google has a long and checkered history in. It started with the splashy, ill-fated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/22/4013406/i-used-google-glass-its-the-future-with-monthly-updates"&gt;debut of Google Glass&lt;/a&gt; in 2012. And then a multi-year effort to sell VR headsets quietly fizzled out in 2019. Google has since been noticeably silent about its hardware aspirations in the space, instead choosing to focus on software features like Lens, its visual search engine, and AR directions in Google Maps. Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg has bet his company on AR and VR, hiring thousands and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;rebranding from Facebook to Meta&lt;/a&gt;. “Metaverse” has become an inescapable buzzword. And Apple is readying its own mixed reality headset for &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-14/apple-s-hotly-anticipated-headset-risks-being-delayed-until-2023?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;as soon as later this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPS4lP"&gt;Project Iris is a tightly kept secret inside Google, tucked away in a building that requires special keycard access and non-disclosure agreements. The core team working on the headset is roughly 300 people, and Google plans to hire hundreds more. The executive overseeing the effort is Clay Bavor, who reports directly to CEO Sundar Pichai and also manages Project Starline, an ultra-high-resolution video chat booth &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22813731/google-project-starline-specs-features-research-paper-8k-tv-microphones-camera-capture-pods"&gt;that was demoed last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UcBjAmmVH_tloCUEDPyR5qtjxfM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23180669/Google_Project_Starline.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Google’s Project Starline&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AV4JAp"&gt;If Starline is any indication, Project Iris could be a technical marvel. People who have tried Starline say it’s one of the most impressive tech demos ever. Its ability to recreate who you’re chatting with in 3D is supposedly hyper-realistic. In &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/how-were-testing-project-starline-google/"&gt;an eye-tracking test with employees&lt;/a&gt;, Google found that people focused roughly 15 percent more on who they were talking to using Starline versus a traditional video call and that memory recall was nearly 30 percent better when asked about the details of conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="olYgbO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google is hoping to ship Starline by 2024 along with Iris&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LPvZ8z"&gt;I’ve heard that Google is hoping to ship Starline by 2024 along with Iris. It recently hired Magic Leap’s CTO, Paul Greco, to the team in a previously unreported move. A pilot program for using Starline to facilitate remote meetings is in the works with various Fortune 500 companies. Google also wants to deploy Starline internally as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422518/google-hybrid-work-office-remote-work-sundar-pichai-memo-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;post-pandemic hybrid work strategy&lt;/a&gt;. A big focus for Starline is bringing the cost of each unit down from tens of thousands of dollars. (Like Iris, there’s a chance that Google doesn’t meet its target ship year for Starline.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIW0Ff"&gt;Bavor has managed Google’s VR and AR efforts for years, dating back to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/5/11862258/google-cardboard-daydream-controller"&gt;Google Cardboard&lt;/a&gt; and Daydream, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/4/17318648/lenovo-mirage-solo-google-daydream-standalone-vr-headset-review"&gt;VR software and hardware platform&lt;/a&gt; that came out around the same time as the Oculus. He is a close friend of Pichai who has been at Google since 2005. Last November, he was given the title VP of Labs, a remit that includes Project Starline, Iris, a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-19/google-forms-blockchain-group-under-newly-appointed-executive?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new blockchain division&lt;/a&gt;, and Google’s in-house product incubator called Area 120. At the time of his promotion, Google &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/google-reorg-moves-ar-vr-starline-and-area-120-into-new-labs-team-reporting-directly-to-sundar-pichai/"&gt;reportedly told&lt;/a&gt; employees that the Labs team is “focused on extrapolating technology trends and incubating a set of high-potential, long-term projects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDDWR6"&gt;Some of the other leaders working on Project Iris include: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qk82Zb"&gt;Shahram Izadi, a senior director of engineering who also manages Google’s ARCore software toolkit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OjKX9L"&gt;Eddie Chung, a senior director of product management who previously ran product for Google Lens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8mtJ0a"&gt;Scott Huffman, the VP and creator of Google Assistant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="k5BHZB"&gt;Kurt Akeley, a distinguished engineer and the former CTO of the light-field camera startup Lytro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2Dyl8r"&gt;Mark Lucovsky, Google’s senior director of operating systems for AR who was recently in a similar job at Meta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tuB9-OpXU_PGF-xxL9HkCUw7Tpc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19444528/Focals2.0_TeaseHero_02_RGB_3000x1543.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: North&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;North’s first pair of smart glasses were called Focals. Google bought the company in mid-2020 before the second version was released.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2dCx04"&gt;Google’s interest in AR dates back to Glass and its early investment in Magic Leap. I’ve heard that the calculus for the Magic Leap investment was to have optionality to buy the company down the road if it figured out a viable path to mass-market AR hardware. In a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/google-wont-release-its-oculus-quest-vr-competitor-anytime-soon/"&gt;2019 interview&lt;/a&gt;, Bavor said, “I characterize the phase we’re in as deep R&amp;amp;D, focused on building the critical Lego bricks behind closed doors.” A year later, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308281/google-north-focals-glasses-purchase-acquire"&gt;bought a smart glasses startup called North&lt;/a&gt; that was focused on fitting AR tech into a pair of normal-looking eyewear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLuQx2"&gt;Most of the North team still works at Google. A recent slew of &lt;a href="https://next.reality.news/news/google-signals-smartglasses-ramp-up-via-job-postings-for-waveguides-other-ar-disciplines-0384557/"&gt;job postings related to waveguides&lt;/a&gt; — a display technology more suited for AR glasses rather than an immersive headset like Project Iris — suggests they could be working on another device in Canada. Google declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="KcgO51"&gt;Last October, Pichai &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/26/sundar-pichai-google-ar/"&gt;said on an earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that Google is “thinking through” AR and that it will be a “major area of investment for us.” The company certainly has the cash to fund ambitious ideas. It has top technical talent, a robust software ecosystem with Android, and compelling products for AR glasses like Google Lens. But it’s still unclear if Google plans to invest as aggressively as Meta, which is already spending &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse"&gt;$10 billion per year on AR and VR&lt;/a&gt;. Apple has thousands working on its headset and a more far-out pair of AR glasses. Until it indicates otherwise, Google seems to be playing catchup.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Messenger Kids’ new internet safety games are mostly teaching kids how to use Messenger </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Facebook Messenger logo seen displayed on a smartphone and Meta Platforms logo in the background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VGvwjGQiw3Fqe7lhiTMWh9V-Zas=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70412323/1237277727.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Meta Messenger for Kids is adding new games to teach online safety | Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UaXlZy"&gt;Facebook parent company Meta has launched new activities on its Messenger Kids platform aimed at teaching internet etiquette to children. According to &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/01/teaching-internet-safety-on-messenger-kids/"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Erik Michael Weitzman, director of product management at Messenger Kids, the new gamified activities will “help kids learn how to use the internet safely and practice making healthy decisions online.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmhiMP"&gt;Pledge Planets is based on what Weitzman says are the tenets of the Messenger Kids Pledge: be kind, be respectful, be safe and have fun. The first episode titled “Be Kind” includes two games that will help kids “learn and practice how to act with kindness,” the company says: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TcbVbq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rough Reviews:&lt;/strong&gt; Players must help the owner read through the reviews and match the correct online response to each one. This game teaches kids to recognize kind and unkind behavior and become familiar with tools like blocking and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMA0Bg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Order Up:&lt;/strong&gt; Players build a sandwich order by selecting the emojis that best respond to the customer’s mood. This game teaches kids how to read people’s emotions online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ts4suXC_nmlxfovM_jpH7aThSKY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23181979/01_Be_Kind_Episode.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Messenger Kids introduced two new games to teach online safety and awareness to children&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TBzEdB"&gt;Weitzman writes that the company developed the pledge and the Pledge Planets activities with guidance from experts in online safety and child development. Meta / Facebook first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/4/16725494/facebook-messenger-kids-app-launch-ios-iphone-preview"&gt;introduced Messenger Kids in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, a scaled-down version of its Messenger app that links to a parent’s Facebook account. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;last year, Facebook shelved&lt;/a&gt; plans for a planned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338911/facebook-instagram-kids-privacy-coppa"&gt;kids’ version&lt;/a&gt; of its Instagram photo-sharing platform after widespread criticism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iO9Mxq"&gt;Setting aside the question of whether Facebook / Meta / Messenger is qualified to offer guidance on healthy decisions and internet safety, what these two games are &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;doing is teaching kids how to use Messenger. Bear with me a second, but the first thing I thought of was (the much more well-intentioned and genuine) Sesame Street, arguably the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/11/17/7228353/sesame-street-changed-world"&gt;first TV show designed to help teach preschoolers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YiHCJa"&gt;While Sesame Street is rightly lauded for having a positive impact on kids’ learning skills and for its diverse, multicultural cast of characters, many have also noted that the show did a great job teaching kids &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/07/the-1960s-experiment-childrens-tv/398681/"&gt;how to watch television&lt;/a&gt;, keeping them engaged and entertained through play learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JKaWqW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside Facebook’s struggle to keep young people","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6cIljI"&gt;Meta’s platforms, however, have something of a troubled history when it comes to child safety online; internal documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen suggested Facebook / Meta was aware that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22816730/mosseri-testimony-instagram-senate-hearing-haugen-child-safety-facebook-meta"&gt;Instagram can be “toxic”&lt;/a&gt; for teenage users and that its algorithms could direct kids to content that may encourage self-harm. And a study last May by online child safety advocacy organization Thorn found that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432863/child-safety-platforms-thorn-report-snap-facebook-youtube-tiktok"&gt;children receive abuse and harassment&lt;/a&gt; on social platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger, at much higher rates than previously believed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIyuMp"&gt;And, recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks"&gt;revealed internal documents show&lt;/a&gt; that Meta is hemorrhaging younger users, with one projection finding Meta would lose 45 percent of its teenage users over the next two years. Most kids don’t see Facebook as a platform meant for them, and while Instagram has remained popular with teen users, it too has lost ground in recent years both to bullies on its app and to competitors like TikTok. So Meta teaching a whole new generation how to use one of its products would seem right in line with its need to get younger users and keep them playing along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjl310"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK company behind Tom Cruise space film unveils plans to launch space movie studio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fp7gJ1rtxEOeQYwq7O0fZDG4WjM=/385x0:2815x1620/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70412212/01see.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An animation of the SEE-1 module attached to Axiom’s space station on the ISS.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Axiom/S.E.E.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1bisFN"&gt;On Thursday, a UK-based company that claims to be producing Tom Cruise’s upcoming film in space said it plans to attach the first-ever space movie studio and sports arena to the International Space Station as early as 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXqrHf"&gt;Called Space Entertainment Enterprise, or S.E.E., the company also announced it is working with commercial space station builder Axiom Space, which has its own partnership with NASA to build and attach an experimental space station to the ISS. That station is called Axiom Station, and Axiom hopes to launch its first module, called Axiom Hub 1, to the ISS by 2024. The company will then build out the space station before eventually separating it from the ISS in 2028 and making it a free-flying vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P0zp75"&gt;&lt;q&gt;S.E.E. plans to attach its own module to the new growing space station in December of 2024&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3j3cqm"&gt;But while Axiom Station is attached to the ISS, S.E.E. plans to attach its own module to the growing space station in December of 2024. Dubbed SEE-1, the module will be available to individuals who want to film or live stream content in space, “including ﬁlms, television, music, and sports events,” according to a press release announcing the news. Animated videos and images of SEE-1 &lt;a href="https://www.seespacearena.com/"&gt;on the company’s website&lt;/a&gt; show the module as a giant white sphere, though there were no available designs of what the interior will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRZ6mW"&gt;Though the module will belong to S.E.E., it is being built by Axiom Space. According to the S.E.E. press release, it will be an inflatable module that will stretch up to 6 meters, or nearly 20 feet, in diameter. S.E.E. says that it will allow third parties to also use the studio for their own projects. No costs or estimated budgets were provided for the project, nor did S.E.E. detail how much it would charge others to use the studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxwtwK"&gt;“Adding a dedicated entertainment venue to Axiom Station’s commercial capabilities in the form of SEE-1 will expand the station’s utility as a platform for a global user base and highlight the range of opportunities the new space economy offers,” Michael Suffredini, Axiom’s CEO, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwTIuA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;S.E.E. also revealed itself to be the production company behind Tom Cruise’s mystery space movie&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4nYbQU"&gt;With today’s announcement, S.E.E. also revealed itself to be the production company behind Tom Cruise’s mystery space movie. In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248460/nasa-tom-cruise-movie-international-space-station"&gt;NASA announced that it was working with the famous actor&lt;/a&gt; to potentially send him to the International Space Station to film a project. The actor’s ride to space is reportedly SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, which is used to ferry NASA astronauts to and from the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ba0xCu"&gt;Later, NASA confirmed in a podcast that &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/06/everything-we-know-and-dont-about-tom-cruises-plans-to-film-a-movie-in-space/"&gt;Axiom was going to be involved in getting Tom Cruise to orbit&lt;/a&gt;. While Axiom builds space stations, it has also contracted with NASA and SpaceX to buy rides on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon to send private individuals to the ISS. Axiom’s first private astronaut mission on a Crew Dragon, called Axiom-1, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22785888/axiom-space-ax-1-science-experiments-spacex-crew-dragon-iss"&gt;is scheduled to take flight in March&lt;/a&gt;. However, there’s no set date or confirmation for Tom Cruise’s flight. As for what Cruise plans to film up in the cosmos, all that’s been reported so far is that director Doug Liman is involved and that the film will not be a &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible&lt;/em&gt; movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYAFG4"&gt;S.E.E. was co-founded by producers Elena and Dmitry Lesnevsky. Their company boasts an impressive list of consultants of former Viacom and HBO executives. The company says it’s currently looking for investors on the Tom Cruise space project, which &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/video/tom-cruise-movie-shot-in-space-budget-deadlinenow/"&gt;Deadline reported in 2020&lt;/a&gt; would have a budget of at least $200 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wakHeD"&gt;However, it’s possible the budget could be even higher, given how much going to space costs. Just one seat on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250327/space-tourists-axiom-private-crew-iss-price"&gt;thought to run around $55 million&lt;/a&gt;, plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18656280/nasa-space-station-private-astronauts-commercial-business"&gt;NASA charges additional fees for private astronauts using the space station’s facilities&lt;/a&gt; while in orbit. S.E.E. says it plans to conduct a fundraising round soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWEhSX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
