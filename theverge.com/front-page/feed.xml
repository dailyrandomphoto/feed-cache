    <title>It’s time for car companies to shut up about electric vehicles and just ship them</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For years, car companies have been promising a major shift to electric — and now they finally have to deliver&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="zZuSLg"&gt;Ford CEO Jim Farley calls it a “watershed moment.” GM’s Mary Barra says it’s an “inflection point.” Volkswagen Group CEO Herbert Diess says it’s a “crucial moment for our company.” And Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota, describes it as “a diversified and uncharted era.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AaMeI"&gt;The auto industry is going electric. We know because they’ve been telling us, over and over, in earnings calls, virtual events, podcast interviews, and in many television commercials. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220574/gm-new-logo-electric-vehicle-brand-ces-2021"&gt;Hi, Malcolm Gladwell!&lt;/a&gt;) Gone will be the dirty internal combustion engines of yesteryear, replaced by zero-tailpipe emission electric vehicles. The future is here, and it probably has a light bar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJAEVh"&gt;The spotlight is on the auto industry like never before. President Joe Biden, who is spearheading a plan to spend billions of dollars on EV charging infrastructure and new incentives for car buyers, has test driven not one but two electric pickup trucks this year. Car companies are under enormous pressure to help usher in this electric future. And they know it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kDkRqj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The transition to EVs is both happening far later than many people had hoped for and far faster than most legacy OEMs expected two or three years ago”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mDn2qP"&gt;“The transition to EVs is both happening far later than many people had hoped for and far faster than most legacy [automakers] expected two or three years ago,” said Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for electric mobility at Guidehouse Insights. He argues that car companies have been “downplaying” the prospect of mass adoption of electric vehicles for years, only coming around after sitting back while Tesla soaked up market share. Now, EV sales are way up, Tesla is one of the most valuable companies in history, and the entire auto industry finally sees there’s profit in plug-in cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4As9iD"&gt;As expected, the transition has been stilted and plagued with problems. There’ve been battery fires, recalls, fraud allegations, a global chip shortage, and numerous missed deadlines. The number of new electric vehicles that went on sale this year is still laughably small compared to all the gas-guzzling, planet-warming, glacier-melting trucks and SUVs that still dominate the roads.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dw2PWr"&gt;The rollout of new EVs remains fairly thin. There’s the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Volkswagen ID 4 … and that’s about it. The Porsche Taycan and Polestar 2 helped fill out the premium segment, while shorter-range EVs, like the BMW i3, Ford Focus Electric, and the VW e-Golf, got the ax. Audi released a $140,000 electric sports car that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798695/audi-rs-etron-gt-review-ev-specs-price"&gt;fantastic to drive&lt;/a&gt; but won’t move the sales needle that much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Z_aD_1agpLjK_liT9GOg2eyDeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278732/sokane_210121_4386_0007.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8JjkMc"&gt;Other rollouts have been a mixed bag. Rivian, which went public in one of the biggest IPOs of all time, saw its stock tumble on the news that production of its first electric truck and SUV would be slow going. The 2021 Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV were both recalled after a number of worrisome battery fires, while the Mercedes-Benz EQS was recalled for an infotainment snafu. General Motors managed to start delivering the Hummer EV trucks to its first customers, just under the wire. The Tesla Cybertruck was delayed until 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QuDdD8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Then the Mach-E came out, and that was about it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ezhRjT"&gt;“It felt like we were setting ourselves up for a big EV year,” said Jessica Caldwell, director of insights at Edmunds. “Then the Mach-E came out, and that was about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0D9mv1"&gt;There have been other setbacks as well. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791984/ford-rivian-ev-canceled-investment-ipo-jim-farley"&gt;Ford dropped its plans&lt;/a&gt; to make an electric SUV with Rivian and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828360/ford-explorer-ev-aviator-delay-lincoln-mustang-mach-e"&gt;delayed the launch&lt;/a&gt; of its forthcoming electric Explorer SUV to December 2024 at the earliest. The company just stopped taking reservations for the F-150 Lightning as it prepares to launch production of its hotly anticipated electric truck. Experts say more delays could be on the horizon if the pandemic continues to disrupt supply chains and the automotive chip shortage doesn’t improve soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4mKJQ"&gt;Tesla still commands around two-thirds of the EV market in the US, with the Model Y overtaking the Model 3 as the best-selling electric vehicle in the world. The company had some noticeable wins, like a 100,000-vehicle order from Hertz. But it also has stirred up controversy over its rollout of the controversial Full Self-Driving beta software to select customers. For those in the market for a non-Tesla electric vehicle, the options are still pretty slim, Caldwell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3G00w"&gt;“It does feel like this EV market has really been like ‘hurry up and wait’ because there’s a lot of announcements and a lot of talk and yet not a lot in the way of delivery,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CTawZy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It does feel like this EV market has really been like ‘hurry up and wait’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EwXCne"&gt;This is partly because the act of transforming century-old industry is like making a three-point turn in a cruise ship. What’s easy for a startup or even a modest-sized automaker like Tesla is much harder for a 100,000-employee company like GM. These companies have been making internal combustion engines for such a long time, it’s hard to imagine them doing anything different.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gcVpU"&gt;Another reason it’s taking so long to see more EVs is that automakers are shifting away from decades-long practices of outsourcing production work and design to suppliers in favor of a more vertically integrated model of manufacturing, Greenhouse’s Abuelsamid said. In the past, designing and building engines and transmissions was considered a core competency for an automaker. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Herbert Diess, head of Volkswagen Group, speaks at the launch of assembly of the new VW ID.3 electric car in Germany. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9csC8s"&gt;But now, ICE powertrains are at the end of the road, and there’s no more room for improvement, leading automakers and major suppliers to scale back their investments. EV motors and batteries are the new core competency, and automakers want to own the whole supply chain. Ford and GM are both planning massive battery-making facilities in the US. They’re also scrambling to lock down other key materials, like lithium and other rare earth minerals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuvsI3"&gt;“That’s why we are suddenly seeing OEMs take back control of the key components of their next-generation vehicles,” Abuelsamid said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGGHYF"&gt;One of the main lessons automakers took away from the financial collapse of 2008 and subsequent auto bailouts was the need to respond more quickly to shifts in customer demands. And right now, demand for EVs is rising, but skepticism is, too. It’s a weird moment in which customers recognize the environmental and financial benefits of going electric but are unsure they can afford an EV or that the necessary infrastructure exists to support their purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qGc1x4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;demand for EVs is rising, but skepticism is, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BUn9WY"&gt;According to a new survey by the Consumer Technology Association, majorities of non-EV owners believe that EVs aren’t reliable (53 percent), are too expensive (64 percent), and that there aren’t enough charging stations to make owning an EV practical (85 percent). On the other hand, EV owners are overwhelmingly enthusiastic about the benefits and reliability of EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8cpPp"&gt;Obviously, this gap will narrow as more people get behind the wheel and see the benefits of EV ownership firsthand, like fewer maintenance needs, more spacious cabins, instant torque, and other attractive features. But that will depend on the auto industry’s ability to make enough electric vehicles to meet this rising demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I6pxOj"&gt;To date, every major automaker has unveiled a grand strategy to shift to electric-only or at least electric-majority sales. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308851/volvo-electric-cars-only-2030-online-sales"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588587/mercedes-benz-electric-ev-2030-caveat"&gt;Mercedes are doing it by 2030&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;GM by 2040&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/volkswagen-all-electric-ev-europe-us/"&gt;Volkswagen by 2050&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, all of these pledges are just words floating in the ether, and the likelihood that some gasoline-fed vehicles will manage to slip past these deadlines is very high.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXUQ04"&gt;“There are a lot of new challenges for automakers in doing all of this stuff,” Abuelsamid said. “They know how to assemble vehicles, but much of the rest is new and convincing consumers they know what they are doing won’t be easy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9rDRMj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The slow rollout of new EVs gives the false impression that we have time when, in reality, the clock is ticking&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zZVhXp"&gt;The slow rollout of new EVs gives the false impression that we have time when, in reality, the clock is ticking. There are roughly 280 million cars and trucks on the road in the US today, only 3 percent of which are electric. Americans typically buy 16–17 million cars every year, which means it will take roughly 16 years of EV-only sales to completely replace all of the gas cars currently on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahQNPn"&gt;Meanwhile, climate change experts insist that we have to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels in order to avoid some of the worst-case scenarios that climate change could create. We’re on track to surpass that in a few decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tASlN2"&gt;Much depends on the speed and efficiency of automakers to churn out electric vehicles  — while the rest of us grapple with the ravages of car dependency. Fewer cars on the road, especially in urban areas where they create congestion and undercut more sustainable modes of transportation, will be essential to fighting climate change. Experts believe that smaller, battery-powered vehicles, like electric bikes, can help pave the way by replacing car trips and making cities more liveable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EioTOa"&gt;But that’s probably not the watershed moment that car companies had in mind. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2021 was the year platforms came for our ears</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MfYEAwhs3fNTzOEvIkCWTPRcttM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70301241/acastro_181227_3146_podcast_analytics_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZgGj2h"&gt;In 2017, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings infamously told investors his streaming platform not only competes with its counterparts for attention but also with sleep. Now almost five years later, and as the pandemic continues on, our visual attention is maxed out. If you’re not streaming a show, maybe you’re playing a video game, or working, or on a Zoom call. The tech and content platforms of the world realize this, so instead, in 2021, they focused on something other than capturing whatever’s in front of our eyeballs: they came for our ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2VeeY3"&gt;Look at who got into audio and podcasting this year. Meta, formerly known as Facebook, a company known for copying any service that takes time away from its own, started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537023/facebook-podcast-rss-feed-publish-clips-pages"&gt;supporting podcasts&lt;/a&gt; on its main app. The impetus? To keep you inside its world and away from competitors, like Spotify or Apple Podcasts, that might capture your free ear attention. Twitter, an app already reliant on you reading it, launched its live audio product Spaces — a way for you to interact without actually having to look at the screen. (Same with any of the live audio launches this year.) Meanwhile, Amazon Music acquired Wondery at the end of 2020 and, this year, launched some of its first, high-profile original shows, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549391/amazon-music-art19-hosting-platform-advertisers"&gt;acquired hosting platform&lt;/a&gt; Art19, and debuted its first podcast-oriented feature with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22752750/amazon-music-podcast-transcripts-synchronized"&gt;synced transcripts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3P5bA1"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/insider-november-4-2021-amazons-decade-long-podcast-plan/"&gt;a chat with me&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod Insider&lt;/em&gt;, Kintan Brahmbhatt, Amazon Music’s director of podcasts, directly acknowledged the play for attention Amazon is making and the maxed-out screen real estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdLS7f"&gt;“Customers have more time for their ears than they do for their eyes,” he said. “If you look at it from a share of attention perspective for customers, we think more and more customers will have more time to listen to things, and podcasts are here to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLPxCr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; also launched its own audio app in beta with an explicit outline of where it might be able to conquer still-unaccounted-for ear time. The below chart, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/arainert/status/1468291125660291074?s=20"&gt;tweeted by&lt;/a&gt; Alex Rainert, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ head of audio product and design, demonstrates the blank spaces the company’s app can occupy — as well as where its competitors hope to dominate. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uHwRU-fTtxF0hC6_V8WWgQIDmzY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23116033/nytaudioday.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/arainert/status/1468291125660291074?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;Alex Rainert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0uG1kR"&gt;Even video streaming services now recognize the pull of audio in helping it dominate everyone’s time, both visual and audio. Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/netflix-hires-ex-apple-executive-to-lead-podcasting-operations"&gt;made its first&lt;/a&gt; podcast-oriented hires this year, while HBO Max &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609212/hbo-max-podcast-exclusive-batman-audio-jeffrey-wright"&gt;started distributing&lt;/a&gt; exclusive podcasts directly in its app. YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708688/youtube-music-free-background-listening-date"&gt;started rolling out&lt;/a&gt; free background listening for its Music app and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746466/youtube-podcasting-kai-chuk-amazon-project-mic-live-audio-hot-pod"&gt;hired someone&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to podcasts on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27yMZ3"&gt;Taken altogether, every app now has an audio component that they’ll use to compete with one another for that attention real estate. It makes sense — the biggest tech companies mostly depend on ad revenue, and they’ve put ads everywhere they can. Audio is the newest frontier for them — a fresh place to shove ads and lay claim to more of our time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4FfVs"&gt;I don’t see a reason this strategy wouldn’t work. Presumably, the platforms can turn some portion of the millions of people who don’t already subscribe to podcasts into listeners, and globally, the opportunity is massive. I view this year as one in which the groundwork was laid. Companies were acquired, public statements were made about the power and interest in audio, and during the next one, we’ll see the true marketing and content budgets put to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJGSX1"&gt;Walks, cooking time, and commutes are open for the taking, and looking ahead to 2022, the platforms are hoping they can conquer it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HVYdNJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This year, podcasts showed up with a vengeance on TV  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jlp7jOg8ofuYUIqvQxtGS_bGu_U=/615x0:1902x858/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70301242/Screen_Shot_2021_12_20_at_8.20.02_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;HBO Max&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yjZ8Ng"&gt;In the new &lt;a href="https://www.oxygen.com/true-crime-buzz/how-chucky-gets-into-the-true-crime-podcast-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chucky&lt;/em&gt; series on SyFy&lt;/a&gt;, one of the show’s main characters investigates a series of brutal murders by hosting a DIY true-crime podcast — a fact I found out while listening to &lt;a href="https://food4thotpodcast.com/"&gt;a podcast myself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5V50z"&gt;If you listen to podcasts, you may already feel like they’re everywhere, but this year, they really were: podcasts popped up in non-podcast spaces like television time and again in 2021. True-crime podcasts drive both &lt;em&gt;Chucky&lt;/em&gt; and the new Hulu show &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V1rQdXXXyI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only Murders in the Building&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Carrie Bradshaw co-hosts a podcast in the &lt;a href="https://www.etonline.com/and-just-like-that-heres-what-carrie-miranda-and-charlotte-are-up-to-in-sex-and-the-city-reboot"&gt;revival of &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In non-fictional spaces, a certain controversial Spotify host got &lt;a href="https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour/watch/joe-rogan-who-s-not-a-doctor-gives-terrible-vaccine-advice-110960197869"&gt;plenty of&lt;/a&gt; broadcast &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/01/media/joe-rogan-covid/index.html"&gt;news coverage&lt;/a&gt; throughout the year, and &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt; even made an appearance &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/video/best-podcasts-to-listen-to-this-summer-114332229761"&gt;on &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Podcasting abounded within both fictional depictions of our world and the institutions that document it, despite there still being &lt;a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/the-infinite-dial-2021-2/"&gt;tons of non-listeners&lt;/a&gt; out there — and maybe even because of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqtHQd"&gt;TV’s fictional-but-realistic characters reflect the parts of our world that are prominent enough to capture, and 2021’s media showed that podcasting has made it. It’s a &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/and-just-like-that-new-and-missing-characters.html"&gt;realistic, timely move&lt;/a&gt; for relationship columnist Carrie Bradshaw to transition to a newer, digital medium, and it mirrors the real-life media institutions that have added podcasting to their repertoire. It’s also nearly identical to the trajectory of similar real-life columns, like Meredith Goldstein’s &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe &lt;/em&gt;column &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/12/12/lifestyle/i-left-my-husband-someone-who-has-left-me/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://loveletters.boston.com/podcast"&gt;became a podcast&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, and &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ column-turned-podcast-turned-TV-series &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/modern-love"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modern Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LVAzVs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LWr3Vj"&gt;At the same time, podcasting getting top billing in TV shows may also signal that many people still don’t fully understand it, and it needs longer, sustained plots to make sense. In the first episode of &lt;em&gt;And Just Like That…&lt;/em&gt;, the logistics of Carrie’s new gig are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; much in focus. We hear the podcast. We see her receive feedback on her recording. We get a glimpse of her writing a rough script at home. In Miranda’s case, the idea of a parent going back to school is commonplace enough to not really need explaining; viewers can instead focus on what it serves to tee up (i.e., the cringey exploits of a white woman navigating a human rights class in 2021).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zi0bT"&gt;Maybe this time next year, podcasts will be shouted out even more often, with fewer explainers needed; media with a faster turnaround is already giving a glimpse of what this could look like. This year, &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; took at least three stabs at podcasting, first dedicating a whole skit to the dynamic between Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPpMAhfyw-8"&gt;on the podcast &lt;em&gt;Renegades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1459745432922374150?s=20"&gt;referencing a viral Joe Rogan quote&lt;/a&gt;. When they came for &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/evelinamedina/kate-mckinnon-returned-snl-billie-eilish"&gt;Joe Rogan more recently&lt;/a&gt;, it was much more subtle. And so it begins.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The year in audio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x2Fzaj3osqWMfmKH5elTo86Zy9I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70301239/acastro_211217_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nejVmq"&gt;We’re nearly there. 2022. These are times of deep uncertainty, so I’m glad I can offer you something you can depend on: a &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod &lt;/em&gt;issue. I do what I can. Today, we have a light news roundup and some bullet points on trends to remember about the year. Both Aria and I published columns about a specific throughline from the year. Mine is about how all the investment in audio over the past 12 months was in service of capturing our ears’ unaccounted for attention, and Aria wrote about the year in which podcasters were highly represented on TV. You can read Aria’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22611535"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and mine &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22611321"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Now, let’s get to the rest.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1RlOpa"&gt;
&lt;p id="4BWv2D"&gt;First, the news, which we’re going to get through quickly, so you can savor that sweet, sweet end-of-year content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVRdHB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iHeart shares year-end numbers around the Black Effect Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A8XeoT"&gt;Let’s time travel back to September 2021. At that time, iHeartMedia teamed up with Charlamagne Tha God to launch the Black Effect Network, a network run by Black leaders with the goal of reaching Black audiences. Today, the iHeart Digital Audio Group exclusively shared details on the network’s past year or so with &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt;, as well as on its Latinx-focused network My Cultura, which launched in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArevZH"&gt;Among the details: iHeart says 23 percent of its monthly podcast listeners, across all networks, are Black, up from 19 percent the year prior, and 21 percent are Hispanic, up from 18 percent in 2020. (The demographic data comes from Triton, the team says.) More specifically around the Black Effect Network, the team says ​​39 percent of all Black listeners to the iHeartPodcast Network listen to shows from the offshoot, which now includes 27 titles. Conal Byrne, CEO at iHeart Digital Audio Group, says the network accounts for more than 15 million downloads per month, as defined by the IAB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLV3L4"&gt;“We spent a great deal of investment and energy last year” on these two new networks, Byrne says, and the resulting numbers are “validation” the efforts are worthwhile. “I think what changed for us about the Black Effect was creating this atmosphere of longer tail creators being able to jump into podcasting, so not necessarily, quote unquote, just Questlove or Jada Pinkett Smith, but also people like Jess Hilarious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mUtsp"&gt;I know all of y’all reading this have lots of feeling about data, so have at it and let me know what you think. I’m always happy to see more representation in podcasting, and if it helps introduce a more diverse audience to the medium? That’s great, too. A lovely note to wrap this one up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="zXDFrS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XiWOFA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorry, but I just have to point out Spotify’s “Pod City” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwvHpB"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-12-17/spotify-unveils-podcast-hub-in-downtown-l-a"&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt; Spotify’s new, sprawling campus and casually dropped what is seemingly its internal name: “Pod City.” This is not a joke! Pod City comprises only one section of the new campus, which supports 600 employees, has 18 podcast studios, a theater, an indoor stage, and “places for musicians to tinker with vintage instruments.” All right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WSyf7Y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick profiles &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Long Gone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oN3Qaj"&gt;Another shoutout for our friend Nick Quah over at &lt;em&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt; (and one with a Spotify angle). He &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/12/how-long-gone-podcast-interview-profile.html"&gt;profiled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;How Long Gone&lt;/em&gt;, a show y’all know I’m also snacking on. For the numbers-oriented folks, hosts Chris Black and Jason Stewart say the show averages 30,000 downloads per episode. (They’re also primarily sponsored by Spotify’s Anchor.) &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4cd9bfd2-6ddf-4b2e-9ecc-6faf2546a2dd"&gt;profiled them, too,&lt;/a&gt; last week, under the angle of “podcasts capitalizing on friendships.” I think we can officially pronounce &lt;em&gt;How Long Gone&lt;/em&gt; mainstream. Done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOFMuw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global, which operates ad exchange DAX, acquires hosting platform Captivate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxO0kj"&gt;Global, a media and entertainment group, &lt;a href="https://podnews.net/press-release/global-acquires-captivate"&gt;announced its acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of the hosting platform Captivate yesterday. The release says Captivate hosts 14,000 shows and that the platform will directly integrate with Global’s DAX ad exchange. The idea clearly will be to make a bigger play for programmatic podcast ads by allowing these hosted shows to pull from that exchange for monetization. Programmatic keeps on comin’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmi1t4"&gt;And now, on to our year-end content and a reminder that we’ll be back Tuesday with our predictions for 2022. We have to see where we went before we know where we’re going, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqUeXd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable things from this year, from both myself and Aria:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LxAHDy"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;More accountability for audio job listings. &lt;/strong&gt;Audio makers increasingly demanded that job postings list exact pay upfront to prevent applicants from accepting lowball offers and reinforcing that those prices are fair (a risk that’s heightened when communicating in private, without the watchful eye of peers). Way more numbers had already started to circulate in audio-industry listservs when, less than a week ago, &lt;a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2021/12/15/city-council-passes-bill-to-mandate-salary-transparency-in-job-listings"&gt;a bill was passed&lt;/a&gt; to mandate salary disclosures for all job listings in NYC, where many media companies are based. Icing on the cake. -AB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lA453X"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Spanish-English podcasts made it big&lt;/strong&gt;, with two major ones, &lt;a href="https://www.futuromediagroup.org/labrega/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;La Brega&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.futuromediagroup.org/anything-for-selena/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anything for Selena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, having a byline shared by Futuro Studios and a well-known public radio station. As Nick &lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/the-future-in-futuro-studios/"&gt;noted in &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the year, the studio (a new division within Futuro Media Group) chose to partner up in hopes of not needing to raise additional funds but still getting to produce and market ambitious shows with separate feeds for each language — and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-podcasts-presents-the-best-of-2021/"&gt;it seems&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2021-in-review/the-best-podcasts-of-2021"&gt;have worked&lt;/a&gt;. -AB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TVt31x"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Subscriptions became a possibility for the industry’s future.&lt;/strong&gt; Apple Podcasts made its biggest move in years with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534960/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-channels-shows-app"&gt;launch of in-app, paid podcast subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;, effectively setting the industry up to move toward a different monetization model. Apple’s buy-in makes me think the broader listenership might start to accept paying for a podcast, too. Apple got us all to wear AirPods. Can it get us to pay for shows?  -AC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="3VAPtL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="S5uSnS"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Podcast unions negotiate.&lt;/strong&gt; Unions at Parcast, &lt;em&gt;The Ringer&lt;/em&gt;, and Gimlet, all notably under Spotify’s management, made moves starting late last year, with the latter two reaching agreements in April and the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ParcastUnion/status/1468293252923084802?s=20"&gt;former still negotiating&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22327090/gimlet-media-union-spotify-contract-agreement"&gt;Ashley pointed out&lt;/a&gt; in the spring, the contracts that did come to be didn’t grant members the IP rights they were looking for, but they were still noteworthy for giving form to a field where reports of overwork and underpay are pretty damn common. Just this month, podcast workers at iHeartMedia also unionized, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iheartpodunion/status/1468963170240794632"&gt;shouting out&lt;/a&gt; their recent predecessors. -AB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1qXSEY"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The line begins to blur between audiobooks and podcasts. &lt;/strong&gt;Multiple moves in audiobooks happened this year — Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776777/spotify-findaway-acquire-audiobooks-podcasts-buy"&gt;bought Findaway&lt;/a&gt;, an audiobook distributor and creator, and Pushkin Industries, which has led the way in supporting both audiobook and podcast production, continues to roll out audiobooks on private RSS feeds. Storytel, Europe’s subscription audiobook app, &lt;a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/industry-deals/article/87893-sweden-s-storytel-buys-audiobooks-com.html"&gt;bought Audiobooks.com&lt;/a&gt;, giving it a foothold in the US. The lines continue to blur, as might the distribution models. Meanwhile, Audible got into podcasts last year. So, so fuzzy.  -AC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6SxfFt"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Joe Rogan officially became fodder for parodies.&lt;/strong&gt; Everyone got the memo: enough people now know who Joe Rogan is that if you reference him, it’ll land. The comedian Tim Heidecker delivered &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6Iyg9fznvM"&gt;an entire mock episode&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; for those who like bits to go on forever, but the jokes, jabs, and references truly took all forms: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHPBU4JDPO4"&gt;a song&lt;/a&gt; about failed romantic prospects who were fans of Rogan’s; the various &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; mentions I made note of in my column; a quick crack in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mattbooshell/status/1471852068403097614"&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; by the comedian Matt Buechele; and, of course, the ever-interesting choice of making “Hoe Rogan” one’s Twitter display name. -AB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kwg74o"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Companies keep trying to take down the radio. &lt;/strong&gt;We continued to see platforms aim for a slice of the radio pie. Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726497/spotify-car-thing-hardware-waitlist"&gt;rolled out&lt;/a&gt; its Car Thing device more widely, designed to make it easier to stream from the car; Amazon Music &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372235/amazon-music-car-mode-driving-bigger-text-buttons-alexa"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; a Car Mode, also designed for the same purpose; and Spotify also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840024/spotify-whooshkaa-acquisition-tech-megaphone-hosting"&gt;acquired Whooshkaa&lt;/a&gt;, software that helps turn live radio shows into on-demand podcasts. Clearly, the tech companies believe they need to not only speed up the potential death of radio through their own devices but also be in a place to make money off the programs that go on-demand. -AC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="N2cKBy"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Everyone in Hollywood is into podcasts now. &lt;/strong&gt;You knew this one was coming. &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt; broke the news on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22833976/quentin-tarantino-podcast-recording-hot-pod"&gt;Quentin Tarantino’s new podcast project&lt;/a&gt;. J.J. Abrams’ Bad Robot &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-17/j-abrams-bad-robot-forges-new-audio-division-in-collaboration-with-spotify/"&gt;launched an audio department&lt;/a&gt; with Spotify. Ron Howard and Brian Grazer’s Imagine Entertainment &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/12/brian-grazer-ron-howards-imagine-entertainment-audio-division-iheartmedia-1234885655/"&gt;did the same with iHeart&lt;/a&gt;. Seth Rogen &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seth-rogen-to-launch-original-podcast-series-with-siriusxms-stitcher-301288704.html"&gt;launched a show&lt;/a&gt; with SiriusXM and Earwolf. And those four bits of news were just recently. I don’t foresee this trend slowing down anytime soon, so perhaps we’ll have this same bullet point in 2022. But I’ll save that for my predictions. -AC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CdYw8d"&gt;
&lt;p id="Z96t8K"&gt;That’s it! You made it. Thank you for reading. We’re skipping &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod Insider&lt;/em&gt; this week because of the holiday, but if you &lt;em&gt;haven’t &lt;/em&gt;subscribed to that now, it might be a good time. I would suggest you give it as a gift, but honestly, I can’t see the whole extended fam being thrilled to find in-depth audio industry scoops in their inbox every week. However, &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;should treat yourself. Supply chain woe-free. Have a good holiday and talk next week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8k879J"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1voaLl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose’s noise-canceling QC35 II are back down to their lowest price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bose QuietComfort 35" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o8tUJVZseoixxqI00EkKvo27HWs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70301229/theverge7_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JNvh39"&gt;A set of noise-canceling headphones should definitely come in handy if you’re planning to travel soon. They’re essential if you want to silence the hum of the jet engines or to hush distracting sounds that are keeping you from concentrating. If you’re interested in a good set that won’t cost you too much, the Bose QuietComfort 35 II headphones are $169 off their original price at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1227753/2092?subId1=TheVergeDailyDeals122021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbose-quietcomfort-35-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones-ii%2F-%2FA-52955552"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B0756CYWWD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. These retailers are selling the QC35 II for just $179.99 instead of $349, although note your order will most likely not arrive by Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vZJRT"&gt;Like their predecessor (as well as newer Bose models), these are comfortable, lightweight headphones that also come with other praiseworthy features, including good sound quality and the ability to seamlessly switch between two paired devices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review"&gt;Bose’s newer $329 QuietComfort 45 headphones&lt;/a&gt; are discounted at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-45-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B098FKXT8L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$279&lt;/a&gt;, but if those are out of your budget, the QC35 II are a solid alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="er6fV4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"65 last-minute gifts that will arrive in time for the holidays","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22840189/christmas-gifts-best-last-minute-tech-gaming-gadgets-shipping"},{"title":"Here are the shipping deadlines to get your holiday gifts there on time","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22833986/ups-usps-fedex-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target-shipping-deadlines-2021"},{"title":"Still on the hunt for the perfect gift? Here are some last-minute digital gift ideas","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22834542/digital-holiday-gift-ideas-last-minute-online-subscriptions-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="UqTmiz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="riEhkk"&gt;Shifting away from headphones to gaming, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18531144/logitech-g502-wireless-gaming-mouse-lightspeed-price-specs-features"&gt;​​Logitech’s wired G502 Hero&lt;/a&gt; gaming mouse is more affordable than usual today. This mouse shares a lot of features in common with the pricier wireless counterpart, the $150 G502 Lightspeed, except for its actual price. Best Buy is currently selling G502 Hero SE for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgfsrEREzpU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$29.99&lt;/a&gt; when you’re signed in with a free My Best Buy account (if you don’t see this price, it may reflect at checkout). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wk9VHH"&gt;What’s more, if you click on the “Hot Offer” link underneath the price, you can add a three-month subscription to PC Game Pass for just $20 (usually $29.99). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="K1DIuW"&gt;It may not arrive in time for Christmas or Kwanzaa, but the newest Fujifilm Instax Mini 11 instant camera will still make for a great belated holiday gift. Right now, you can buy select Instax Mini 11 bundle colorways for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Mini-2021-Bundle/dp/B09J97TRP5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$69.95&lt;/a&gt; instead of $79.95 from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Mini-2021-Bundle/dp/B09J97TRP5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kohls.com%2Fproduct%2Fprd-5199933%2Ffujifilm-instax-mini-11-bundle.jsp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F21%2F22846762%2Fbose-qc-35-ii-headphones-logitech-gaming-mouse-fujifilm-instax-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kohl’s&lt;/a&gt;, with the latter retailer offering an option to pick it up before the holidays if your local store has it in stock. That’s the lowest price we’ve seen so far on a bundle that includes a 10 pack of Instax Mini film, hexagon photo holders, a curved frame, and an Instax idea book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ckwmdv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10941146"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mXC9eV"&gt;Amazon is selling various Level Lock smart lock models for their second-best price to date. Right now, for example, you can buy the regular $249 Level Lock for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Level-Keyless-Smartphone-Bluetooth-Enabled/dp/B08X6R77VX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$211.60&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to keep your existing lock or you just want something a little cheaper, the Level Bolt simply replaces your lock’s internals, and it’s selling for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Level-Lock-Bolt-Edition/dp/B086VQ37W4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$179&lt;/a&gt; instead of $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTPW8x"&gt;With its discreet design, the Level Lock could easily pass as just a regular deadbolt lock. All of its electronics and mechanics are hidden inside. However, despite the plain appearance, you can open and close the lock with your phone and, if you’re an owner of an Apple HomeKit hub owner, with your voice via compatible devices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304792/level-lock-smart-homekit-review-test-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review of the Level Lock and Bolt.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C5qlQw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10941152"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="43ap0n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10941154"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ShE8yc"&gt;If you don’t mind buying it refurbished, you can save over $200 on the best drone under $1,000. DJI’s official Newegg storefront is selling a refurbished DJI Mavic Air 2 Fly More Combo for &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=Verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F380-0002-003U1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$750&lt;/a&gt; instead of $988, the cost when purchased new. This price includes the drone, a power cable, a remote controller with extra sticks, a shoulder bag, six low-noise propellers, a battery-to-power bank adapter, and more. The midrange drone offers up to 34 minutes of flight time, a built-in 48-megapixel camera, as well features like ActiveTrack 3.0, which can automatically follow a subject. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21243887/dji-mavic-air-2-2020-drone-flight-photography-video-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6NnCMn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10791622"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gj1Z5j"&gt;Check out some other notable deals:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hr7UGb"&gt;Samsung is offering around the same discount on its Frame TV as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/ref=asc_df_B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and other retailers. Right now, you can buy the 55-inch version of the smart 4K TV designed to blend in with your home’s decor for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgfJMOfqW9h" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,199.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeDeals122121&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-earbuds%2F8r9cpq146064%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,499.99.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VarHYy"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeDeals122121&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-earbuds%2F8r9cpq146064%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Buds are just $9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-earbuds%2F8r9cpq146064" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;9.99&lt;/a&gt; at the Microsoft Store. We praised this model’s comfy fit, long-lasting battery life, and fantastic voice quality as reasons to put cash down on them, except we felt that $200 was too steep. But at half that price, getting them is a much more reasonable idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PsdkfB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F483978365&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s latest iPad is $30 off at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, costing $299 for the 64GB version. It’s been a little while since we’ve seen this model selling for less than its standard price, so hopefully, it’s the first of many deals to come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gyaw9k"&gt;You can get $10 off your next purchase of $15 and up if you buy (or already own) the &lt;a href="https://store.rockstargames.com/en/game/buy-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; via the Rockstar Games Launcher. In addition, until January 5th, 2022, owners of that GTA collection can choose a PC game (from a select list) to download at no cost, including&lt;em&gt; Grand Theft Auto IV: Complete Edition&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Max Payne 3&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; L.A. Noire,&lt;/em&gt; and more. You can learn more about this deal &lt;a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/4407663218067/Grand-Theft-Auto-The-Trilogy-The-Definitive-Edition-Rockstar-Store-Offer-FAQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HDgogx"&gt;For a limited time, this fun little NERF Rival Flex XXI-100 blaster is selling for just $5.99 instead of $11.99 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1227755/2092?subId1=TheVergeDailyDeals122021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnerf-rival-flex-xxi-100-blaster%2F-%2FA-80171778" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>11 great shows from 2021 to stream on Netflix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/whJKFYWyhHqAb_nvAYXiWpIsuI8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70301162/VRG_ILLO_2021_RoundUp_NETFLIX.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A handy guide for finding the best stuff released this year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="HnjRwo"&gt;As Netflix has become more ubiquitous, it’s also become more of a challenge to sift through the seemingly never-ending list of shows on the service. There’s a lot, from reality shows about questionable animal tycoons to a plethora of video game adaptations. Sure, the really big stuff rises to the top — &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;, etc. — but there’s also a lot that’s easy to miss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NoHH3b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10927726"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="5PAjHN"&gt;
&lt;p id="EU2xJw"&gt;Lucky for you, I spend far too much time keeping up with the latest releases and have come back with 10 series that should definitely add to your Netflix rotation: everything from grisly horror to comfort food sitcoms to cozy post-apocalypses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thsOic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="D7zsVb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Svs_hl897c?rel=0&amp;amp;start=43" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1o8oiH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; is a series based on the long-running game &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, but you don’t have to know a thing about the game to enjoy it. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22763818/netflix-league-of-legends-arcane-review"&gt;this slick animated show&lt;/a&gt; actually serves as a great introduction to &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; and its steampunk-meets-fantasy universe. The story follows a handful of characters in a bustling city that’s quickly changing thanks to a new technology that can harness the power of magic. Things move at a rapid pace, making it great for binging, and oh, my goodness, is the animation &lt;em&gt;incredible&lt;/em&gt;. This might be the best-looking animated project since &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse&lt;/em&gt;. And once you do finish, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22815884/league-of-legends-ruined-king-rpg"&gt;there’s a brand-new &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; RPG that’s a perfect follow-up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="uvch3Y"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bXxwLH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="cf16Mp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oqxAJKy0ii4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K2eOwX"&gt;If you haven’t actually watched &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; yet, you’re likely at least aware of it. The show was &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; in 2021, from social media to Halloween costumes — and with good reason. The story follows a disturbing competition where hundreds of players, all struggling financially, compete at various children’s games for a chance at a huge cash prize. The twist is that the games are all deadly, and making it to the end means being the sole survivor. What follows is a grisly indictment of class and capitalism and also just a really great show that will keep you on edge the entire time. At least you’ll have some time to catch your breath &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772170/squid-game-season-two-netflix-director-confirms"&gt;before season 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="pSIZDB"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BJt1kd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hellbound&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="a0XL9w"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UWfgm20-LTM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hlcS2j"&gt;Show titles don’t get much more literal than &lt;em&gt;Hellbound&lt;/em&gt;. The show is about a mysterious phenomenon in which angel-like creatures start appearing before people, telling them that they’re bound for hell. Even worse, they’re given a specific time so they know exactly how long they have left to live. When that time hits, terrifying monsters attack, resulting in some very bloody deaths. These grisly episodes are at the heart of the show, but they’re also mostly an excuse to explore deeper questions about everything from the power of religion to internet-fueled mobs. &lt;em&gt;Hellbound &lt;/em&gt;also doesn’t overstay its welcome: at just six episodes long, it’s prime binge material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9J24i9"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BuBYv8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="WID1Lc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TJFVV2L8GKs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7OYqK0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;’s first season&lt;/a&gt; helped solidify it as one of the best dark fantasy epics around, combining political intrigue and scary monsters with lots of sex and humor. It was tense and bloody but also a lot of fun. Now we have a second season, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22826460/witcher-season-2-review-netflix"&gt;which leans a little more towards the serious side&lt;/a&gt;, but still manages to be a great watch thanks to the incredible cast, led by the gruff-as-always Geralt, played by Henry Cavill. And the franchise keeps growing: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638162/the-witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-review-netflix"&gt;there’s an animated prequel out now&lt;/a&gt; and a live-action spinoff starring Michelle Yeoh on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="klwVzh"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VsEUSy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nailed It&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="wKTiIV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XgHdBTeloek?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U22pNH"&gt;Sometimes you just need to turn off your brain, and there are few better ways of doing that than watching comedian Nicole Byers and chef Jacque Torres host a competition for the world’s worst bakers. What makes &lt;em&gt;Nailed It&lt;/em&gt; work so well, beyond the undeniable chemistry of its hosts, is that everyone is in on the joke, so you never feel guilty laughing when someone serves a mushy pile of icing that’s supposed to be a cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="QFudFA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3RfUEw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="bfDHEw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zG9RuJb3QU?rel=0&amp;amp;start=36" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yb7EIf"&gt;There are a lot of post-apocalyptic shows, and the vast majority are grim and depressing. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22518583/netflix-sweet-tooth-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; mostly avoids this&lt;/a&gt;. Partially, that’s due to the Americana vibe, which almost makes the end of the world seem cozy. But most of it comes down to the main character Sweet Tooth himself. The show’s version of the apocalypse begins when a sickness wipes out much of the population, coinciding with the mysterious appearance of animal-human hybrids. The story follows Sweet Tooth, a young boy with antlers whose wide-eyed curiosity and infectious cheer make it impossible not to root for him. The show is still dark and often uncomfortable, but it has just enough hope to make it tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="sBbZtb"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nOi8DJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brand New Cherry Flavor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="vYGBcM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wOzM3c33TVg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cKfxn1"&gt;If there is an opposite of comfort viewing, that would be &lt;em&gt;Brand New Cherry Flavor&lt;/em&gt;. The horror series follows a budding director who turns to a witch in order to get revenge on a backstabbing producer. From there, things just get increasingly more horrifying but in a way that’s hard to look away from. &lt;em&gt;Brand New Cherry Flavor&lt;/em&gt; particularly excels when it comes to body horror; there are a handful of disturbing scenes that will stick with you long after you finish watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="UxXl99"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VJD8Lh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sex Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="quQLYi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zmgYlYw7Uwk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VXEmBY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sex Education&lt;/em&gt; is one of the rare high school dramas that just keeps getting better. The show is ostensibly about a therapist, played by Gillian Anderson, and her son, as they (separately) help just about everyone around them with sex-related problems. But from that simple premise, the show has blossomed to be one of the most frank and diverse explorations of sexuality on television. It’s a joy to watch these characters grow over time, and the new third season does an amazing job of introducing plenty of change without getting away from what makes the show work so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bZELqA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mdM94o"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="hT19IY"&gt;Director Mike Flanagan has had an incredible run of horror anthologies on Netflix. It started with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17911720/haunting-of-hill-house-review-netflix-shirley-jackson-mike-flanagan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Haunting of Hill House&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, continued with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21508362/haunting-of-bly-manor-review-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Haunting of Bly Manor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and now we have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683761/midnight-mass-review-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The latest series has plenty that will be familiar to fans of his work — a troubled family, mysterious supernatural elements, oh-so-long monologues — but it also takes a turn to more straight-up horror. It takes a little while to get going, but when &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; eventually ramps up, it becomes an exquisite mix of scares and heartbreak that reaches a fever pitch with a truly wild and bloody final episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="5GBYFR"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="L1T94p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="BFva5h"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQXKyIG_NS4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VUBVqJ"&gt;What’s the deal with classic sitcoms on streaming services? While original series are typically what define a streamer, older shows are also a big part of the business. That’s why Netflix made such a big deal of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652391/seinfeld-netflix-october-streaming-wars-friends-the-office"&gt;bringing every episode of &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; to the service earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. And for a show that’s very much a product of the ’90s, it manages to stand up pretty well in 2021 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704399/seinfeld-aspect-ratio-netflix-4k-widescreen-letterbox-streaming-hd"&gt;so long as you aren’t too bothered about aspect ratios&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="cvCVTo"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uWk3yF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call My Agent!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call My Agent!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JNzfJx"&gt;Netflix has lately been featuring a number of series from non-English-speaking countries, and one of the most fun is &lt;em&gt;Call My Agent!&lt;/em&gt; This French comedy takes us through four seasons of the trials and tribulations of a Paris talent firm as they deal with rambunctious movie stars (played as caricatured versions of themselves by the real actors), difficult love affairs, and desperate attempts to keep their floundering agency afloat. The series (originally called &lt;em&gt;Dix pour cent&lt;/em&gt; or “Ten percent”) has been so successful that it’s spawned a couple of knock-offs and an upcoming fifth season. &lt;em&gt;(Barbara Krasnoff)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GeoGuessr made figuring out where on Earth you are the hottest new esport</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A collage of famous landmarks (Eiffel Tower, the Colosseum), confusing signage, and maps." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JBPuRr9uQ2PW8unzOFS5GOrsPCM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70301051/acastro_211216_4930_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The years-old browser game became a competitive thrill this year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="0561oB"&gt;The camera-mounted Google truck that drove through South Africa’s Kruger National Park is equipped with a distinct, camo-green paint job and a pair of white racks resting on its rooftop. The car can’t be found anywhere else on Earth; so, if you pan down and see its blurry edges on Street View, you know that you’re somewhere within a 7,523 square mile radius north of Eswatini and west of Mozambique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOzq2N"&gt;This is a completely useless piece of trivia for everyone except those who take &lt;a href="https://www.geoguessr.com/"&gt;the browser game &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; very, very seriously — and more people are joining those ranks every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hq818"&gt;The game is simple. In each round, a player is dropped at a random location on Google Street View’s wide, interlocking atlas, potentially anywhere across the globe. Using only the context clues gleaned from the surrounding fauna, climate, billboards, and language, players are challenged to identify their coordinates on a map as accurately as they can and, in certain competitive settings, as fast as they can. So, at the highest levels of cutthroat metagaming ambition, the contours of the Kruger National Park’s truck becomes vital information — a way to separate the pros from the hobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="og52mJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uh4guW7aYXc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nwBH94"&gt;“You might not see that car again for two years playing the game,” says RadoX1988, one of the moderators of &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr’s&lt;/em&gt; competitive subreddit, who asks to be referred to by his online pseudonym. “But if you can remember it, over a long period of time, that becomes a massive advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2PGSI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; was never designed to be played at high stakes. The game arrived in 2013 as a freeware project authored by a Swedish IT professional named Anton Wallén, right as Google was working to fill in the gaps to worldwide camera coverage. (“Was fiddling around with backbone and Google maps API v3 and decided to make a small application. Would appreciate your feedback/suggestions?” wrote Wallén on an ancient &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1clk3h/was_fiddling_around_with_backbone_and_google_maps/"&gt;Reddit thread unveiling GeoGuessr’s original incarnation.&lt;/a&gt;) It became one of those enduring social media curios — something you showed your mom on winter break. The idea that anyone would grind away at Wallén’s invention in the same way that top &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; guilds plowed through raid bosses was totally ludicrous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="S8Mz8Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pro players can “find out where they are based on the road, the sun, the environment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="whIwdr"&gt;And yet, scores of subscribers now log on YouTube to watch &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; semi-pros like Tom Davies, aka GeoWizard, who’ve trained long and hard to become oracular, all-seeing masters of Google Street View. It’s incredible to watch him cook. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh4guW7aYXc"&gt;Davies plops into a bustling flea market&lt;/a&gt;, pans the camera around, and sees the abbreviation “KSI” on a banner. “Does that stand for Kumasi?” a city in central Ghana. He pins down his location with omnipotent precision. (“2.2 miles away, fair enough,” he says.) A few minutes later, Davies touches down on a tranquil river and investigates a few highway signs bearing some telltale script: “I think this is Montenegro.” He comes within five yards of an exact match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jV5Wk6"&gt;Davies is the harbinger of one of the most unexpected trends in gaming. In 2021, more than 240,000 people follow the &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr &lt;/em&gt;tag on Twitch, and a casual competition in late October, hosted by the French player AntoineDaniel, earned over 100,000 views. At a time when the future of the esports industry is in flux — with &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/esports/2021/04/12/esports-investments-spacs/"&gt;economists warning of market corrections&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.esports.net/news/overwatch-league-is-haemorrhaging-viewers-and-sponsors/"&gt;high-profile leagues teetering on the brink&lt;/a&gt; — plenty of young players discovered that nothing in video games rivals the drama of scouring a map as the timer ticks down, unsure if you’re in either Vietnam or Cambodia.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6cJg7"&gt;RadoX1988 isn’t sure how all of this happened. When he started participating in the &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; subreddit in 2017, there were only about 10 users actively competing. “We all just played the daily challenge together, and that was it,” he says. Participation grew slowly through the end of 2020, when suddenly, a huge swathe of fresh blood poured into the community, eager to showcase their topographic aptitude. RadoX1988 speculates that a zeitgeist circled around &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr’s&lt;/em&gt; newly launched “Battle Royale” mode — translating the anxious, one-vs-all bedlam of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; into the sedate act of map-pointing — which hit live servers last winter. “That made &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; mainstream for the first time,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of GeoGuessr showing a road, a tree, some buildings, and power lines. Google Street View controls let the player manipulate the game. A map in the bottom right corner lets players guess where they are." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/auqc6QucgPDAVQvPHVEc0diG5fQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115692/Screen_Shot_2021_12_20_at_3.29.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;GeoGuessr gives you Street View controls, a map, and the challenge of figuring out where on Earth you are.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ClNMo0"&gt;Filip Antell, head of communications at &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt;, says he welcomes the newly energized cast of pin-droppers tearing up the game. The team released a “Pro Leagues” function, where players can create their own round-robin competitions among invitees. They’ve also put together a “Career Mode” with daily challenges and experience points, which evokes the enveloping progression systems you might find in &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike, &lt;/em&gt;nudging &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; closer to esports terrain. “When you look at the pro players that can be dropped anywhere in the world and actually find out where they are based on the road, the sun, the environment, it’s really jaw-dropping,” says Antell. “And I believe that when you see someone being able to differentiate and excel in that, it also encourages you to do the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9X1TXS"&gt;There’s no centralized competitive infrastructure in &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; — nobody battles in this game while swaddled in plush, nylon FaZe Clan jerseys — so those invested in the art of atlas combat must create their own rivals. Anyone can host a tournament, and they come in all sorts of different flavors. There’s an ongoing Reddit League, complete with a stringent regular season that ranks players on their win/loss records before eventually crowning a winner and relegating the bottom-feeders. Each week, the Street View action goes down in a distinct region (Germany, Guatemala, Saskatchewan), accentuating the versatility necessary for longitudinal superiority. “You have to be serious about it and play on the regular,” says RadoX1988. There is also a “World Cup” challenge, in which players compete head to head in “home” and “away” games. The first match takes place in one player’s chosen country, the second in the other’s backyard, like a summer series between the Yankees and Red Sox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="S2Xg7I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is very hard for organizers to be able to prevent cheating.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EPqBGM"&gt;That said, there are rarely any prizes on the line in high-level &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; play. Zotomo, a tournament organizer in Japan, tells me champions will occasionally receive a small trophy or a &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; Prime subscription — which guarantees an unlimited number of free games on the platform. But for the most part, the only reward is bragging rights. This is the nature of the beast. &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; is a free browser game with no security safeguards or automated pit bosses, explains Zotomo. That makes it easy for someone to open a surreptitious tab and Google the name of whatever street they happen to land on, totally derailing the spirit of sportsmanship. “It is very hard for organizers to be able to prevent cheating,” says Zotomo. “So no serious prizes can be given away without a lot of issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kF9bKT"&gt;It’s the elephant in the room and perhaps the only barrier facing &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; as it continues to stretch its legs as a nascent esport. Wallén developed this game on the back of data scraped directly from Google, and as such, &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; headquarters will never be fully in control of its servers. Does that rule out a timeline full of LAN events, cash prizes, and all the pageantry we associate with the modern esports industry? Not necessarily. “Having an official &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr Masters&lt;/em&gt; would be really interesting to set up in the future,” says Antell. “If one can dream.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="fysyHu"&gt;I understand his optimism. The &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; team has already beaten the odds by proving that a geography game can exist in the same competitive atmosphere as &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;. Scores of players are pouring in, all of whom are eager to demonstrate how quickly they can identify the trucks of Kruger National Park. With just the sun, the mountains, and a handful of road signs, the sky’s the limit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This security researcher fooled an at-home COVID-19 test using a Bluetooth hack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qvBiYR7p7g7U4elz1kP2CFUgDDI=/42x0:1092x700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70300934/img_product_consumer02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Researchers were able to exploit Ellume’s at-home test.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ellume&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q1xB3S"&gt;A security researcher was able to change the results of an at-home COVID test and get those results certified by intercepting and modifying Bluetooth traffic from the device before it reached the app. The researcher, Ken Gannon, found the flaw in Ellume’s nasal swab test, which is designed to analyze and transmit data to a companion app which displays and saves the results. According to a press release from F-Secure, the security company Gannon consults for, Ellume has now fixed the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JqBt3"&gt;The process of falsifying results wasn’t a simple one — according to F-Secure’s writeup, the researcher used a rooted Android device to tap into and analyze the data the tester was sending to the app. From there, Gannon was able to determine how the results were sent, and how their authenticity was verified. Then, he wrote two scripts that were able to successfully change a negative result into a positive one. When he got an email with his results from Ellume, he says, it incorrectly showed he had tested positive. If you’re interested in the technical details, you can &lt;a href="https://labs.f-secure.com/blog/faking-a-positive-covid-test"&gt;read the writeup here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iWnpUY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ellume says it’s followed recommendations to make this type of exploit harder&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BXstvC"&gt;Ellume says it followed F-Secure’s recommendations to do more analysis to ensure that data was accurate, and made changes to the app that should make it harder to analyze its data or take over the data transmission. Gannon told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that he didn’t test to see if his research was applicable to the iOS version of the app, and that the goal of his research was “to see if an ‘average person’ can fake a positive/negative COVID test.” He said that, in theory, “a dedicated threat actor could use [his] research to modify the Ellume app to always report a positive / negative result,” which could be installed on a non-rooted phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTYLpU"&gt;While Gannon’s writeup only includes changing negative results to positive ones, he says in F-Secure’s press release that “the process works both ways.” Before Ellume’s patches, Gannon says that “someone with the proper motivation and technical skills could’ve used these flaws to ensure they, or someone they’re working with, gets a negative result every time they’re tested.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a41Vxq"&gt;In theory, a fake certification could be submitted to meet US re-entry requirements. Not only was F-Secure able to get an incorrect result certified, it did so without &lt;a href="https://www.azova.com/testing/ellume/"&gt;a video test supervisor&lt;/a&gt; being able to detect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgG0gR"&gt;The press release says Ellume is now working on a “verification portal” that will let authorities verify that its at-home tests are authentic, and has gone back to analyze all its previous results for accuracy. Ellume says it found that none of them had been faked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s big holiday update adds TikTok and playable Sonic the Hedgehog  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Tesla Model 3 interior is displayed with a Sega Genesis game controller sitting under the infotainment screen with a window on the screen showing the game Sonic 1." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_UD039NLuQ9srYlRdeWAJUoMeAQ=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70300924/IMG_0936.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the Sonic 1 title screen opened in the Tesla web browser taken prior to its release.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="atniDs"&gt;Tesla’s annual holiday software update for its cars is here, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/20/tesla-releases-big-holiday-update-tiktok-app-ui-changes/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. It includes useful driving features like automatic access to a car’s blind spot cameras, as well as fun additions like new games built into Tesla Arcade, TikTok support, and a feature that lets the electric cars “dance to a choreographed light show.” The update’s version number is 2021.44.25, and should be rolling out over the coming days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYQRCp"&gt;The most useful inclusion in the update could be its blind spot camera feature which automatically shows a live camera view of the car’s blind spot whenever a driver activates a turn signal. Tesla CEO Elon Musk indicated the feature was in development &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1281121939600207873"&gt;in July 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but now it’s here to (hopefully) make maneuvers like changing highway lanes a little bit safer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FFLVTm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sure&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1281121939600207873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 9, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n7jDOZ"&gt;Other practical improvements include an easier way to add multiple waypoints to a journey, and simplified controls for accessing a car’s primary controls. It’s also now possible to drag and drop your most frequently used apps to customize the car’s menu bar, and the heaters in the front seats can now regulate temperature based on how hot it is in the car generally.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RezT1V"&gt;Of course, this being Tesla, there are a number of less essential and more fun inclusions in the update. TikTok videos can now be watched directly from the car’s touchscreen via Tesla Theater, and Tesla Arcade has been updated with new games like the original &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834023/sega-genesis-sonic-1-tesla-arcade"&gt;announced earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;em&gt;Sudoku&lt;/em&gt;. It’s probably best to save these for when the car is stationary, although &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823127/tesla-car-arcade-games-safety-nhtsa"&gt;controversially they’re also playable by passengers&lt;/a&gt; while a vehicle is in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tP4l2c"&gt;Finally there’s “Light Show,” a feature that appears to be coming to all Tesla’s after being shown off on the &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2015/12/23/the-tesla-model-x-flaps-its-wings-with-a-xmas-theme-light-show-video/"&gt;Model X in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. Many thanks to u/Emulsifide for posting a complete record of the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/rl21jd/tesla_20214425/"&gt;update’s changelog to Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7GZaaz"&gt;Exactly one year from the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202973/xiaomi-mi-11-flagship-announced-chinese-variant"&gt;Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;, Xiaomi is set to launch the successor on December 28th, the company has announced via its &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/2202387347/L72AgfN3a?pagetype=profilefeed"&gt;official Weibo account&lt;/a&gt;. The new lineup will be called the Xiaomi 12 series, following the company’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639020/xiaomi-mi-brand-ending-mix-4-confirmed"&gt;phase out its Mi branding&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. A teaser poster features Chinese sprinter Su Bingtian, which sets the expectation that the event is likely to be focused on the Chinese market before the Xiaomi flagships make their way to global markets in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzrwtN"&gt;Xiaomi’s 12 series lineup could include as many as four different devices, &lt;a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-12-12x-pro-series-launch-date-december-28-poster-ultra-specifications-features-2662501"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Gadgets 360&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These include the Xiaomi 12, the 12 Pro, the 12X, and the 12 Ultra, although it’s possible that not all of them will be announced during the December event (this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;Mi 11 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t announced until late March, for example). &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/12/21/xiaomi-12-12x-12-pro-names-launch-date-confirmed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmochina &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Xiaomi executives have been spotted using the other three phones to post to their Weibo accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="tl" dir="ltr"&gt;Xiaomi 12 and 12 Pro  coming &lt;a href="https://t.co/HRCYuamab9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HRCYuamab9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ice universe (@UniverseIce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1473190043711782912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YrsKej"&gt;There aren’t many official details about the upcoming handsets, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leijun/status/1465843044415336449"&gt;Xiaomi has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that they’ll be powered by Qualcomm’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809687/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-chip-smartphone-processor-specs-details"&gt;Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor&lt;/a&gt;. Apparent marketing images of the Xiaomi 12 and 12 Pro shared by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1473190043711782912"&gt;leaker @UniverseIce on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; show the phones will feature centrally orientated hole-punch cameras. Other rumored specs of the Xiaomi 12 include a triple rear camera, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1471470228089585682"&gt;leaked renders from @OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt;, with a 50-megapixel primary sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4csX7"&gt;Although Xiaomi’s phones don’t have much of a presence in the US, it’s ranked as the &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/europe-smartphone-market-q3-2021/"&gt;second biggest smartphone manufacturer in Europe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartphone-share/"&gt;second biggest Android manufacturer in the world&lt;/a&gt; behind Samsung. Demand is driven by phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;Xiaomi Mi 11&lt;/a&gt; which offers comparable specs to Samsung’s flagships at much more affordable prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFsnAi"&gt;The Xiaomi Mi 11 launched globally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272003/xiaomi-mi-11-international-price-release-date-announcement"&gt;in February this year&lt;/a&gt;, which hopefully means that the international version of the Xiaomi 12 will arrive soon after the December event.&lt;/p&gt;
