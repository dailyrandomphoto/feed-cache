    <title>Airbnb will hide guests’ names to fight discrimination (but only in Oregon)</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TsvRLF"&gt;Airbnb announced that it’s changing the way guest profiles are displayed in its app — for Oregon residents specifically. Airbnb hosts who are based in Oregon will now see a potential guest’s initials, rather than their full name, until after they’ve confirmed that guest’s booking request. The change will fully roll out by January 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6AQxz"&gt;The change aims to prevent racial discrimination among hosts, &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/update-for-guests-who-are-oregon-residents/"&gt;per the company’s announcement&lt;/a&gt;, by stopping them from gleaning a guest’s race from their name. &lt;a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/racial-discrimination-in-the-sharing-economy-evidence-from-a-field-experiment"&gt;A 2016 study&lt;/a&gt; found that Airbnb guests with names that sounded Black were 16 percent less likely to have bookings confirmed than guests with names that sounded white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQMlsB"&gt;The announcement follows a &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2019/08/airbnb-settles-oregon-discrimination-suit.html"&gt;voluntary settlement agreement&lt;/a&gt; that Airbnb reached in 2019 with three Portland-area women who had sued the company. The plaintiffs, all Black, alleged that the platform allowed hosts to discriminate against Black users in requiring guests to attach names and photographs to their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSu5PR"&gt;After settling with the plaintiffs, Airbnb announced that it would “review and update the way profile names are displayed to hosts as part of the booking process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLeeaH"&gt;The company has been vocal about its support for racial justice in the past. It now requires users to agree to an &lt;a href="https://blog.atairbnb.com/the-airbnb-community-commitment/"&gt;Airbnb Community Commitment&lt;/a&gt; certifying that they won’t discriminate. It also launched &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fresources%2Fhosting-homes%2Fa%2Fa-new-way-were-fighting-discrimination-on-airbnb-201&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Project Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative to uncover and research discrimination on its platform, in the summer of 2020. Prior to the launch of that program, the company says it did not have a way to measure “larger trends and patterns related to discrimination” across its bookings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kfx67i"&gt;Airbnb guests are not required to provide profile photos (though hosts can require them in order to book their properties). Since 2018 (&lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/front-porch/2017/03/oregon_woman_sues_airbnb_says.html"&gt;post-lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, pre-settlement), the platform has also &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fresources%2Fhosting-homes%2Fa%2Fairbnb-answers-guest-profile-photos-77&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;kept guest photographs invisible to hosts&lt;/a&gt; before bookings are confirmed. That change, also intended to combat discrimination, has proved somewhat controversial among Airbnb’s users, some of whom worry that it could put marginalized guests in dangerous situations they’d otherwise avoid. “I’d rather get declined for a reservation than beaten or killed!” one user lamented in the company’s &lt;a href="https://community.withairbnb.com/t5/Hosting/Horrible-And-Dangerous-New-Profile-Pic-Policy/td-p/924339"&gt;community center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4jvtz"&gt;But if the company does expect such a strategy to reduce discrimination, why is it limited to Oregon? Reached for comment, Airbnb spokesperson Liz DeBold Fusco did not directly address whether this feature will expand in the future. Fusco pointed to language in Airbnb’s announcement post, which reads, “As part of our ongoing work, we will take any learnings from this process and use them to inform future efforts to fight bias.” The company added that it plans to “continue working with our Hosts and guests, and with civil rights leaders to make our community more inclusive.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new ad invites you to imagine dying alone without a Watch on your wrist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EsscqcojoVWyol0sEAfxmpAttbo=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70336936/maxresdefault__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cx6aL7"&gt;Apple wants you to know that buying a $400 smartwatch could be a matter of life-and-death — and it’s brilliantly, gruesomely captured that feeling in a new TV ad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJXVSP"&gt;Titled “911,” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ2JiwEARFo"&gt;the one-minute ad spot&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t show any of the gory details — you simply hear three phone conversations between 911 operators and people who managed to use their Apple Watch when facing seemingly imminent death: one who might drown in a sinking car, one who fell a great distance and broke his leg, and a paddleboarder who got swept out to sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiOZiV"&gt;They each have a happy ending, Apple informs us: “With the help of their watch, Jason, Jim, and Amanda were rescued in minutes.” But the underlying message is brutally clear: if they didn’t have this miraculous life-saving product on their wrists, they could have died alone. Apple is well known for commissioning heartstring-plucking ads, and this one is no exception: it’s painfully easy to imagine myself bleeding out or drowning, with no help on the way, when I listen to their scared voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPI9Bg"&gt;I’m torn about this marketing, because it partially rings true. You don’t have to search long to find people who believe the Apple Watch genuinely saved their life. I nearly bought one for my dad a while back, believing it a small price to pay just in case it made a difference. (He declined; for one thing, he’s on Android.) Even though there are other smartwatches that could theoretically make emergency calls, I don’t think it’s a stretch to say an Apple Watch is the obvious choice, particularly if you believe the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936113/apple-watch-emergency-sos-fall-detection-set-up-how-to"&gt;fall detection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702151/apple-watch-heartbeat-irregular-pulse-afib"&gt;irregular heartbeat flagging&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527707/apple-health-data-eldery-falls-walking-privacy"&gt;walking steadiness indicator&lt;/a&gt; might also help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ff3a22"&gt;But that doesn’t change the fact that Apple is now selling you on &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt;, edging into shady insurance salesman territory to do so. It’s a good ad, but it feels a little shameless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0wCqeo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new health features bring new focus to elder care technology","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527707/apple-health-data-eldery-falls-walking-privacy"},{"title":"Apple is bringing car crash detection to the iPhone, says the Wall Street Journal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757102/apple-iphone-car-crash-detection-feature-onstar"},{"title":"The Apple Watch heart monitor sends too many people to the doctor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496813/apple-watch-heart-monitor-ekg-false-positive"},{"title":"Apple Watch Series 7 review: time and time again","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Ussr4T"&gt;Besides, the feature Apple’s showing off here is still &lt;em&gt;a &lt;/em&gt;phone call — something you can also do with a phone. This is an optional, pricey gadget you have to remember to put on your wrist, compared to the phone that every Apple Watch customer already owns and keeps on their person — except, perhaps, in the middle of a car accident or a paddleboarding excursion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9brOLs"&gt;If I were in a life-or-death situation like these, would I really dial 911 from my watch? Perhaps I would, and be grateful. But I think it’s more likely I’d have my phone, rather than the Apple Watch that spends most of its time forgotten on my bedside shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TP2Sbu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T and Verizon may have to delay 5G deployments another two weeks over airline safety fears</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQc0cfDVFbOQyriJ8meFsw6J9eQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70336748/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OOFwVV"&gt;US officials have asked AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon to further delay new 5G deployments so that the Federal Aviation Administration can have more time to determine where they might interfere with airlines. US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson sent a letter to the CEOs of the two telecoms on Friday requesting a delay of “no more than two weeks,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-officials-ask-att-verizon-delay-5g-wireless-over-aviation-safety-concerns-2021-12-31/"&gt;according to Reuters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8V1bx"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon had already delayed these deployments by a month over regulators’ concerns and planned to start the rollout on January 5th as a result. The two telecoms now &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/buttigieg-delay-5g-service-airline-safety-concerns-verizon-wireless-att-2022-1"&gt;tell &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;they are reviewing the latest request for a further delay. Buttigieg and Dickson write that, even with an additional delay, they expect 5G deployment will still begin in January “with certain exceptions around priority airports.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RXyjNT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Carriers are miffed about the delays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EnAkNi"&gt;The two telecoms are eager to start deploying the new 5G spectrum that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;they bought in early 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which uses the so-called C-band frequencies. Those frequencies of spectrum allow radio waves to hit a sweet spot between high speeds and long distances, allowing for higher-speed 5G deployments than traditional LTE spectrum can achieve, without the stifling distance limitations that come with millimeter wave 5G. Getting these deployments out is a critical step for AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon to make 5G a worthwhile upgrade and stay competitive with T-Mobile, which has &lt;a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/t-mobiles-mid-band-5g-network-surpasses-200m-people-covered/2021/11/"&gt;already started deploying&lt;/a&gt; its own similar spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNSRyV"&gt;Officials have been concerned that C-band frequencies could interfere with altimeters and prevent the use of guided landing systems meant for times of low-visibility, threatening the safety of aircraft. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822875/5g-faa-rule-c-band-landing-airport-bad-weather-visibility"&gt;On December 7th&lt;/a&gt;, the FAA went so far as to tell pilots they wouldn’t be able to use those guided and automatic landing systems at airports where there’s deemed to be interference, which could theoretically lead to many flight delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXBwPU"&gt;Buttigieg and Dickson want to identify “priority airports” and mitigation strategies so that most large commercial aircraft can “operate safely in all conditions.” Some proposals revolve around placing 5G “buffer zones” around airports, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/airlines-brace-for-flight-restrictions-in-5g-standoff-11639929603"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOIwwt"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are pretty unhappy about the delays. On Friday, the companies accused the aerospace industry of holding deployment “hostage” unless they covered the cost of altimeter upgrades. Verizon also went in on the airline industry, telling &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, “This industry which got a $54 billion taxpayer-funded, government bail out over the past couple years clearly has much bigger issues to worry about.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Winnie-the-Pooh and around 400,000 early sound recordings enter public domain</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hbUJyI4NtyS1oYJ_rTSUakyu9mc=/0x6:468x318/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70336490/WinnieThePooh.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cover art for A. A. Milne’s &lt;em&gt;Winnie-the-Pooh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xTHmug"&gt;A. A. Milne’s &lt;em&gt;Winnie-the-Pooh&lt;/em&gt;, Ernest Hemingway’s &lt;em&gt;The Sun Also Rises&lt;/em&gt;, and other books, movies, and compositions from 1926 enter into the public domain today in the US. The works are now “free for all to copy, share, and build upon,” &lt;a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2022/"&gt;according to Duke’s Center for the Study of the Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks which copyrighted materials will become public each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDk9sJ"&gt;This year, the usual list of books, movies, and compositions comes with a sizable bonus: a trove of around 400,000 early sound recordings. A recent law, the 2018 Music Modernization Act, standardized how early sound recordings are handled under federal copyright law. As part of that, it set today as the date that copyright protections would end for “recordings first published before 1923.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3gG9Tp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The advent of sound recording technology all the way through to early jazz and blues”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGhoGA"&gt;The recordings include “everything from the advent of sound recording technology all the way through to early jazz and blues,” Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke’s public domain center, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/31/1069434896/winnie-the-pooh-and-more-works-will-enter-the-public-domain-tomorrow"&gt;recently told &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The recordings include works from Ethel Waters, Mamie Smith, and The Sousa Band, among many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lit7jg"&gt;Until a couple years ago, a 20-year copyright extension had stopped additional works from entering into the public domain. Passed in 1998, the law was widely seen as a protective measure for Disney, since the earliest Mickey Mouse cartoons, released in 1928, were just years from falling out of copyright. Those are now slated to enter public domain in 2024 — as long as there isn’t another last-minute update to the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GltCjZ"&gt;This year’s batch already starts to add some complications for Disney. Both Winnie-the-Pooh&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and Felix Salten’s &lt;em&gt;Bambi, A Life in the Woods &lt;/em&gt;head into the public domain today. Disney still retains copyright over its newer works and adaptations (and, as Jenkins points out, Disney holds brand trademarks as well). But the public is now free to reprint the original book, adapt it into a play or film, write a sequel, or use the appearance and traits of any of its characters, according to Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rXZ1e"&gt;You can now do all of this “without having to seek a license from Disney,” Jenkins writes. “This is how the public domain supports creativity.” (But heads up: Tigger wasn’t introduced until a couple years later, so that character still belongs to Disney.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8Uhh2"&gt;Remixers may still have trouble navigating Disney’s control over the brand and later works, though. Jenkins has &lt;a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2022/bcvpd/"&gt;an entire piece up&lt;/a&gt; exploring how that could play out and explaining how brands aren’t allowed — or, at least, aren’t &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be allowed — to use trademark to bully people out of accessing public domain properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="intjls"&gt;So what we see remixers attempt (and get away with) over the next couple years when it comes to Pooh and friends could be a preview of how Disney will respond when the earliest Mickey Mouse copyright expires in just a couple years’ time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Merry Christmas! Santander Claus made a $176 million payment mistake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="IRAQ-NEW YEAR-CHRISTMAS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hxXwzt5nlwVB5SKcSXcuCXJO3Z0=/1x0:5461x3640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70335231/1237483801.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by HUSSEIN FALEH/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ve6QaU"&gt;Some tens of thousands of people woke up on Christmas Day to doubled wages and a higher-than-expected bank balance after Santander did an oopsie, depositing £130 million ($176 million) into accounts held by its UK customers. Santander would now like the money back, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="928ipr"&gt;The deposit mishap was the result of a mysterious “scheduling issue,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/santander-bank-error-gives-thousands-an-unexpected-christmas-bonus-dd5vt2g87"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which first reported the story. The bank confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that some payments were accidentally doubled. (Santander is characterizing it as a “technical issue.”) Those transactions included those from 2,000 businesses, as well as accidental deposits across 75,000 accounts of individuals and companies like a corporate Ebeneezer Scrooge who’d been scared into generosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7tscZh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Santander will now use a process called ​​“bank error recovery” to collect the funds&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="37nhG6"&gt;The bank is now working to undo that generosity, Santander confirmed. Unfortunately for Santander, many of the deposits were made to accounts at other financial institutions, including HSBC, Barclays, and others. Santander will now use a process called ​​“bank error recovery” to collect the funds, though it’s unclear how many individuals have already spent the money, which could make this process a nightmare for the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYlgsS"&gt;Incidentally, large sums of money being whoopsed into the wrong accounts is not uncommon. In April, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/business/bank-deposit-error-charles-schwab.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that a Louisiana woman was charged with fraud after failing to return $1.2 million mistakenly deposited into her account by Charles Schwab, which had originally intended to move just $82.56 into a Fidelity account. Kelyn Spadoni had used the funds to buy, among other things, a house and an SUV. She was subsequently fired from her job as a 911 dispatcher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oW2k7s"&gt;Chase Bank, meanwhile, mistakenly deposited $50 billion into a Louisiana man’s account earlier this year. In a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/03/us/50-billion-mistakenly-deposited-bank-account-louisiana/index.html"&gt;statement to &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in July, Chase Bank blamed the issue on a “technical glitch,” adding that the account was ultimately returned to its correct balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlw5KL"&gt;In most cases, as with the aforementioned goofs, mistakenly deposited funds should be returned. One notable exception is Citibank’s $900 million mistake. After accidentally wiring nearly a &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; dollars to hedge funds, some of those hedge funds decided to hang on to the money — and a court ruled that was perfectly fine, due to pre-existing loan terms and convoluted systems Citi had in place for sending funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHIfO6"&gt;Unfortunately, “finders keepers” likely does not apply to the Santander crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 will close a day early because of COVID concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CES-2016-stock-verge-10" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KJng5S0iChVrOuaRcv-whEF9uDg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70334726/CES-2016-stock-verge-10.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X3M40f"&gt;CES has dropped the last day of its 2022 tech conference in Las Vegas, and the show will now end on January 7th, the Consumer Technology Association announced today. The shorter schedule is “an additional safety measure” in the face of a surge of COVID-19 diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFgIXC"&gt;Over the last two weeks, a number of large companies — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22850502/ces-2022-exhibitors-dropping-bmw-ibm-mercedes"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;Intel, AMD, GM, Google, T-Mobile, Amazon,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22853157/ces-microsoft-canceled-omicron-covid"&gt;Microsoft &lt;/a&gt;and the company formerly known as Facebook — have dropped their physical presences at the conference. It’s the largest tech conference in the world, which typically pulls more than 10,000 people in each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s558Kt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The CTA’s president and CEO has said the show “will and must go on.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jL08Yd"&gt;Yesterday the US set a grim new record in COVID: &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/30/us/coronavirus-cases-high.html"&gt;the highest number of infections reported daily&lt;/a&gt; — breaking a record set the day before. Las Vegas is located in Clark County, Nevada, &lt;a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/health/coronavirus-health/new-clark-county-reports-5th-highest-cases-in-pandemic-test-positivity-climbs-to-11-1/"&gt;where 11 percent of COVID tests&lt;/a&gt; are returning positive results. &lt;a href="https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/"&gt;Nevada’s COVID tracker&lt;/a&gt; flags Clark County as an area of elevated disease transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vh7JtV"&gt;More than 2,200 exhibitors are confirmed-in person for CES, the CTA said in its emailed statement. As exhibitors have curtailed their trips to Las Vegas, the CTA’s president and CEO, Gary Shapiro, has &lt;a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/"&gt;said the show&lt;/a&gt; “will and must go on.” In today’s announcement, the CTA said that 143 companies have signed up for in-person exhibits in the last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7VzBk"&gt;Attendees will have to show proof of vaccination to get their badges. The CTA has also requested that they test for COVID-19 less than 24 hours before entering the conference, and will be giving away free rapid tests to help with that. Masks will be required for the show, and international travelers will get a free PCR test after the show ends.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden administration will continue ISS cooperation through 2030</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EIXjqD02Z9p6qAbHTPKhrfeAm0w=/35x0:1565x1020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70334637/1600px_International_Space_Station_after_undocking_of_STS_132.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UlzW2W"&gt;The US will continue to work with other countries’ space programs on the International Space Station through 2030, &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/"&gt;NASA announced today&lt;/a&gt;. That will allow for an uninterrupted transition to a planned commercial space station (or stations!) in the late 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmX7v9"&gt;Funds for the ISS have already been approved through 2024. NASA administrator &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440208/nasa-administrator-bill-nelson-interview-rockets-moon-plans-partnerships"&gt;Bill Nelson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in May &lt;/a&gt;that he wants to continue work on the ISS through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OJ6cTZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ISS’s future was called into question in 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a0thkP"&gt;The ISS’s future was called into question in 2018, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16930154/nasa-international-space-station-president-trump-budget-request-2025"&gt;a draft budget proposal&lt;/a&gt; from President Donald Trump’s administration had scheduled ending support for the space station in 2025. More recently, escalating tensions between the US and Russia have threatened the cooperation required to work together on the ISS. In November, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782946/russia-asat-test-satellite-international-space-station-debris"&gt;Russia blew up a satellite&lt;/a&gt;, creating a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791176/russia-asat-satellite-test-space-debris-visualizations"&gt;dangerous debris cloud&lt;/a&gt; in Earth’s orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09NFEW"&gt;“It’s more important than ever that the United States continues to lead the world in growing international alliances and modeling rules and norms for the peaceful and responsible use of space,” Nelson said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DC0YbA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Colorado fires close out a year of disastrous drought</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Wildland fire in Boulder county burning hundreds of structures." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ijy_Tryt537YB_uOCe7LO6SUJnE=/0x0:4176x2784/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70334517/1362041399.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Fires continue to burn into the evening in neighborhoods on December 30, 2021 in Louisville, Colorado. | Photo by Helen H. Richardson/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yXt3Pq"&gt;Devastating fires in Colorado cap off a year of awful drought across the US. Dry conditions helped set the stage for blazes that scorched hundreds of homes and forced tens of thousands to evacuate just ahead of New Year’s Eve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rFml3"&gt;The fires have been raging through suburbs near Denver since December 30th. Strong winds fanned the flames and knocked out power. About 6,000 acres and at least 500 homes had burned by Friday morning. But there were no casualties, which Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle called “miraculous” given the severity of the fire in a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;amp;v=310406430998077"&gt;press briefing&lt;/a&gt;. Families had “minutes” to evacuate their homes, Governor Jared Polis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzMqMX"&gt;More than two-thirds of Colorado’s land is experiencing “severe” drought, according to the &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap.aspx"&gt;US Drought Monitor&lt;/a&gt;. Officials &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/31/us/colorado-wildfires.html"&gt;suspect&lt;/a&gt; that downed power lines might have sparked the inferno, a problem that becomes more dangerous when a dry landscape provides plenty of tinder.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W1RWuk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;One of the many factors that lead to the devastating wildfire today is the recent record dryness. For all periods from Jul 1st to Dec 29th (essentially the second half of the year), Denver has been the driest on record by over an inch. Snowfall is at record low levels, too. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COwx?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#COwx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/8OriOBPyTs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8OriOBPyTs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NWS Boulder (@NWSBoulder) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWSBoulder/status/1476803594196193280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cxMh5i"&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538603/2021-fire-season-us-west-forecast-drought-heat-wave"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; a particularly bad fire season this year. The potential for “significant fire activity” was “above normal” for nearly all of the West at some point this year, according to a February &lt;a href="https://www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf"&gt;outlook&lt;/a&gt; from the National Interagency Fire Center. By the end of the year, more than &lt;a href="https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/nfn"&gt;7.8 million acres&lt;/a&gt; burned across the US — five percent more than the 10-year average of 7.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQw115"&gt;What’s typical for the US is changing because of the climate crisis. Severe fires have become &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GL089858"&gt;much more frequent&lt;/a&gt; in the western US over the past few decades with hotter, drier seasons. On top of that, fire season — which used to run roughly from May to November — &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2019/06/27/wildfires-all-seasons"&gt;no longer seems to let up&lt;/a&gt;. Colorado’s blazes illustrate this, coming unusually late in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VHj7iG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What’s typical for the US is changing because of the climate crisis. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hBFBBp"&gt;The fires in Colorado are just one catastrophic symptom of drought across the US. The Colorado River, a lifeline for 25 million people who rely on it for water, faced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627681/water-shortage-lake-mead-hoover-dam-colorado-river"&gt;unprecedented water shortage&lt;/a&gt; this year. An official shortage was declared for the first time at the US’ largest reservoir, Hoover Dam’s Lake Mead, in August. Water levels at the reservoir dipped to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527600/hoover-dam-reservoir-lake-mead-record-low-drought"&gt;historic low&lt;/a&gt; in June. Mandatory &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/newsroom/#/news-release/3950"&gt;water cuts&lt;/a&gt; will kick in for Arizona, Nevada, and Mexico starting January 1st. Arizona will face the steepest cuts, which are expected to hit farmers the hardest. In California, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573648/drought-california-power-grid-electricity-hydro-energy"&gt;drought cut into the state’s available hydroelectricity&lt;/a&gt; — putting even more stress on a power grid that’s struggled to keep the lights on for many residents whenever fire weather picks up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KK85rq"&gt;Heavy rain and record snow are now closing out the year in California. That’s been somewhat helpful in easing water shortages, but it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/california-record-snowfall-drought"&gt;not enough&lt;/a&gt; to end the drought. Climate change, no surprise, is behind the rise in extreme weather swings. It intensifies the world’s water cycle, says a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;landmark climate repor&lt;/a&gt;t published this year. So we’ll probably want to brace for another wild weather year in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A program for cheaper internet for low-income Americans launches today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Virtually Meets With Local Officials To Discuss Infrastructure Investment" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8n1930TMIN_kI37BUWupF-GbGEU=/0x2:7654x5105/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70333952/1333633935.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;U.S. President Joe Biden participates in a virtual meeting on Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act at South Court Auditorium at Eisenhower Executive Office Building August 11, 2021 in Washington, DC.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JsWfht"&gt;Starting today, eligible US residents can apply for help with their internet bills under the new &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/acp"&gt;Affordable Connectivity Program&lt;/a&gt;. The program &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-launches-affordable-connectivity-program"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; today with $14.2 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law passed in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9Ab0r"&gt;Households can apply to take up to $30 a month off their internet service bill. For households on &lt;a href="https://acpbenefit.org/do-i-qualify/enhanced-tribal-benefit/"&gt;qualifying Tribal lands,&lt;/a&gt; the discount is up to $75 per month. The program could help to connect millions of people to the internet who haven’t had access to it at home, especially in communities that have historically faced more barriers to getting online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKFVbD"&gt;Almost a third of people living on Tribal lands lacked high-speed internet at home in 2017, according to a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41134-020-00147-9"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). That’s compared to just 1.5 percent of city-dwellers without high-speed internet access. On top of limited infrastructure, cost is often another barrier. The United States has the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/"&gt;second-highest&lt;/a&gt; broadband costs out of &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/sti/broadband/broadband-statistics-update.htm"&gt;35 countries&lt;/a&gt; studied by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). And American Indian and Alaska Native people have the highest poverty rate of any race group in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/facts-for-features/2017/aian-month.html"&gt;according to the US Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5OgT4i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To even apply for the Affordable Connectivity Program, someone has to be able to get online.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MB0XjQ"&gt;To even apply for the Affordable Connectivity Program, someone has to be able to get online. They’ll need to visit &lt;a href="http://acpbenefit.org/"&gt;ACPBenefit.org&lt;/a&gt; to apply or print out a mail-in application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiuOXZ"&gt;Folks eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program can also qualify for a one-time $100 discount for a laptop, tablet, or desktop computer from &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/emergency-broadband-benefit-providers"&gt;participating providers&lt;/a&gt; (including T-Mobil, AT&amp;amp;T, and Verizon). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yym18z"&gt;The Affordable Connectivity Program is basically a long-term replacement of the temporary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302807/fcc-internet-subsidies-authorized-low-income-broadband"&gt;Emergency Broadband Benefit Program&lt;/a&gt; started to help Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. That program offered a higher discount of $50 a month for households &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; living on Tribal lands, and will continue until &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/broadbandbenefit"&gt;March 1, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRTAFh"&gt;While the payout will be lower for some households, the FCC &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/broadbandbenefit"&gt;expanded&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://acpbenefit.org/do-i-qualify/"&gt;criteria&lt;/a&gt; for who can apply. Being eligible for &lt;a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic"&gt;WIC&lt;/a&gt; (the food assistance program for women, infants, and children) now also makes a household eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program. And a household with an income that’s at or below 200 percent of &lt;a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines"&gt;federal poverty guidelines&lt;/a&gt; is also newly eligible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYDUuE"&gt;There’s more funding on the way to close the digital divide in the US. The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783684/biden-infrastructure-bill-bipartisan-broadband-ev-electrical-grid-climate"&gt;$1 trillion infrastructure law&lt;/a&gt; includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598636/white-house-infrastructure-broadband-package-bipartisan"&gt;$65 billion&lt;/a&gt; to boost broadband access. More than 30 million Americans live somewhere without adequate broadband infrastructure, according to a Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/"&gt;fact sheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The governor of Missouri still doesn’t know how websites work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Missouri Gov. Mike Parson Holds Press Conference On Planned Parenthood License" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wBHz_x730cyzplncgR1GkmEmICk=/0x0:3326x2217/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70333854/1146875721.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jacob Moscovitch/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dQd1Uj"&gt;Mike Parson, Governor of Missouri, does not understand how websites work. He held a press conference earlier this week in St. Louis to once more reiterate his desire to prosecute a &lt;em&gt;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; journalist for looking at the source code of a state-run website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVG4vC"&gt;In October 2021 reporter Josh Renaud &lt;a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-teachers-social-security-numbers-at-risk-on-state-agency-s-website/article_f3339700-ece0-54a1-9a45-f300321b7c82.html"&gt;reported that the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education website source code had exposed the social security numbers of over 100,000 school teachers, administrators, and counselors&lt;/a&gt;. He published the story only after he’d reported the problem to the state and the vulnerability had been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lx8hFA"&gt;Parson and the DESE were apparently not grateful for the alert and immediately accused Renaud of “hacking” the DESE website. Missouri Education Commissioner Margie Vandeven sent a letter to educators saying “an individual took the records of at least three educators, unencrypted the source code from the webpage, and viewed the social security number (SSN) of those specific educators.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGvmdk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-officials-planned-to-thank-post-dispatch-before-threatening-newspaper-emails-show/article_0f6c5288-cd11-569c-804e-9b280e9c1e68.html"&gt;According to records obtained by the &lt;em&gt;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the FBI told the state the website had been “misconfigured” and that Renaud’s actions were “not an actual network intrusion”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bs7zFG"&gt;The source code was not encrypted. A website’s source code is typically available to anyone using a web browser. While scraping it requires some technical knowledge, just looking at it is as simple as opening the “Developer Tools” option available in nearly every web browser, including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge. If you want, you can go look at The Verge’s source code right now. By the logic of Parson and the DESE anyone who uses the Developer Tools on a website they don’t own is a hacker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpyI8t"&gt;In fact...gimme a second....boom, I just hacked Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7f2bc"&gt;While a gross misunderstanding of how websites work by both a state agency and the governor of said state might be funny, Governor Parson's behavior since the paper first published its story is anything but. According to public records obtained by the &lt;em&gt;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-officials-planned-to-thank-post-dispatch-before-threatening-newspaper-emails-show/article_0f6c5288-cd11-569c-804e-9b280e9c1e68.html"&gt;Vandeven had initially planned to thank the paper for finding the vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;. Her tone only became accusatory after meeting with the governor’s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOdxMT"&gt;The Missouri State Highway Patrol, whose superintendent is appointed by the governor, initiated a probe into the newspaper’s story. They turned the case over to Cole County Prosecuting Attorney Locke Thompson on Monday, December 27. Governor Parson then held a press conference on Wednesday, December 29, where he cited a &lt;a href="https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=569.095"&gt;state statute&lt;/a&gt; related to computer tampering and repeatedly suggested Thompson should use it to prosecute Renaud and the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8Qgwd"&gt;In the press conference, he compared Renaud’s actions to a person using a lock pick to enter a person’s home without permission. Which is in no way an appropriate analogy. Websites are public-facing. They’re akin to public buildings, not homes. A more apt analogy would be if a person is in a state-owned building and walks by a locked room, and sees someone posted a bunch of sensitive information in the window for anyone to see, regardless of whether or not they have keys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qSjFt"&gt;Personally, I would want someone to knock on the door and point out the problem without fear of prosecution by an embarrassed man with no grasp of how websites work.&lt;/p&gt;
