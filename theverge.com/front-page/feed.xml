    <title>Google Calendar’s new focus blocks can auto-decline meetings for you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u9ps3K922dDrXwTPBm98qyDHjbw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70021958/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Efdwml"&gt;It can be hard to block off focus time during the workday. To help make scheduling dedicated work blocks a bit easier, Google is adding &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/10/set-aside-time-for-focus-in-google.html"&gt;new dedicated focus time entries to Calendar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AO6Ti"&gt;The focus time entries have a small headphones icon on your calendar and can be given a different color to help separate them from other things on your schedule. If you want, you can set focus time entries to automatically decline meetings that get scheduled during that block, which could help ensure that your focus time stays open and free from pesky meetings. Focus time entries will also appear in your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649975/google-calendar-time-insights-meeting-breakdown"&gt;“Time insights” panel&lt;/a&gt; so you can see how much of your time you’re spending in meetings and on focused work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dpdjoulsvt7PRXxgS1saIcG69aU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942589/Focus_time_calendar_entry_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what making a focus time entry looks like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D24M93"&gt;Focus time entries begin rolling out Wednesday to users on the Rapid Release track, but they won’t be available to every Calendar user; Google says they’re coming to Google Workspace Business Standard, Business Plus, Enterprise Standard, Enterprise Plus, Education Fundamentals, Education Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Upgrade, Education Standard, Education Plus, and Nonprofits customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="NlLamu"&gt;Google never stops issuing updates to its Android OS (well, unless your phone is old enough to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735485/google-pixel-6-three-years-android-updates-security-feature"&gt;outlived its update period&lt;/a&gt;), and it has recently introduced its latest upgrade: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22724322/android-12-official-launch-date-pixel-phones-samsung-oneplus-xiaomi"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlBFrb"&gt;As always, the new OS is coming to Google’s Pixel phones first, and when it does come to Samsung and other Android devices, it will probably be tweaked somewhat by the manufacturer. But whether you have uploaded Android 12 into your Pixel or are still using Android 11 on another phone, we’ve assembled a guide that will help you make the most of your mobile life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGKBzL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;guide to Android&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is a comprehensive resource that will help you learn how to use your Android phone’s best features and further educate you about this popular and flexible mobile operating system. We’ve separated out some of the new features found in Android 12, but you can also check out Android 101 and Hardware Help for tips that will apply to the majority of Android phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8kyKB9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span data-author="-1"&gt;Everything you need to know about Android  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="momCET"&gt;We have advice and step-by-step instructions for beginners and experts. Our how-tos can teach you everything you need to know about some of your phone’s more advanced features. Take a look around and learn how to use Google Pay, send texts from your web browser, take screenshots, and even install &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;(which isn’t as easy as it sounds). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5jNJ7f"&gt;Be sure to check back regularly, as we’ll be updating &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;guide to Android&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with new articles and tips over time. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ST3RH7o1_mOUSZxfGy4nhE4wo5I=/152x0:1768x1077/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016186/lcimg_e5568f90_70f5_4d74_938b_5d1c34060e11.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can preorder Google’s just-announced Pixels.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p512wU"&gt;Google’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22713338/google-pixel-6-event-top-announcements-tensor-processor-snapchat-pass"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are freshly announced&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re already up for preorder. These Pixels promise new designs, new cameras, a uniquely designed Google Tensor CPU, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57DFat"&gt;This year’s Pixel phones come in two sizes: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;the standard Pixel 6 and the larger, triple-camera equipped Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. The base Pixel 6, with 128GB of storage, starts at $599, while the Pixel 6 Pro runs $899 and up if you prefer to go above the base 128GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="samX3I"&gt;WHAT’S NEW&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jTBVbQ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Pixel 6 and 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; look mostly nothing like prior iterations, with a metal and glass design highlighted by a rear camera bar that is slightly reminiscent of the classic Nexus 6P. These are big phones. The smaller Pixel 6, which cannot truly be considered small by any stretch of the imagination, has a 6.4-inch 2400x1080 OLED 90Hz display. The larger Pixel 6 Pro stretches its legs with a huge 6.7-inch 3120x1440 LTPO OLED 120Hz screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzGN0n"&gt;On the inside, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22710844/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-ai-speed-specs-details"&gt;Google’s brand new Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt; powers both, while the Pixel 6 gets 8GB of RAM, and the 6 Pro has 12GB. The new chips have a lot to prove for Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;just as the new camera systems do&lt;/a&gt; — with the Pixel 6 housing a dual-camera setup and the 6 Pro adding a third camera and lens to its rear bar. The phones match each other with 50-megapixel main cameras and a 12-megapixel ultrawide, but only the Pro counterpart gets a 48-megapixel sensor complete with telephoto 4x optical zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpMCfQ"&gt;Time will tell if all this hardware and new camera software brings the Pixels back to the top of the pack, but in the meantime, let’s look at how the Pixel 6 phones are configured and available for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x26RG3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the Pixel 6 compares to the Pixel 6 Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22724481/google-pixel-6-pro-specs-comparison-price"},{"title":"Sundar Pichai and Rick Osterloh think the Pixel 6 is Google’s breakout phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="af9xF5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10816444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Fl3bAs"&gt;WHERE TO PREORDER THE PIXEL 6 AND PIXEL 6 PRO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3iYB8E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.google.com/category/phones?hl=en-US"&gt;Google has kicked off its preorders on its own store&lt;/a&gt; first, right as the phone became official. The release date for the phones is Thursday, October 28th. Though, like most phone launches these days, delays may be expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZO9lWc"&gt;We will update this post as more options become available, but we can immediately see how some models are not available everywhere — if a 512GB Pixel 6 Pro is your jam, your only option is Google at this time. So far, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfO5wFAh05o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-5g-unlocked-128gb%2F-%2FA-84683612%3Fpreselect%3D83607398%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergepixel6preorders" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1665071-REG%2Fgoogle_ga02900_us_pixel_6_dual_sim_128gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; are all taking preorders for both Pixels with at least the base 128GB storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4YOc6"&gt;Deals on new phones are tough to come by, but the best preorder deal going around for an unlocked Pixel 6 or 6 Pro is a free pair of Pixel Buds A wireless earbuds included with your purchase. The Pixel Buds A are Google’s budget-friendly earbuds, but they’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a solid set that is more worthwhile than the more expensive Pixel Buds&lt;/a&gt; — and free is free. You can currently get this promo with all of those preorders from Google, Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H, and Target. Just note that some retailers like &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-pixel-buds-a-series-wireless-headphones%2F-%2FA-83360244&amp;amp;subid1=vergepixel6preorders" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target may require you to add the Pixel Buds A to your cart manually&lt;/a&gt;, and they might be out of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FfBJXi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815891"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ZBa1GT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815902"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gHSBMR"&gt;Carrier deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qBhCBk"&gt;If you’re not shopping for an unlocked phone and prefer to utilize promos and payment plans from your carrier, there are some offers from the likes of AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Google’s own Fi service. Bear in mind that carriers give discounts as bill credits over time, attempting to rope you into service for 36 months or more. The Pixel 6 phones offered from &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-128gb-stormy-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; (including Verizon models bought on Google’s store) have radios for mmWave 5G, which cost upward of $100 more and may not give you faster speeds depending on where you live and use the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bskHg6"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="fwxgST"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is offering up to $700 off the &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-128gb-cloudy-white.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a qualifying trade-in for new and existing customers, and 50 percent off of any Google-branded accessories purchased simultaneously. The base &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-128gb-stormy-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; 128GB model costs $15 per month over 36 months without a trade-in, but keep in mind that the mmWave-equipped model AT&amp;amp;T is selling is fully priced at $740 and not the base $599 of unlocked models using only Sub-6 5G. The $15 per month over 36 months will result in a total price of $540, reflecting the $200 AT&amp;amp;T will discount over time via bill credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="X9W7Oc"&gt;Verizon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pPtJqr"&gt;Verizon’s offers are similar promo, with up to $700 off a &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a trade-in— though this is limited to new customers switching over. Existing customers can get up to $350 off when trading in a phone and upgrading a line. If you’re shopping for more than one Pixel device, you can buy one and get a second Pixel 6 or 6 Pro for up to $700 off (given to you in billing credits over time; you’ll pay in full upfront) with eligible unlimited plans. The base Pixel 6 on a payment plan from Verizon will run $23.33 per month for 30 months, totaling $700 and a one-time $35 activation fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74YwEQ"&gt;If you want to buy a Pixel 6 for Verizon’s network &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_6?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;direct from Google&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll also receive up to $100 in Google store credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="O5sVYL"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hVohEb"&gt;T-Mobile is advertising the base &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%3Fsku%3D810029932646&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; as free with a trade-in on its Magenta Max plan and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro%3Fsku%3D810029931533&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; up to $900 off under the same terms. Once again, these promotions involve buying the device as a Magenta Max subscriber or purchasing that service, paying the sales tax, trading in a qualifying phone that T-Mobile will offer a value on, and then receiving the allotted money back as monthly bill credits over 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bpnx5n"&gt;Note that T-Mobile’s offerings of Pixel 6 and 6 Pro do not have mmWave radios, only Sub-6 5G, and are thus the respective $599 and $899 base prices as Google advertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="66aMs3"&gt;Google Fi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rwhuyq"&gt;Google’s own Fi service combines its &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/promo-terms/?p=2021-october-pixel-6-series" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free Pixel Buds A offer with $200 in bill credits&lt;/a&gt; if you transfer your number from another carrier after purchasing a &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_6?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_6_pro?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Giant retailers pledge to leave fossil-fueled ships behind </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kBOu4S"&gt;Major retailers, including Amazon and Ikea, are beginning to clean up their shipping pollution. A group of companies&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cozev.org/img/FINAL-coZEV-2040-Ambition-Statement_2021-10-18-144834_uorz.pdf"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; yesterday that by 2040, they’ll only contract ships using zero-carbon fuels to move their goods. Both Ikea and Amazon were among the 15 companies responsible for the most maritime import pollution in 2019, according to one recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584335/ikea-amazon-walmart-shipping-emissions-climate-change"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTSmnP"&gt;Joining Amazon and Ikea in the commitment are Unilever, Michelin, and clothing retailer Inditex, which owns Zara and other brands. German retailer Tchibo, Patagonia, sports gear company Brooks Running, and FrogBikes are part of the deal, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZdjPv"&gt;The aim is to leave behind heavy fuel oil in favor of alternatives that don’t release planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions. But there will still be plenty of hurdles ahead to rein in shipping pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="9WecL7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A catalyzing force and a game-changer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EdUBQK"&gt;“This will be a catalyzing force and a game-changer for the industry to really push for the decarbonization of the sector,” says Kendra Ulrich, shipping campaigns director at the environmental nonprofit Stand.earth, which was one of the authors of the 2019 import pollution report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vU09hg"&gt;Before arriving at our doorsteps or on store shelves, nearly all the goods we buy are moved by ship around the world. As a result, the maritime shipping industry is responsible for about 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. The sector also produces between 10 to 15 percent of sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions, pollutants linked to respiratory problems and other health risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="br9ryt"&gt;Environmental activists, portside communities, and workers have demanded for years that Amazon and other big-box brands cut down their pollution. Now, they’re starting to see some progress from companies in the form of environmental pledges. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873834/amazon-sustainability-jeff-bezos-climate-change-pledge-emissions-paris-accord"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; set a goal of becoming carbon neutral in 2040, a deadline for it to stop releasing more CO2 than it can capture or offset. By 2030, Ikea plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent and invest in projects intended to draw down the rest of its CO2 emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tTdWp"&gt;Those goals, in turn, have pushed shipping giants to act more swiftly on climate change. Maersk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334173/retail-cargo-ships-climate-change-goals-maersk"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in February that it would speed up construction — by seven years — of the first large cargo ship to run on carbon-neutral fuels. About half of Maersk’s largest customers had new carbon-cutting targets, the company said when it made the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YslkyP"&gt;There’s no time to waste, Ulrich says. Her organization is pushing companies to switch to zero-emission ships this decade — not 2040, as Amazon, Ikea, and the other retailers have just pledged. She also wants to see clear benchmarks to measure progress in the nearer term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="r5iLTJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We need to see action now”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eZcyoA"&gt;“We are faced with a climate crisis now, and we need to see action now,” she says. On top of that, she says, companies should also make targets to tackle pollutants other than carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaZjg3"&gt;Shipping is considered one of the industries that’s hardest to decarbonize. Batteries so far have only been able to store enough juice to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21508333/niagara-falls-electric-ferry-boats-greenhouse-gas-emissions"&gt;power short boat trips&lt;/a&gt;, but container vessels take much longer journeys. Some advocates like Ulrich are optimistic that hydrogen fuel cells might be an option for the shipping industry. Maersk, meanwhile, is looking into methanol and ammonia as replacement&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fuels. But the production of alternatives like hydrogen, methanol, and ammonia typically still relies on fossil fuels. That’s a problem that a broader transition to clean energy will need to fix. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer Aspire Vero review: for a better footprint, find a better laptop</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Despite Acer’s branding, this isn’t the most environmentally friendly laptop you can buy&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="u2qRzj"&gt;Many laptop manufacturers are making lofty statements about the sustainability of their products. But Acer’s claims around the Aspire Vero are at a level we haven’t seen before. It’s an entire laptop targeted to, in Acer’s words, “eco-minded users.” It’s being advertised primarily as an eco-friendly laptop made of recycled materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQq5rR"&gt;Sure. Acer has devoted an entire product to a goal that’s very worthwhile and commendable. Unfortunately, that’s probably the best thing I can say about the Acer Aspire Vero. Outside of Acer’s eco-minded marketing material, it’s not a great laptop, and its price tag is too high. It’s not the top option I’d recommend for the eco-minded, and it’s definitely not the option I’d recommend for budget shoppers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xgwu7R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10817623"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FIZwOf"&gt;Acer’s environmental claims are as follows: The chassis and bezels are 30 percent post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic, the screen is “over 99 percent” recyclable, the keycaps are 50 percent PCR plastic, and the packaging is 100 percent recyclable (and can be turned into a reusable laptop stand). Acer claims that the Vero is saving “around 21 percent” in C02 emissions compared to a “regular” plastic laptop chassis of the same size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hg5lQX"&gt;Before we move on, it’s worth noting that these proportions of recycled material aren’t especially unique among laptop chassis. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675550/hp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;HP’s Elite Dragonfly Max&lt;/a&gt;, which is not at all an eco-branded laptop, also has a 50 percent PCR keyboard with bezels that are 45 percent PCR, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21247274/hp-elite-dragonfly-2020-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;some of the Dragonfly line&lt;/a&gt; have had chassis that are 90 percent recycled. Apple’s new MacBooks have incorporated high proportions of recycled material &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18042448/macbook-mac-mini-recycled-materials-2018-environmental-impact"&gt;for a while&lt;/a&gt;, and the new Pros’ enclosures are &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-unveils-game-changing-macbook-pro/"&gt;100 percent recycled aluminum&lt;/a&gt;. Recyclable, plastic-free packaging is also getting more common. Many companies put out lists of figures like this, and while the Vero’s is certainly nice to see, it’s not clearly leading the charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5d7UG"&gt;Acer also notes that the Vero is held together with standard screws, which means you can use a Philips Head screwdriver to pry the thing apart and upgrade it (as opposed to some other types of screws, which require more specialized tools). Sure — that’s good and also true of plenty of other Acer laptops, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377208/acer-swift-3-review-2020-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Swift 3&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22218681/acer-nitro-5-gaming-laptop-intel-11th-tiger-lake-h35-amd-ryzen-rtx-3080-qhd-release-date-price"&gt;Nitro 5.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Post Consumer Recycled engraving on the right palm rest of the Acer Aspire Vero." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GXu4h-YRbwKQptnO-4KLim7nAp8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22906537/akrales_211005_4787_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s an “Intel Core” logo on the right palm rest too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="oKZb25"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10817640"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JH4fOz"&gt;Of course, the somewhat non-unique nature of its lofty claims hasn’t stopped Acer from branding the Vero as an eco-minded laptop up and down. The whole thing has an earthy vibe. The lid and palm rests have a slightly coarse texture with a speckled grey color, reminiscent of handmade recycled paper. The “R” and “E” keys are backward and printed in yellow (to represent “review, rethink, recycle, and reduce”). The various logos you’d usually see on a laptop are engraved in the finish, rather than constructed from additional plastic: “Intel Core” on the left palm rest, “Post-Consumer Recycled” on the right palm rest, the Acer logo on the lid. (Don’t worry, Intel’s Core i7 and Iris Xe stickers are still here — flip the product over, and you’ll find them on the bottom.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Aspire Vero open angled to the right on a wooden table with a shelf in the background. The screen displays a green and blue desktop background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TylKI2YfVaqoQr3zo97kLe3jn_o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22906546/akrales_211005_4787_0132.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The chassis is a bit...blocky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uSV6hw"&gt;But these attributes, cute as they are, aren’t enough to make me recommend the Aspire Vero on the merit of its environmental impact. The reality is that the impact of people buying gadgets with recycled plastic in them is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712435/recycling-e-waste-tech-plastic-pollution"&gt;minuscule in comparison&lt;/a&gt; to the mounds of electronic waste that humans generate every year. It really doesn’t matter what colors the keys are on the laptops you’re buying — e-waste is the cardinal sin of the electronics industry. If you care a lot about the environmental impact of your laptop, you shouldn’t be adding up the recycled plastic inside of it. What you need to care about is how long it’s going to last and how soon you’ll need to buy a new one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3su9U"&gt;This, unfortunately, is hard to judge from a week-long testing period. But I’m not hugely optimistic about the Vero’s durability. It’s noticeably plastic, and it’s got a bit of a flimsy feel compared to higher-end Acer products like the Swift 3 (which is just &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://store.acer.com/en-us/swift-3-laptop-sf314-511-70tu?internal_source=us.acer.com&amp;amp;internal_medium=referral&amp;amp;internal_campaign=CLM&amp;amp;internal_content=NX.ABNAA.001" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 more&lt;/a&gt; than my Vero unit for comparable specs). There’s noticeable flex in the keyboard and the display. I was actually worried about snapping the latter during torque testing, which isn’t often a concern on 15-inch models, especially at this weight and thickness. And there were other dings here and there — the lid on my unit was bent oddly in the middle such that it didn’t fully close all the way, I occasionally heard some internal rattle when I was typing, and leaning on the palm rests sometimes depressed the touchpad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ay9KS9"&gt;None of these are horrifying to see on a budget laptop — but laptops that are built cheaply tend not to last as long as nicer ones, and a laptop you need to replace quickly is not environmentally friendly. You can find options close to this price (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22632318/hp-pavilion-aero-13-2021-amd-review"&gt;HP’s Pavilion Aero 13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21423498/lenovo-ideapad-slim-7-2020-amd-review"&gt;Lenovo’s IdeaPad Slim 7&lt;/a&gt;) that don’t have these issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Aspire Vero keyboard seen from above on a blue fabric surface." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bt54xaq0_Hmc3mnz-MqNLNQ_s60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22906538/akrales_211005_4787_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Backlit keyboard, though it’s not super bright.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7Sn1x3"&gt;Let’s run through the rest of the laptop’s chassis, where there are a few highlights. The speakers are decent, with clear vocals and decent volume, though bass and percussion were weak. The microphones support AI noise reduction and didn’t give me any trouble during video calls. But the useful port selection is a plus for this device: there’s one USB-C, two USB 3.2 Gen 1, one USB 2.0, an HDMI 2.0, a 3.5mm audio jack, and an Ethernet jack, in addition to a port for the AC adapter and a lock slot. I wish the Vero could charge with USB-C, though Acer’s provided charger is fairly portable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MG58UO"&gt;On the downside, the 15.6-inch FHD display is the weakest part of the chassis. It’s fairly dim, maxing out at just 227 nits, and it covers just 66 percent of the sRGB gamut. The touchpad is also a bit of a clunker — it’s accurate and did a fine job with palm rejection, but it takes some effort to press. The keyboard is okay, though a bit flat compared to those on higher-end devices. There’s a NumPad, which is handy, though the keys are quite small. (I probably wouldn’t have wanted to use it regularly, and my fingers are tiny.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3OiNS"&gt;Most annoyingly, the Vero comes loaded with some bloatware. It’s not as annoying as these programs sometimes are — I wasn’t bombarded with annoying Norton popups and Acer Jumpstart ads — but I did still have to uninstall a bunch of junk. This isn’t uncommon to see on Aspires, but the closer a laptop gets to the $1,000 mark, the unhappier I am to see crapware preloaded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Aspire Vero open on a wooden table with a bookshelf in the background. The screen displays The Verge homepage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PwbtaW5XXg0KMHG35gsVxXRsYlU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22906541/akrales_211005_4787_0053.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big, big bezels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Autkbk"&gt;Recycling aside, the big argument in the Vero’s favor is its processor. My test unit, which &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://store.acer.com/en-us/aspire-vero-green-laptop-av15-51-75qq" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $899.99&lt;/a&gt;, comes with a quad-core Core i7-1195G7, which is technically the most powerful chip that Intel makes for thin and light laptops. It’s a chip you don’t often see in the wild — many of the big players of the portable laptop market, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569871/lenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review"&gt;Lenovo Yoga 9i&lt;/a&gt;, max out at a Core i7-1185G7, which is a step below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gRWMS"&gt;My unit pairs that chip with 16GB of memory and a 512GB SSD. Acer says a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://store.acer.com/en-us/aspire-vero-green-laptop-av15-51-5155" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$699.99 base model&lt;/a&gt; with a Core i5-1155G7 (as well as 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage) is coming soon. Both models have Iris Xe integrated graphics and a 1920 x 1080 display and ship with Windows 11 Home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcCSds"&gt;The performance I saw from the 1195G7 is definitely the Vero’s strongest feature. It’s undoubtedly one of the most powerful Intel systems you’ll be able to find at an $899 price point (although “Intel” is crucial there — it’s not going to win many battles against the Ryzen-powered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22632318/hp-pavilion-aero-13-2021-amd-review"&gt;HP Pavilion Aero 13&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEwPOu"&gt;You can certainly play some non-AAA games on this device, edit photos and videos, and run CPU-intensive tasks; you would want a proper discrete GPU for heavy modern games and higher-throughput video work. I was able to run Zoom calls and Spotify streams over heaps of apps and Chrome tabs on the Battery Saver profile with no slowdown, crackling, or other issues. I never once heard the fans spin up or felt any significant heat in the chassis. You can push this thing; it’s a powerful device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Aspire Vero half open seen from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9BA9Rsr2Pi_sfy0xOCkWxtwVjjM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22906544/akrales_211005_4787_0078.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ethernet port has a trapdoor hinge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qdc1XL"&gt;There’s a big cost to that, though: battery life. The Vero only has a 48Whr battery, which is evident from its lifespan. Even with Battery Saver on, I was averaging four hours and 52 minutes of continuous work to one charge. That’s really not great — it’s on the lower end &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22723299/razer-blade-15-advanced-late-2021-review-specs-features-design"&gt;even for &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22726307/asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt; with beefier processors and hardcore GPUs. AMD machines around this price range with eight-core processors can easily last twice that length. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sa1VEo"&gt;On the whole, that result makes me struggle to see who the Acer is best for. “Eco” branding aside, the Vero seems to be targeting people who want the most power they can get for their buck. But I’m theoretically one of those people, and that battery life would still be a dealbreaker for me. Unless you specifically need an Intel feature like Quick Sync, most people should be able to get similar performance from an AMD system without the battery penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIMX5b"&gt;But perhaps more importantly, that battery life is another knock against Acer’s “eco-friendly” marketing. This is an inefficient laptop compared to its major competitors. It will spend a lot of time plugged in and a lot of time sucking power. And — to go back to durability — this is what the battery’s at now after just a week of use. That lifespan is only going to get worse over the years. It doesn’t inspire much confidence in this laptop lasting a long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="9QAjIq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10817677"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="EUP52Z"&gt;That about sums my feelings on this device. As a laptop, it’s too expensive for what it offers. While there’s likely a small group of people who don’t want a GPU but do want the power of the 1195G7, the mediocre battery life isn’t a sacrifice I’d recommend that most people make. Laptops like HP’s Pavilion Aero 13 and Acer’s own Swift 3 deliver better battery life in thinner and lighter chassis at the Vero’s price, and most people won’t notice the performance difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GwmXx8"&gt;And as an eco-friendly purchase, the Vero is pursuing a commendable mission that it does not actually achieve. If your priority is having the lowest environmental impact possible (which is certainly a priority everyone should have), buy a power-efficient laptop that you won’t need to replace any time soon. Buy something like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587205/framework-laptop-review"&gt;Framework Laptop&lt;/a&gt;, which is made entirely of user-upgradeable components. Buy any number of better built laptops from Dell, HP, Lenovo, or Acer itself that are stable and sturdy and will last for years (and aren’t too much more expensive than this Vero unit). To lower your carbon footprint, commit to reducing your consumption and waste — don’t fall for these marketing ploys. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ITxRxA"&gt;Epic Games launched its battle royale hit &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on Android devices in 2018 with a big catch: it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/9/17666316/samsung-galaxy-note-9-fortnite-android-release-unpacked-event-2018"&gt;exclusive to Samsung-made phones for a few days&lt;/a&gt; as a way to help market the then-new Samsung Galaxy Note 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vn1Oh"&gt;At the time, would-be players had to deal with a waiting list and / or a restrictive list of qualified Android phones. These days, it’s a lot easier — but you still need to download it directly from Epic. (Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said this is basically to &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/f3543b49-0dff-4bb9-8902-a5766a7a7de1"&gt;avoid paying Google’s 30 percent cut on in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;.) Epic is using its own website and a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Installer program to distribute the game more widely on all compatible Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPO6l3"&gt;Here’s a step-by-step breakdown to make sure you’re prepared and understand the best way to start playing &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on Android. But before we get to the nitty-gritty, a brief warning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="p6duG2"&gt;Avoid the Play Store&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lZsXnF"&gt;First and foremost, do not download anything from the Google Play Store or from a third-party web source. Epic has made it clear that it’s only distributing &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on Android through its own website and through Samsung’s Galaxy Store. Searching for the game&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on the Play Store will get you a simple “No results” message. (Originally, searches would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/10/17675054/google-play-store-android-fortnite-battle-royale"&gt;return a special warning from Google&lt;/a&gt; reading, “&lt;em&gt;Fortnite Battle Royale&lt;/em&gt; by Epic Games, Inc is not available on Google Play” because of worries about malware-laden fake versions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lhES5E"&gt;Download the installer and then the game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LQUrbV"&gt;Because of the unique distribution model here, you’ll have to download two separate applications. The first will be the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Installer, which is the official APK file that then installs the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxm42u"&gt;In order to do this, you may need to turn off special permissions in your Android settings that allow you to download third-party applications, depending on which version of Android you have and what your existing security settings are. After that, you’ll need to go through a series of download sequences that are a bit more involved than your standard app installation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eb0JwD"&gt;Here’s a blow-by-blow of the steps you’ll go through:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1YstLe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10817676"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="8gg9NH"&gt;If you have a Samsung phone, you can go to the the Galaxy Store to &lt;a href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.epicgames.portal?session_id=W_bfae6c311778961724acb2f3fae4bbe4"&gt;download the installer for Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;. You can then skip to step 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ch9AfS"&gt;Otherwise, go directly &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/mobile/android/get-started"&gt;to Epic’s site&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll find a page suggesting that you either visit &lt;a href="http://fortnite.com/android"&gt;fortnite.com/android&lt;/a&gt; on your phone or scan a QR code. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NQUFKQ"&gt;Whichever method you choose, you’ll be sent to a page that gives you some instruction on what to expect. You’ll also get a pop-up for the installer; tap “Open.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0H1rfk"&gt;You will probably get a security notice saying that your phone isn’t allowed to install unknown apps from that source. Tap on “Settings.” A page labeled “Install unknown apps” will let you toggle on “Allow from this source.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lA872G"&gt;You will then be asked if you want to install the app. Tap on “Install.”  When you get the “App install” pop-up, tap on “Done.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Xj81Rl"&gt;The installer will appear on your homepage and in your phone’s app list as Epic Games. You may also get a download notification for the APK. Tap on the icon or on the APK notification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5d6D51"&gt;You’ll land on a page with  the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; graphic. Tap on that, and then on “Install.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mrpjVk"&gt;You’ll probably get that message again about installing unknown apps. Once again, tap on Settings and toggle on “Allow from this source.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="teKqgP"&gt;The app will then install, load any updates, and open. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="0yaY7C"&gt;Once it’s completed, you should be able to boot up &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, log into your account, and start playing. In the past, Epic has advised users to keep the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Installer program, as it’ll be responsible for updating the game with new patches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aHCMP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 20th, 2021, 11:50AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on August 13th, 2018; the process of installing the game has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s time for the Pixel Watch</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F4lM_jI8wYeLQ7inf8EeVmm1CHk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70021378/akrales_190822_3612_0135.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4SRam3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; are the company’s most interesting devices in years. They might actually succeed at the Pixel’s ultimate goal of being the shining example of what Android phones can and should be capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EIu0A"&gt;It’s high time that Google followed that example with a Pixel Watch that does the same thing for Wear OS. It’s pretty likely that Google is already working on something along those lines: When we asked, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"&gt;Rick Osterloh told&lt;em&gt; The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Dieter Bohn&lt;/a&gt; that its own Wear OS wearable is just a matter of time. He noted that Google’s acquisition of Fitbit is still “pretty early in the integration” since the purchase only went through a few months ago — it takes time to develop a product, after all, especially one with a new operating system that Fitbit has never used before. But Osterloh did tease that “you’ll see them [the Fitbit team] build wearables on Wear OS in the future,” with the team already “hard at work at that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sY1hL9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fitbit is already working on a Wear OS device&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KUkbGF"&gt;It’s no secret that Wear OS is in desperate need of some flagship hardware (or any hardware, really). If you buy a shiny new Pixel 6 this week and are looking for a smartwatch running the latest and greatest Wear OS 3.0 software, your only option is Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4. &lt;em&gt;Every&lt;/em&gt; other Wear OS device is out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSAFzu"&gt;Now, the Watch 4 is not a bad smartwatch by any means, but despite the new, shared Tizen / Wear OS collaboration, it’s still a distinctly &lt;em&gt;Samsung&lt;/em&gt; device. That means that everything from the basic UI to payments to fitness tracking to the virtual assistant is Samsung-flavored experiences, not Google ones. Google Assistant isn’t even available on Samsung’s watch, and most of the basic apps like the calendar, weather, contacts, and calculator are set to Samsung’s defaults, not Google’s options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Most of the pre-installed apps on the Galaxy Watch 4 come from Samsung." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YrznZlqdrp50UtpFcuoRBVtmXaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787996/dbohn_210816_4717_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s not a lot of Google apps on the Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fpJdkQ"&gt;The biggest tell? If you do want to use a Pixel 6 with a Galaxy Watch 4, you’ll have to install a suite of Samsung apps on your phone to use it properly, something that would largely defeat the point of having a Google-made phone in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sv0neN"&gt;For all the years of Pixel phones, Google has never really tried a Pixel Watch to go with it. The closest was back in 2016, when the company was apparently working with LG on smartwatches ahead of the Wear OS 2.0 relaunch. But according to a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-google-shifting-smartwatch-strategy-2019-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;, Google hardware lead Rick Osterloh himself killed off the project just before the original Pixel was released because they “didn’t look like what belonged in the Pixel family,” leading Google to pull its name from the products. That turned out to be the right call, as those LG wearables were, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/8/14546312/lg-watch-sport-style-review-android-wear-2-smartwatch"&gt;put simply, terrible&lt;/a&gt; (LG itself no longer makes Wear OS watches — or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;Android phones at all&lt;/a&gt; for that matter). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="JYpsNk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s never seriously tried a Pixel Watch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oUthU7"&gt;The company has repeatedly squashed suggestions that it might build a Pixel Watch over the years, with Miles Barr, the former director of engineering for Wear OS, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/31/17807442/google-smartwatch-pixel-watch-wear-os-no-release"&gt;commenting in 2018&lt;/a&gt; that Google wasn’t on board yet with the idea of a “one-size-fits-all watch” and that Google’s “focus is on our partners for now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GP7dPe"&gt;But years later, Google’s list of hardware partners is wearing thin. In 2021, Wear OS has mostly been kept alive by dogged efforts from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22647941/fossil-announces-new-gen-6-wear-os-smartwatches-2021-update"&gt;Fossil&lt;/a&gt; and Mobvoi’s TicWatch lineup, neither of which screams “cutting edge consumer hardware.” Neither company has plans for a Wear OS 3.0 watch this year, either. If Google wants a great smartwatch for Android users, it needs to take the same approach here as it did with the original Pixel: make a proper, Google-built watch that shows both customers and hardware partners how it’s done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2Psgu"&gt;Both Apple and Samsung’s smartwatch efforts are testaments to the power of how good wearables can be when deep hardware and software integration complete each other. Owning an Apple Watch makes using your iPhone better, giving you additional health tracking metrics and better access to notifications, glanceable information, and things like music control on your wrist. But it’s not for nothing that the two best smartwatches around — the Apple Watch and the Samsung Galaxy Watch — are devices that are really only suited for owners of their respective smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 7 in green." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HzI7QElmyePeOV3IGRw5j3oxyGE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908899/vpavic_211006_4796_0029.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T7DFCx"&gt;A Pixel Watch could do the same thing for Google that the Apple Watch and Galaxy Watch do for Apple and Samsung: serve as a must-have accessory that helps drive Pixel owners to expand into the Google ecosystem with more health and fitness services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqGk6x"&gt;The Pixel 6’s biggest innovation isn’t a specific AI feature or camera upgrade. It’s the ethos behind it that Google was willing to pause, take a look at what &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; considered was important to have in a truly great Android phone, and then build a bespoke device that specifically did those things. With Google effectively relaunching Wear OS for the third time with Wear OS 3.0, the time is more than ripe for Google to do the same for the wrist, building a bespoke Pixel Watch that could fill a similar role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eyBZ4x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has the tools to do it, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bfeQIx"&gt;Google has the tools to do it, too. Wear OS is in better shape than it has been in years, thanks to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;Samsung partnership&lt;/a&gt; and an influx of new users on the platform (&lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/smartwatch-market-grows-27-yoy-q2-2021-apple-watch-user-base-crosses-100-million/"&gt;Samsung is one of the biggest players&lt;/a&gt; in the smartwatch world outside of Apple). Qualcomm has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307368/qualcomm-snapdragon-4100-google-wear-os-smartwatch-wearables-faster-battery-life"&gt;relatively new Snapdragon 4100 chips&lt;/a&gt; ready for hardware partners, assuming Google doesn’t simply make its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22710844/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-ai-speed-specs-details"&gt;in-house Tensor-style chip&lt;/a&gt; for smartwatches, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGyJV9"&gt;And of course, back in January, Google itself spent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22188428/google-fitbit-acquisition-completed-approved"&gt;$2.1 billion to buy Fitbit&lt;/a&gt;, which has been leading the field of fitness-focused wearables for years now, in addition to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18187026/google-fossil-group-smartwatch-sale-40-million-wear-os-android"&gt;mysterious $40 million purchase&lt;/a&gt; of Fossil’s smartwatch technology and R&amp;amp;D division in 2019. It just needs to combine all the pieces together into the kind of smartwatch that can compete — or even lead in — the wearable space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZG4vu9"&gt;Which means that it might just be a matter of time before the Pixel 6 (or perhaps a future Pixel 7) gets the Pixel Watch that Android fans have been waiting for — although it’s possible in a twist of irony that, when it does arrive, Android’s Wear OS savior might bear a Fitbit logo, not a Google one. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mark Zuckerberg has been added to a DC lawsuit over the Cambridge Analytica scandal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n-R454plBZ7mH7Yoc4SBFve4K44=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70021246/acastro_180409_1777_facebook_zuckerberg_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6TGUk7"&gt;District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine is adding Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18148651/facebook-lawsuit-washington-dc-attorney-general-lawsuit"&gt;to a lawsuit over&lt;/a&gt; the Cambridge Analytica data-mining scandal. Racine &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/agkarlracine/status/1450787572112838658?s=21"&gt;announced the addition&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter this morning, saying his investigation had revealed that Zuckerberg was “personally involved in decisions related to Cambridge Analytica and Facebook’s failure to protect user data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wQhKX"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2018-12/Facebook-Complaint.pdf"&gt;2018 lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; accuses Facebook (and now Zuckerberg) of misrepresenting its policies around third-party data access and compromising user privacy with lax protections. The attorney general’s office alleges that Facebook violated the Consumer Protection Procedures Act and seeks civil damages for the offense. A judge &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-privacy/u-s-judge-waves-through-d-c-case-against-facebook-idUSKCN1T22X7"&gt;allowed the case to proceed&lt;/a&gt; despite Facebook’s efforts to halt it in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3TLtwg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;BREAKING: I just added Mark Zuckerberg as a defendant in my lawsuit against Facebook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our continuing investigation revealed that he was personally involved in decisions related to Cambridge Analytica and Facebook’s failure to protect user data.&lt;/p&gt;— AG Karl A. Racine (@AGKarlRacine) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AGKarlRacine/status/1450787572112838658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xhku4Z"&gt;Racine says he added Zuckerberg after the office reviewed “hundreds of thousands of pages of documents produced in litigation and completed a wide range of depositions including former employees and whistleblowers.” He did not indicate which details had led to the decision or how deeply Zuckerberg was allegedly involved in the incident. “We’ve taken our obligation to investigate wrongdoing very seriously — and Facebook should take its responsibility to protect users just as seriously,” Racine tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2YowU"&gt;The DC complaint focuses primarily on Cambridge Analytica, a consulting firm that worked with a researcher using Facebook’s developer platform to access over 70 million US users’ profile information with the goal of targeting political advertisements. It alleges that Facebook knew the system was being abused to harvest data from nonconsenting users but failed to conduct audits, limit the company’s access, or reveal the improper access publicly until years after the fact. The complaint claims Facebook also failed to take action when other companies violated its rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJhXxs"&gt;Facebook has disputed the basis of the lawsuit. “These allegations are as meritless today as they were more than three years ago, when the District filed its complaint. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously and focus on the facts,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will start downranking your Groups posts if you break its rules</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cz2b06"&gt;Facebook will start demoting all Groups content from people who have violated its policies elsewhere across the platform. The move is supposed to limit rulebreakers from reaching other people in a community, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335659/facebook-groups-members-rules-recommendations-ban"&gt;builds on existing policies&lt;/a&gt; that prevent them from posting, commenting, or inviting others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cN4Yyb"&gt;In a blog post, Facebook says it will also add a new “Flagged by Facebook” feature that shows group administrators content that’s been flagged for removal. The admins can choose to remove the content or to ask for a review if they believe it’s appropriate, with the goal of getting administrators involved before Facebook steps in and issues a strike that could affect the group itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JghvG"&gt;Facebook has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21554349/facebook-groups-probation-violating-rules-misinformation-election"&gt;paid increasing attention to groups&lt;/a&gt; since the 2020 US presidential election, where they were used to spread false information about voting. It’s also facing increased scrutiny over extremism and other harmful content on the platform thanks to documents leaked by former Facebook employee Frances Haugen, who recently testified before Congress. Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3xjjj/facebook-says-extremely-common-thing-it-does-is-bad-when-reporters-do-it"&gt;Facebook indicated that&lt;/a&gt; it’s also expecting a slew of new stories based on “thousands of pages of leaked documents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOJchW"&gt;While the company characterized the upcoming reports as “an orchestrated ‘gotcha’ campaign,” it’s also promoted its efforts to reduce hateful or false content while offering greater transparency around moderation. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688840/facebook-releases-content-distribution-guidelines-for-news-feed"&gt;A September update&lt;/a&gt; offered detail about content that it demoted as problematic but didn’t entirely remove, including posts by accounts that had violated its rules in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
