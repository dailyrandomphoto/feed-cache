    <title>Backbone releases free adapter and 3D-print files for iPhone 13 Pro camera bump issue</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hk174V"&gt;Backbone Labs has acknowledged the issue that hampers the use of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;excellent iPhone gaming controller&lt;/a&gt; with the new iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691301/iphone-13-pro-camera-bump-backbone-one-gaming-controller-accessory"&gt;As we noticed last week&lt;/a&gt;, the iPhone 13 Pro’s thicker camera bump means the phone doesn’t sit neatly in the Backbone One controller, either sticking out on one side or causing the bridge on the back to slightly buckle. It’s not unusable, but it’s not great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uV1mXY"&gt;“We spent a tremendous amount of time meticulously crafting every surface of Backbone One (both bits and atoms) and even designing universal support for the iPhones available when it was released,” a Backbone representative wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Backbone/comments/pvhl98/backbone_one_iphone_13_pro_pro_max_adapter/"&gt;official post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, we’re disappointed in the situation at hand. Several folks on the team even upgraded to 13 Pro Max for a better gaming experience, and while the fit may be acceptable for some users, it’s not as good as we’d like it to be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WquSRF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Backbone One is a stunning controller that turns your iPhone into a more capable gaming device","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0nAvVr"&gt;To address this, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplaybackbone.com%2Fadapter%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22695887%2Fbackbone-controller-iphone-13-pro-camera-bump-3d-printed-adapter" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Backbone has designed an adapter&lt;/a&gt; that is intended to improve the experience with the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. Ordering one will require the latest version of the Backbone app. Once you boot into it, you should see a pop-up that will guide you through the process of ordering one. Otherwise, you can open the app, then go to Settings, find the Help button, then click “Request Adapter.” It’s free to order, but you’ll pay shipping fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZFzsm"&gt;Backbone has also released open-source 3D printable files for the adapter, if you’d prefer to go that route. &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4977709"&gt;The files are hosted on Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;. It says on its site that “UPS offers printing services, there are tons of free local printers at libraries, and websites like Shapeways allow you to order prints to your doorstep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwUaUy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 30th, 8:42AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Backbone has added a support page that details the installation process for the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max adapter. Additionally, it has steps for Backbone One owners, both current and new, to redeem a free adapter or 3D print it themselves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DISH bets on 5G by making its own $280 5G phone for Boost Mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2RfU8j1kHb_dlt0G11qeknp5YOw=/90x0:1710x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69930334/Celero_Option2_1800x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DISH and Boost Mobile hope to bring in new 5G customers with their own phone, the Celero5G.&lt;/em&gt; | DISH/Boost Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x0s0B3"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;acquiring Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Sprint and T-Mobile merger in 2020 and snapping up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319621/dish-network-acquires-republic-wireless-5g-cell-carrier-mvno-t-mobile"&gt;Republic Wireless for its 5G network&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, Dish is finally ready to turn Boost Mobile into the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587790/t-mobile-sprint-acquisition-dish-promises"&gt;fourth wireless carrier that the FCC envisioned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMGgqB"&gt;Its opening salvo? The satellite television provider is introducing an exclusive budget 5G phone for Boost Mobile’s prepaid customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czzVHh"&gt;The Celero5G is a “custom-built phone” for Boost Mobile, according to its spokesperson. Just like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557433/t-mobile-revvl-v-5g-price-screen-specs-availability"&gt;T-Mobile’s Revvl&lt;/a&gt; or AT&amp;amp;T’s Radiant, it has unique branding that you won’t find anywhere else. For a carrier that is trying to expand its user base, this is certainly an unusual way to get there. After all, most other carriers try to dangle the latest flagship phones from Apple and Android to lure you to sign up for their expensive post-paid service plans, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22678111/iphone-13-carrier-promotions-new-signups"&gt;deluge of “free” iPhone 13 offers&lt;/a&gt; from the Big 3 carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOEGoM"&gt;“With LG leaving the mobile device market and creating seismic shifts in the supplier landscape, we saw an opportunity,” said a Boost Mobile spokesperson. “The departure of LG left a significant hole in the Boost lineup. Celero5G is the response to fill that hole.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlQczK"&gt;Not much is known about this 5G phone at the moment besides the fact its name, Celero5G, is inspired by the “Latin word for speed.” According to the press release, the phone has a 6.52-inch display, four cameras, 36 hours of battery life, 4GB RAM, a microSD card slot, and 64GB of internal storage — all respectable specifications for a budget phone. Like the sub-$300 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;, this phone is probably powered by the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 690 5G chip that makes 5G connectivity possible at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oJFa6F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Celero5G fills a LG-sized hole in Boost Mobile’s lineup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mcGsXb"&gt;Judging by the press materials that Boost Mobile provided, it looks like the Celero5G has an iPhone-like metallic trim around the phone, and a glass back, which are rather upscale touches for a phone of this class. Perhaps this phone really is “superior to other mid-tier Android devices at higher price points,” as the press release claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFINtE"&gt;The best part about this phone is the plan. If you pre-order the Celero5G by October 31, 2021, you will get 12 months of free unlimited talk, text, and data service from Boost Mobile. Of course, it’s not completely unlimited: you will be downgraded to 2G after burning through 35GB of data, but it’s still plenty to use comfortably. Dish and Boost Mobile will even give you a free case for your $280 Celero5G 5G phone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pXwwQ"&gt;Signing up and keeping existing Boost Mobile customers with the Celero5G may be the easiest part of realizing Dish’s 5G dreams. Its biggest challenge will be to build out and provide national coverage to its 5G service — a  project that is much more expensive and challenging than releasing an exclusive 5G phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFcG2u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fairphone’s latest sustainable smartphone comes with a five-year warranty</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TFSm8pgeN4YONzo30D4MpbSJmEs=/0x0:3969x2646/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69930128/Fairphone_02_grey_phone_in_hand_on_couch_Kera_0091_C1_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fairphone 4’s updated design makes it look like a modern smartphone.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Fairphone 4&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vr0H02"&gt;Fairphone, the manufacturer focused on making easy to repair smartphones made out of ethically sourced materials, just took the wraps off its fourth-generation handset. The Fairphone 4 uses a modular design that’s similar to the company’s previous phones, only now with more powerful internals, a five-year warranty, and a promise of two major Android updates and software support until the end of 2025. Prices start at €579 / £499 for the phone, which will ship on October 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fq3T8m"&gt;I’ve been using the Fairphone 4 for a couple of days as my primary phone, and while I’m not ready to give a final verdict just yet, it feels like a big step forward compared to the dated designs and low-power components found in the company’s previous phones. Stay tuned for my full review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1daxC7"&gt;Fairphone’s ambition is to produce a more ethical alternative to modern smartphones. That means making a device that’s ethically sourced using sustainable materials before providing the software support and warranty to make it useable for as long as possible. Although Fairphone is only guaranteeing software support until the end of 2025, it has ambitions to extend this as far as 2027. In an ideal world, Fairphone would also like to eventually release 2024’s Android 15 as an update to the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/up1_EG9tNOFkd0m4c_SfDHk3DUw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887059/Fairphone_09_repairing_grey_phone_Keira_0069_C2_RGB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fairphone&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Fairphone’s previous devices, the Fairphone 4 is designed to be easy to disassemble.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h3H3ln"&gt;Normally, the specs of Fairphone’s devices are secondary to its ethical considerations, but unlike its previous phones, the Fairphone 4 is competitive with other mid-range Android handsets. The 5G handset is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 750G processor, and that’s paired with either 6 or 8GB of RAM and 128 or 256GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD. It’s powered by a 3,905mAh removable battery, and the display is a 6.3-inch 1080p LCD panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lq6W69"&gt;There are two rear cameras — a 48-megapixel main camera and a 48-megapixel ultrawide — and a single 25-megapixel selfie camera. The main rear camera is equipped with optical image stabilization and can record at up to 4K / 30fps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCGCMp"&gt;A notable downside compared to previous Fairphones is that the Fairphone 4 no longer includes a 3.5mm headphone jack, a choice that feels at odds with the company’s otherwise customer-first approach. Fairphone tells me it made this decision in order to be able to offer an official IP rating for dust and water resistance, which was missing from the company’s previous phones. It’s only IP54, which means it’s protected from light splashes rather than full submersion, but that’s impressive in light of its removable rear cover and modular design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2DwJSg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No plans for a US release for now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3A5n1w"&gt;Regarding its modularity, Fairphone is selling eight repair modules for the phone, which include replacement displays, batteries, back covers, USB-C ports, loudspeakers, earpieces, rear cameras, and selfie cameras. All of these are easily removable using a standard Philips head screwdriver, which means customers should be able to carry out a lot of repairs themselves. But, if you need to turn to a professional, Fairphone says its spare parts are readily available for local repair shops to buy and use themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqG2V2"&gt;Fairphone’s previous two phones are the only devices to have received &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2Fsmartphone-repairability%3Fsort%3Dscore&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F30%2F22700014%2Ffairphone-4-release-date-news-features-warranty-price-sustainable" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;perfect repairability scores from iFixit&lt;/a&gt;, and the company tells me it believes the Fairphone 4 is even more repairable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgUPR1"&gt;The hope is for these spare parts to be available until at least 2027. Fairphone has a good track record with previous devices, telling me it still has parts in stock for the six-year-old Fairphone 2, two years after the last handset was sold. But product manager Miquel Ballester concedes that the company has run out of certain parts for that model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HkEF2FHwpum8W-kZquDJEBBkcQA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887060/Fairphone_03_grey_phone_from_back_Kera_0114_C1_RGB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fairphone&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the rear are two cameras and a TOF sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ogqpZC"&gt;So too does Fairphone have a solid record on the software side of providing major Android updates for its phones… eventually. Earlier this year, the company officially released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349953/fairphone-2-android-9-update-sustainable-long-term-support"&gt;Android 9 update for the Fairphone 2&lt;/a&gt;, a device that originally launched with Android 5. It may have come almost three years after Android 9’s original release, but it means that the phone continues to run an officially supported version of Google’s operating system. It bodes well for Fairphone’s support aspirations for the Fairphone 4, although it will have to contend with the fact that Qualcomm only officially supports its chipsets for three major OS updates and four years of security updates, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/qualcomm-promises-three-years-of-android-updates-for-its-entire-soc-lineup/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h64dao"&gt;In terms of materials, the Fairphone 4 is made using Fairtrade-certified gold; responsibly sourced aluminum and tungsten; and recycled tin, rare earth minerals, and plastic (including its rear panel, which is 100 percent recycled polycarbonate). The company has various initiatives to improve the working conditions of miners and factory workers involved in the supply chains for its devices. Fairphone also claims that the Fairphone 4 is the “first electronic waste neutral handset” because it’ll recycle one phone or an equal amount of e-waste for each device sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icj5sw"&gt;The Fairphone 4 is available to preorder today in Europe and should ship starting October 25th. The model with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage costs €579 / £499, while the step-up model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage retails for €649 / ￡569. Unfortunately, there’s no sign of a US release: Fairphone says it’s interested but that it’s focusing on Europe for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Cloud Gaming launches in Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Japan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MdHr05jGgjWgG8YyIzxwH-itgCU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69930039/acastro_210429_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9J9GPS"&gt;Microsoft is launching its Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service in Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Japan. The software giant has been testing streaming Xbox Game Pass Ultimate games in these markets over the past few months, and is now ready to greatly expand the reach of its xCloud technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oZa31"&gt;XCloud will be available to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers in Brazil and Mexico later today, meaning it technically launches in Australia and Japan in the early hours of October 1st. Xbox Cloud Gaming will be available through the dedicated Android and Xbox Windows apps, or via the web for iOS and other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6SGPn"&gt;Microsoft is now offering Xbox Cloud Gaming in 26 countries, thanks to this big expansion. “Since cloud gaming is powered by custom Xbox Series X consoles, that means these games are being played on an Xbox in the cloud, bringing faster load times and improved frame rates to the gameplay experience,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/09/30/xbox-cloud-gaming-launches-in-australia-brazil-japan-and-mexico/"&gt;explains Catherine Gluckstein&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s head of Project xCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQMJYK"&gt;Alongside the expansion of Xbox Cloud Gaming, Microsoft also announced during its Tokyo Game Show broadcast that &lt;em&gt;Scarlet Nexus&lt;/em&gt; will be arriving on Xbox Game Pass later today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox chief warns console supply constraints will last into 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IeQCv7WyUvxGUgDogrg21YzX2ok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69930019/vpavic_201103_4275_0163.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series X console.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I7yVyk"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox chief, Phil Spencer, says console supply issues will continue into 2022. In an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/gaming-leaders-strauss-zelnick-of-take-two-xboxs-phil-spencer-join-thegrill-2021/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wrap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-says-console-supply-issues-will-continue-into-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video Games Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Spencer admits the Xbox supply issues will last for the rest of the year and into 2022 due to supply chain complications beyond just a chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VkjAt"&gt;“I think it’s probably too isolated to talk about it as just a chip problem,” says Spencer. “When I think about, what does it mean to get the parts necessary to build a console today, and then get it to the markets where the demand is, there are multiple kind of pinch points in that process. And I think regretfully it’s going to be with us for months and months, definitely through the end of this calendar year and into the next calendar year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEbkvs"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; has impacted various companies for 18 months now. Car manufacturers have had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22222166/semiconductor-shortage-ford-idle-kentucky-toyota-nissan-volkswagen"&gt;scale back production&lt;/a&gt; of vehicles, and it’s been near impossible to find stock of new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297039/playstation-ceo-ps5-supply-2021-stock-consoles-jim-ryan"&gt;PS5s&lt;/a&gt;, and Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LyNzV"&gt;Spencer isn’t alone in his predictions about the supply issues, either. Chip manufacturer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385240/tsmc-chip-shortage-2022-intel-ceo-earnings-graphics-cards-cpus-gpus"&gt;TSMC warned earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that the industry chip shortages could continue through 2022. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"&gt;Nvidia said it expects&lt;/a&gt; GPU supply constraints for the “vast majority” of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honda is doubling down on rockets, robots, and flying cars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RdLZS3Tb7c5gGhR-GQB7Kpirhks=/0x108:2581x1829/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69930004/187513_Honda_e_and_Frankfurt_International_Motor_Show_2019.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NnKpGu"&gt;Honda is increasing its research and development spending in three futuristic areas: rockets, robots, and electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOL), otherwise known as flying cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DyHFk7"&gt;The automaker will spend $45 billion (5 trillion yen) on R&amp;amp;D over the next six years. But Honda won’t say what fraction of that amount will be spent on developing rockets, robots, and flying cars, nor even if it plans on pursuing those projects as commercial businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0r3WP"&gt;In fact, Honda sees robots, rockets, and eVTOL aircraft as an extension of its main business of manufacturing automobiles. If the company can get a better electric vehicle platform out of it, for example, then it will be worth the investment. Basically, it wants to see if it can make working prototypes before taking the next step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aZuKxw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Core technologies in these areas are connected to our existing businesses”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ehTwxm"&gt;“Core technologies in these areas are connected to our existing businesses,” said Marcos Frommer, head of corporate communications for Honda, in a briefing with reporters, “and we are pursuing these new areas as an expansion of our core business as a mobility company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiJ8oC"&gt;Honda says it’s looking into eVTOL aircraft that could be used as part of an urban taxi service. But unlike most startups that are building lightweight, multi-prop vehicles that run on lithium-ion batteries, Honda says it will pursue a hybrid solution “as a means to realize the range desired by our customers,” Frommer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sejmx5"&gt;Honda says that pure battery-electric aircraft will only be able to achieve a maximum range of “several 10s of kilometers,” he said. By using gas turbines to supplement an electric motor, Honda says it will be able to achieve a range of up to 250 miles, enabling more commercially viable trips, like between Boston and New York City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqsh6r"&gt;Honda says it will make a decision on whether to pursue a commercial air taxi service “before 2025,” with the aim of obtaining regulatory certification and launching a new service by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2Vafe"&gt;Honda isn’t the only automaker to express interest in eVTOL. Others, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21068135/joby-aviation-toyota-flying-air-taxi-investment-amount"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226778/gm-flying-car-cadillac-halo-av-evtol-concept-autonomous-ces-2021"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt;, have also invested in prototypes and concepts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlSl0D"&gt;The aim of its robotics division is to develop “multi-fingered hands” that can pick up and grip certain objects. Honda is researching how to do this through remote operation, in which a human wearing a VR visor and a connected glove can operate the robotic hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OJCcy8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Honda is a pioneer in the field of robotics&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5XIlc4"&gt;Honda is a pioneer in the field of robotics, having developed Asimo, one of the first robots to walk on two legs. The automaker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17514134/honda-asimo-humanoid-robot-retire"&gt;ceased production of Asimo in 2018&lt;/a&gt; in order to focus on using the technology for more practical use cases in nursing and road transport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylJnio"&gt;Honda envisions white collar using its “Avatar” robots with digital screens in place of a face to remotely attend meetings and even interact with physical objects. This will allow people to live where they choose without constraints of workplace obligations, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfAIWv"&gt;Lastly, Honda is hoping to put its work propulsion, guidance, and control technologies to work on a “reusable rocket” program, Frommer said. The automaker started developing rocket technology in 2019, he added. “If we can use such rockets to launch small low orbit satellites, we can expect to evolve our core technologies into various services, including connected services,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3uAEa"&gt;How successful any of these research projects will be remains to be seen. The auto industry is going through a huge shift right now, with most of the major companies vowing to phase out gas-powered vehicles in favor of electric ones. Honda is no different, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399212/honda-gas-car-phase-out-2040-electric-vehicle"&gt;vowing to stop selling internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040&lt;/a&gt;. This will be an incredibly costly project, and risky too, as consumers in the US have been slow to adopt electrification. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A grueling day in Elizabeth Holmes’ trial ended with evidence that Theranos’ tests sucked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zcAxfVhyRZ5BX-aaWQySAPQrrzU=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69929323/1235435752.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A preview of arguments to come&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="a2F48p"&gt;After a tedious day of bickering, Victoria Sung appeared like manna from heaven — to tell us that Theranos’ tests sucked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ukgp8F"&gt;Sung worked at Celgene when it contracted with Theranos. Her testimony was brief and to the point: Celgene had not “comprehensively validated” Theranos technology, she said. That would have taken more work than what she did with Theranos’ tests. The work she showed the court from 2012 demonstrated Theranos performed dismally compared to standard testing — often returning results that were “out of range.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zyc1c6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sung is a teaser for a big part of US v. Elizabeth Holmes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U7DAav"&gt;We’ll get to the bickering in a minute, I promise, but Sung is a teaser for a big part of &lt;em&gt;US v. Elizabeth Holmes&lt;/em&gt; we haven’t explored much: Theranos’s relationship with pharmaceutical companies. One allegation prosecutor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663723/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-trial-opening-arguments-day-one"&gt;Robert Leach made in his opening statement&lt;/a&gt; was that Holmes had deceived Walgreens about its relationship with drug companies. During former employee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680372/elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-emails-gangakhedkar"&gt;Surekha Gangakhedkar’s testimony&lt;/a&gt; a little over a week ago, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1438927235352645637"&gt;she said&lt;/a&gt; that she didn’t think pharma company GlaxoSmithKline’s report on Theranos tech “comprehensively validated” it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ogYoGf"&gt;This phrase felt familiar, and today I realized from where: &lt;em&gt;Bad Blood&lt;/em&gt;, John Carreyrou’s book about Theranos. In the book, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Bad_Blood/CcJFDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;dq=he+first+was+the+clinical+trial+work+it+did+for+pharmaceutical+companies.+Documents+it+gave+Walgreens+stated+that+the+Theranos+system+had+been+%E2%80%9Ccomprehensively+validated+over+the+last+seven+years+by+ten+of+the+largest+fifteen+pharma+companies.%E2%80%9D&amp;amp;pg=PT98&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover"&gt;Carreyrou wrote&lt;/a&gt; that documents Theranos gave Walgreens “stated that the Theranos system had been ‘comprehensively validated over the last seven years by 10 of the largest 15 pharma companies.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdMBtO"&gt;GSK and Celgene’s acquirer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, certainly rank among the largest pharma companies. They did have contracts with Theranos; in fact, Celgene was Theranos’ largest pharma customer. But neither of the studies those two companies did count as comprehensive validation, according to Sung and Gangakhedkar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pw7xtv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At one point, the two got into a fight about whether Rosendorff had forwarded an email or replied to it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w4Pfs4"&gt;I imagine we will work through Theranos’ other pharma partners later in the trial; Sung’s testimony was brief. She was only on the stand because former lab director Adam Rosendorff had a childcare commitment at 2PM and couldn’t continue his cross-examination, which took most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vljHNp"&gt;Rosendorff had previously testified that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt;Theranos’ tests were bad&lt;/a&gt;, even saying he didn’t understand the clinical value of one test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VblPFP"&gt;Lance Wade, Holmes’ attorney, set out to undermine this testimony, and that was the source of a great deal of bickering.  Rosendorff could be persnickety about details; for instance, Wade kept mixing up “proficiency tests” with “precision tests,” and Rosendorff kept correcting him. At one point, the two got into a fight about whether Rosendorff had forwarded an email or replied to it. At least, I think that’s what they were arguing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVnJmp"&gt;We revisited the lab inspection by the California Department of Public Health, where Theranos employees got instructions not to go in or out of the “Normandy” lab, where the Edison machines were kept. In a previous inspection in New York, bulletin boards had been covered with paper so the inspector couldn’t see what was on them. Wade asked if that was to protect trade secrets. Rosendorff asked who would pin trade secrets to bulletin boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="pmNZ1S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Not as big bucks as you get paid.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RFmJ7O"&gt;But we did find out the results of the audit: some minor deficiencies, which upset Holmes and Balwani, Rosendorff testified. Later, Wade quipped that supervising quality control tests and making sure laws were followed was “why you get the big bucks, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdkx8Y"&gt;“Not as big bucks as you get paid,” Rosendorff replied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7tkUZ"&gt;While he was among the highest-paid employees at Theranos, making $240,000 a year, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/vLx6xZ7AHDQ0Kr2l6Sw4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noted that partners at Wade’s firm made an average of about $1.5 million a year. Given the problems at Theranos, as well as lawyers’ fees that stemmed from his time there, he should have been paid more, Rosendorff said. That bit of testimony was struck from the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ibjlc4"&gt;Bickering aside, Wade did make some progress. He put some of the emails Rosendorff had been asked about on direct examination in chronological order with documents Rosendorff had signed, showing that whatever reservations Rosendorff had didn’t stop him from approving tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66gC7M"&gt;Crucially, Wade got Rosendorff to revise his testimony about proficiency testing, which is required by law. Though proficiency testing wasn’t run on the Edison devices, Rosendorff said, it &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; been run on the FDA-approved machines in the lab. Wade produced documents from the American Proficiency Institute that graded Theranos “acceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NJtNcu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We have at least one more day of listening to Rosendorff and Wade squabble&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7j55dC"&gt;This is a significant narrowing of Rosendorff’s testimony from the direct examination. Unlike Wade’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699614/elizabeth-holmes-trial-steve-jobs-emails"&gt;attempted “gotcha” moment yesterday,&lt;/a&gt; this &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; make me reconsider how I felt about Rosendorff’s direct testimony on proficiency testing. It is far less damning to say that proficiency testing had been done everywhere &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; the Edison, which was used for only seven tests. Rosendorff was testifying to plans for proficiency testing on the Edison machines when he had to leave for the day. (This was when the email dispute occurred.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sU0p06"&gt;Remarks made by counsel after the jury left suggested we have at least one more day of listening to Rosendorff and Wade squabble, which I am not especially looking forward to. But Sung’s testimony &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; give me something to get excited about: What is the rest of Big Pharma going to say about Theranos?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon settles with the activists it fired</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d_xQhbdkZnFG3TGWQxLgs9mBwZc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69929129/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i98rut"&gt;Amazon has settled a dispute with two workers that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367672/amazon-employees-climate-justice-nlrb-case-wrongful-termination"&gt;National Labor Relations Board said were fired for their activism&lt;/a&gt;. In April 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220353/amazon-covid-19-criticism-protest-fired-employees-cunningham-costa-climate-change"&gt;fired Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa&lt;/a&gt; after they had organized a protest against Amazon’s work with oil and gas companies, as well as raising concerns with the company’s coronavirus measures at its warehouses. &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15kVQrpyqH_sbtOXvQ38DeXZx7lwLAn3GVsZUDb6i0e8/edit"&gt;In a joint statement&lt;/a&gt;, Costa and Cunningham said that the company would have to pay them lost wages as well as inform employees that they couldn’t be fired for organizing. They haven’t mentioned whether they would be getting their jobs as UX designers back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czFgdX"&gt;At the time of the NLRB’s ruling, Amazon said that it disagreed with the findings, and that Costa and Cunningham had been fired due to violation of internal policies. NLRB rulings don’t carry the weight of ones handed down by federal judges, but the labor relations board &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do"&gt;can argue to the legal system&lt;/a&gt; that its orders should be enforced. Often, though, &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/decide-cases"&gt;the two parties will settle&lt;/a&gt; as we saw today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3sl04B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The former employees called the settlement “a win for protecting workers rights”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GdnP1L"&gt; Amazon did not immediately respond to request for comment, but &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/29/amazon-settles-with-employees-who-said-they-were-fired-over-activism.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that it and the employees had “reached a mutual agreement that resolves the legal issues in this case and welcome the resolution of this matter.” Costa and Cunningham called the settlement “a win for protecting workers rights.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0ODCn"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/fired-interrogated-disciplined-amazon-warehouse-organizers-allege-year-retaliation-n1262367"&gt;faces many more NLRB complaints&lt;/a&gt;, and the NLRB &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;issued a preliminary assessment&lt;/a&gt; in August that the company illegally interfered with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"&gt;highly publicized warehouse union drive&lt;/a&gt; in Bessemer, Alabama. That case is &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/10-RC-269250"&gt;currently still open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZzoyG"&gt;Amazon has already been required to post notices informing workers about their labor rights because of previous settlements, so that’s not a new win for organizers or activists. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-union-labor-violations-nlrb"&gt;Some workers have argued&lt;/a&gt; that the settlements and NLRB rulings don’t carry enough consequences for Amazon to change its retaliatory behavior against its employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="d6jIEl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NLRB officer says Amazon violated US labor law","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>This is Facebook’s internal research on the mental health effects of Instagram</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BhvNkv8KRLSBKoToVPMrKwZbqtI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69929052/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hbaYAV"&gt;Facebook has shared the internal research about the impact of Instagram on teenage mental wellbeing reported on by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported that the files showed Instagram knew the social media network has a negative affect on teens’ mental health. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report"&gt;has pushed back&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;WSJ’s&lt;/em&gt; characterizations of its research, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; “it is simply not accurate that this research demonstrates Instagram is ‘toxic’ for teen girls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSTY2F"&gt;The research slide decks are available on &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/"&gt;Facebook’s newsroom here&lt;/a&gt;, split into two PDFs. We’ve also embedded the PDFs at the bottom of this story. Notably, the two PDFs have been annotated by Facebook in an effort to provide context.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7pKkt"&gt;Following Facebook’s release of the two documents, &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-documents-instagram-teens-11632953840?page=1"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; them along with four more that it said formed the basis of its Instagram story. &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reporter Jeff Horwitz &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffHorwitz/status/1443397583645249541"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Facebook ran the first two documents minutes after being given an hour’s notice of the newspaper’s plans to publish. The previously unpublished documents include research on teen girls’ body image and appearance-based social comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="M5o4Lx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“teens who have lower life satisfaction more likely to say Instagram makes their mental health... worse”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kLORH9"&gt;The release comes after significant pressure on Facebook to release the files, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22697786/why-facebook-should-release-the-facebook-files"&gt;including from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Casey Newton&lt;/a&gt;. “We know Facebook executives believe that the company has positive overall benefits for the world, and we also know that they are meticulous students of their own data,” Newton wrote on Tuesday. “It’s hard to understand why, if the data is so positive, Facebook is often so reluctant to share it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKD65L"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s report highlighted specific findings from the document as evidence of a broader mental health problem on the app — most notably the finding that “thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wj3SY8"&gt;The slides produced by Facebook do much to back up to that interpretation, even if the company disputes specific points of the interpretation. In one particular slide, Facebook clarifies that the data is better interpreted as “teens who have lower life satisfaction more likely to say Instagram makes their mental health or the way they feel about themselves worse than teens who are satisfied with their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6XVpN"&gt;The release of the research arrives the evening before a Congressional hearing on the effect of Facebook and Instagram on kids’ mental health. That hearing is scheduled &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/9/protecting-kids-online-facebook-instagram-and-mental-health-harms"&gt;for Thursday at 10:30AM ET&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo categorically denies that a 4K Switch Pro is in development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nintendo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kzndv147yiO9wZfKx_61I1fa9VI=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69929036/nintendo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f4M4eY"&gt;It is rare for a big company to come out and categorically deny an entire report, but that’s what Nintendo just did today — the Japanese corporate entity has issued a press release insisting that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-29/nintendo-switch-4k-developers-make-games-for-nonexistent-console?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s seeming revelation&lt;/a&gt; that Nintendo was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701210/nintendo-switch-4k-pro-rumors-oled"&gt;pushing developers to build 4K-resolution games&lt;/a&gt; for an upcoming but potentially canceled “Switch Pro” handheld was entirely incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNMMYO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1443366440183074819"&gt;Nintendo writes&lt;/a&gt; the report “falsely claims that Nintendo is supplying tools to drive game development for a Nintendo Switch with 4K support” and insists that it’s “not true.” Separately, it says that it has no plans for any new Nintendo Switch other than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22690483/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-oled-console-hands-on-preview"&gt;the slightly refined OLED model&lt;/a&gt; that’ll be out next week.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gvtXQt_gsnw_c91aFLwK8mp6mWA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22889057/nintendo_twitter_bloomberg_report_switch_pro.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1hUcdR"&gt;While there’s always a possibility that the language technically allows for most if not all of &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; report to be correct — that, for instance, there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a 4K Switch development kit, and that Nintendo &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; push developers to build 4K content, and that Nintendo is simply &lt;em&gt;not pushing that anymore — &lt;/em&gt;Nintendo is attempting to say that the entire report is not true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ewPtO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; appears to be standing by its report, which isn’t much of a surprise. It comes from respected game/tech industry journalists who have been extremely well-sourced in the past, and this report is no exception: it cites anonymous employees at 11 different game companies all saying they have a 4K Switch development kit. Following Nintendo’s tweet, the publication simply added an additional line about Nintendo’s denial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDB7HZ"&gt;Weighed against a Nintendo statement with even a little bit of wiggle room, I’d tend to believe 11 sources over the company, particularly when that company’s under investor pressure to have its new OLED handheld do well on launch day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zPHp6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:56PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Bloomberg has minimally updated its post to include Nintendo’s new denial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NY5UHR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
