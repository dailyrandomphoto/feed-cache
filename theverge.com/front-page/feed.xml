    <title>Jabra’s Elite 65t are just $50 at Best Buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="synnAq"&gt;It seems like the market for true wireless earbuds becomes more and more crowded each week, with products like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;Nothing Ear 1s&lt;/a&gt; being two of the latest contenders to jump into the already-burgeoning field. And while the Jabra Elite 65t are beginning to show their age in comparison and are by no means top of the field, they’re still a great pair of earbuds with enjoyable sound and a customizable fit, not to mention a two-year warranty that covers any potential damage they may sustain from prolonged exposure to sweat or dust. Normally $80, you can pick up the copper-black model at &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fjabra-elite-65t-true-wireless-earbud-headphones-copper-black%2F6230036.p%3FacampID%3D0%26cmp%3DRMX%26irclickid%3DQJaSroQtuxyLRzW0UfQwQyYMUkBRJYTkExnTRM0%26irgwc%3D1%26loc%3DNarrativ%26mpid%3D376373%26ref%3D198%26skuId%3D6230036&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $50&lt;/a&gt;, slightly more than their best price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/17/17247354/jabra-elite-65t-truly-wireless-earbuds-review-airpods"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LsZ8di"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625428"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xJtr6U"&gt;When talking TV recommendations with the rest of &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;staff, there’s one model that seems to come up more often than any other: the LG C1. It’s not particularly surprising, however, especially since the 4K OLED is the successor to the LG CX, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs you can buy for the PS5 or Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. Every configuration of the C1 offers support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync technologies and comes with a 120Hz refresh rate, low input lag, and HDR. It also has a faster processor than the CX and a gamer-friendly interface that lets you quickly toggle between various settings without having to delve deep into the settings pane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaN1ct"&gt;If you don’t mind sticking with a smaller panel, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FLG-C1PU-48-HDR-4K-Ultra-HD-Smart-OLED-TV-2021-Model-%2F184898835257%3F_trksid%3D%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDeals081221%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F12%2F22620961%2Fjabra-elite-65t-earbuds-lg-c1-48-inch-oled-anker-nintendo-switch-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model for an additional $100 off at eBay&lt;/a&gt; with coupon code &lt;strong&gt;SAVE20FORBTS&lt;/strong&gt;, bringing the final sale price down to just $1,197.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rFbsD2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697443"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PZM0Kg"&gt;The Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite are great consoles when it comes to portability, but keeping either console juiced on the go can prove challenging, especially if you’re using an older Switch model that doesn’t offer the same kind of battery life as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697601/nintendo-switch-new-model-battery-life-improvements"&gt;second-gen model&lt;/a&gt; or forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;OLED edition&lt;/a&gt;. That’s where a device like Anker’s PowerCore 13400 Powerbank can prove handy. The compact, Nintendo-licensed battery pack — which is currently &lt;a href="http://adorama.rfvk.net/2rQzAA"&gt;on sale at Adorama for $30&lt;/a&gt; — provides nearly enough power to charge the standard Switch twice over and can be used with a range of other USB-C devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit is now valued at more than $10 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XFjqLoDbgITDdQ8G-GQiYLXeoBI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714632/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U58DcO"&gt;Reddit, the self-declared ‘front page of the internet,’ says it is now &lt;a href="https://redditblog.com/2021/08/12/reddit-secures-funding-to-continue-growth-plans/"&gt;valued at more than $10 billion&lt;/a&gt; after raising an additional $410 million in funding, with the final round expected to grow to up to $700 million. The company continues to build and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21364019/reddit-bans-racist-subreddit-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-twitter-thread"&gt;sanitize its business&lt;/a&gt;, removing racist, misogynist, and otherwise controversial communities, as it prepares to go public at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="574zEp"&gt;“We are still planning on going public, but we don’t have a firm timeline there yet,” Reddit’s co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/technology/reddit-new-funding.html"&gt;in an interview&lt;/a&gt;. “All good companies should go public when they can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4LUZJ"&gt;The company previously raised $250 million in funding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274077/reddit-funding-round-250-million-double-employees-investment"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for a valuation of $6 billion. But Huffman told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; the company was approached with this recent financing round by Fidelity Investments and were made “an offer that we couldn’t refuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNSnzp"&gt;Reddit makes most its money from advertising on the site, and although it’s a minnow compared to the likes of Facebook and Google, it’s growing its business quickly. The company says it made $100 million in advertising revenue in the second quarter of 2021, up 192 percent compared to the same period last year. Though for context, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596592/google-q2-2021-record-revenue-profit-youtube-ad-cloud-search"&gt;made $61.9 billion&lt;/a&gt; in this year’s second quarter, mostly from YouTube and Search advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlauzM"&gt;Reddit now has roughly 52 million daily users (compared to 1.85 billion daily Facebook users) and more than 100,000 active sub-reddits. Earlier this year, the company said it planned to double its staff count by the end of 2021 to around 1,400 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfEQfU"&gt;Huffman told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that the new funding would be used to make the site easier for first-time users and help its communities expand internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet users have more options to add co-hosts, limit screen sharing, and mute others</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nsy-EcbVP9_BlHit8lD1XT7MNFc=/0x0:1980x1320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714425/googlemeetnewui.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="svljGT"&gt;Google is adding a bunch of &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/08/add-up-to-25-cohosts-expanded-safety-features-for-meet.html?"&gt;new features to Google Meet&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier for users to control and direct meetings. However, exactly which controls will be available depends on whether you are using Meet as a regular user or as part of a Google Workspace team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKoHZC"&gt;The main update is that all users will now be able to assign up to 25 co-hosts per meeting, who will have access to host controls. This will let them limit who can share their screen and send chat messages, as well as mute all participants with a single click, end the meeting, and control who can enter the meeting (though this last feature is only available to certain Google Workspace versions). Previously, assigning co-hosts was only available to Google Workspace for Education customers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXSv181Esl0gLcE6zfIxIovPFmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22777885/host2.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hosts can assign other call participants as co-hosts by clicking the three-dot menu next to their name&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uEisbB"&gt;Google Meet is also getting new Quick Access settings if you’re a Google Workspace customer. This will be enabled by default, but if it’s turned off, it means meetings won’t be able to start until the host joins. Users can also do things like block anonymous users from joining or only let invited participants join without asking — ensuring only people who are &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be in a meeting are actually in there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4qXfy"&gt;The changes are scheduled to roll out on web and Android from August 16th and on iOS from August 30th. For full details of the changes and availability based on different Workplace versions, check out the blog post from Google &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/08/add-up-to-25-cohosts-expanded-safety-features-for-meet.html?"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s Wear OS app is getting offline playback in the coming weeks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-_d13u-UaD3xsRI6anxOz-YpYVo=/591x0:1416x550/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714396/Spotify_wearOS_banner01_1_1440x550.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wNFepC"&gt;Spotify’s updated Wear OS app is releasing “over the coming weeks,” &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-08-11/enjoy-all-your-music-and-podcasts-offline-on-smartwatches-running-wear-os/"&gt;Spotify has announced&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll support offline playback on smartwatches running Wear OS 2.0 and up. The new functionality was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442880/spotify-youtube-music-download-offline-playlists-podcasts-updates"&gt;announced in May&lt;/a&gt; alongside the news of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;Google’s collaboration with Samsung&lt;/a&gt; on the next-generation of the wearable operating system, Wear OS 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUFVtq"&gt;The fact that offline downloads will be available on Wear OS 2 means that it’s not exclusive to upcoming Wear OS 3 watches like Samsung’s recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22618532/galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-fitness-tracker-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy Watch 4 and the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify says it should work on watches from the likes of Fossil, Mobvoi, and Suunto. Meanwhile Google’s new YouTube Music Wear OS app, which also supports offline listening, is &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/11/youtube-music-wear-os-maps-release/"&gt;exclusive to Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1RM7Y"&gt;Similar to Spotify’s offline listening on the Apple Watch, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447222/spotify-adding-feature-music-downloads-offline-apple-watch"&gt;launched in May&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll need a Premium subscription to use the feature. Spotify says you’ll be able to download music or podcasts by hitting the “Download to watch” button in the Wear OS app. A small green arrow will appear next to a playlist, album, or podcast once it’s available for listening offline. Free users will be able to download podcasts directly to the watch for offline playback, but when it comes to music they’ll have to stream in shuffle mode over Wi-Fi or cellular. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Warhammer’s new subscription streaming service is coming to iOS, Android, and smart TVs </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gt_N9DpOPPvzY_uSo-x0vreyp7M=/0x24:1500x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714336/WH40K_GuillimanvsBlackLegion2018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Roboute Guilliman, primarch of the Ultramarines, takes on the Black Legion. | Image: Games Workshop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eaIsRk"&gt;Games Workshop is preparing to launch Warhammer Plus, a niche subscription streaming service for fans of the sprawling, lore-dense Warhammer universe (or rather, universes: the sci-fi world of &lt;em&gt;Warhammer 40,000&lt;/em&gt;, and fantasy setting of &lt;em&gt;Warhammer Age of Sigmar&lt;/em&gt;). The &lt;a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2021/08/11/warhammer-is-packed-with-amazing-shows-and-features-heres-how-youll-access-them-all/"&gt;company now says&lt;/a&gt; Warhammer Plus will not only be available on iOS and Android through a number of dedicated apps, but also on Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Roku services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCJtCl"&gt;The launch comes at a rather awkward time for Games Workshop, given that some fans are currently boycotting the firm after a recent change to its intellectual property policy. &lt;em&gt;Warhammer 40k&lt;/em&gt; in particular has an extremely vocal and active fanbase (check out &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Grimdank/"&gt;r/Grimdank&lt;/a&gt; for a taste) that produce memes, cosplays, and fan animations. But Games Workshop recently said &lt;a href="https://www.games-workshop.com/en-WW/Intellectual-Property-Guidelines"&gt;it is now taking&lt;/a&gt; a “zero tolerance” approach to unauthorized uses of its IP, meaning fan films “are only to be created under licence from Games Workshop.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AmdYazRUrkMiNe7EeBIKRmOfbSA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22777862/hmLRvMup5WPBKx67.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Games Workshop&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The service is launching August 25th. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JsZxdA"&gt;The change &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aq4j3/warhammer-40k-fans-in-revolt-over-zero-tolerance-fan-animation-policy"&gt;understandably angered a lot of fans&lt;/a&gt;, particularly when popular creator Bruva Alfabussa shut down his long-running &lt;em&gt;Warhammer 40k&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyiDf91_bTEgnBN0jAvzNbqzrlMGID5WA"&gt;YouTube show&lt;/a&gt;, If The Emperor Had a Text-To-Speech Device, rather than face potential legal repercussions. It seems like a bit of a self-defeating move for Games Workshop, considering how the work of fans helps to draw people into Warhammer, and ultimately buy its tabletop figures and video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gl0aM8"&gt;It’s also hard not to draw a line between the change in policy and the new Warhammer Plus streaming service, which includes a number of new animation series. Though, despite the annoyance of same fans, many admit the service seems like decent value for money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1yAye"&gt;For $5.99 / £4.99 a month (or $59.99 / £49.99 a year), subscribers will get access to a swathe of content, including a free miniature, which would cost upwards of $30 by itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="IuVqOb"&gt;TV shows like &lt;em&gt;Citadel Colour Masterclass&lt;/em&gt; for teaching model painting techniques, &lt;em&gt;Loremasters&lt;/em&gt; to dive into official Warhammer lore, and &lt;em&gt;Battle Report&lt;/em&gt;, which follows tournament-style tabletop battles in the Warhammer TV studio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FvxDxm"&gt;Animations like &lt;a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2021/04/08/a-new-angels-of-death-trailer-is-here-and-its-crawling-with-cultists/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2021/03/18/hammer-and-bolter-spectacular-new-screenshots-from-the-animated-anthology/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hammer and Bolter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BYLRNO"&gt;Premium access to the games’ official companion apps, Warhammer 40,000: The App and Warhammer Age of Sigmar, which include rulebooks, FAQs, and the Battle Forge army builder. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l0GQWU"&gt;The Warhammer Vault, which includes official novelizations and the whole back catalogue of &lt;em&gt;White Dwarf&lt;/em&gt; magazine. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="e08UwH"&gt;A free exclusive miniature, with subscribers able to choose from a Vindicare Assassin or an Orruk Megaboss, with the option to buy the other later on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZrIrCPI6QOxXNSw6jiIJ8VNhUUQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22777865/warhammer_plus_minis.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Games Workshop&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Vindicare Assassin (left) and Orruk Megaboss (right) miniatures, available exclusively for Warhammer Plus subscribers. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cYiyCK"&gt;The irony is that Warhammer Plus will &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22451632/warhammer-plus-streaming-service-animations-previews-trailer"&gt;also include an animation series&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;em&gt;Astartes&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/3/11/22325655/warhammer-40k-animation-announcement-astartes-follow-up-exodite-primaris-lost-templar-iron-within"&gt;started life as a fan animation&lt;/a&gt;, shared on YouTube and racking up millions of views, before Games Workshop offered its creator, Syama Pedersen, a job. By stifling such fan creativity in the future, is the company shooting itself in the foot with a bolter? If so, it’ll definitely lose the leg. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom’s new focus mode could keep students from distracting each other</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EzV_MaSwms1V28pRwGWiMWiEYeo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69713469/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S7VKng"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/back-to-school-hybrid-learning/"&gt;Zoom has announced&lt;/a&gt; a new Focus mode, &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360061113751"&gt;which it says&lt;/a&gt; is meant to keep students from getting distracted while in a virtual classroom, while still allowing the teacher to keep an eye on everybody. When activated, Focus mode will make it so that a meeting’s participants won’t be able to see each other’s videos or screen shares, while the host is still able to see everyone’s webcams. It provides some of the control &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115004834466#h_01EYVHFHQMD1G3YSZB8TNG9E8P"&gt;found in Webinar mode&lt;/a&gt;, without the &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/when-to-use-meetings-vs-webinars/"&gt;complexity and lack of flexibility&lt;/a&gt; that comes with it — for instance, a teacher could turn on Focus mode while presenting, and then turn it off when it’s time for a class discussion. And, while &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fpricing%2Fwebinar&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F11%2F22620822%2Fzoom-virtual-learning-classes-focus-mode-teachers-students" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hosting a Webinar costs money&lt;/a&gt;, Focus mode appears to be available to free accounts, based on my testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1xRV6"&gt;This feature comes as the new school year approaches in many districts, and as the threat of COVID-19 remains serious. It seems likely that virtual classrooms are going to be sticking around for some, so it’s good that Zoom is adding features to improve tele-learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="73Epe8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10697320"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SeOgR3"&gt;While focus mode will put the teacher’s video or screen share front-and-center for students, it won’t be the only thing on their screens. For one, participants will still see their own video, as well as any videos or screen shares that are spotlighted by the host. They’ll also be able to see the names of the other participants, as well as any emoji reactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtOMkG"&gt;Overall, the feature seems like a decent way to keep students from distracting each other during class, and could even have its uses outside of a learning environment (say, during company presentations, if managers are worried about employees not paying attention to slides). Zoom’s &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360061113751"&gt;Focus mode support article&lt;/a&gt; says that the feature can be enabled or locked on for accounts, groups, or individual users. After turning it on for your account the feature can be accessed by clicking the More button while in a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three more high-profile Blizzard employees are no longer at the company, including Diablo 4’s director</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MjXMsgkIv764ZBXBfVWH6XZo38A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69712748/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8b7HR2"&gt;Three prominent Blizzard employees have been let go from the company, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/jesse-mcree-diablo-4-director-no-longer-at-activision-1847469113?rev=1628715951359"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, marking the latest departures from the studio following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;major sexual harassment lawsuit brought by the state of California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Diablo 4&lt;/em&gt; game director Luis Barriga, lead designer Jesse McCree, and &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; designer Jonathan LeCraft are not employed at Blizzard anymore, according to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku. &lt;/em&gt;Activision Blizzard confirmed the departures in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; after we published this story, but declined to comment on whether or not Barriga, McCree, and LeCraft were fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAEkZX"&gt;“We have a deep, talented roster of developers already in place and new leaders have been assigned where appropriate,” a Blizzard spokesperson said. “We are confident in our ability to continue progress, deliver amazing experiences to our players, and move forward to ensure a safe, productive work environment for all.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i8pI2d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;McCree is the inspiration for the name of the McCree character in Overwatch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jdyxvL"&gt;Activision Blizzard has not shared why they are no longer at the company, according to a &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; source. McCree appears to be one of the people photographed inside Blizzard’s so-called “Cosby Suite,” in a screenshot &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and appeared to participate in the “BlizzCon Cosby Crew” chat. McCree is also the inspiration for the name of the McCree character in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch;&lt;/em&gt; Michael Chu, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/11/21174947/overwatch-lead-writer-michael-chu-leaves-blizzard"&gt;the game’s former lead writer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/lPXKBFXS3wk?t=146"&gt;revealed in 2017&lt;/a&gt; that the real-life McCree had to “sign over his name” to the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; team because they liked it for the gunslinging character more than many other ideas. (Some&lt;em&gt; Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League casters have &lt;a href="https://gamerant.com/overwatch-league-casters-mccree-name/"&gt;avoided saying McCree’s name on air&lt;/a&gt;.) LeCraft was also pictured in the Cosby Suite, according to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku’s&lt;/em&gt; new story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xi17ju"&gt;We asked if Blizzard plans to change McCree’s name in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and the company said it’s checking into it. It’s possible the company might do so: days after the lawsuit hit, Blizzard’s &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; team promised to remove &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597006/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-activision-remove-references-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;“references that are not appropriate for our world,”&lt;/a&gt; and has reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/references-to-alex-afrasiabi-removed-in-world-of-warcraft-323588"&gt;already removed a variety of &lt;em&gt;WoW &lt;/em&gt;in-game references to Alex Afrasiabi.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsqOZ3"&gt;Afrasiabi was a former &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; senior creative director who was singled out in the lawsuit for his behavior, and Blizzard &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it fired Afrasiabi for “his misconduct in his treatment of other employees.” He appears to have worked for the company &lt;a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/alex-afrasiabi-whered-he-go-o/749539"&gt;until June 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHjg5a"&gt;The departures of Barriga, McCree, and LeCraft follow the ones by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;former Blizzard president J. Allen Brack&lt;/a&gt;, who was named in the lawsuit, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608320/blizard-jesse-meschuk-leave-company-hr-svp"&gt;former SVP of HR Jesse Meschuk&lt;/a&gt;. Employees walked out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;in late July&lt;/a&gt; to protest the company’s response to the lawsuit, and a shareholder released a letter on Tuesday saying the company’s response doesn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618776/activision-blizzard-shareholder-letter-soc-investment-group"&gt;“go nearly far enough.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L54Fwh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 11th, 7:35PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Blizzard and relevant context about another fired Blizzard executive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors pivots to renting space at former GM factory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lordstown Motors Headquarters Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TozUNnhFg8VJhskK8KZ2yqY2dUA=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69713084/1232963726.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7NapJL"&gt;Lordstown Motors is looking to essentially loan out some space at the massive former General Motors factory it owns, as the troubled startup gets closer to building its first production-quality Endurance pickup trucks later this year. Interim CEO Angela Strand shared Wednesday that Lordstown is in “serious discussions... with several potential partners” who may build vehicles or do other types of work at the plant alongside the startup — meaning the startup could act like a sort of WeWork for manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EI0aA"&gt;“This is a critical strategic pivot for us, a decision that we believe will lead to significant new revenue opportunities for Lordstown at the same time as production of the Endurance is ramping up,” Strand said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vf5LP7"&gt;“Our current footprint utilizes about 30 percent of the plant’s 6.2 million square feet, so we have ample room for potential partners to build vehicles, for us to build vehicles for others, and for additional [Lordstown Motors] vehicle platforms” to be built, president Rich Schmidt added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aNAC0y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a critical strategic pivot for us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xxa9FV"&gt;Strand and Schmidt shared the plan on a call with investors where the company discussed its &lt;a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results"&gt;second quarter financial results&lt;/a&gt;. Lordstown Motors, which said in June that it&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535457/lordstown-motors-electric-van-project-camping-world-work-stopped-endurance"&gt; will run out of cash by May 2022 without additional funding&lt;/a&gt;, lost $108 million in the quarter. The company was recently &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/lordstown-motors-strikes-stock-sale-agreement-with-hedge-fund-271627309034"&gt;buoyed by an equity purchase agreement with a hedge fund&lt;/a&gt; which could allow it to raise up to $400 million. But the startup is still looking to raise more funding as it heads towards an announced September start date for production of the Endurance, and it won’t make money on those vehicles until they start shipping in early 2022 (which is around the same time that Ford’s competing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522488/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck-first-look-photos"&gt;F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt; is set to ship).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsHdD6"&gt;Those funding efforts include the plan to allow other companies to use the factory, as well as finding strategic partners and investors, and raising debt financing. Strand — who struck a five-month, $500,000 &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000110465921085206/tm2119909d2_8k.htm"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; with Lordstown to captain the ship while it searches for a permanent CEO — said that the startup is in talks with a number of companies and potential lenders but declined to name any. She also said Lordstown Motors is working to get a third-party appraisal of the value of the factory, the equipment inside, and the improvements that the startup has made — which could help increase the amount of money Lordstown can borrow against the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHWz8H"&gt;The former GM factory has played an outsized role in the short but tumultuous story of Lordstown Motors. In fact, the company was essentially founded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537225/gm-factory-workhorse-ev-electric-vehicle-startup-sale-trump-tweet"&gt;with the intent of buying the factory in early 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="2tylTV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The former GM plant has played an outsized role in Lordstown Motors’ short history &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2613ZN"&gt;At the time, GM had come under tremendous pressure from then-President Donald Trump for closing the plant (where it once produced the Chevy Cruze). So Lordstown Motors founder Steve Burns &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20954956/gm-lordstown-motors-factory-workhorse-electric-vehicles-trump-ev"&gt;struck a deal with his former company&lt;/a&gt;, another EV startup called Workhorse, to license intellectual property for an electric pickup truck that was never put into production. GM assisted with the purchase and handed over some equipment. Trump said the deal was “GREAT NEWS FOR OHIO!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crXgxU"&gt;Lordstown Motors, which went public in a merger with a special purpose acquisition company late last year, has since put about $240 million of work into the factory to get it ready to build the electric pickup truck. Workhorse was even considering using Lordstown Motors as &lt;a href="https://www.mahoningmatters.com/local-news/report-us-postal-service-contract-could-mean-800m-for-lordstown-motors-2782744"&gt;a manufacturer&lt;/a&gt; if it won the contract to build the next-generation United States Postal Service mail truck (before the award &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557764/workhorse-complaint-oshkosh-usps-mail-truck-fight"&gt;went to defense contractor Oshkosh&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99rBVZ"&gt;But Lordstown Motors stumbled earlier this year after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"&gt;Hindenburg Research published a report&lt;/a&gt; alleging that Burns had misled investors about how many preorders the startup had collected for the truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bTR9f"&gt;Burns has since resigned, along with a number of other executives and employees close to him, and the startup is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. Lordstown Motors subsequently narrowed its plans for initial production, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535457/lordstown-motors-electric-van-project-camping-world-work-stopped-endurance"&gt;stopped work on a second vehicle&lt;/a&gt; — an electric van — that was supposed to be part of a partnership with Camping World. This week, Workhorse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616733/workhorse-c1000-electric-van-truck-redesign-wkhs-usps"&gt;sold 72 percent of the stake it acquired&lt;/a&gt; in Lordstown Motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVJ16D"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MI8b36"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYUJYf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="8AY6XC"&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1425550620887375876?s=20"&gt;Twitch has issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; announcing the steps it’s taking to protect its marginalized streamers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="GpOKv4"&gt;Twitch says it’s identified “a vulnerability in our proactive filters, and have rolled out an update to close this gap and better detect hate speech in chat.” It also says it will implement more safety features in the coming weeks, including improvements to the account verification process and ban evasion detection tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSXCck"&gt;This statement is in response to the hashtag &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23twitchdobetter&amp;amp;src=typed_query"&gt;#twitchdobetter&lt;/a&gt;, which was an effort started by &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rekitraven"&gt;Twitch creator RekItRaven&lt;/a&gt; in order to bring awareness to harassment issues that Black creators were experiencing on the streaming platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMfie6"&gt;“I was hate raided for the 2nd time in a week and I shared both the first and second occurrences [on Twitter] because they were very pointed rather than the normal, ‘You’re fat, black, gay stuff,’” Raven tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; via direct messaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrdQEX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Content warning: racism)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ysnG3X"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Guess who got hate raided again tonight?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep hating, babes. I'm not going anywhere.&lt;br&gt;And the fact that ya'll made accounts like "ravens_baboon_lips" and "ravencantbreatheofficer" don't mean fuck all to me because I'm still here and I'm still ✨thriving ✨ &lt;a href="https://t.co/fHtgy1Os2W"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fHtgy1Os2W&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ʀᴇᴋ ɪᴛ, ʀᴀᴠᴇɴ! ☠  (@RekItRaven) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RekItRaven/status/1423828534133407747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NtKZIH"&gt;Raiding is a popular Twitch feature that allows a streamer to send viewers to another streamer at the end of their broadcast. It’s a tool used to boost viewership, grow communities, and foster connections between streamers and their audiences. Hate raids are the polar, toxic opposite. In hate raids, a streamer directs their viewers to another creator — who is often times Black, queer, female, or has an intersection of marginalized identities — in order to bombard that streamer with hate speech and harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEul8m"&gt;Raven believes they became a target for hate raids because they stream using the Black tag, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/22/22448809/transgender-twitch-tags-lgbt-streaming-identity"&gt;a new Twitch feature&lt;/a&gt; that allows users to classify their streams with different markers. The tags are ostensibly used for creators to categorize their streams so interested users can better find the content they’re looking for, but it also creates a beacon trolls use to zero in on vulnerable, marginalized streamers. After their experience with hate raids, Raven noticed other marginalized streamers in their community were having the same experiences. And with no word from Twitch on what was being done to protect its users from that kind of targeted, violent harassment, Raven decided to re-start the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9X6gFi"&gt;“I started&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TwitchDoBetter?src=hashtag_click"&gt; #TwitchDoBetter&lt;/a&gt; because I’m tired of having to fight to exist on a platform that says they’re diverse and inclusive but remained silent to the pleas of marginalized creators asking for more protections from hate raids,” Raven says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeYUSW"&gt;Twitch struggles with keeping toxicity off its platform. Last year, streamer CriticalBard was subjected to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229209/criticalbard-pogchamp-gootecks-hasanabi-twitch-emote-harassment"&gt;wave of racist trolls&lt;/a&gt; when he became the temporary face of the “pogchamp” emote. Twitch also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280121/twitch-removes-twitchcop-emote-to-prevent-misuse"&gt;removed its TwitchCop&lt;/a&gt; emote amid concerns it might be used to harass creators talking about police violence after George Floyd’s murder. In these situations and now, Twitch has been reactive to the needs of its users rather than proactive, resulting in creator frustration. Better, more proactive moderation tools have been a perennial ask from Twitch’s marginalized creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yUfNN"&gt;The tools Twitch is implementing in today’s safety rollout will seemingly only address &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cypheroftyr/status/1425264755380531201?s=20"&gt;trolls using non-Latin characters&lt;/a&gt; to circumvent chat filters. Streamers are asking for more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6orgxp"&gt;“I’d love to see creators having more tools to control their experience like allowing creators to block [recently created] accounts from chatting, [and] allowing mods to approve or decline raids,” Raven says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bU1xJt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlBSDO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nestflix is a Netflix for fake movies and shows from real movies and shows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AN-3YXiXi_OVHbIVQYgzuckzHDo=/0x0:2478x1652/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69712668/Screen_Shot_2021_08_11_at_1.42.48_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nestflix, Lynn Fisher&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ONa5wb"&gt;It’s been notoriously difficult to watch lost classics like Vincent Chase’s &lt;a href="https://nestflix.fun/aquaman/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aquaman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://nestflix.fun/the-rural-juror/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rural Juror&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— in part because they’re not real — but thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lynnandtonic/status/1425481907320483840?s=20"&gt;the launch of Nestflix&lt;/a&gt;, that’s all changing. Those movies are from &lt;em&gt;Entourage&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;30 Rock&lt;/em&gt;, respectively, created as gags or plotlines, but Nestflix, “the platform for your favorite nested films and shows,” will let you browse them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2NZTW"&gt;The basic premise behind &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lynnandtonic?s=20"&gt;designer Lynn Fisher’s&lt;/a&gt; Netflix alternative is “what if every fake show or movie featured in a real show or movie lived on a single platform?” The result is something that looks a lot like that red-and-black-colored streaming service you might be familiar with, populated with fake TV show and movie listings for projects that never existed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQPIp85z7yedbNu763j6sCRSNeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22776973/Screen_Shot_2021_08_11_at_1.45.07_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nestflix, Lynn Fisher&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nestflix even has room for independent entries, like “Threat Level Midnight.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GLMvKB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lynnandtonic/status/1425482328575340548?s=20"&gt;In a tweet announcing the project&lt;/a&gt;, Fisher describes it as “just a wiki doing some cosplay,” which frankly undersells it. Nestflix is wonderfully detailed, with a working search function, cast lists for each project, and information on what real show or movie the fake shows or movies originally appeared in. That’s perfect for shows like &lt;em&gt;30 Rock&lt;/em&gt;, which basically existed to create throwaway media goofs like &lt;a href="https://nestflix.fun/milf-island/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Milf Island&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;a href="https://nestflix.fun/leap-dave-williams/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leap Dave Williams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but even older fakes like &lt;a href="https://nestflix.fun/angels-with-filthy-souls/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Angels with Filthy Souls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Home Alone &lt;/em&gt;make an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2Q6S9"&gt;It’s a fascinating look at how self-referential most modern film and TV is (there are a lot of fake sequels), but also how ingrained Netflix’s content strategy and interface are in our culture generally. It’s one thing to cut away to a scene from a fake movie or show during a comedy, but it’s a whole other thing to have it packaged up with stills, art, and metadata like it’s ready to stream. It doesn’t make any of the fake movies or shows feel more real, but it does make them funny all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQRIMp"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://nestflix.fun/"&gt;browse Nestflix right now&lt;/a&gt; and also contribute &lt;a href="https://nestflix.fun/contribute"&gt;any shows or movies it’s missing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFtajq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
