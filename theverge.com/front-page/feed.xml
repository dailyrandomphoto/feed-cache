    <title>Sony reportedly making even fewer PS5s due to component shortage</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wp2iyK"&gt;Sony is struggling to make PlayStation 5 consoles and has internally lowered its production forecast for the current financial year, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-11/sony-trims-playstation-5-assembly-plans-after-chip-shortages-hit"&gt;report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. While the company was expecting to assemble 16 million units between April 2021 and March 2022, that figure is reportedly now at around 15 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cJk0Z"&gt;Sony had publicly predicted that it would sell 14.8 million PS5 consoles this financial year, so while this isn’t a large downward revision, it shows just how tight the supply is likely to be for the foreseeable future. The figure of 16 million units would have allowed Sony to meet that goal while securing additional stock for the following year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XyrUFl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why the global chip shortage is making it so hard to buy a PS5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NcUkdQ"&gt;Sony is said to be having trouble with logistics as well as the supply of components, as the world grapples with an unprecedented chip shortage. Bloomberg’s report says that component shipments aren’t always arriving on time, and varying levels of vaccine rollout have complicated operations at production bases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3tyj3"&gt;Sony has forecast 22.6 million PS5 sales for the financial year beginning in April 2022, but its manufacturing partners reportedly think it will be difficult to meet that target. In other words, don’t expect it to get any easier to buy a PS5 any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woUz1F"&gt;Earlier this month Nintendo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22762933/nintendo-earnings-q2-2021-switch-sales-forecast"&gt;cut its Switch sales forecast&lt;/a&gt; by 1.5 million for the financial year due to the component shortage. Valve’s Steam Deck handheld PC has just been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;delayed by two months&lt;/a&gt; for similar reasons and now won’t ship until February.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge buys Rittenhouse lawyer’s inane argument that Apple’s pinch-to-zoom manipulates footage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kyle Rittenhouse Trial Continues In Kenosha, WI" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zDVoE_-vlqC4mlIOTgC89V94i-Q=/0x0:5043x3362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125363/1236486033.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Krajacic-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vmv9F2"&gt;As Kyle Rittenhouse took the stand to answer questions about the sequence of events before he shot and killed a man in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the jury was forced to watch the video evidence play out in miniature — because Rittenhouse’s defense lawyer came up with the wild notion that Apple has “artificial intelligence” that manipulates footage when you pinch-to-zoom on an iPad, and Judge Bruce Schroeder totally bought into that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="raJUzK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The word he’s looking for is algorithms, but that’s beside the point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYw2Ho"&gt;“iPads, which are made by Apple, have artificial intelligence in them that allow things to be viewed through three-dimensions and logarithms,” the defense insisted. “It uses artificial intelligence, or their logarithms, to create what they believe is happening. So this isn’t actually enhanced video, this is Apple’s iPad programming creating what it thinks is there, not what necessarily is there,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltjm5U"&gt;While it’s unclear from a full video of the proceedings (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIzj48oL6T0&amp;amp;t=18145s"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) whether the judge actually prohibited the prosecution from using an iOS device or otherwise zooming into the footage, the result was the same: instead of using an iPad, the jury wound up watching the original, zoomed-out clips on a Windows machine hooked up to a large TV in the courtroom. The images didn’t fill the TV’s entire screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WuBA4y4JkmyBJzK_40Pt0j2In-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23004713/image__4_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the first video clips Rittenhouse was questioned about, as presented to the jury.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9zoKjo"&gt;Judge Schroeder argued that it was the prosecution — not the defense — that had the burden of proving that Apple &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; use artificial intelligence to manipulate footage, demanding that they provide an expert to testify, and didn’t allow the prosecution to adjourn to find that expert before bringing Rittenhouse up for cross-examination. The judge suggested that prosecutors could somehow find that expert in 20 minutes while they took a brief recess. “Maybe you can get someone to testify on this within minutes, I don’t know,” said the judge. No such expert was there by the time the trial resumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dD9xmb"&gt;While the nature of reality with regards to digital images is thorny when it comes to things like color, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling"&gt;digital image scaling&lt;/a&gt; is fairly well understood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GflCas"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/us/kyle-rittenhouse-charges.html"&gt;six criminal charges&lt;/a&gt; against Rittenhouse in connection to the shooting in Kenosha. He’s accused of killing two people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3Iuii"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX successfully launches four astronauts on Crew-3 mission to the space station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fwt70DEjJtfqmlUjZSoIrXBE2dU=/0x33:3044x2062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125357/51671227928_189f01b129_o.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket carries the Crew-3 astronauts to space&lt;/em&gt; | (NASA/Joel Kowsky)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BzOflP"&gt;This evening, SpaceX successfully launched another crew of four on their way to the International Space Station, marking the fifth time the company has sent people to space. Riding inside SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, the spacefarers will now spend roughly the next day in orbit lapping the Earth, before docking with the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAEdct"&gt;The mission, called Crew-3, is carrying three NASA astronauts — Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, and Kayla Barron — and one German astronaut, Matthias Maurer of the European Space Agency. After a number of launch delays, the foursome finally took off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida at 9:03PM ET, launching on top of one of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets. After successfully boosting the Crew Dragon carrying the passengers into low Earth orbit, the Falcon 9 then turned back toward Earth and performed one of SpaceX’s signature rocket landings on the company’s drone ship in the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SoZgBI"&gt;“Welcome to orbit,” SpaceX mission control said to the crew when they’d separated from the rest of the rocket. “Hope you enjoyed the ride from [the Falcon 9]. Dragon will take you from here. Safe travels.” The launch director also sent his warm wishes to the crew. “It was a pleasure to be part of this mission with you,” he said. “Enjoy your holidays amongst the stars. We’ll be waving as you fly by. Cheers.” Chari responded on board that it was “a great ride, better than we imagined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Jciy4N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is SpaceX’s third operational crewed mission for NASA&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FxyVn7"&gt;This is SpaceX’s third operational crewed mission for NASA as part of the agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/index.html"&gt;Commercial Crew Program&lt;/a&gt;. Each mission, including Crew-3, is supposed to last roughly six months, with SpaceX responsible for launching the astronauts and also bringing them home again. The Crew-3 astronauts are slated to come home sometime in spring 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jd5vh9-oc_h0meMIgT4XfGIlju8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23004659/51671408764_56a9429b71_o.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;(NASA/Joel Kowsky)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Crew-3 astronauts saying goodbye to their families ahead of the launch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NkOewb"&gt;SpaceX’s primary way of getting people to orbit is the Crew Dragon, an automated capsule outfitted with sleek seats and interactive touchscreens. The capsule is also designed to dock automatically with the space station, without the need of input from the crew on board. At around 7:10PM ET tomorrow, November 11th, the Crew Dragon carrying the Crew-3 team will attempt to dock with the ISS, and then about an hour later, the astronauts will open the hatch and enter the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLNdFH"&gt;There, they’ll be greeted by the three crew members already living on the ISS: NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei and Russian cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov. Once inside the station, the seven inhabitants will do a short welcoming ceremony around 9:20PM ET. Maruer is officially the 600th person to fly to space, while Barron is the 601st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="NlI4W3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Crew-3 crew just missed out on crossing paths with another batch of astronauts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wwasEp"&gt;The Crew-3 crew just missed out on crossing paths with another batch of astronauts on the space station, though. A crew of four astronauts, part of SpaceX’s Crew-2 mission, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22769970/spacex-crew-2-dragon-capsule-splash-down-success"&gt;left the ISS on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, flying back to Earth inside their own Crew Dragon and splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico. Originally, Crew-3 was supposed to launch &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the Crew-2 astronauts returned, but a series of delays kept stalling the Crew-3 launch. Eventually, NASA opted to bring the Crew-2 astronauts home ahead of Crew-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdmO1p"&gt;“Sometimes when you try to fly on Halloween, you get a trick instead of a treat,” Chari told SpaceX mission control ahead of the launch, referencing the fact that their mission was supposed to take place on October 31st. Chari noted it was instead an honor to fly on Veteran’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sepl3D"&gt;The Crew-2 return occurred on Monday, November 8th and the astronauts splashed down just fine. However, one of the capsule’s four main parachutes inflated a little slower than the rest on the way down to the water. The capsule still landed the crew safely, and neither NASA nor SpaceX thought it warranted delaying today’s launch. Additionally, NASA said that the turnaround between the splashdown and today’s launch was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bnjacobs/status/1458619316216160258"&gt;the shortest in human spaceflight history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zS1bbQ"&gt;Ahead of today’s launch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22747319/spacex-liftoff-crew-3-nasa-iss-how-to-watch-live"&gt;NASA had to do a small maneuver with the ISS&lt;/a&gt; first to make sure it didn’t get hit by space debris. Around 3:30PM ET, the thrusters on board a docked Russian Progress vehicle fired up, moving the space station slightly higher and out of the way of a fragment from an old Chinese satellite called Fengyun-1C. The boost paved the way for the Crew-3 team to reach the space station tomorrow safely.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can see Netflix’s new AV1 streaming tech on select TVs and the PS4 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EgF1BEf-mV4__lNDbkvKobwJEq8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125293/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QCnKkR"&gt;Netflix now supports the AV1 codec when streaming to some TVs, &lt;a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/bringing-av1-streaming-to-netflix-members-tvs-b7fc88e42320"&gt;the company announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. It’s only available on certain devices to start with, though that list includes any TV connected to the PS4 Pro, so if you have one of those, you can give AV1 Netflix streaming a shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uq7uND"&gt;Netflix shared this lineup of supported devices with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mlZSXr"&gt;Select Samsung 2020 UHD Smart TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="i9PEwb"&gt;Select Samsung 2020 UHD QLED Smart TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uIgj21"&gt;Select Samsung 2020 8K QLED Smart TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VIXThb"&gt;Samsung The Frame 2020 Smart TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="beh83J"&gt;Samsung The Serif 2020 Smart TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oXDwwM"&gt;Samsung The Terrace 2020 Smart TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gTDrEy"&gt;Any TV connected to a PS4 Pro streaming with the Netflix app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OJR2pR"&gt;Select Amazon Fire TV devices with Fire OS 7 and above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gwSO5E"&gt;Select Android TV devices with Android OS 10 and above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="HidoSi"&gt;Netflix noted in its blog that “we are working with external partners to enable more and more devices for AV1 streaming,” so hopefully more hardware will be compatible soon. And the company also says it’s “exploring” the possibility of AV1 streams with HDR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEzIks"&gt;AV1 can lean on high-powered modern processors to stream better quality video with more compression than other video codecs, and in Netflix’s testing, it observed that AV1 delivered higher quality videos at the same bitrate as other formats and that testers saw fewer noticeable drops in video quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6kO9pw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AV1 has broad industry support&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUYF7l"&gt;But this move likely isn’t entirely motivated by better streaming performance; since AV1 is an open-source codec, Netflix also won’t have to pay royalties to use it. The codec has broad industry support and is managed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), which counts Apple, Amazon, Facebook (now Meta), Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Samsung and more &lt;a href="https://aomedia.org/membership/members/"&gt;as members&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTQjTr"&gt;Netflix first supported AV1 videos in its Android app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126039/netflix-android-av1-video-codec-efficient-support-bandwidth-quality-vp9"&gt;in February 2020&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, it touted better streaming with AV1, saying that it saw a 20 percent improvement in compression when compared with the VP9 codec. In a blog for that announcement, Netflix said that its goal was to “roll out AV1 on all of our platforms,” and when we asked Wednesday, Netflix declined to share a timeline of when we might see AV1 Netflix streaming on other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R0fEbN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 10th, 9:12PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Noted Samsung TVs on the list of compatible devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gmail’s upcoming iOS widget could actually be useful</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EY5kSu3I_3iWhioAyqtaA8cXnPs=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125299/gmail_widget.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BCy6If"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-on-ios/stay-productive-these-google-features-ios/"&gt;Google announced&lt;/a&gt; it’s updating the Gmail iOS widget with a new one that’s actually useful, showing you the subjects and senders of the emails sitting in your inbox. The company says the new widget will be “launching in the next few weeks,” to replace the previous version that wasn’t particularly well-received. This also means that, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/10/gmail-ios-widget-meet-sheets/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, this means that Gmail’s iOS widget will have the same functionality as the current Android one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5lXgJ"&gt;When the first version of the Gmail widget launched, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21574112/google-new-gmail-widget-ios-14-limitations"&gt;we pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that it isn’t particularly helpful. It really only provides shortcuts to different screens on the app like your inbox and the email composer. Critically, it doesn’t actually show you much information about the emails you’ve received, though it does tell you how many are sitting unread in your inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/14nvlngEXOqt5quLjsKEo8_jzg4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23004270/Old_Widget.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old widget can only take to to the app’s search, compose, and inbox screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VCvrrd"&gt;Part of the old widget’s lack of functionality was due to Apple’s limitations. You’re currently not allowed to build interactivity into your widget, and any tapping the user does has to be handled by launching the app. Those rules haven’t substantially changed since the first widget was introduced, but the new design shows that there’s still room for useful information. You may not be able to archive an email from your home screen, for example, but you’ll at least be able to get a feel for what’s waiting in your inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Df821sd9pAlX_97Fz1mqYrEM-wY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23004197/Sheets_Keyboardshortcuts.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google also says it’s updating Google Sheets’ keyboard shortcut support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s05ZO5"&gt;Google also announced other upcoming improvements to its apps that could be useful for heavy users of its services. Meet (it’s business-focused video chat app) is getting support for iOS’s picture-in-picture feature, so you can still see your co-workers or the presentation while you switch apps to check on a file or email. Google also says it’ll expand the keyboard shortcuts available for people who use Google Sheets with an external keyboard (including Apple’s Magic Keyboard case).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk starts selling billions worth of Tesla shares after Twitter poll</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6fczm_8NJoaihJE0rEfVqtRQmOk=/0x0:600x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125144/REC_ASA3_CODE21_20210928_143439_0053_M.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="owcKtP"&gt;Elon Musk has kicked off a cascading sale of his personal Tesla holdings after recently asking his Twitter followers if he should sell &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/7/22768364/elon-musk-poll-twitter-tesla-10-percent-billionaires-capital-gains-tax"&gt;10 percent of his stake in the company to pay taxes&lt;/a&gt;. According to 10 &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/ciks=0001494730&amp;amp;entityName=Musk%2520Elon%2520(CIK%25200001494730)"&gt;new filings&lt;/a&gt; with the Securities and Exchange Commission published Wednesday, the billionaire CEO has sold at least $5 billion worth of Tesla stock so far this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5eBktt"&gt;The filings are likely to keep coming, too, as the few million shares sold are far short of 10 percent of the more than 240 million Musk owns in his company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qGCZ3M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk ran the Twitter poll after increased scrutiny over his wealth&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="syVrAk"&gt;Musk is selling these shares after facing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22769731/elon-musk-billionaire-tax-stock-sell-off-ron-wyden-tweet"&gt;increased scrutiny over his wealth&lt;/a&gt;, especially from elected officials. The world’s richest man has been criticized for not paying income taxes, since he doesn’t actually take a salary from Tesla and instead is compensated in stock awards. Musk doesn’t have to pay taxes on that compensation until he claims and sells that awarded stock — something he hasn’t done in a few years. Instead, Musk borrows a lot of money using his holdings as collateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F4jUS"&gt;One official, Ron Wyden (D-OR) has proposed a “Billionaires Income Tax” that would tax these wealth increases like income, despite them being “unrealized gains.” This pressure prompted Musk to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/7/22768364/elon-musk-poll-twitter-tesla-10-percent-billionaires-capital-gains-tax"&gt;poll Twitter this past weekend&lt;/a&gt; as to whether he should sell 10 percent of his Tesla holdings to pay taxes. The response was, somewhat narrowly, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLzEb5"&gt;(When Wyden quote-tweeted Musk’s poll saying that “[w]hether the world’s wealthiest man pays taxes at all shouldn’t depend on the results of a Twitter poll”, Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22769731/elon-musk-billionaire-tax-stock-sell-off-ron-wyden-tweet"&gt;responded crudely&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ciDlWA"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Tesla Technoking and SpaceX Chief Engineer Elon Musk | Full Interview | Code 2021|104204" data-volume-uuid="c4bc5d03c" data-volume-id="104204" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-862" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pHTNFj"&gt;The first two filings to show up in the SEC’s system on Wednesday were related to Musk’s previously-announced plan to exercise certain stock options granted to him in 2012, which he spoke about at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698563/elon-musk-code-conference-liveblog"&gt;this year’s Code Conference&lt;/a&gt;. Musk said at the conference that he had a “huge block of options” that he would exercise and sell in the fourth quarter of 2021. Those first two filings on Wednesday confirmed that Musk had already planned to exercise around two million options that the company had granted him in 2012 and sell about half of those shares by the time he spoke at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkpvNx"&gt;But later Wednesday, a much bigger batch of filings were posted by the SEC that show Musk sold millions more shares this week — beyond the sale he had scheduled back in September. The billionaire CEO now truly seems to be in the midst of a selloff of millions of shares of Tesla. But while he’ll have to pay upwards of 50 percent of that value in taxes, he’ll still wind up holding billions of dollars in fresh cash when the sales are complete. For a man who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/8/21252487/elon-musk-personal-finances-billionaire-wall-street-journal-go-read-this"&gt;has professed to be cash poor&lt;/a&gt;, it means Musk will soon find himself in a rare position of being extremely wealthy not only on paper, but in a very tangible sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dp7j5u"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, November 11th, 12:01AM ET:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;After this story was published, more stock sales were registered with the SEC. The story and headline have been changed to reflect this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is emailing out gift cards to its online store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kCfh1e"&gt;It’s November, which means it’s officially the holiday season (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/1455021954763792397"&gt;according to Mariah Carey, at least&lt;/a&gt;), and Microsoft seems to already be celebrating by emailing people gift cards to the Microsoft Store. We’ve seen a few reports on Twitter of people receiving legitimate emails from Microsoft offering gift cards &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyB3RMUDEZ/status/1458564160443359238"&gt;for $10&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_cerdafied_/status/1458566511392481283?s=21"&gt;even $100&lt;/a&gt;, and the Microsoft Store Twitter account confirmed the promotion in a direct message with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2NCmg3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I wouldn’t have bothered to check the email I use for my Xbox live account if I didn’t see this tweet. Thanks! &lt;a href="https://t.co/SYFoCcduQT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SYFoCcduQT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Christian Cerda (@_cerdafied_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_cerdafied_/status/1458566511392481283?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e5YQhC"&gt;It’s unclear who is eligible for the gift cards or how Microsoft is selecting people to get them. But if you have a Microsoft account or have signed up to receive emails from Microsoft, you might want to check your email to see if you’ve received a gift from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rXNVs"&gt;If you were lucky enough to get a gift card, there are lots of new products from Microsoft you can put your money toward. The company announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684950/microsoft-surface-event-biggest-announcements-pro-8-duo-studio-laptop"&gt;a wave of new Surface products in September&lt;/a&gt; that might catch your eye. If you’re a gamer, I would personally recommend the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769985/forza-horizon-5-review"&gt;excellent &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which was released on Tuesday. Or, you could put the money toward a subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which will let you play &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; now and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; campaign when that’s released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22637945/halo-infinite-release-date-launch"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SS2ipp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 10th, 7:11PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The Microsoft Store Twitter account confirmed the promotion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rep. Gosar anime video highlights ties to the online right</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Committee Examines Unanswered Questions Surrounding The Capitol Insurrection" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q8q4Zik3XAp_xLCD9l4QDMFQ1Jc=/2x0:2570x1712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124830/1232844555.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jonathan Ernst-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B7zuCh"&gt;Republican Congressman Paul Gosar (AZ) ignited national fury this week after tweeting a video portraying himself as an anime character killing other prominent lawmakers. But while Democrats are now calling for his expulsion from Congress and his accounts to be banned, the incident has drawn new attention to Gosar’s long association with far-right meme culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9fl3L"&gt;Gosar first posted the problematic video parodying the opening credits of the popular anime series “Attack on Titan” on Sunday. The video — captioned “Any anime fans out there?” — depicts Gosar as one of the show’s main characters killing Democratic politicians like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and President Joe  Biden by superimposing their faces onto those belonging to other characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPMHJW"&gt;Responding to the video on Monday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1457888052991381508?s=20"&gt;Ocasio-Cortez tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that “a creepy member I work with who fundraises for Neo-Nazi groups shared a fantasy video of him killing me,” likely referring to &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=paul+gosar+fundraising+far-right&amp;amp;oq=paul+gosar+fundraising+far-right&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5466j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;a summer fundraiser&lt;/a&gt; linked to far-right influencer Nicholas Fuentes. She continued, “He’ll face no consequences,” because House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (D-CA) “cheers him on with no excuses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXm710"&gt;The video was posted onto Gosar’s official congressional Twitter account and was viewed over 3 million times before it was removed. It’s unclear if Twitter or Gosar’s office removed the video as of publication. On Monday, Twitter placed a “public interest notice” over the tweet, saying that it violated the company’s policies against hateful conduct. Instagram also placed a “sensitive content” warning on the video, which was also posted to Gosar’s official account on that platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Uy3Qfs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gosar’s video is just the latest example of a long-standing interest in the meme culture that’s popular in far-right internet communities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kCHvMw"&gt;Democratic lawmakers are already demanding that Gosar face additional consequences for the video. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) called on McCarthy to “join in condemning this horrific video and call on the Ethics Committee and law enforcement to investigate” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1458105886182887424?s=20"&gt;in a Tuesday tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXj2uN"&gt;White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said at a press conference Tuesday, “This should not be happening, and we should be condemning it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxbdT4"&gt;As of Wednesday afternoon, McCarthy has yet to respond to Pelosi’s statements or those from the White House. His office did not immediately respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;regarding the video and Gosar’s future standing in the Republican caucus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJOjzu"&gt;But Gosar’s video is just the latest example of a long-standing interest in the meme culture that’s popular in far-right internet communities and image boards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynx7Jt"&gt;In October, Gosar tweeted a now-deleted meme video depicting the “Doomer guy,” a sad-looking cartoon image of a man, in front of a series of articles with some headlines related to transgender people. At the end of the video, the “America First” logo is displayed over Gosar’s head, a reference to a popular white nationalist movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwZ6cO"&gt;In August, he tweeted an image of himself in front of cacti, all with &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-congressman-paul-gosar-is-tweeting-a-green-arrow-po-1847590910"&gt;green lines edited&lt;/a&gt; in a reference to a red-pill pro-masculinity meme. In 2019, Gosar’s account tweeted out a thread &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/gop-rep-paul-gosar-inserts-epstein-didnt-kill-himself-1839844491"&gt;that spelled out “Epstein didn’t kill himself&lt;/a&gt;” with the first two letters in a series of 22 tweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUUZPu"&gt;This kind of content espouses a kind of rhetoric more often found in image boards than the halls of Congress, experts say. “This is incredibly intentional work,” said Jamie Cohen, assistant professor in media studies at Queens College. “This is by design, and it is internet fluency that is not your typical internet fluency from a member of Congress. This is a far-right influence being broadcast over a public speaker because he’s a public figure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eF8VYI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He’s getting very good at expanding the borderlands”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hO1cr2"&gt;Gosar’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding who created the videos published on his Twitter feed. But in a now-deleted quote-tweet from his personal account, Gosar thanked his “team” for their creativity in editing the video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Mu3Nk"&gt;Gosar’s digital director, Jessica Lycos, responded to the backlash in a statement on Monday, saying, “We made an anime video.” Lycos continued, “Everyone needs to relax. The left don’t get meme culture. They have no joy. They are not the future. It’s a cartoon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qTuAS"&gt;As pressure continued to mount on Gosar in response to the video, his office put out a lengthy statement Tuesday night calling the backlash a “gross mischaracterization” of a symbolized “battled for the soul of America when Congress takes up Mr. Biden’s $4 trillion spending bill that includes amnesty for millions of illegal aliens.” Gosar continued, “I do not espouse violence or harm towards any member of Congress or Mr. Biden.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfWkIh"&gt;But experts argue that Gosar’s flirtation with right-wing meme culture is still harmful, normalizing extreme content even as it stays within the bounds of what’s acceptable. “When we normalize this type of media, we extend to the outward edges of what can be presented online,” Cohen said. “If he’s not held accountable, the next thing will be edgier and become acceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMYcHl"&gt;“He’s getting very good at expanding the borderlands,” Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmsPBe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will now show full-sized images on web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMlgNu_hqlEB2J5b4rb8S56Iyw4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124780/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ojFiAY"&gt;Twitter is dropping the crop on web. This is the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421574/twitter-crop-issue-bigger-images-rollout"&gt;update that banished&lt;/a&gt; Twitter’s awkward auto-cropping algorithm on its Android and iOS apps, which means that you’ll see images in their entirety on your timeline as you scroll through Twitter on your web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PEUj8e"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is now available on web!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pic looking good in the Tweet composer? That’s how it will look on the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1458538066461736965?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6flZ1K"&gt;The same goes for when you post images of your own; you’ll see an accurate preview of your image that doesn’t appear oddly formatted when you post it. The platform touts its full-size preview window as a “what you see is what you get” look at your post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HI2agv"&gt;The ongoing changes to Twitter’s handling of photos stem from last year’s auto-crop controversy. Some users noticed that Twitter’s auto-cropping algorithm &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/20/21447998/twitter-photo-preview-white-black-faces"&gt;may favor white faces over Black faces&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in a crop that shows white faces more prominently. Twitter looked into the issue and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444372/twitter-image-crop-racial-gender-bias-research"&gt;found that its auto-crop algorithm wasn’t very biased&lt;/a&gt; but still disabled it just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlozGj"&gt;Whether Twitter’s auto-crop feature was biased or not, I think we can all agree that we’re better off now that it’s gone for good. This means we’ll no longer miss out on interesting images because we were too lazy to click past the preview. I still might miss the awkwardly cropped images, though (as long as they’re not my own).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CUbGc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Withings’ ScanWatch with built-in EKG is finally available in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m95Ko4cU73TYIfFzCcFUpe-OqXc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124625/akrales_200916_4186_0153.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WsrznF"&gt;After almost two years, the Withings ScanWatch is now available to purchase in the US after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21048522/withings-health-monitoring-scanwatch-ecg-afib-heart-sleep-apnea-blood-oxygen"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; back at the beginning of 2020. The ScanWatch was waiting for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722333/withings-fda-clearance-blood-oxygen-heart-rhythm"&gt;clearance from the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;, which it had received in October for its EKG and blood oxygen measurement features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8t9j6"&gt;Unlike its competitors Apple Watch and Fitbit, both of whom can track blood oxygen and have EKG technology, Withings is claiming that the hybrid watch can detect sleep apnea, a sleep disorder charactered by disrupted breathing patterns. The ScanWatch is still a part of an &lt;a href="https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004508038-ScanWatch-Clinical-studies#anchor_apnea"&gt;ongoing clinical study&lt;/a&gt; for this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YekNB7"&gt;Unlike Apple and Fitbit’s devices, the Withings ScanWatch also requires medical review. Users are required to &lt;a href="https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407741101457-ScanWatch-Frequently-asked-questions-about-ECG-US-users-only-"&gt;gain medical clearance&lt;/a&gt; to fully access the EKG feature, Withings says. After 24 to 48 hours, users can access their first EKG reading in the HealthMate app that they can install on their connected phones. During that time, their readings are sent to Heartbeat Health, a healthcare technology company, where they will be consulted by a cardiology team for clinical interpretation, &lt;a href="https://www.newswire.com/news/heartbeat-health-partners-with-withings-on-new-fda-cleared-hybrid-21547475?_ga=2.113187140.1736918582.1636383180-2013823946.1636055945"&gt;according to the company’s press release&lt;/a&gt;. This feature is only available if you’re over 22 years old, and in some states, you may be required to give your phone number so &lt;a href="https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407741101457-ScanWatch-Frequently-asked-questions-about-ECG-US-users-only-"&gt;Heartbeat Health can contact you directly about the results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The Withings ScanWatch is available in both white or black and is priced starting at $279 for the 38mm and $299 for the 42mm. It is currently being sold on the Withings website, Amazon and Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;
