    <title>Brydge’s new keyboard for the M1 iPad makes it more MacBook-like than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KLmXH6d9BXFWlQZZxe4MTGLxlcA=/55x0:1045x660/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165808/BRY_129_MAX_Plus_filler_01.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6W9KkO"&gt;Brydge is announcing a keyboard and trackpad accessory for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/21/brydge-unveils-new-max-keyboard-trackpad-combo-for-12-9-inch-ipad-pro/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"&gt;the company’s previous accessories&lt;/a&gt;, the Brydge 12.9 Max Plus will let you take your iPad from being a tablet to a laptop, just by connecting it to the accessory. With Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;new M1-powered iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, some might already be thinking about using it to make a MacBook replacement, while others may just be excited for the way you can now neatly attach it via magnets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qznUJg"&gt;The answer to whether this will help replace your MacBook with an iPad is more or less &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22391979/apple-ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air-2021-anouncement"&gt;what it’s always been&lt;/a&gt;: it depends on whether you can do all your work with what’s available on iPadOS. The iPad Pro has been more powerful than a lot of MacBooks for years, but hardware is only part of the equation. While the 12.9-inch iPad Pro may now have a processor as fast as a MacBook’s and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;a better screen&lt;/a&gt; to boot, it’s still using an OS that, for some, won’t be able to fully take advantage of those features. If you’re fine with the limitations of iPadOS, then the Brydge 12.9 Max Plus could be a new solution for taking the iPad into laptop mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AddzH"&gt;The iPad will attach to the new Max Plus magnetically, instead of using the clamp system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"&gt;used by previous Brydge keyboards&lt;/a&gt;. That system required you to wedge your expensive tablet between clamps that then held onto that breakable glass — a nerve-wracking and not terribly pleasant experience. This brings Brydge’s offering more in line with the Magic Keyboard, and users will likely appreciate increased ease in switching between laptop and tablet mode. Easy, magnetic attachment is something that’s generally been associated with Apple’s iPad keyboards instead of third-party ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaE9AZ"&gt;While Brydge’s built-in trackpads have generally not compared favorably to Apple’s, the company is hoping to change that by adding native multitouch support. With the Max Plus, Brydge is also playing the size comparison game — its trackpad is the largest on an iPad keyboard, according to the company’s site. That may be a nice bonus if you’re the type of person who likes to use the mouse a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLuQap"&gt;The Brydge 12.9 Max Plus is available for preorder &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-12-9-max-plus%3Fvariant%3D39379780075625&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22396039%2Fbrydge-keyboard-magnetic-tablet-laptop-m1-ipad-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Brydge’s site&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s expected to ship in June. It comes in three color options (space gray, silver, and white) and costs $249.99 — $100 cheaper than &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJQJ3LL%2FA%2Fmagic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-11-inch-3rd-generation-and-ipad-air-4th-generation-us-english&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22396039%2Fbrydge-keyboard-magnetic-tablet-laptop-m1-ipad-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s ethical AI researchers complained of harassment long before Timnit Gebru’s firing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G0C3OTOYIsbqoozEDbopsQQ-9-g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165743/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="snJ16V"&gt;Google’s AI leadership came under fire in December when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;star ethics researcher Timnit Gebru was abruptly fired&lt;/a&gt; while working on a paper about the dangers of large language models. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-21/google-ethical-ai-group-s-turmoil-began-long-before-public-unraveling?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new reporting from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests the turmoil began long before her termination — and includes allegations of bias and sexual harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yOI63"&gt;Shortly after Gebru arrived at Google in 2018, she informed her boss that a colleague had been accused of sexual harassment at another organization. Katherine Heller, a Google researcher, reported the same incident, which included allegations of inappropriate touching. Google immediately opened an investigation into the man’s behavior. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; did not name the man accused of harassment, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; does not know his identity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXPKW9"&gt;The allegations coincided with an even more explosive story. Andy Rubin, the “father of Android” had received &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html"&gt;a $90 million exit package despite being credibly accused of sexual misconduct&lt;/a&gt;. The news sparked outrage at Google, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18057716/google-walkout-20-thousand-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai-meeting"&gt;20,000 employees walked out of work&lt;/a&gt; to protest the company’s handling of sexual harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeMChr"&gt;Gebru and Margaret Mitchell, co-lead of the ethical AI team, went to AI chief Jeff Dean with a “litany of concerns,” according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. They told Dean about the colleague who’d been accused of harassment, and said there was a perceived pattern of women being excluded and undermined on the research team. Some were given lower roles than men, despite having better qualifications. Mitchell also said she’d been denied a promotion due to “nebulous complaints to HR about her personality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NibrGh"&gt;Dean was skeptical about the harassment allegations but said he would investigate, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports. He pushed back on the idea that there was a pattern of women on the research team getting lower-level positions than men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RScxFP"&gt;After the meeting, Dean announced a new research project with the alleged harasser at the helm. Nine months later, the man was fired for “leadership issues,” according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. He’d been accused of misconduct at Google, although the investigation was still ongoing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Fa13m"&gt;After the man was fired, he threatened to sue Google. The legal team told employees who’d spoken out about his conduct that they might hear from the man’s lawyers. The company was “vague” about whether it would defend the whistleblowers, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zH0njI"&gt;The harassment allegation was not an isolated incident. Gebru and her co-workers reported additional claims of inappropriate behavior and bullying after the initial accusation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7e4eXF"&gt;Gebru said there were also ongoing issues with getting Google to respect the ethical AI team’s work. When she tried to look into a dataset released by Google’s self-driving car company Waymo, the project became mired in “legal haggling.” Gebru wanted to explore how skin tone impacted Waymo’s pedestrian-detection technology. “Waymo employees peppered the team with inquiries, including why they were interested in skin color and what they were planning to do with the results,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZMeUy"&gt;After Gebru went public about her firing, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309962/timnit-gebru-google-harassment-campaign-jeff-dean"&gt;she received an onslaught of harassment&lt;/a&gt; from people who claimed that she was trying to get attention and play the victim. The latest news further validates her response that the issues she raised were part of a pattern of alleged bias on the research team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="72sc8C"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NFL RedZone is coming to Hulu’s live TV service in time for the 2021 season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NFL: FEB 07 Super Bowl LV - Chiefs v Buccaneers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U1ZTTznBXQw4HhepfzRn8FXxJTs=/0x0:4800x3200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165719/1231080601.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rah4qH"&gt;NFL fans will have another place they can watch NFL RedZone and the NFL Network next season, as both channels are coming to the Hulu with Live TV plan &lt;a href="https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/NFL-Media-and-Hulu-Reach-Carriage-Agreement.aspx"&gt;by August 1st&lt;/a&gt;. NFL Network will be included in the base package, while NFL RedZone will be offered at an additional cost, Hulu tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDLaEW"&gt;Hulu isn’t the only streaming service where you can get the NFL channels, as they are also available on YouTube TV, Sling, and fuboTV. And similarly, only NFL Network is part of the base subscriptions for these services — you’ll have to pay for sports-focused add-ons to get access to NFL RedZone. But if Hulu with Live TV is your preferred live TV streaming service, now you don’t have to go somewhere else to get your NFL channel fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgY8zS"&gt;The NFL’s deal with Hulu comes weeks after the league signed new streaming deals &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339636/nfl-streaming-deals-amazon-peacock-paramount-tubi-espn-plus"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;, which included Amazon getting exclusive rights to &lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt; starting with the 2023 season. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Microsoft Classroom Pen 2 is an affordable Surface Pen for students</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vdDhDLubfo02J6AnGhbWEIosAnM=/67x0:787x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165390/Picture1.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iGOAiA"&gt;Microsoft is releasing a new stylus for classroom use: the Classroom Pen 2. The pen will be available on April 27th and will be sold directly to schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NMCWq"&gt;The company launched its first &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-launches-40-classroom-pen-for-students"&gt;Classroom Pen&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. That stylus sold for $39.99 per unit. It was compatible with any device that supported the MPP protocol (including a number of non-Surface Windows devices). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3Wg5D"&gt;Microsoft is going even more budget with this release. The Pen 2 will be sold to schools in packs of 20 for $399.80, which works out to $19.99 per pen. Per &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2021/04/21/best-in-class-microsoft-classroom-pen-2-empowers-every-student-to-achieve-more/"&gt;Microsoft’s blog post&lt;/a&gt;, however, it seems like this pen may only be optimized for Microsoft’s own Surface Pro and Surface Go devices — other Windows devices aren’t mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CfDLkd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p_j3aPr_y6k?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mclcpW"&gt;Microsoft claims that the device has an “improved design” from the &lt;a href="https://www.connection.com/product/microsoft-surface-classroom-pen-20-pack-black/nwh-00001/36623795"&gt;previous model&lt;/a&gt;, though the announcement doesn’t share many specifics. It looks like the Pen 2 is a different color and has a pen clip to attach to a Surface Type Cover. The company also says the new device has a longer enclosure “to optimize for grip strength.” Sure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIpvxC"&gt;Like its predecessor, the Pen 2 appears to have two buttons. It also shares some classroom-specific features with the Classroom Pen: it ships with replacement tips and has a slot that teachers can loop a string through to tether the pen to a Surface device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3izap"&gt;The release is part of Microsoft’s long-standing push to challenge Chromebooks in the education sphere. (Those devices had their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22256873/chromebook-best-year-ever-double-yearly-sales"&gt;best year ever&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, as many students around the world began attending class from home.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="086Oju"&gt;Microsoft has worked with partners like Acer, Dell, and Lenovo to release dozens of &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Feducation%2Fdevices%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sub-$500 Windows PCs&lt;/a&gt; in the past few years, alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18192906/microsoft-classroom-pen-chromebook-challenge-devices-2019"&gt;updates to Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt; that are tailored to classroom use. Stylus support can be a must-have for students who want to draw graphs and take notes on their laptops, and widely distributing Surface Pens could certainly save teachers some paper and ink. And if you’re an average Joe like me who just really wants to play around with a $20 stylus, it’s time to make friends with some neighborhood teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is now letting everyone tweet pictures in 4K on Android and iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VY-VwER3PIt-1bIIRkD8_ZY7cig=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165104/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5PsRbk"&gt;Get ready for Twitter to start looking a whole lot crisper — starting today, the company is letting all users tweet (and view) pictures in 4K on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwChR2"&gt;Twitter’s web app already supports higher-resolution images (at up to 4096 x 4096 resolution), but the mobile apps had been limited to just half that, with a maximum resolution of 2048 x 2048. The company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;previously started testing&lt;/a&gt; the 4K image upload option for mobile users earlier this year, and it seems those tests went well, as its now rolling out the feature to all users starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VlbVFU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter tries to fix problematic image crops by not cropping pictures anymore","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="A4zU7W"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Time to Tweet those high res pics –– the option to upload and view 4K images on Android and iOS is now available for everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To start uploading and viewing images in 4K, update your high-quality image preferences in “Data usage” settings. &lt;a href="https://t.co/XDnWOji3nx"&gt;https://t.co/XDnWOji3nx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1384945690304995330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kp7iRF"&gt;In order to enable the new feature, users will have to go to the “data usage” section of the settings menu in the Twitter app and enable both “high-quality images” (for viewing 4K images) and “high-quality image uploads” (for tweeting them). Users can select whether they’d like the higher-resolution images to be enabled for both cellular and Wi-Fi, just Wi-Fi, or disabled entirely — similar options to how Twitter handles higher resolution or auto-playing video. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon One’s palm-scanning payments are coming to Whole Foods</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="vCfg9W"&gt;Amazon One is &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-one-continues-expansion-now-available-as-a-contactless-payment-option-at-initial-whole-foods-market-store-in-seattle"&gt;expanding to its biggest area yet&lt;/a&gt;: the company is now testing its palm-scanning payment technology in Whole Foods, starting with a single store in Amazon’s home city of Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBVdiW"&gt;The company has been using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496673/amazon-one-palm-reading-vein-recognition-payments-identity-verification"&gt;Amazon One payment technology&lt;/a&gt; in its Amazon-branded stores in the Seattle area (including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493094/amazon-one-palm-recognition-hand-payments-amazon-go-store"&gt;Amazon Go&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321268/amazon-one-seattle-stores-palm-recognition-payment-technology"&gt;Amazon Books&lt;/a&gt;), but the Whole Foods rollout will make the most substantial expansion of the technology yet. The company says that thousands of customers have already signed up with Amazon One. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZYaFYi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s palm reading starts at the grocery store, but it could be so much bigger","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496673/amazon-one-palm-reading-vein-recognition-payments-identity-verification"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GPlx6n"&gt;According to an Amazon FAQ, the palm-scanning technology analyzes “the minute characteristics of your palm — both surface-area details like lines and ridges as well as subcutaneous features such as vein patterns” in order to identify a customer, allowing them to use the biometric scan as an alternative (and, theoretically, faster) method of checking out than fumbling around with a credit card or cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eSt5y"&gt;Customers will be able to register their palms at kiosks in the supported Whole Foods stores, allowing them to associate a physical credit card to that palm scan. (Amazon One users who have already registered may have to re-link their cards once to be able to use them at Whole Foods.) And of course, Amazon One users will be able to link their Prime accounts to their scans to get the subscription service’s discounts when shopping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fv4KHm"&gt;Amazon One will debut at the Madison Broadway Whole Foods in Seattle as an additional payment option for customers, with plans to expand it to seven other Whole Foods stores in the Seattle area over the next few months. Amazon hasn’t announced plans to further build out the palm-scanning payment system outside of the Seattle area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQmm7l"&gt;All of this, of course, assumes that you’re OK with Amazon building an ever-larger database of biometric information linked to its customers, something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496673/amazon-one-palm-reading-vein-recognition-payments-identity-verification"&gt;that some experts have raised concerns about&lt;/a&gt;. That’s particularly true given that Amazon’s data — unlike other biometric security systems, like Apple’s Face ID — is stored in on the cloud, rather than secured locally on a specific device. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I9y6oi"&gt;Google has announced &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-gets-a-little-more-helpful/"&gt;some new features&lt;/a&gt; coming to Chromebooks, including the company’s Live Captions feature that will be added to Chrome on “most” Chrome OS devices in the coming weeks. Once Live Captions are available, users can flip them on in the accessibility settings to get captions for any media with audio right inside their browser. The feature rolled out to Chrome on Windows, Mac, and Linux &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22337074/chrome-real-time-live-captions-audio-accessibility"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Kt1nQ"&gt;Google is also beefing up the Chrome OS Launcher, which lets you search for files and apps, with some new capabilities, allowing you make simple calculations and check the weather, the definition of a word, and stock prices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BnZwiznehJdWtY7fZgREme0lLB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22460117/Launcher_inline_image_Cy9giIb.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Searching for weather in the Launcher.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GycipM"&gt;The search giant is also adding a new Diagnostics app to Chrome OS that lets you check the status of and run tests on your computer’s battery, CPU, and memory. That means that if your battery isn’t holding a charge for as long as you think it should, you can run a battery discharge test in the Diagnostics app to see if something’s wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRhYOM"&gt;The new launcher capabilities and the Diagnostics app aren’t yet available for a colleague of mine running Chrome OS, but Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the release begins rolling out today. So if you don’t have the new features just yet, you might just need to hang tight until you get the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrpHDX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 21st, 3:41PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added information about the rollout from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple now lets you extend a Mac’s AppleCare Plus coverage beyond three years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_ORDh_fFd5xujzyMXk79_D36Co=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164763/vpavic_191118_3800_0201.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RfzyHE"&gt;Apple’s Mac computers typically come with a one-year warranty that you can optionally extend to three years by purchasing AppleCare Plus. The extended warranty also adds coverage for accidents and physical damage. But now, Apple is giving Mac customers the choice to keep AppleCare Plus going for even longer than the usual three-year limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mxt5D7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/applecare-for-mac-extended-coverage/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;As noticed by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210580"&gt;a new support page&lt;/a&gt; that confirms people in the United States can convert AppleCare Plus into an indefinite annual subscription once the coverage they paid for upfront lapses. Apple says the recurring annual coverage must be purchased “within 30 days of the end date of your original coverage.” Once you’ve moved to annual billing, it renews automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AL5T5f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More peace of mind for you, more revenue for Apple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T2Naeg"&gt;AppleCare Plus covers up to two incidents of accidental damage each year. Accident claims require a $99 deductible for a damaged display or external damage. More severe damage (like water incidents) have a deductible of $299. Either way, it’s far cheaper than paying for out-of-warranty repairs or buying a new Mac altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y61QbH"&gt;Presumably this new policy means that Apple will continue to support covered Macs for as long as it has repair parts for a given machine. Part of Apple’s terms and conditions on this says the company will automatically cancel your plan (and provide 60 days’ notice) if it doesn’t have the necessary parts anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaZ4JT"&gt;AppleCare Plus falls under Apple’s services division, so giving customers the option to stretch out their warranties means more peace of mind for them — and more revenue for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Md6NwZ"&gt;Apple’s extended warranty for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch can also be converted into  continued monthly coverage for customers who bought upfront coverage, which normally covers those products for a total of two years. As with the Mac, the renewing coverage must be purchased within 30 days of the original coverage end date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft enables Linux GUI apps on Windows 10 for developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nqwLizsuJPAuweze0P_p4nax7QA=/0x20:1219x833/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164306/windowslinux.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PC7NJG"&gt;Microsoft is starting to allow Windows 10 testers to access Linux GUI apps. The first preview of support for GUI applications is available today for Windows Insiders, allowing developers to run GUI editors, tools, and applications to build and test Linux apps. It’s a significant extension for Microsoft’s Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), after the company added a full Linux kernel to Windows 10 last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4NeJF"&gt;While it has been possible to run Linux GUI apps within Windows previously using a third-party X server, official support from Microsoft means there’s also GPU hardware acceleration so apps and tools run smoothly. Audio and microphone support is also included out of the box, so Linux devs can easily test or run video players and communications apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VL3C6C30KsPkiwyJLc9b3EzHT7c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22460021/linuxguiappswindows.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linux GUI apps running on Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nbbxu0"&gt;This is all enabled without Windows users having to use X11 forwarding and without users having to manually start an X server. Microsoft automatically starts a &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/the-initial-preview-of-gui-app-support-is-now-available-for-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-2/"&gt;companion system distro&lt;/a&gt; when you attempt to run a Linux GUI app, and it contains a Wayland, X server, pulse audio server, and everything else needed to make this work inside Windows. Once you terminate an app and WSL, then this special distro ends, too. All of these components combine to make it super easy to run Linux GUI apps alongside regular Windows apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDuZWm"&gt;Microsoft is also testing a new eco mode for the Windows Task Manager in this latest test build. It’s an experimental feature that lets you throttle process resources inside Task Manager. It’s really designed to rein in apps that suddenly start taking up lots of system resources, and it could be useful if you want to temporarily throttle back an app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z_SUo7b93WP0iaCARdiDo-IEeVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22460025/task_manager_eco.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Eco Mode for Task Manager.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wLQmw1"&gt;If you’re interested in testing Linux GUI apps on Windows 10 or this new Task Manager feature, you’ll need to install the latest &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/04/21/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-21364/"&gt;Windows Insider build 21364&lt;/a&gt; from the Dev Channel. Be warned: these are designed as developer builds and not for machines you rely on daily.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple approved another secret gambling den, masquerading as a puzzle game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JRo5vHfFyT2XXx-D65QpbOI_JIw=/113x0:1531x945/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164172/kosta_gambling_den_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xS4HkY"&gt;This morning, I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;how Apple’s $64 billion-a-year App Store isn’t catching incredibly obvious multimillion-dollar scams&lt;/a&gt; because the company isn’t even bothering to audit its most profitable apps for fraud, and how app developer Kosta Eleftheriou is showing the company how it’s done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Qb4Ts"&gt;But that’s not the only kind of scam Eleftheriou has been uncovering in Apple’s App Store — he has also discovered that Apple’s review teams have been approving games that transform into secret gambling dens when you access them from certain countries (or via VPN). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386533/ios-app-scam-jungle-runner-magical-forest-apple-kosta"&gt;We wrote about two of them last Thursday&lt;/a&gt; as if they were an isolated incident, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407589539115011"&gt;he’s now found at least two more&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting this may be a trend — including a match-three puzzle game dubbed &lt;em&gt;Lucky Stars&lt;/em&gt; that turns into a casino if you open it in Russia, and a game called &lt;em&gt;Vegas Pirates&lt;/em&gt; that does the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ch7YAx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; app pretends to be a game for kids 4+, but if you are in Russia (or use a VPN) it becomes an online casino that doesn’t even use Apple’s in-app-purchase system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AppleEvent&lt;/a&gt; scam of the day  &lt;a href="https://t.co/VU1XpaiILU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VU1XpaiILU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407589539115011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="5AdBtR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The developer - “Marina Misko” - has several gambling apps, all posing as games for kids 4+  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These have been on the App Store for several months, and even had multiple updates approved by Apple! &lt;a href="https://t.co/iE8pbljeh9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iE8pbljeh9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407629493989378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XeDpim"&gt;In some ways, they’re even more egregious examples: while it might be more shocking that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386533/ios-app-scam-jungle-runner-magical-forest-apple-kosta"&gt;a kids’ monkey-collecting-bananas game would transform into a gambling den&lt;/a&gt;, these new apps would seem to invite extra scrutiny with their gambling-oriented visuals and the fact they pretended a Russian news organization was their “developer website.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DkyAQM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The developer’s website listed on the App Store is &lt;a href="https://t.co/mHYeXEn8dV"&gt;https://t.co/mHYeXEn8dV&lt;/a&gt;, a big Russian news outlet. Really.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even the *privacy policy* link they’ve provided to Apple is the same exact link - and Apple has happily accepted all this! &lt;a href="https://t.co/QIgMg78cnf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QIgMg78cnf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407638666989573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RlT9fG"&gt;They’re both gone now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrE0QV"&gt;If you’re looking for shock value, Eleftheriou also spotted this unrelated app the other day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q37FIo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Curated by the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt;, for your kids’ safety!   &lt;a href="https://t.co/wFJOc0FeDQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wFJOc0FeDQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384561527387131904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IaTG06"&gt;Apple is testifying before Congress today — and in an incredibly high-profile court case against Epic Games next month — about how its App Store protects users, justifies the company’s traditional 30-percent cut (reportedly $64 billion last year alone), and shouldn’t be broken up. These kinds of discoveries are giving the company’s critics a lot of ammo.  &lt;/p&gt;
