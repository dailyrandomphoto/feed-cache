    <title>Now’s your chance to get a month of Paramount Plus for free </title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ViacomCBS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CRAlL3"&gt;If you’ve been weighing whether to take the plunge on Paramount Plus, now’s your chance to take the streaming service for a test drive for a full 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Rz7V8"&gt;The service is currently offering a month-long trial period that extends to both its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22515286/paramount-plus-5-subscription-plan-ads"&gt;recently launched “essential” plan&lt;/a&gt; that’s supported by ads (regularly $5 per month), as well as to its premium ad-free experience (normally $10 per month). While trial periods are fairly standard for most major streaming services — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514661/netflix-free-trial-us-cancel-content-sampling-streaming"&gt;unless it’s Netflix&lt;/a&gt; we’re talking about — Paramount Plus had most recently offered just a week to try the service before it required users to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfsxwo"&gt;Much like Disney Plus and HBO Max, Paramount Plus is a super-stuffed service with designated hubs for content from CBS, BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, and Smithsonian Channel, plus originals exclusive to the platform. &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Picard&lt;/em&gt; (and much more &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, for that matter), &lt;em&gt;The Real World Homecoming: New York&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes Plus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Kamp Koral: SpongeBob’s Under Years&lt;/em&gt; are among the service-specific titles you’ll only be able to stream with an active subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bKA0Vc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Paramount Plus most recently offered a week-long trial — now’s your chance to get a whole month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MF9tg5"&gt;The service should automatically apply the coupon code for the month-long trial at checkout, but in case it does not, the offer is valid with the coupon “movies.” The free 30-day subscription offer will end July 1st, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/paramount-plus-subscription-deal-2021"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ct9Ra7"&gt;Earlier this week, Paramount Plus introduced its new, cheaper “essential” plan that normally costs $5 per month. The ad-supported plan replaces an older $6-per-month plan that was grandfathered in from CBS All Access when the service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300993/paramount-plus-streaming-wars-netflix-disney-launch-date-price"&gt;relaunched as Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8IpdGS"&gt;Many of us are already paying for far too many streaming services. We may as well snag the freebies where they’re available — just don’t forget to cancel if you don’t plan to stay.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy A32 5G review: 5G on a budget</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A sub-$300 phone that’s ready for the future&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="p7mUdG"&gt;If you’re looking for a 5G Android phone and want to spend as little as possible, you can stop right here. At $279, the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G is your best bet right now, especially if you’re in the US where such options are scarce. It offers good 5G support (including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;all-important C-band&lt;/a&gt;!), a huge battery, and four years of security updates. That’s a compelling package for under $300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHlDDa"&gt;That’s not to say it’s perfect. The A32 5G’s screen isn’t great, performance is a little laggy, and though capable, its camera is limited. If you can spend just a bit more, you can get a phone that does better in at least one of these areas. And if you can hold off on your phone purchase for even a few more months, we should see many more very affordable 5G phones on the market to choose from, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522711/oneplus-n200-5g-specs-screen-price"&gt;OnePlus N200&lt;/a&gt;. But if you don’t have time to wait and can’t spare the extra cash, I can’t find a good reason to talk you out of the A32 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HOLmhP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10602493"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8FbAEW_mnjnHlY8Z1V6mGE19New=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22654071/ajohnson_20210608_4627_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A32 5G is a big device, housing a 6.5-inch screen and a large 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GJsj8V"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A32 5G screen, performance, and design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="l4qYTS"&gt;The A32 5G features a big 6.5-inch 720p LCD panel that’s best described as nothing special. Colors look a little flat and washed out, and though it gets bright enough to see in direct sunlight, the screen’s reflective plastic protective panel makes it challenging. It’s also a low resolution to be stretched across such a large screen, so you’ll see a little pixelization if you look close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LgiW1"&gt;The phone uses a MediaTek Dimensity 720 5G processor that compares well with Qualcomm’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/6/16/21286692/qualcomm-snapdragon-690-processor-5g-budget-phones-120-hz-4k-hdr-video"&gt;Snapdragon 690 5G chipset&lt;/a&gt; for budget 5G phones, used by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;. The Galaxy A32 5G combines the MediaTek processor with 4GB of RAM (decent) and 64GB of storage (skimpy but just enough to get by, and you can throw in a microSD card to expand it), and it performs well enough for its class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="QpPgiJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The A32 5G features a big 6.5-inch 720p LCD panel that’s best described as nothing special&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XK7rOH"&gt;There’s noticeable hiccuping with media-dense pages, brief pauses when diving into a demanding task like starting Google Maps navigation, and noticeable camera shutter lag. For the most part, though, I just didn’t notice slowdowns as I jumped between apps, scrolled through Instagram, and just generally went about using the phone normally. That’s about all I’d ask for from a sub-$300 phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mELPZW"&gt;The phone’s headline feature, 5G, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;still isn’t something&lt;/a&gt; we’d recommend you run out and buy a new phone to get. But the A32 5G has a couple of features that make it worth your time, even considering that good 5G is still a year or two away in the US. Crucially, the A32 5G &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/samsungs-galaxy-a32-promises-c-band-5g-for-less-money"&gt;has been cleared by the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; to use C-band frequencies that Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, in particular, will be utilizing for 5G in the coming years. Not all 5G phones can use C-band, so that’s a big ol’ checkmark in the A32 5G’s favor. There’s no mmWave support here, which is the fastest and scarcest flavor of 5G, but that’s no great loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tfMqJO"&gt;The second factor here is that you can reasonably expect to keep using this phone for enough years to actually see 5G that’s meaningfully better than LTE because Samsung will keep offering security updates for four years. Many budget devices only get about two years of security update support, but the A32 5G’s lengthy lifespan should see it through to the actual 5G age in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="CwkX6s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The A32 5G’s lengthy lifespan should see it through to the actual 5G age in a few years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HX9CnL"&gt;Battery life is one of the A32 5G’s strengths. Its 5,000mAh capacity battery is big indeed, and I had no trouble getting two full days of moderate use out of it. My usage was more battery-friendly than someone else’s might be, with battery optimization on and the bulk of my time spent on Wi-Fi, but even the most power-hungry user would be able to get a full day — if not more — out of the A32 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7a2rr"&gt;With a 6.5-inch screen, the A32 5G is a big phone for sure. It’s a little too bulky and awkward-feeling in my hand. What I dislike even more is that it feels slippery to me — the back panel plastic feels hard to get a decent grip on. On one occasion, I set the phone down on a softcover book, and it somehow shimmied itself across the cover and off of a side table when I wasn’t looking. (There’s a happy ending, though: it only fell about a foot into a box filled with hand-me-down baby clothes waiting to be put away, so there’s a good argument for keeping clutter around your house.) Anyway, get a case for it if you buy this phone, and know that if your hands are small, it won’t be very comfortable to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d9eGBuNVVdirO_Sfgqwjj2ztPGw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22654072/ajohnson_20210608_4627_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a decent-quality 48-megapixel main camera on the A32 5G’s rear panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DqxxSP"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A32 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="VH2X6K"&gt;There are two cameras of consequence on the A32 5G’s rear panel: a 48-megapixel standard wide and an 8-megapixel ultrawide. There’s a 5-megapixel macro camera that’s not very good and a 2-megapixel depth sensor that may or may not help with portrait mode photos. There’s also a 13-megapixel selfie camera around front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ge8fdB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10602618"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jo6l5C"&gt;Considering the phone’s price, the A32 5G’s main camera performs well enough. Like most any other phone, it takes very nice pictures in good lighting. That’s no surprise, even for a budget phone. But it reaches its limits quickly in less-good lighting, like interiors. That’s where optical stabilization or more sophisticated image processing would come in handy, neither of which the A32 5G offers. Instead, you may find some of your photos indoors are a little blurry, and you’ll be very challenged to get a sharp photo of a moving subject in anything less than bright daylight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZS8vo"&gt;The ultrawide camera shows its shortcomings if you look close — there’s some distracting flare in direct sunlight, and some noise visible in shadows of high-contrast scenes. There’s no telephoto lens here, with shortcuts in the camera app to jump to 2x (acceptable), 4x (eh), and 10x (don’t use it) digital zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UKNWzLb6yiIqX-5QnIE4W7KaPxA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22654070/ajohnson_20210608_4627_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A32 5G’s generous security support timeline means it’s a phone you can plan to use for the next few years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="AFcAmw"&gt;It’s tough to say how the Galaxy A32 5G compares to the competition because it doesn’t have much yet. It’s among the least expensive 5G phones you’ll find anywhere. Its closest competition at the moment is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;, which is a little more expensive at $299 but offers some worthwhile hardware upgrades, like a nicer screen, a bit better camera performance, and faster charging. It’s a nicer phone in a lot of ways, but it’s only slated for two years of security updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7fRN5R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you want a future-proof choice that’s easy on the budget, then the Samsung A32 5G will do the trick&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8BEKVd"&gt;Of course, if you only plan to hold on to your phone for a couple of years, then the N10 5G is worth strongly considering. If that’s the case, then 5G becomes a less important feature, too. If there’s room in your budget, consider the $349 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;, which will get you a much better camera, cleaner software, and timely updates over the next couple of years, albeit without support for 5G at all. It’s a much smaller device, though. So if a big screen is part of the A32 5G’s appeal, you might want to look at something like the $279 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311690/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs"&gt;Motorola Moto G Stylus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Bd53va"&gt;If you’d like to avoid the hassle of phone shopping again in two years and you want a future-proof choice that’s easy on the budget, then the Samsung A32 5G will do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pharma is winning the big business popularity contest  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Boxes of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine sitting in freezers..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aa-37JAlccg0cVgZxFWQikrR0r0=/0x1535:3684x3991/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69443914/1233002445.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vz4onF"&gt;It used to be easy to hate pharmaceutical companies. Between soaring drug costs and the opioid crisis, the industry was widely perceived as one that put profits over people’s health. In a &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/266060/big-pharma-sinks-bottom-industry-rankings.aspx"&gt;2019 Gallup survey&lt;/a&gt;, pharma was ranked dead last for positive perception among United States institutions. People had more positive feelings about the federal government than Big Pharma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuWCke"&gt;That year, technology companies were more popular. In a different survey, &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/265799/americans-split-regulation-big-tech.aspx"&gt;just under half&lt;/a&gt; of US adults had a positive view of the tech sector. It’s hard to compare two different polls head to head, but the general trend is clear: in 2019, people felt better about tech companies than they did about pharma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGcpJc"&gt;But then, the pandemic hit, and the country’s recovery depended on the success of vaccines. Government scrutiny of tech companies — from both sides of the aisle — picked up steam. And the two industries seem to have swapped places in the nationwide popularity contest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Yt3qds"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gx5ACZ"&gt;The COVID-19 vaccines developed by companies like Pfizer, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, and Moderna are astonishingly effective. Their rollout has helped reduce levels of virus in parts of the US to some of the lowest they’ve been since March 2020. That success led to a boost in popularity for the drug companies. There were more people who had a favorable view than people who had an unfavorable view of the companies in a March 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2021/3/dfp-pharma-infrastructure-funding.pdf"&gt;Data for Progress survey&lt;/a&gt;, just as the vaccination campaign in the US was picking up steam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pz4Xak"&gt;Meanwhile, during the pandemic, tech companies’ popularity took a &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/539367-views-of-big-tech-firms-worsen-over-past-18-months-poll?rl=1"&gt;nosedive&lt;/a&gt;. Democrats and Republicans both spent the past year highlighting various tech failures, and congressional hearings brought new attention to their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506682/google-apple-amazon-facebook-antitrust-report-house-judiciary"&gt;anti-competitive business practices&lt;/a&gt;. The group of US adults who have a positive view of the tech industry shrunk to around a third, according to a &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/329666/views-big-tech-worsen-public-wants-regulation.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;amp;utm_campaign=syndication"&gt;February 2021 Gallup poll&lt;/a&gt;. And the number of people with a very negative opinion of the sector jumped to 22 percent, up from 10 percent in August 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAOXRI"&gt;The past year recalibrated our relationships to both industries: the shine is off tech, and there’s an appreciation for some of the benefits of pharma. But the pandemic also highlighted how deeply they’re entangled in most people’s day-to-day lives, and how much they govern how we live, work, and move through the world. The past year showed that we can’t really go without either one — but that doesn’t mean we have to like them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KwK39c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the shine is off tech, and there’s an appreciation for some of the benefits of pharma&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9ati9Y"&gt;After all, drug prices &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/blog/january-drug-price-hikes-2021/"&gt;kept going up this year&lt;/a&gt;, even as pharma racked up goodwill from the COVID-19 vaccines. Pharmaceutical company Biogen just slapped a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/08/biogen-faces-tough-questions-over-56k-a-year-price-of-newly-approved-alzheimers-drug.html"&gt;$56,000 annual price tag&lt;/a&gt; on a new drug for Alzheimer’s that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01546-2"&gt;may not actually work&lt;/a&gt;. Congress is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301453/antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-reform-cicilline-buck"&gt;still targeting&lt;/a&gt; the industry, and tech CEOs are making headlines for their &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax"&gt;tax avoidance&lt;/a&gt;. If trends continue the way they’re going, the popularity contest may be more like a race to the bottom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkqCMz"&gt;Here’s what happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1NtbkT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wcMgWX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/07/health/covid-alpha-uk-variant.html?smid=tw-share"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the ‘Alpha’ Coronavirus Variant Became So Powerful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llBcUF"&gt;The coronavirus variant that was first identified in the United Kingdom, now known as the Alpha variant, can evade parts of the the immune system — which is partly why it spread so fast. (Carl Zimmer / &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIXCLU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/06/would-you-have-your-dna-tested-predict-how-hard-covid-19-would-strike-should-you"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you have your DNA tested to predict how hard COVID-19 would strike? Should you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIprMP"&gt;An Australian company says it can use genetic and demographic data to predict someone’s risk of developing a severe case of COVID-19. But there isn’t much evidence to base those claims on. (Jocelyn Kaiser / &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="c4BSfd"&gt;We’re only beginning to understand pandemic trauma. Every COVID-19 death has unleashed a river of grief still flooding over the bereaved. Millions of coronavirus survivors are still ravaged by what the disease did to them. Even those who haven’t personally been touched by the virus have had to contend with lost jobs, anxiety, and missed opportunities. But for some people, the past year has also fundamentally broken their moral compass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>You can get some great tech and game deals ahead of Prime Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IWuEmoeuuKdtMwXlI2LJ0lCq_fc=/0x1:1137x759/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69443721/samsungq70ahero.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J9ZKiV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;Prime Day 2021&lt;/a&gt; is happening in just a little over a week, kicking off on Monday, June 21st, and lasting through Tuesday, June 22nd. In addition to keeping up with our regular deals cadence each day, we’ve been working hard behind the curtain to ensure that we’ll be able to bring you the best Prime Day coverage out there once it starts. To that end, we’re updating each of our useful deal guides, so you’ll be able to tell more easily when something that we recommend is discounted. We recently updated our guide to helping you find the best deals on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"&gt;wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnRd2b"&gt;It’s going to be a busy but great week ahead for deals. If you’re looking for savings, you’ll definitely want to see what’s coming on Prime Day, whether it’s at Amazon or at other retailers like Best Buy, Walmart, and Target. Until then, I’m going to give you what you came for: the best deals of the week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OoZJsH"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5zuwAe"&gt;Get $700 in gifts cards when you buy Samsung’s 85-inch Q70A QLED TV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OSxPt4"&gt;At Best Buy, you can get $700 in gift cards when you purchase Samsung’s 85-inch Q70A QLED TV. Originally $3,300, recent price cuts have reduced it to $2,800. Best Buy gifts cards obviously aren’t as good as a cash discount, but once factored in, it’s like getting this gargantuan, but very thin TV for $2,100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UK1DOn"&gt;This model has a 4K 120Hz refresh rate panel and it supports FreeSync, variable refresh rate and auto low-latency mode. It features an HDMI 2.1 port to allow PC and Xbox Series X to display games at up to 4K resolution at 120 frames per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xXqHgU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10603517"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="F36KX5"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WnBs98"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 5 is just $50 right now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hysBf5"&gt;You can stretch $50 pretty far these days, especially on tech. One way to spend your $50 is on Amazon’s first-generation Echo Show 5 smart display. It can display the time, weather, video content, and more. You can also hop on a video chat with its built-in camera and microphones. These originally sold for $90, but you can get one for nearly half the cost right now at one of the retailers below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fNcjDa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="dwKocr"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4Ta92i"&gt;Roku’s capable Ultra streaming box is $30 off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MPyBss"&gt;If you’re in the market for a new streaming device that supports 4K output with Dolby Vision and HDR 10 as well as Atmos compatibility, Roku’s Ultra at $69 is a great value right now. I can’t forget to mention that the Ultra has an ethernet port, so you can get full speeds for streaming 4K content if your wireless network isn’t up to snuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rfhAb8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10518754"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="f3sGc9"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Control" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/08uR2eJiVXuOSxa81QyzIZzNVxs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20062302/control.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8l1nEJ"&gt;Remedy’s &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;for PC is free at the Epic Game Store&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3JKmPS"&gt;There’s a new free game at the Epic Games Store nearly every week, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/control"&gt;and this week’s title is &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That info alone is enough for some people to just go ahead and click the link to grab the game. If you need a little more convincing, it’s a third-person action game in which  you investigate an otherworldly presence that has taken over a fictional version of the FBI. In addition to being a fun game to play, it’s got some dollops of &lt;em&gt;X-Files&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt; inspiration in there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrfV4K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Echo Show 5 (second gen) review: small screen, small updates</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s smallest smart display has gotten the tiniest of refreshes&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="wL02c4"&gt;Amazon recently updated a couple of its Alexa-based Echo Show smart displays. The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 8 (second gen)&lt;/a&gt; saw a couple of enhancements over its predecessor, but the smaller Echo Show 5 has received an even smaller refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Dg4dV"&gt;There are only three basic changes in the new &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-5-2nd-Gen-2021-release-dp-B08KJN3333/dp/B08J8H8L5T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$84.99 Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen)&lt;/a&gt;: it has a 2-megapixel camera instead of the 1-megapixel sensor of the first model; it comes in blue as well as the black and white color options; and the 3.5mm output jack on the back is gone. Unlike the larger Echo Show 8, the new 5 didn’t get a new processor, and its camera doesn’t feature the automatic panning and cropping that the Echo Show 8 and 10 offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ofY0wY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10602714"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nancLy"&gt;That means that this new model provides effectively the same experience as the prior generation. It’s a compact smart display that’s best used as a smart alarm clock or a desk companion in a home office. The 5.5-inch 960 x 480-pixel touchscreen is bright and colorful, but not as easy to read from across the room as Amazon’s larger smart displays. It works as a monitor for a security camera or video doorbell, but I wouldn’t want to watch much video on it — your phone is a better device for that. If you insist, the Echo Show 5 supports Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and YouTube via its browser, but not as many video services as the larger models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FxFoJKj27YiCmyTnBs4oIqch3Mo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653348/dseifert_4630_amazon_echo_show_5_2nd_gen_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Echo Show 5 is available in blue, in addition to white or black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T7Wpy12qv80d3zHEjK2SaCcazbE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653351/dseifert_4630_amazon_echo_show_5_2nd_gen_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 5’s camera has been upgraded to 2 megapixels, but it’s still not great. Fortunately, you can block it with the built-in privacy shutter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fRXXzK"&gt;The single speaker inside the wedge design gets surprisingly loud and puts out more bass than expected for its size, but it won’t as easily fill a room with sound. It works great for a morning alarm or listening to a podcast at a desk. The Echo Show 5 also has a handy feature that lets you tap the top of the device to snooze an alarm, which is easier than trying to say “Alexa snooze” when you’re half awake. (The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"&gt;Google Nest Hub’s&lt;/a&gt; ability to just stop the alarm with a single word, or to snooze when you wave your hand in front of it, is still better, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzBMOL"&gt;Though the camera in the new model is 2 megapixels instead of 1, that’s not a huge upgrade. The Echo Show 5 doesn’t support Zoom, so you can’t use it for work calls, but it’s fine for calling from one Alexa smart display to another or to the Alexa app on a phone. Perhaps a more useful feature is the ability to view the camera’s feed through the Alexa app, so you can see what’s going on at home when you’re gone. If you don’t want to use the camera at all, you can block its view with the built-in privacy shutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="10Lar9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s new Echo Show 8 is a little faster and has a better camera","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uabtP8"&gt;Since the second-gen Echo Show 5 has the same processor as the last model, it’s not any faster. Of Amazon’s smart display lineup, it’s certainly the pokiest, taking the most time to load a video feed from a security camera and taking an extra beat or two to pull up different screens or menus when you interact with it. Most people will probably not find that to be a problem, but if you were hoping for a speed increase this time around, sadly there isn’t one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R2fK2WiPef33PFDkDrBiJ-vjWz8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653346/dseifert_4630_amazon_echo_show_5_2nd_gen_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kids Edition Echo Show 5 comes in a unique chameleon color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ha2tClCh-INTLP5M4gjzLCgY84s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653342/dseifert_4630_amazon_echo_show_5_2nd_gen_16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kids Plus service that comes with the Kids Edition limits what can be played on the device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TluHbV"&gt;Along with the standard Echo Show 5, Amazon is also now selling a Kids Edition model for $10 more. That gets you a custom blue-green-yellow chameleon color, a year’s subscription to the Kids Plus service, and a two-year warranty against accidental breakage. (A two-year damage warranty for a device that is supposed to stay put on a shelf or dresser doesn’t seem very valuable to me, but I’m sure some kid out there will find a way to break the thing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCq8tg"&gt;The Kids Plus service on the Echo Show is similar to what’s available on Amazon’s Fire HD Kids Edition tablets. It allows parents to customize which content and features are available on the devices and tailor them to their child’s age. It will play music from Amazon Music and won’t allow explicit tracks. It also removes certain features like smart home controls from the Show’s touch interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYTjMT"&gt;On the tablets, it’s possible to have multiple profiles that can be switched between different kids, but the Echo Show doesn’t support that. If you’re planning to have more than one kid share it, you have to set the limitations to the age range of just one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RmegLe4QIwWgtm5qQ8hwoprOd5g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653355/dseifert_4630_amazon_echo_show_5_2nd_gen_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Echo Show 5 is effectively the same as the prior model﻿.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DRFe2N"&gt;In all, the new Echo Show 5 (and its Kids Edition derivative) is basically the same as the prior model. It’s still a handy, compact smart display for a nightstand or desk, but it’s not as capable or fast as the larger Echo models in Amazon’s lineup. Given the limitations with the camera, I would be more interested in a model without a camera at all, similar to Google’s Nest Hub, as the bedroom alarm clock is the ideal use case here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9atOn"&gt;At $84.99, the new model is $5 less expensive than its predecessor at launch, but Amazon frequently discounts its Echo devices and you’ll likely be able to find it for less than its retail price quite often.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo leaks new Mario + Rabbids game on its own website</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/shPwgPWpxQp2rx4UrOUa9o-nOZ8=/0x0:920x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69443648/mr.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d2Iv7P"&gt;Ubisoft’s Mario and Rabbids crossover turn-based strategy game is getting a sequel, according to Nintendo’s website. The unannounced game is currently &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mario-plus-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-switch/"&gt;listed on its own page&lt;/a&gt; as “&lt;em&gt;Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope&lt;/em&gt;” together with some key art, three screenshots, and a release date of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BExQR9"&gt;Ubisoft’s E3 press conference is happening at 3PM ET today, Saturday June 12th, and the new game was presumably set to be announced there. The first &lt;em&gt;Mario + Rabbids&lt;/em&gt; title, &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Battle&lt;/em&gt;, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/12/15749998/nintendo-ubisoft-e3-2017-mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-trailer"&gt;originally revealed&lt;/a&gt; by Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto at Ubisoft’s press conference at E3 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

We called it “a shockingly good Nintendo Switch strategy game” in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/28/16214482/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-nintendo-switch-review"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBEv1f"&gt;It’s not necessarily surprising that a well-received game would get a sequel a few years later, but this is an uncharacteristic mistake from Nintendo. Here’s how the &lt;em&gt;Sparks of Hope&lt;/em&gt; page appears on Nintendo’s website right now:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oQsYgP"&gt;And here are the three screenshots:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BUtx8Y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope &lt;/em&gt;could, of course, also be officially announced at Nintendo’s own E3 event. That one’s happening at 12PM ET on Tuesday, June 15th — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465864/e3-schedule-time-date-live-stream-how-to-watch"&gt;here’s our guide to everything else going on at E3 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia to drop Windows 7 and Windows 8 driver support in October</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="nvidia, nvidiastock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bSf7kGgz2Vr1q8ieR-nSvLzHQ2s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69443642/DSC00697.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q4IUA7"&gt;Nvidia is planning to drop support for Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 later this year. Nvidia drivers will be exclusively available for Windows 10 in October, with only critical security updates available on Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 through September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtKTuL"&gt;Microsoft has already dropped support  for Windows 7 and Windows 8, and even the extended support for Windows 8.1 will end in January 2023. “The vast majority of our GeForce customers have migrated to Windows 10 OS,” reads a &lt;a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5201/related/1"&gt;support note from Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;. “In order to ensure GeForce owners experience the best possible security, support, and functionality, Nvidia will now focus on Windows 10 operating system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzqS8k"&gt;There are now 1.3 billion active Windows 10 devices, but Windows 7 is still in use in many parts of the world. &lt;a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide"&gt;Statcounter estimates&lt;/a&gt; that Windows 7 still accounts for 15 percent of all Windows versions. Windows 10 dominates &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam"&gt;Steam usage&lt;/a&gt; though, making up nearly 93 percent with Windows 7 at just under 2 percent. Microsoft is also expected to launch a new version of Windows, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"&gt;likely to be named Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;, in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipdbv3"&gt;Nvidia’s last driver to officially support these old versions of Windows will be made available on August 31st, with an October 4th release being the first to only support Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple rubberstamped Trump’s request to secretly scoop up data on two members of Congress</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wxb5CmJPhMnhWOoqpeb-NdvtPNk=/0x336:4032x3024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69442683/B2E53F34_14F4_4895_AECA_E72D86070E7C.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Steve Jobs Theater at Apple’s Apple Park headquarters.&lt;/em&gt; | Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FBbcJ8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/technology/apple-google-leak-investigation-data-requests.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;is reporting&lt;/a&gt; on a new wrinkle in the story of how the Trump administration’s Department of Justice used Big Tech &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528853/trump-force-apple-democrat-house-intelligence-committee-data"&gt;to spy on two members of the House Intelligence Committee&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to track down leaks to the press — namely, that Apple didn’t fight it, perhaps never had a chance to fight it, because the company rubberstamped the request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rGvdjG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Trump administration forced Apple to secretly reveal at least two Democrats’ data","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528853/trump-force-apple-democrat-house-intelligence-committee-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="13T3Uy"&gt;Apple didn’t even know it was handing over the records of Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA), then the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, it told the publication. In a statement, Apple said it didn’t know what the investigation was about, and couldn’t have known unless it dug through user accounts itself. So it was handled like the vast majority of the 250 requests the company received from the government each week: approved. “An Apple paralegal complied and provided the information,” reports the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nWJTaa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple did not realize that data on two Democratic lawmakers was part of a request by the Trump Justice Department. It was handled by a paralegal like a routine request.&lt;a href="https://t.co/kS51EUmnCp"&gt;https://t.co/kS51EUmnCp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jack Nicas (@jacknicas) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jacknicas/status/1403471132435623936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="myl4ao"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;More details: The grand jury subpoena sought metadata for 109 identifiers, specifically 73 phone numbers and 36 email addresses. Apple said it assumes ISPs and other tech companies were also sent similar requests. Apple now limits identifiers to 25 or less.&lt;/p&gt;— Zack Whittaker (@zackwhittaker) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker/status/1403476908789178375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9KULPB"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times’ &lt;/em&gt;piece paints a picture of a US government whose requests have been increasing in volume, and perhaps a general willingness by Big Tech to comply (not that these companies often have a choice). Apple challenged only 4 percent of this sort of request in the first six months of 2020, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. And while Google fought a gag order when the Trump administration seized the phone records of &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;reporters, the story suggests it was easier to challenge because Google counted the NYT as a corporate customer, not an individual user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLMN3L"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/us.html"&gt;Both Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?hl=en&amp;amp;user_requests_report_period=series:requests,accounts;authority:US;time:&amp;amp;lu=user_requests_report_period"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have transparency report pages where you can see how many government requests they received, and how often they comply. Apple didn’t reply to our request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="If2jF8"&gt;Microsoft was also swept up in Trump’s leak hunt. It told the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; that it, too, only learned that it had provided information to the government about a congressional staff member after a gag order expired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzJtqP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPiZb9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YkxpTv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch E3 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VC1JN5"&gt;E3 2021 is finally here. After being canceled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, E3 is back for 2021 in an all-digital format, &lt;a href="https://e3expo.com/news/e3-news/e3-2021-schedule-and-fan-registration"&gt;kicking off on June 12th&lt;/a&gt;. Some big reveals have already hit — although technically not a part of E3, Thursday’s Summer Game Fest’s Kickoff Live event was packed with news, including a trailer and release date for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22307059/elden-ring-george-rr-martin-fromsoftware-e3-2021-trailer-gameplay"&gt;highly-anticipated &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the announcement of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528209/death-stranding-directors-cut-ps5-hideo-kojima"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding: Director’s Cut &lt;/em&gt;for PS5&lt;/a&gt;. (You can catch &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/MqXeohrnoaY"&gt;a full replay of that show here&lt;/a&gt;.) And over the next few days there still are big conferences from Ubisoft, Microsoft and Bethesda, and Nintendo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y8NWN"&gt;If you want to attend the virtual E3 as a fan, you can register to attend &lt;a href="https://e3expo.com/"&gt;on E3’s website&lt;/a&gt;. (I will warn you from personal experience that the E3 portal and website are pretty bad.) But if you just want to follow along with the press conferences and announcements, we’ve put together a timeline of some of the biggest events to look forward to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="949NMw"&gt;When is E3?&lt;/h2&gt;
