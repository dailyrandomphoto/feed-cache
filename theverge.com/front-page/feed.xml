    <title>Facebook is reportedly continuing a ban on anti-coup groups in Myanmar</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i3amtd"&gt;Facebook has reportedly upheld a ban on many organizations in Myanmar that have joined forces to resist the military coup that occurred back in February, &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/facebook-is-still-censoring-groups-fighting-the-military-coup-in-myanmar/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The bans were put in place back in 2019, when organizations like the Arakan Army, and many of its allies, were classified as terrorist organizations by the democratically-elected government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IE5Jnd"&gt;Things have changed in Myanmar since then. After the military coup and government takeover by the Tatmadaw (carried out after an election which &lt;a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/election-fraud-01282021184631.html"&gt;the military claims was fraudulent&lt;/a&gt;), the political situation has become extremely complex. There is, however, one thing that is seemingly clear: the Arakan Army is no longer classified as a terrorist organization, either by the &lt;a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/myanmar-military-regime-removes-arakan-army-list-terrorist-groups.html"&gt;current military-led government&lt;/a&gt;, or by the &lt;a href="https://www.myanmar-now.org/en/news/myanmar-military-not-eaos-only-terrorist-organisation-in-myanmar-crph-says"&gt;elected government currently in exile&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, according to &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;, the Arakan Army is still not allowed on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vy9M8F"&gt;The AA isn’t the only group that’s found itself unable to communicate through Facebook. There are apparently many ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) active in the country, some of which &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22412118/myanmar-coup-protesters-rohingya"&gt;have banded together as a resistance&lt;/a&gt; to the coup government, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/3/13/22329081/myanmar-protests-killed-casualties"&gt;violently cracking down on pro-democracy protestors&lt;/a&gt;. Many of their Facebook pages were also restricted back in 2019, under orders of the democratically elected government, which has since been overthrown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLgycN"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;, the ban of EAOs was controversial before the coup as well: some argue that it prevented the spread of information about human rights violations, like &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41566561"&gt;the genocide against the Rohingya Muslims&lt;/a&gt; carried out by the Tatmadaw. Now, EAOs and journalists in the country argue that Facebook’s bans prevent them from showing what’s happening in the struggle against the current military government. The director of a human rights organization told &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; that the bans are “like trying to close the people’s eyes and ears.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdlxGy"&gt;Facebook also &lt;a href="https://time.com/5943151/facebook-myanmar-military-ban/"&gt;banned pages associated with the Tatmadaw&lt;/a&gt; following the coup, but human rights activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi tells &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; that the company has still failed to react to the political changes that have occurred in Myanmar since then, and called on the company to create an official oversight board for the country.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter may be working on Twitter Blue, a subscription service that would cost $2.99 per month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DrXZxW9zkRnSgMqroLciklrDtY4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292410/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IV4i7C"&gt;Twitter has previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349644/twitter-subscription-service-survey-undo-sent-analytics-feature-ideas"&gt;confirmed that it’s exploring&lt;/a&gt; a paid subscription model for some features, and app researcher Jane Manchun Wong tweeted Saturday that she’s discovered how much it will cost and what it will be called. Twitter Blue, Wong says, will cost $2.99 per month, and will include an Undo Tweets feature and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393287285156859911?s=20"&gt;bookmark collections&lt;/a&gt;. Wong says it appears Twitter is working on a tiered subscription model, which she posits could mean a less-cluttered, premium experience for the highest-paying subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zgZgW2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is calling their upcoming Subscription Service “Twitter Blue”, priced at $2.99/month for now, including paid features like:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Undo Tweets: &lt;a href="https://t.co/CrqnzIPcOH"&gt;https://t.co/CrqnzIPcOH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Collections: &lt;a href="https://t.co/qfFfAXHp1o"&gt;https://t.co/qfFfAXHp1o&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/yyMStpCkpr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yyMStpCkpr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393541248049303555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2u2xPw"&gt;Twitter didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday, but the company doesn’t usually confirm or otherwise comment on Wong’s typically accurate discoveries of new features before they launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqIiMQ"&gt;Twitter has made a slew of new product announcements over the past several weeks, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420586/twitter-offensive-tweet-warning-prompt-updated-success-rate"&gt;updating its warnings&lt;/a&gt; for potentially offensive tweets, improving its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421574/twitter-crop-issue-bigger-images-rollout"&gt;photo cropping algorithm&lt;/a&gt; to allow “taller” images to fully display in users’ feeds, adding the ability for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434936/twitter-dm-search-android-expanding"&gt;Android users to search&lt;/a&gt; their direct messages, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;rolling out a Tip Jar feature&lt;/a&gt; to allow users to make donations to some creators, journalists, experts, and non-profits (although that last one raised some &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx55k4/psa-twitters-new-tip-jar-can-reveal-your-address"&gt;privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt; about what user information is included along with the tip).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5d9SP"&gt;And earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22417852/twitter-buying-scroll-subscription-service-news-revue-newsletter"&gt;Twitter acquired Scroll&lt;/a&gt;, the $5-per-month subscription services that removes ads from websites that participate. With the Scroll announcement, Twitter also said it would be winding down Nuzzel, a Scroll service that sent users daily email roundups of top stories in their Twitter feeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46o8Eb"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1'21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;first-quarter earnings report&lt;/a&gt; late last month, Twitter had a profit of $68 million on revenue of $1.04 billion. The company reported a 20 percent increase in monetizable daily active users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmgMo6"&gt;There’s no word  yet on when a premium paid version of Twitter would launch, or who would be eligible. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How far have you gone for internet access?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hFMm-Tbdb1rhimDTY5fPzPBC8fU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292292/VRG_ILLO_4341_American_Ethernet.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ONt52x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22421637/infrastructure-week-broadband-hospitals-biden-plan-ev-charging"&gt;Infrastructure Week&lt;/a&gt; focused partly on how dire the broadband problem currently is for Americans. On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data"&gt;we showed you a map&lt;/a&gt; of the worst counties for broadband in the US — and on Friday, we closed the week by showing how satellite services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;Starlink&lt;/a&gt; aren’t enough to close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VeSTgq"&gt;But even for the people who do have high-speed internet access, many of them have done desperate things to secure access to it. Our team resides all around the US, and they’ve shared some personal tales below about their experiences getting (or failing to get) high-speed internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmPUzF"&gt;But we also want to know what lengths &lt;em&gt;you’ve&lt;/em&gt; gone to for internet access. Did you have to plead with an unwilling internet service provider to branch out its high-speed service to your area? Did you resort to using a device in an unintended way to get internet access? Did you use any clever workarounds to improve your internet (or piggy-back on a neighbor’s)? Share your story in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="akDgYb"&gt;
&lt;p id="3xIejD"&gt;When I came back from college one summer, I found my mom had switched from dial-up to slightly faster RF-based internet. There was a little dish on our back porch pointed at the grain elevators in town (the largest building in the area). The internet providers were just a couple of nice young dudes who were using cable lines to string internet from the center of town to the grain elevators where they would then beam it out to people too far away to get DSL or cable. The internet was usually fine but would slow down or stop altogether if there was interference. Usually, it was a bad storm or heavy fog. But the worst was whenever the hay fields between the grain elevators and my home were harvested. It would kick up dust and leave me totally internet-less. I got very comfortable playing &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; in coffee shops and diners in rural North Texas. &lt;strong&gt;— Alex Cranz, managing editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="jxvtcm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10493160"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K5vNY2"&gt;The internet at my parents’ house (where I’ve spent a good amount of the pandemic working, since my 200-square-foot apartment isn’t an ideal office) is mind-bogglingly slow. This is a problem for me as someone who reviews laptops, and especially gaming laptops, because I constantly need to download things. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;took almost four days to load onto my drive on my parents’ internet, for example, and it was bogging everything else down so much that I needed to find another solution. So I want to take this space to shout out the Congregational Church of Salisbury, which has allowed me to absolutely pummel their holy internet with piles of heavy downloads several times this year. There’s no experience more serene than spending the morning in an empty chapel, hearing the chirps of birds echo through windows and across the pews, feeling at peace with nature and God, as you download AAA game after AAA game. &lt;strong&gt;— Monica Chin, writer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmY0SZ"&gt;Back in the days when getting access to data internationally cost a small fortune, a friend of mine came up with the ingenious workaround of using the free 3G connection on his Kindle as a workaround. He spent an entire summer using the basic browser built into his e-reader to load up Google Maps and find his way around. It was a painful process, and I don’t think he got anywhere particularly quickly, but it was better than having to pay the international roaming rates being charged at the time. &lt;strong&gt;— Jon Porter, news reporter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJOX2h"&gt;Being a freelance video professional and needing to upload large files means my internet connection can be the difference between spending a day to get a video online or a few minutes. Unfortunately, living in NYC means I pretty much only have one option for internet from the legacy cable provider (Spectrum). Like most cable providers, they offer decent download speeds but throttle the upload speeds to the same measly 30mbps across all their plans, and even then you rarely get the full 30mbps. I wanted fiber internet because it offers modern bandwidth for uploads, but there was little incentive for Verizon FiOS to run their service into the pre-war building I live in on the Upper West Side. I was determined, though, and went door to door to every resident in the building to get enough signatures showing interest in having a fiber option for internet. After getting a majority of the tenants to sign on and calling and writing to Verizon every week for almost six months, I was able to get them to coordinate with the landlord to install service to our building. Now an average video that would take several hours to upload can be put online in a few minutes. Being able to fix a problem or make a quick change to a video for a client allows me to accommodate client requests that many other producers would not be able to handle. My upload speed can be the real difference between getting the next job or not.  &lt;strong&gt;— Liam James, producer on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVf6CF"&gt;I was studying in mainland China during a big crackdown on US websites in college. So I spent half the year playing a constant game of whack-a-mole with Tor and a series of sketchy (but faster) free web proxies whose names and links got passed around my cohort like we were sharing the passwords to a speakeasy. I’m lucky I didn’t end up with some kind of horrific malware, but on the bright side, it’s the only time I could imagine feeling cool and rebellious visiting Facebook. &lt;strong&gt;— Adi Robertson, senior reporter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SjVIP"&gt;My family didn’t upgrade from dial-up until around 2012, which meant that we also didn’t have Wi-Fi. Of course, I wasn’t going to let that stop me from getting Online, so I did what any preteen would do: grabbed my PSP 2000 and roamed around my neighborhood looking for unprotected hotspots. I ended up finding one right by our house (hi neighbors!), and eagerly connected to it. Thankfully, there was a tree in the exact perfect spot, where I was as close to their property as I could’ve been without technically trespassing. That unprotected Wi-Fi hotspot and my PSP’s web browser were my main access to the internet for about a year — I would hang in, on, or around the tree, surfing the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aoHSt"&gt;I realize that this may mean I was one of the PSP web browser’s top users, and I know I had a few JavaScript bookmarklets installed, though I don’t remember what they did. I know that most of what I was doing were the types of things I didn’t want to or couldn’t do on the public desktop: setting up a secret MySpace account to talk to my fake middle school girlfriend and playing multiplayer games (though I usually couldn’t finish them, as the connection was, understandably, super flaky). &lt;strong&gt;— Mitchell Clark, news writer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEAN3F"&gt;Dial-up internet was the only option during my teenage years living on the outskirts of a small town in Ohio. We got service through CompuServe, and it showed its limitations when I needed to do pretty much anything other than using MySpace, Xanga, or GameFaqs for text-only gaming guides. I remember it took a week to download a 63MB trailer for &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&lt;/em&gt; on Kazaa. So, it was totally inadequate for playing online games like &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt; on the Xbox 360, which all of my friends were playing at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8tVc6"&gt;To get something that could even be considered high-speed internet at our house (I recall that speed being well under 500Kbps for download and upload speeds), I had to repeatedly call and plead with the local ISP to bring it out to where I lived, about 20 miles out of town. It eventually worked after a few months of persistence. I got my way, and I could &lt;em&gt;finally &lt;/em&gt;play synchronous multiplayer games online for the first time ever. Shortly thereafter, a stranger online in &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt; told me he was going to come to my house and kill me, so I quit playing it entirely. &lt;strong&gt;— Cameron Faulkner, writer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G78y9g"&gt;There are four rooms in my apartment. Living room —&amp;gt; Kitchen —&amp;gt; Bathroom —&amp;gt; Bedroom. Thick concrete walls between each of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfcASv"&gt;My router is in the living room. It does not reliably reach the bedroom. If I leave the bedroom door all the way open, I might maintain a consistent signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnEEAT"&gt;I know I need to buy an Eero or something, but I keep thinking a better model will come out soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnRd8B"&gt;So instead, I bought a $30 Wi-Fi repeater and a long extension cable. I ran the cable from a power outlet in the kitchen out into the hallway (there are no outlets in the hallway) that leads to the bedroom. The cable is somewhat tactfully hidden around a doorframe using a series of tiny nails meant for hanging picture frames and thread to hold the cable in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pL1ZS3"&gt;The Wi-Fi repeater is now hovering near the ceiling, halfway between the router and bedroom. If I connect to it, I can get AOL-grade speeds in my bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKLZxP"&gt;It’s been there for 12 months now. I never use it.&lt;strong&gt;— Jake Kastrenakes, senior editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRGovd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlEL4X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aG3k9M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0L2xuk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o52Wqt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FoltOU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden revokes Trump executive order that targeted Section 230</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o1HccnHYQQ7SfomOcm7pVz9Hj-k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292149/acastro_181106_1777_flag_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BV2gd3"&gt;President Biden on Friday &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/14/executive-order-on-the-revocation-of-certain-presidential-actions-and-technical-amendment/"&gt;revoked several of former President Trump’s executive orders&lt;/a&gt;, including one that would have changed legal protections for social media sites and other online platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMLIC8"&gt;Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act limits how much online platforms can be held liable for content users share on their platforms. The Trump order, titled “preventing online censorship,” would have allowed federal authorities to hold companies like Twitter, Google, and Facebook responsible if they were found to be infringing on users’ speech by deleting or otherwise modifying users’ posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gB5SPn"&gt;Trump signed the order last May, just as Twitter started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271207/twitter-donald-trump-fact-check-mail-in-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-california"&gt;applying labels to his tweets as “misleading.”&lt;/a&gt; Trump was eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for tweets inciting the January 6th riot at the US Capitol. A similar ban by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"&gt;Facebook remains in effect&lt;/a&gt; while the company reevaluates it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X31hif"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Let’s go through Trump’s terrible internet censorship order, line by line","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21273191/trump-twitter-social-media-censorship-executive-order-analysis-bias"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XTdqd5"&gt;In addition to revoking the executive order that would have changed Section 230, Biden revoked a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-signs-executive-order-punish-vandalism-against-federal-monuments-n1232322"&gt;2020 Trump order&lt;/a&gt; that would have allowed the government to prosecute people who caused damage to statues or monuments, and put a halt to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/04/trump-garden-of-american-heroes-348761"&gt;Trump’s plan to create&lt;/a&gt; a National Garden of American Heroes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5NJaj"&gt;President Biden also revoked a 2019 Trump order that would have &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-require-applicants-for-immigrant-visas-to-show-proof-of-health-coverage-11570228956?mod=article_inline"&gt;required immigrants to the US&lt;/a&gt; to prove they could afford healthcare as part of their visa applications.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="yyEvJx"&gt;This week, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22395472/covid-vaccine-pfizer-kid-ages-12-15-fda-authorization"&gt;authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for people 12-15&lt;/a&gt;, a moment that many families have been eagerly waiting for since the vaccine rollout began in the US. As shots became available, parents &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-rush-to-get-covid-19-vaccines-for-their-children-11620984600"&gt;rushed to get their kids the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. But the decision has also contributed to ongoing discussions about how to best distribute vaccines around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUrG8H"&gt;In Santa Barbara, one 14-year-old got a &lt;a href="https://newspress.com/vaccines-for-teens/"&gt;vaccine for his birthday&lt;/a&gt;. In Colorado, schools are &lt;a href="https://co.chalkbeat.org/2021/5/13/22435327/covid-vaccine-teens-families-colorado-schools"&gt;setting up vaccine clinics&lt;/a&gt;. In Los Angeles, high-schoolers were eager for their shot at experiencing a normal life again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Bhn7OJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yO4Gd3"&gt;“I have a large family, one that I haven’t been able to see in over a year. I’ve missed out on being with my friends, spending time with family, going to school and so much more,” 15-year-old Malyna Trujillo &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-12/l-a-county-to-offer-covid-19-vaccines-to-younger-teens-thursday"&gt;said at a news conference&lt;/a&gt; in LA. “This vaccination isn’t just for me, it’s for my family — for my community.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BXYmM"&gt;On Wednesday, an advisory committee to the CDC endorsed the FDA’s decision, clearing the way for vaccinations to start in earnest. After the committee’s vote, Henry Bernstein, a member of the panel and a Professor of Pediatrics at the Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell said he was excited that younger people could now get the vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXUxjz"&gt;“This will provide protection for 12 to 15 year olds. It’ll decrease transmission within their families. It’ll contribute to community immunity, and it allows the kids to more safely go back to camps this summer, and back to in person school.” Bernstein said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CDteaD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’ve missed out on being with my friends, spending time with family, going to school and so much more,”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3FyMEH"&gt;Not everyone was thrilled with the decision. “I understand why some countries want to vaccinate their children and adolescents, but right now I urge them to reconsider” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organisation, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-urges-rich-countries-donate-shots-instead-vaccinating-children-2021-05-14/"&gt;said this week&lt;/a&gt;. He asked that countries donate vaccines to other countries instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndhnoJ"&gt;“In low and lower-middle income countries, Covid-19 vaccine supply has not been enough to even immunize healthcare workers, and hospitals are being inundated with people that need lifesaving care urgently,” &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-57114734"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUhd7s"&gt;People on the CDC committee acknowledged the disparity in comments after the vote. “If we look at what’s happening elsewhere in the world, that’s evidence of what happens if you don’t have adequate supplies of safe and effective vaccines” said Matthew Daley, a pediatrician and researcher at Kaiser Permanente’s Institute for Health Research. “We’re in this very privileged position where we can see declining deaths and declining case rates because of these vaccines.” &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4NNYy8"&gt;Younger people are not at as great a risk of developing severe complications of COVID-19 as older people. But less risk is not zero risk, and as vaccinations have accelerated in the United States, doctors have seen &lt;a href="https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/childrens-health/covid-upticks-among-kids-and-teens-what-parents-should-know"&gt;spikes in infections in unvaccinated children.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNlq7T"&gt;For parents, securing an early vaccine slot was a first chance to provide their kids a little bit more freedom after a year of caution. Kids were excited at the prospect of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/us/coronavirus-vaccine-children-ages-12-15.html"&gt;sleepovers, shopping&lt;/a&gt;, and anything that looks like pre-pandemic life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTgphd"&gt;“The reason why I got it was because I want to see my friend, which I haven’t seen for a while. We’ve only been able to call each other,” 13-year-old Evan Yaney told &lt;a href="https://www.wilx.com/2021/05/13/mid-michigan-teenagers-lining-up-for-covid-vaccines/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WILX&lt;/em&gt; in Lansing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ms5fQB"&gt;That loneliness is something that experts hope this next stage of the vaccine rollout might combat. At the meeting of the CDC’s advisory panel this week, Grace Lee, a Professor of Pediatrics at Stanford University pointed out that we still don’t know the long-term effects of this pandemic on younger age groups.  “I think sometimes we lose the importance of children and adolescents in the midst of a pandemic. There’s been such a focus on older adults in particular, I think that the childhood experience our kids have gone through will have long-lasting consequences that may extend across generations,” said Lee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C6emvr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I want to see my friend, which I haven’t seen for a while.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KW7Id4"&gt;It has been a brutally hard year for children, many of whom have been kept apart from friends and family, suffered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21366285/covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-education-school-distance-learning-control-damage"&gt;educational setbacks&lt;/a&gt;, or witnessed trauma. For them, the chance to get a vaccine offers them hope — for themselves, and also for the future.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5ES9H"&gt;“I have been extremely careful throughout this whole thing,” 13-year-old Pia Andrade told &lt;a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2021/05/13/houston-area-teens-among-first-to-be-vaccinated-in-12-through-15-age-group/"&gt;Houston’s &lt;em&gt;KPRC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as she got vaccinated this week. “My principal actually died from COVID. He was perfectly fine and he got it and was hospitalized and he just died. I’ve seen the effects firsthand, and the more of us that get vaccinated, the better the world will be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="je9oHk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ABb4MR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03606-z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The epidemiological impact of the NHS COVID-19 App&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;This research paper in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; this week models how well the NHS’s contact tracing app worked. The researchers found it worked about as well as manual contact tracing methods, and calculated that it &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-google-contact-tracing-uk-1225935/"&gt;may have saved thousands of lives&lt;/a&gt;. They suggest that similar apps could be used in other countries to blunt the pandemic, while the world waits on vaccines. (Fraser et al, &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

But they don’t always show the same symptoms as adults. In particular, they are much less likely to have a fever, making temperature screenings less effective at catching cases. (Karen Kaplan/Los Angeles Times) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAN7XX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01246-x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How COVID broke the evidence pipeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;With more than a year of pandemic research under our belt, scientists are starting to take stock of the flood of COVID-19 related medical research. They’re finding that some of it...wasn’t that great. There were too many studies on individual (useless) drugs, studies with too few trial participants for any significant results, or review studies that quickly went out of date. There were major successes too, but scientists hope they can learn from the failures the next time an emergency crops up.  (Helen Pearson/&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

But They Aren’t ‘Hesitant’ Either.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;About 30 million people in the US say they’d get a COVID-19 vaccine, but haven’t actually taken the plunge yet. Their reasons vary, but many in this group face hurdles like language barriers, difficult work schedules, or general lack of access.

&lt;p id="S9Buvl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/health/vaccine-pregnancy.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coronavirus Vaccines Protect Pregnant Women, Another Study Suggests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;New studies are adding to a growing pile of evidence that coronavirus vaccines protect pregnant people. A new paper showed that pregnant people can pass antibodies on to their fetus, and that breastmilk can pass antibodies along to infants. Another study found that the vaccine does not damage the placenta.  (Emily Anthes/&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yCQQf3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspectives &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="trV7c7"&gt;This week, the CDC changed its guidance for fully vaccinated people, saying that they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434645/vaccines-masks-social-distancing-cdc-covid"&gt;don’t have to wear masks&lt;/a&gt; in many settings. But masking won’t disappear overnight. Here are a few perspectives from people who are continuing to mask up, for a variety of reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xgoNr5"&gt;“Maybe it’s because I’m a New Yorker or maybe it’s because I always feel like I have to present my best self to the world, but it has been such a relief to feel anonymous. It’s like having a force field around me that says ‘don’t see me’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KFi5nY"&gt;— ‘Francesca’ a professor, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/10/the-people-who-want-to-keep-masking-its-like-an-invisibility-cloak?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; why she’ll continue to wear a mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="tP16fT"&gt;“I know it’s a low percentage, but there are children who have gotten it and been affected. What if it was your kid? I would take a gamble on myself. But my children? Never.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="093DkB"&gt;— Jani Able, mother of two 7-year-olds &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/05/14/covid-19-cdc-mask-guidance-parents-young-children-coronavirus/5093405001/"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;why her family will continue to wear masks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6V62M0"&gt;“I still have fears that my husband will die even though we’re vaccinated...Just because I’ve read so many stories about people’s husbands dying. Or I have fears that my child will be that one kid who gets the rare syndrome, and visions of myself in the hospital. I have an overactive imagination. I tend to be anxious and impressionable. But I think a lot of people, not just me, are going through similar thoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8nPuBQ"&gt;— Frani, a woman in New York City &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93yye8/pandemic-safety-mask-lockdown-cant-quit-grief-trauma-anxiety"&gt;talks to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about why she’s still wearing a mask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Wd58Qi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eB0mEC"&gt;To the people who have received the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/"&gt;1.41 billion vaccine doses&lt;/a&gt; distributed so far — thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVY63I"&gt;To the more than 161,951,393 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMVaxk"&gt;To the families and friends of the 3,359,318 people who have died worldwide — 585,233 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MppEl6"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1pxQd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBfWHt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket suffers failure, loses payload of two satellites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/--Mym7fCDgbkzOvOWe8kXL6l068=/11x0:1382x914/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292048/Screen_Shot_2021_05_15_at_9.42.00_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket launches from New Zealand on Saturday, as seen on the company’s live video feed. | Rocket Lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RxHIoa"&gt;Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket failed to reach orbit after suffering an unexpected engine shutdown mid-flight on Saturday, losing the mission’s payload of two satellites, the company said. The launch from New Zealand was Electron’s 20th, and marked the company’s second mission failure in less than a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aATXd1"&gt;Electron, a roughly six-story tall rocket with two booster stages, lifted off from Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 1 on the Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand at 7:11AM ET on Saturday, aiming to send a pair of Earth observation satellites for BlackSky into orbit. Two and a half minutes into flight, the rocket’s second stage booster successfully separated from its first stage and ignited for a few seconds before shutting down, indicating a problem as seen on the company’s launch live stream. Mission control lost telemetry of the booster shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVjl45"&gt;“An issue was experienced during today’s launch, resulting in the loss of the mission,” Rocket Lab &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RocketLab/status/1393531340188913665?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; after the failure. “We are deeply sorry to our launch customers BlackSky and Spaceflight. The issue occurred shortly after stage two ignition. More information will be provided as it becomes available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tj5Ods"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We will learn from this, and we’ll be back on the pad again”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1EGUpD"&gt;A secondary objective for the mission, dubbed “Running Out Of Toes,” involved a test of some hardware upgrades meant to improve Electron’s reusability, including a new heat shield for the booster’s reentry. The rocket’s first stage booster successfully splashed down in the ocean under parachutes as planned after lofting the second stage toward space, Rocket Lab said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcnL8L"&gt;The company is working with the Federal Aviation Administration to investigate the cause of Saturday’s issue to correct it for future missions, the statement said. “With multiple launch vehicles currently in production, Rocket Lab is prepared for a rapid return to flight as soon as investigations are complete and any required corrective actions are in place,” it said. No injuries or public damage were reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZCtUH"&gt;“We will learn from this, and we’ll be back on the pad again,” Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck said in the statement. BlackSky, the launch customer, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BlackSky_Inc/status/1393539335807397897?s=20"&gt;retweeted&lt;/a&gt; Rocket Lab’s statement, saying: “This is what we have received from Rocket Lab. We will continue to offer updates as we learn more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOsrWv"&gt;Electron’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/4/21313502/rocket-lab-electron-launch-failure-pics-or-it-didnt-happen"&gt;last failure&lt;/a&gt; occurred in July 2020, carrying and ultimately losing seven satellites after its second stage shut down early. Rocket Lab &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408378/rocket-lab-electron-return-to-flight-capella-space-sequoia-satellite#:~:text=But%20just%20a%20few%20minutes,and%20fell%20back%20to%20Earth."&gt;returned to flight&lt;/a&gt; two months later after pegging the failure on a faulty electrical connection, carrying on with six successful Electron missions thereafter. The company has launched 17 successful missions in all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Twitter policy that could temporarily censor every single one of your tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l-C9MND0vH5SM4VNjNpiHNWe6xs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69291957/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ay94xs"&gt;On Tuesday, a noted Palestinian-American journalist reporting live from protests near Jerusalem was suddenly and mysteriously silenced on Twitter — with every single tweet replaced by the message “@MariamBarghouti’s account is temporarily unavailable because it violates the Twitter Media Policy.” &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8b4x/twitter-said-it-restricted-palestinian-writers-account-by-accident"&gt;It was a mistake&lt;/a&gt;, the company quickly admitted, and her tweets were quickly restored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMMZwe"&gt;But it turns out that one part of the incident was &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;a mistake. While Twitter may have taken action on this person’s account in error, there actually is one particular situation where Twitter reserves the right to make your tweets disappear. And — if you ask me — it’s super, super dumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iOKPG7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;ive been on twitter what feels like my entire life and ive never seen before what they're doing to this palestinian journalist's account &lt;a href="https://t.co/z6bSmLCvNn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/z6bSmLCvNn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Casey Johnston (@caseyjohnston) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/caseyjohnston/status/1392235369614163976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7PWFPP"&gt;Twitter pointed me to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/notices-on-twitter"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cdn.cms-twdigitalassets.com/content/dam/help-twitter/tombstones2/mediapolicymobile4.png"&gt;this specific image&lt;/a&gt; as an example of the policy, which seems like it could date back as far as October 2017: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JyAqj48gYxN4TncpzBdws-JoS_o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22516445/mediapolicymobile4.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I found references to this policy on Twitter’s site dating back to 2018, though you can see an October 2017 timestamp on this theoretical example.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8H1aVo"&gt;There, the “Requiring media or profile edits” policy reads: “If an account’s profile or media content is not compliant with our policies, we may make it temporarily unavailable and require that the violator edit the media or information in their profile to comply with our rules. We also explain which policy their profile or media content has violated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bnvzS"&gt;Or, in plain English, if your profile picture, header image, or other picture you post doesn’t meet Twitter’s standards, Twitter won’t just censor that image — it may censor your entire account until you fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7M9wR"&gt;Why would Twitter need to notify people about a bad image on every single tweet from an author, instead of just omitting the image and perhaps providing an explanation? Over the past several years, we’ve seen many, many instances of Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296518/twitter-trump-video-manipulated-media-deepfake-carpe-donktum"&gt;choosing&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21554013/twitter-flags-president-trumps-tweets-votes-counted-election-pennsylvania"&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271207/twitter-donald-trump-fact-check-mail-in-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-california"&gt;warning labels&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254733/twitter-covid-19-misleading-information-label-warnings-misinformation"&gt;nearby&lt;/a&gt; offensive and damaging content, labels that still allow people to easily view those tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAMZqu"&gt;When I raised this question, a Twitter spokesperson would only say that the policy is designed to “better inform folks on the actions taken by Twitter.” The company declined to say more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbTRAL"&gt;The most generous explanation I can muster is that this is an old, antiquated policy that should have been retired long ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Scy2fG"&gt;Twitter also initially restricted Barghouti’s ability to tweet, retweet, follow and like for 12 hours, according to screenshots she provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not clear why her account was mistakenly censored to begin with; Twitter couldn’t immediately say whether it was a human action or an automated system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSqblk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly will continue to require masks in its US retail stores </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man wearing a face mask is seen outside an Apple retail store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VhAl_w0FHoyVHyOw1lEddZEV8rE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69291913/1232558252.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple will keep its mask mandate in place at its US retail stores | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KWfcNW"&gt;Despite new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Apple will keep its mandatory mask policy in place at its US retail stores for the time being,&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-15/apple-stores-keep-mask-mandate-as-company-evaluates-measures?sref=10lNAhZ9"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The company informed stores that it is continuing to evaluate COVID-19-related health and safety measures, but that the policy requiring customers and employees at its Apple stores would stay in effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6U0Bt"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434645/vaccines-masks-social-distancing-cdc-covid"&gt;CDC announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that people who had been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus could do away with wearing masks indoors and outdoors, and did not have to continue social distancing. There are some exceptions to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html"&gt;CDC guidance&lt;/a&gt;, which recommends people continue masking on public transit, airplanes, and trains, and in health care settings such as a doctor’s office. Immunocompromised people are advised to consult their healthcare professional before discontinuing masks, and someone who develops new COVID-19 symptoms should start wearing masks again to be safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLw1dp"&gt;Some retail stores across the US &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2021/05/14/mask-mandate-stores-change-fully-vaccinated-cdc-no-masks-indoors/5102169001/"&gt;began lifting their mask requirements&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, with large companies including Walmart, Trader Joe’s, and Costco updating their policies. But Target and CVS were among the retailers who said they would keep their mask requirements in place as they assessed the CDC guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tza6u7"&gt;In its stores that have reopened— some are open on a limited basis — Apple currently requires customers and store employees to wear masks, and provides masks for customers that don’t have their own. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbrowse%2Fstore%2Fplan_your_visit&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F15%2F22437593%2Fapple-masks-retail-stores-covid-cdc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The company’s FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; also says it requires temperature checks before anyone is allowed to enter an Apple store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd1X63"&gt;Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Our favorite pandemic gifts to ourselves</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kqsvsEEq4IsuOcNyKS5okTXeSs4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69291857/akrales_191008_3706_0164.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hbnGki"&gt;When you’ve been through tough times — and we all have — sometimes you just need a distraction or something that just makes you feel good to get you through it. We asked the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; what they’ve treated themselves to in order to help make all the upheavals and lockdowns of the past year just a bit more bearable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jtnjoh"&gt;These are some of the things that made them smile over the past year. Hopefully, you’ve got something that made you smile as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a4FI6v"&gt;World of Warcraft subscription &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MCtE3J"&gt;Nothing feels like an escape more than a world of Orcs, Mages, and Warriors. I’ve played &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; off and on throughout the years, but — faced with hours of Netflix, in-home workouts, and utter boredom during the pandemic — I decided it was time to re-commit to playing. Nearly six months into my renewed subscription, I’m thankful for it. The winter was long, lonely, and dreary, but I found a community in &lt;em&gt;WoW&lt;/em&gt; that helped me mentally escape. I don’t know if I’ll continue playing once life starts returning back to normal, but I’m glad for the hours I spent in that magical little world. &lt;em&gt;— Kaitlin Hatton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1PbGX8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498504" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9VzBwI"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5WrWNM"&gt;Blue Apron&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vT3DXC"&gt;Blue Apron helped me get through lockdown (and continues to help) in more than one way. Early on, when going to the grocery store was about as fraught as a journey to Mordor, BA meant three fewer meals to shop for every week, which was a huge relief. It’s also been a low-effort way to help break up the “every day feels like Groundhog Day” monotony of dinner after dinner at home. I get to try something new but with pre-portioned ingredients and a recipe card holding my hand the whole way. Some of the meals have been more successful than others, and I’ve actually gained some confidence as a home cook — that’s huge for someone like me who can simultaneously worry that a piece of meat is both overcooked and undercooked. I don’t think I’ll keep the subscription in the long run, but I have a stack of recipe cards and a few more skills to rely on when I do decide to strike out on my own. &lt;em&gt;— Allison Johnson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OVUXLo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8tmMt0"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1TLgW7"&gt;Circular knitting needles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TKc8cE"&gt;Knitting is the only skill I have that’s never produced a catastrophic mental death spiral. And during a long year at home, I realized relying on straight needles — the things I almost exclusively associated with knitting when I started — is a sucker’s game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNTM6j"&gt;Circular needles are designed for making round projects like hats. It took me way too long to grasp that they’re great for shawls, scarves, and other flat-knit stuff, too. Also, screwing together different sizes of needles and cords &lt;a href="https://www.knitterspride.com/Materialwise-size-Details.asp?id=188"&gt;from an interchangeable set&lt;/a&gt; is inexplicably satisfying. I wish I’d bought this thing sooner — although my increasingly knitwear-laden friends and family might disagree. &lt;em&gt;— Adi Robertson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4UcwL4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498668"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Pfzff4"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tGCa5Y"&gt;Remodel your bed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2WEY5g"&gt;I got sick — not with COVID — in November and early December, and come January, I was still pretty exhausted. I was spending more time in bed than usual, so I thought, “Why not make bed more pleasant?” First, I bought the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slumbercloud.com%2Fproducts%2Fcore-mattress-pad&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22434062%2Fgifts-covid-favorite-warcraft-knitting-ps5-nintendo-echo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Slumber Cloud Nacreous Mattress Pad&lt;/a&gt;, which has kept my temperature pleasantly even. Then &lt;a href="https://brooklinen.pxf.io/c/482924/971323/12856?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brooklinen.com%2Fproducts%2Flinen-core-sheet-set%3Fvariant%3D43437481045&amp;amp;sharedid=VergePandemicGifts051421"&gt;Brooklinen’s Core Linen Set&lt;/a&gt; (in cream), which gets softer every time I wash my bedding and feels lovely on the skin. Finally, I added the &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/go/tempur-neck-pillow-best-pillows-for-neck-pain"&gt;Tempur-Pedic Tempur-Neck Pillow&lt;/a&gt;, which looks dorky but has been an absolute pleasure to sleep on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSvlNU"&gt;I’m back on my feet again, but these purchases keep paying off. I don’t think I’ve slept so well or thoroughly in years. There’s nothing better than crawling into a cozy bed and drifting off after a long day. &lt;em&gt;— Liz Lopatto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fUEksd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498716"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="e82Hu6"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="612JhG"&gt;Fully Jarvis standing desk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vSn2UV"&gt;I’ve required several unnecessary pick-me-up purchases during the pandemic, like a &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-2/dp/B08F7PTF53?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;. My latest purchase is the priciest yet, but it seems more logical. I just bought a Fully Jarvis standing desk so that I can actually stand up a few times during the day to get my blood flowing. There are several days per week when I really don’t move around as much as I should (even on the days I do move, I’m still not doing much), so I think this should help me out. If not, I can blame &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310104/remote-work-desk-home-set-up-jay-peters-macbook-xbox"&gt;Jay Peters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22395531/remote-work-desk-setup-from-home-office-tech"&gt;Dan Seifert&lt;/a&gt; for being effusive about their Fully Jarvis desks in their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22340755/whats-on-your-desk-setup-tech-verge"&gt;What’s on your desk?&lt;/a&gt; posts. I haven’t even received the desk yet, so I’m anxiously awaiting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adIsxr"&gt;Will it be my most fun pandemic gift to myself? Probably not. For one, this desk can’t play &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;. In seriousness, it’s one of the few things I’ve done for myself in the past year that takes my future well-being into consideration. That’s not easy to do these days, but I’m hopeful that I have this desk for many happy years to come and can look back on it as being my favorite pandemic gift. &lt;em&gt;— Cameron Faulkner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0GFRpf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10306098"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="15bVrT"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6Pyfxl"&gt;A water kettle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VZaYnk"&gt;Buying coffee equipment is like painting a house: the second you improve one part of your setup, it immediately exposes something else that needs an upgrade. So after switching to a Hario V60 coffee dripper for my home brewing, I quickly started lusting after a nice gooseneck kettle. Eventually, I picked the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coffee-Kettle-Hario-V60-Drip-Fitness/dp/B07C9GG9XH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hario V60 Fit Drip Kettle&lt;/a&gt; stovetop kettle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnneDr"&gt;I don’t think it’s the best pick for everyone — it doesn’t have a temperature gauge, and a lot of people prefer electric kettles over stove-top models — but it fits my needs perfectly. It’s got a nice plastic handle that doesn’t get hot as the water boils, it works on induction coils (which wasn’t a guarantee with &lt;a href="https://fellowproducts.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001717292-Is-Stagg-compatible-with-induction-cooktops-?and"&gt;Fellow’s otherwise beautiful Stagg kettle&lt;/a&gt;), and overall, it’s easy to control when you’re trying to deal with finicky pour-over coffee. Mostly though, I’m just glad it doesn’t have the weird ridged design of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hario.co.uk%2Fcollections%2Fcoffee-brew-kettles%2Fproducts%2Fv60-drip-kettle-buono-in-large&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22434062%2Fgifts-covid-favorite-warcraft-knitting-ps5-nintendo-echo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hario’s previous drip kettle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;— Jon Porter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L2fyuW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498783"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="SjqpHx"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EwlUA8"&gt;A PlayStation 4 and &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xrsCB8"&gt;Like many fans of the original &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt;, I followed the years of &lt;em&gt;Remake’s&lt;/em&gt; development with the hope that it would actually hold a candle to the classic PlayStation RPG. And to my surprise, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4"&gt;the game turned out to actually be good&lt;/a&gt;, and that pushed me to drop nearly $400 to buy a PlayStation 4 just so I could play the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2AA4im"&gt;That was a big chunk of change, and I worried that I would regret spending all that cash just for a single game, but it was one of the best gifts I bought myself all last year. &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; was an absolute joy to play through, and it gave my wife and me hours of entertainment (and some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150661/entertainment-2020-music-games-movies-comfort-favorites"&gt;memorable quips&lt;/a&gt; from protagonist Cloud Strife).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOnfTc"&gt;Ever since I beat &lt;em&gt;FF7R&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve been working my way through the many fantastic PS4 games that I missed. I’ve also been lucky enough to snag a PS5 &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an Xbox Series X, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;which are fantastic machines for older games&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that I’m now spending even more time catching up on the last generation of gaming. And it’s all thanks to taking the leap on playing &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake. — Jay Peters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GXl4zA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oI39us"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="am2gnl"&gt;Pepper Cannon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GUklis"&gt;I moved into an apartment with a real person-sized kitchen at the beginning of the pandemic and found a renewed love for cooking. (I skipped the bread-baking trend.) That meant a lot of my favorite gadgets of the pandemic were things like my blender and my stand mixer. The gadget that really found the sweet spot between kitchen tool and super neat thing that scratches the gadget itch was the obscenely priced “pepper cannon” I kickstarted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9a6h5"&gt;I spent a lot of money on this “pepper cannon” that is designed to churn out more pepper with every turn. It is an expensive device, and its only job is to grind pepper, which means it is absolutely not worth the money. But the Pepper Cannon is so thoughtfully designed and good at its job that I don’t really mind I spent $150 months ago to back the Kickstarter. My eggs are perfectly speckled with pepper, and my steaks look gorgeously seasoned before they hit the grill. I used to have to pour peppercorns into a mortar to bulk grind them down to dust for rubs and soups, but now I can just give the pepper cannon a few turns and be done with it. &lt;em&gt;— Alex Cranz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jkisP4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Fta0u6"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TcZdIC"&gt;Ring Fit Adventure for Nintendo Switch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AIBbZc"&gt;Being instructed to stay at home made me feel less bad about not going to the gym, but there was a point in the pandemic where I really needed to get more exercise in my day. After playing hours of &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; on my couch, I realized the thing that was going to make me exercise was another video game: Nintendo’s &lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt; fitness RPG. In the game, you are performing a variety of exercise moves using a pilates ring and a leg strap both attached to the Switch’s Joy-Con controllers while you defeat monsters. This has made it fun and easy to get a good amount of exercise every day just by walking into my living room. Since I bought it, it has been a staple in my morning routine.  &lt;em&gt;—Andru Marino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gD6iIE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10273326"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CXlZax"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MXrPr9"&gt;Puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vFw8jq"&gt;My greatest comforts usually come in the form of tinkering and putting things together. I had grand plans to use pandemic time to finally repair some Super 8 film viewers that had been languishing in my family’s attic for years, but it’s now been many months of, “Maybe I’ll do that this weekend.” Instead, I’ve invested in things that scratch a similar itch: puzzles. I know puzzles, jigsaw or otherwise, can be divisive (several of my friends vocally hate them), but for me, there’s no better self-soothing activity than spending a few hours hunched over a bunch of pieces while I listen to podcasts or music. I will pester my spouse with announcements that I’m “in a puzzling mood” and need to be driven ASAP to the local puzzle store, where I can select a &lt;a href="https://www.mudpuppy.com/products/ocean-life-1000-piece-puzzle"&gt;sea creature jigsaw&lt;/a&gt; or a tiny model dinosaur skeleton that begs to be assembled and displayed on my shelf. I even splurged on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fnasa-space-shuttle-discovery-10283&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22434062%2Fgifts-covid-favorite-warcraft-knitting-ps5-nintendo-echo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lego Space Shuttle Discovery set&lt;/a&gt; and spent a full weekend achieving transcendence while aggravating my arthritis. — &lt;em&gt;Kait Sanchez&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AoHFy5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498907"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zig3Mv"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dcqt6m"&gt;Amazon Echo Show 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qlUu5y"&gt;Until the pandemic hit, I tried to visit my mother once a week or so. However, when lockdown hit, I realized that the visits would have to be put off indefinitely. So as soon as I could — in other words, as soon as I could visit briefly and with safeguards — I set her up with an Echo Show 8. This allowed me to do video calls with her more easily than having to direct her how to use Zoom (which may seem simple to us but is problematic for somebody who didn’t grow up with computers). It also lets her listen to music and get the weather just by asking for it, among other things. It made her life just a little easier, and it made me feel a lot more secure. &lt;em&gt;— Barbara Krasnoff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Surface Duo is down to $600 at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jKmlo0RRyTJeW5ZE8V_P-BW44lg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69291775/vpavic_4176_20200905_0061.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nS6yAp"&gt;This week brought some unexpected bargains by way of an eBay sitewide code that can knock up to $100 off a pricey purchase, such as a 4K TV, as well as an excellent Humble Bundle with 100 percent of proceeds going toward COVID-19 relief in India and Brazil. There are more, including a day-long sale on AT&amp;amp;T-locked Microsoft Surface Duo phones and more, so take a spin through this dispatch to see what we thought stood out from the rest in deals world this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="elQOar"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eoq8JU"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Duo is just $600 at Woot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Bzabl7"&gt;We featured a popular deal on the Surface Duo earlier this week, which had the foldable phone selling for $690. That was a great promotion, especially because it was for the version that worked on Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T. That deal is over now, but Woot is picking it back up and improving on the price. You can get the AT&amp;amp;T-locked version of the phone with &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13112648?sid=VergeWeekendDeal051521+&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fmicrosoft-surface-duo-dual-screen-lte-tablets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage for just $600&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB version costs $670. This is good news if you’re on AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aydBWI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10497909"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="7XS5Er"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9c9Eru"&gt;Get a fantastic 4K TV for up to $100 off at eBay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zCYsWF"&gt;Whether you primarily game or watch sports, movies, or TV shows, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"&gt;eBay is listing some really good televisions&lt;/a&gt;. Better yet, through Sunday, May 16th, you can get up to $100 off on eligible products when you use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;PICKSUMMER15&lt;/strong&gt;. The code actually knocks 15 percent off your purchase, but it caps the discount at $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3QADU"&gt;The TVs below are an even better value than usual because of this discount, so check them out if you’re in the market for an upgrade. Of course, this deal isn’t limited to TVs, so I suggest that you go to eBay and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fb%2FeBay-Coupons%2Fbn_7109765183%3F_trkparms%3D%2526clkid%253D1590810078023031888%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F15%2F22435896%2Fmicrosoft-surface-duo-foldable-android-phone-ebay-4k-tv-tcl-lg-samsung-oled-qled-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;see what else might appeal to you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KLvNFz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462612"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="8ue3MQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462552"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="7vRNst"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iGnpkC"&gt;Buy the second-generation Apple Pencil for $20 off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HkSd7c"&gt;If you own one of the iPad Pro or iPad Air models that has a USB-C port, the second-generation Apple Pencil should make for a good companion if you want to draw or write. At Woot, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13142085?sid=VergeDeals&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation-3%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_1_1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get one of these rarely discounted accessories for $110 new&lt;/a&gt;. Other retailers are selling it for $130. Compared to the first-gen Apple Pencil that recharged via its Lightning jack, this one attaches magnetically onto the side of supported iPads and charges wirelessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5drZrP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500002"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="IvfqMe"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RQ8jIj"&gt;Two 20W USB-C wall adapters cost just $14 at Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPDz0n"&gt;The items above are a bit pricey. If you’re looking for something that’s less expensive but very useful, check out this deal on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08PG1BJ5T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RavPower’s two-pack of 20W USB-C chargers that costs $13.60 before tax&lt;/a&gt;. We highlighted this deal earlier in the week (it was almost $2 cheaper then) because it’s what iPhone users should get instead of buying Apple’s equivalent gadget that costs $20. It’s for more than just iPhones, though. It’ll fast-charge many Android phones, and it should work great with charging the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8myGG5"&gt;To get this deal, make sure to click the “Save an extra 15% when you apply this coupon” prompt located underneath the product price at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ofskZp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10495834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="UmctV0"&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Hyper Light Drifter" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5hODvcXZrsjkOeWvWyv4Z-Yjw-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/3360787/420b35d90bc2dbc1ddc6209f1a71b731_large.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LyyPIp"&gt;Donate to COVID-19 relief, and get several great indie games, software, and more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6ol41e"&gt;The latest Humble Bundle package &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/humble-heal-covid-19-bundle?partner=VoxMedia"&gt;will turn your pledge&lt;/a&gt; for a smattering of indie games, software, and more into a donation to support COVID-19 relief in India and Brazil. Humble suggests at least a $25 pledge — and that’s very fair based on what you’re getting in exchange — but you can donate as much or as little as you can. To name a few games included, you’ll get &lt;em&gt;Into the Breach, Superhot, BioShock, The Witness, Undertale, Hyper Light Drifter&lt;/em&gt;, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
