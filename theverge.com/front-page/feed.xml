    <title>Tiny electronic fliers could float like seeds on the breeze to monitor the environment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v6X8nT_byOPqYoV6JEmYkf4PBIM=/0x301:633x723/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893082/Unknown_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection of microfliers imposed on top of their inspiration from nature: a propeller seed, used for dispersal by trees including maple, sycamore, and ash. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: F. Frankel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="60RWb6"&gt;When trees and plants disperse their seeds, they often rely on the wind to carry them to pastures new. Different seeds adopt different methods of flight: some glide through the air, others parachute to the ground, and some spin like helicopters on the breeze. For scientists, these aerodynamics have provided the inspiration for a new sort of airborne sensor — tiny fliers, some smaller than a grain of sand and others electronically equipped, that could, in the future, float into the atmosphere for tasks like environmental monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vxqqd4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microfliers could be dispersed by drone to monitor atmospheric data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P10yx8"&gt;These fliers, which range in size from around 40mm across (the largest) to 0.4mm across (the smallest), do not move under their own power. Instead, they’ve been designed to linger as long as possible in the air, sustained by their bio-inspired aerodynamic designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmeUT7"&gt;An international team of scientists led by engineers from Northwestern University developed their shape through physical prototyping and computer simulation. Their best result was a tiny flier that moves at a leisurely&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;maximum speed of 28 cm/sec when falling to the ground (a measure known as terminal velocity). Snowflakes, by comparison, fall at speeds of 250 cm/sec, while the seeds of the ant tree (&lt;em&gt;Triplaris cumingiana&lt;/em&gt;) float at rates of 75 cm/sec. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZzOlh"&gt;“It was surprising we could do better than seeds in terms of flight dynamics,” John Rogers, a professor of materials science and engineering at Northwestern University who led the development of the fliers, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. He noted that this was likely because nature has to optimize the design of seeds to balance many different considerations, while the scientists could focus on just a few: payload and flight times. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l5ktfH34O6CZMyakZxdrsHxeWuY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866716/Screen_Shot_2021_09_21_at_12.18.04_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Northwestern University&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some prototype fliers were equipped with battery-free electronics, like this unit, which has sensors to detect UV rays and a coil antenna to transmit data. It is approximately 40mm in length. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lyt4Mc"&gt;As described in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03847-y"&gt;paper published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week, it’s these payloads that set these fliers apart. Rogers and his team developed many different prototypes, including large units about 40mm in length, which are equipped with battery-free electronics to monitor solar light exposure. And smaller models, two millimeters across, were made from special materials that change color in response to environmental factors, like acidity or the presence of certain elements, such as lead or mercury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQb1wE"&gt;Their ability to collect data means these fliers could be used as environmental monitoring tools, says Rogers. He imagines that clouds of units could be dispersed via airplane or drone for tasks like monitoring chemical spills or atmospheric pollution. The fliers would collect data as they float to the ground or when they touch down. For the larger units, tiny antennas could send back information wirelessly to a home receiver, or, in the case of the color-changing fliers, aerial photography could be used to snap pictures of the fliers from above to collect the required data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Boh2d8"&gt;But despite Rogers’ ambitious vision for the fliers, there are many unanswered questions about practical, economical, and environmental aspects of the design. Núria Castell, a senior scientist who works on pollution monitoring techniques at the Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU), told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that collecting data in the way Rogers’ team envisions would limit the potential applications of this technology. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ddgwENDVbczeVJeQWWg3ka8WDpU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866720/Screen_Shot_2021_09_21_at_12.19.22_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Northwestern University&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The team fabricated hundreds of prototypes to test how different designs moved through the air. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RyiDLk"&gt;“I was thinking, do we really need this? How is this going to work?” says Castell. She notes that for her own research — measuring air pollution in cities — the fliers offered more problems than solutions. They are too small to carry sensitive equipment; they only collect data from relevant elevation levels for a brief time during their journey to the ground; and they would need to be dispersed again and again to capture data over longer time periods. These are all problems best solved using existing technology, says Castell. “How many of these [fliers] would you need to measure data for even just one week?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LovluW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fliers might be impractical for many environmental monitoring tasks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tnsYSJ"&gt;The engineering and physics research that has gone into designing the fliers is worthy of praise, says Castell. She adds that although they might not be practical for regular data collection, they might be extremely useful in emergency scenarios. “They could use it for biohazard accidents,” she says. “I’m talking about very serious events where you need an immediate response.” In such an event, a drone could quickly fly out and disperse the fliers over the affected area to gather a quick snapshot of the damage of the accident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ydlDWxOhZqJQXE808UsQUP1WKE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866719/Screen_Shot_2021_09_21_at_12.18.39_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Northwestern University&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fliers varied in size, with some, like this one pictured next to a common ant, approximately two millimeters across. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zMAiFD"&gt;Another potential issue with the fliers is that, as single-use items, they might generate waste. But Rogers says he and his team have been working to eliminate this by pairing the fliers with a new class of &lt;a href="https://bioelectronics.northwestern.edu/research/bioresorbable-electronics.html"&gt;dissolvable electronics&lt;/a&gt; that would minimize their environmental impact. “We considered that problem pretty deeply,” he says. “We have some demonstrations we’ll be publishing soon where all of the electronics just disappear and wash away in rainwater over a period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7s5oV"&gt;Ultimately, though, the fliers are still a preliminary design. The fabrication techniques are well developed, says Rogers, but the fliers themselves have only been tested in controlled environments — not in large-scale deployments in the wild. “It’s still early days,” he says. “But at the same time, we’ve thought pretty deeply about which ideas scale and which don’t, and we’ve focused on concepts that can be scaled and ideas that are practically relevant. We’ll be looking for partnerships to take the technology out of the lab.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why does Amazon make games?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rM1nX9ViZ0OUU2NrVdseVgzN24c=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893094/ss_59edc8f4cd2c13495538a3c96040cd133cab6555.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New World.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="va59uX"&gt;When Amazon makes a new movie or TV show, the reason is pretty clear: the tech giant needs to build out its streaming service Prime Video. One of the best ways to do that is to make (or buy) exclusive series and films. But when Amazon develops a new video game, the reasons aren’t so clear. The company’s upcoming MMO, &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, isn’t exclusive to Amazon’s Luna cloud service or Twitch (which Amazon also owns). It’s a regular PC game you can buy on Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWnsyK"&gt;But according to Amazon Games VP Christoph Hartmann, the reason is pretty simple: if you want to be involved in entertainment in any way, you can’t ignore games. “It’s almost impossible to imagine a world where you have a foot in entertainment without considering games,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ILkAC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; is far from Amazon’s first foray into gaming. The company has explored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/23/16189104/amazon-game-studios-breakaway-twitch-broadcasting"&gt;competitive games&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/10/7353099/amazon-game-studios-premium-mobile-games"&gt;premium mobile titles&lt;/a&gt; and made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/5/5384820/amazon-buys-video-game-studio-double-helix-games"&gt;some notable acquisitions&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these ventures have failed to gain traction, including the multiplayer shooter &lt;em&gt;Crucible&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;which was cancelled&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308638/amazon-game-studios-crucible-closed-beta-failure-relentless-studio"&gt;a rocky launch that saw it revert back to a closed beta&lt;/a&gt; before ending altogether. Even &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; has had a tough time, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285810/new-world-amazon-delay-august-2021-release-date"&gt;a handful of delays&lt;/a&gt; on the way to its upcoming launch on September 28th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hQvxPR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Making games is so much more complicated than it seems.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FqwlbJ"&gt;Hartmann, who joined Amazon in 2018 after two decades at Take-Two, says that he isn’t surprised it took the company so long to get going in games. “Just because you’re a great sprinter doesn’t make you a great mountain climber,” he says. “When you, as a company, or a human being, find one formula to be successful, you replicate it again. And we know that one size doesn’t fit all. At the beginning, they tried to replicate the formula which made Amazon great, but making games is so much more complicated than it seems.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tDstBcMREjj7aNsi7XWh0awGBbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22868249/ss_48edbca73ba970cfcb4798820068e8171bdeb6ac.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New World.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vpge3X"&gt;That rocky history also puts a lot of pressure on &lt;em&gt;New World.&lt;/em&gt; After years of trying, the MMO is poised to become Amazon’s first real hit; a closed beta saw more than 1 million players, and it was a fixture on Twitch over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kyMDxj"&gt;“It should be our breakthrough title for Amazon Games to put us on the map,” says Hartmann. “For me, there’s a lot of pride involved because we have been working very hard, and there hasn’t always been great press. I know it’s easy to say, ‘What’s the point in you making games?’ But there are a lot of people who really care about it. And hopefully, it’s the one we can rally around and take Amazon Games to the next level and make us more attractive for more people to join.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbeg62"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; is developed by Amazon’s Orange County studio, and the company also has teams in San Diego (led by John Smedley, best-known for his work on &lt;em&gt;EverQuest&lt;/em&gt;) and, more recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346484/amazon-games-montreal-studio-announced-rainbox-six-siege-developers"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; (led by Alexandre Parizeau, former managing director at Ubisoft Toronto). It’s not clear what either team is working on, though it’s safe to assume they will be large online worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUo85g"&gt;“My personal goal is to create 2-3 AAA, live-service games, which capture millions of players and stay in the market for 10+ years,” Hartmann says of Amazon’s gaming ambitions. The company is also dabbling in publishing partnerships with smaller teams; most recently, Amazon announced it would be working with Glowmade, a studio made of veterans from franchises like &lt;em&gt;Fable&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;LittleBigPlanet&lt;/em&gt;, on an unannounced project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xJxW3B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you have a great game, there are lots of options for what you can do.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s33Sa5"&gt;Despite the fact that Amazon also operates Luna and Twitch, the company isn’t currently making exclusives for either platform. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22663690/amazon-new-world-luna-cloud-gaming"&gt;Amazon has hinted that &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; may come to Luna in the future&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not a game designed to push people to the cloud service. “We keep them in mind, but I don’t want to build games around them,” Hartmann says. “We obviously want to include features that serve them well, but my experience is if you have a great game, there are lots of options for what you can do. So I put the great game first, and then, later on, we can figure out how we can support each other.” He adds that Amazon has offered the games teams a lot of freedom when it comes to deciding what to work on. “When it comes to all of the creative decisions, they stay completely out of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVMDJF"&gt;Which brings us back to the question of why Amazon is bothering with games in the first place. Luna exclusives may not be part of the roadmap, but for Hartmann, a far-off goal is to build a big new multimedia franchise — and he believes that can start with games, citing the success of the &lt;em&gt;Witcher &lt;/em&gt;as an example. (Though that franchise started as a series of novels, it reached global popularity through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/12/8586515/witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-ps4-xbox-one-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and, later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;a live-action Netflix series&lt;/a&gt;.) This is where being part of Amazon, with its various entertainment arms, could be an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOIj2n"&gt;“One day, I think the right opportunity will arise, and we will find somewhere where we can partner up with one of the other entertainment or creative groups in the company,” Hartmann says. “But it’s important that it’s right. It never works when it’s forced.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Live blog: Microsoft’s 2021 Surface event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TsaUEeeKr-3uJu-xaJ9V9-cmo9I=/100x0:1179x719/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893022/microsoft_surface_event_invite.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Surface Go, Surface Book, Surface Duo, Surface Pro X... a lot of Surfaces&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="0Tl5tI"&gt;Microsoft is set to announce a whole bunch of new Surface computers today. At an event starting at 11AM ET / 8AM PT, we are expecting to see a new Surface Pro 8, Surface Book, Surface Go, Surface Pro X, and even the Android-based Surface Duo. That’s a lot of devices for one livestream, so we’ll be live blogging with real-time analysis right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdDxfF"&gt;Details of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682271/surface-pro-8-120hz-display-thunderbolt-support-leak-rumors"&gt;Surface Pro 8 have already leaked&lt;/a&gt;, so we are confident we’ll see a new slate with an Intel 11th Gen processor, 120Hz display, and a switch to Thunderbolt ports — finally. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683595/microsoft-surface-duo-2-fcc-5g-nfc-wireless-charging-support-features"&gt;The Surface Duo has also been spotted&lt;/a&gt; with a big camera bump, so Microsoft may be addressing one of the biggest problems of the original — and may support some form of wireless charging, though it’s possible that’s simply to charge a Surface Pen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNigrR"&gt;And finally, the Surface Book may ditch the ability to detach its screen like a tablet, in favor of a new kind of hinge. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1439597666992893960"&gt;Leaked renders&lt;/a&gt; that our Microsoft reporter Tom Warren called “surprisingly close to the real thing” suggest an easel-style hinge that can tilt up to a variety of different angles, a bit like the design that Acer’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22430445/acer-conceptd-7-ezel-2021-review"&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691638/acer-predator-triton-900-review-price-specs-features"&gt;popularize&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/31/4380132/acer-aspire-r7-review"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1OEa6"&gt;Whether those rumors turn out to be true or not, we’ll cover the whole thing from start to finish. It promises to be a big kickoff for a season of computers designed to run Windows 11. Tune in below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m2W2Fd"&gt;&lt;div class="live-center-embed" data-src="https://livecenter.norkon.net/frame/voxmedia/16846/vox"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;(function(n){function c(t,i){n[e](h,function(n){var r,u;if(n&amp;&amp;(r=n[n.message?"message":"data"]+"",r&amp;&amp;r.substr&amp;&amp;r.substr(0,3)==="nc:")&amp;&amp;(u=r.split(":"),u[1]===i))switch(u[2]){case"h":t.style.height=u[3]+"px";return;case"scrolltotop":t.scrollIntoView();return}},!1)}for(var t,u,f,i,s,e=n.addEventListener?"addEventListener":"attachEvent",h=e==="attachEvent"?"onmessage":"message",o=n.document.querySelectorAll(".live-center-embed"),r=0;r&lt;o.length;r++)(t=o[r],t.getAttribute("data-rendered"))||(u=t.getAttribute("data-src"),u&amp;&amp;(t.setAttribute("data-rendered","true"),f=n.ncVizCounter||1e3,n.ncVizCounter=f+1,i=f+"",s="nc-frame-c-"+i,t.innerHTML='&lt;div style="position: relative; height: 300px; border: none;" id="'+s+'"&gt;&lt;iframe src="'+u+"?"+i+'" style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;',c(t.firstChild,i)))})(window);&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OLdMBs"&gt;Watch Microsoft’s stream of the event here:&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p id="9jxnEY"&gt;Tim Cook sent an email to Apple employees Tuesday evening about an all-hands meeting that leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last week. He said the company is doing “everything in our power to identify those who leaked” and noted that “people who leak confidential information do not belong” at Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyp52w"&gt;On September 17th, Tim Cook announced during an internal company-wide meeting that Apple would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679772/apple-vaccine-policy-covid-19-testing-unvaccinated"&gt;requiring frequent testing for unvaccinated employees&lt;/a&gt; — but was stopping short of a vaccine mandate. He also said that he was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679724/tim-cook-epic-apple-antitrust-ruling-employee-meeting"&gt;“looking forward to moving forward”&lt;/a&gt; after the Epic v. Apple antitrust case. Shortly after the meeting, both pieces of news leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyulCs"&gt;Now, Cook is tying the news to product leaks — which the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22601564/apple-leak-phone-cases-cease-and-desist-trade-secrets"&gt;historically gone to great lengths to track down&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL0ZSS"&gt;Read the full transcription of Cook’s email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ouaDaK"&gt;Dear Team,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKTVeL"&gt;It was great to connect with you at the global employee meeting on Friday. There was much to celebrate, from our remarkable new product line-up to our values driven work around climate change, racial equity, and privacy. It was a good opportunity to reflect on our many accomplishments and to have a discussion about what’s been on your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dH1oP9"&gt;I’m writing today because I’ve heard from so many of you were were incredibly frustrated to see the contents of the meeting leak to reporters. This comes after a product launch in which most of the details of our announcements were also leaked to the press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4hDqzA"&gt;I want you to know that I share your frustration. These opportunities to connect as a team are really important. But they only work if we can trust that the content will stay within Apple. I want to reassure you that we are doing everything in our power to identify those who leaked. As you know, we do not tolerate disclosures of confidential information, whether it’s product IP or the details of a confidential meeting. We know that the leakers constitute a small number of people. We also know that people who leak confidential information do not belong here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZuzat"&gt;As we look forward, I want to thank you for all you’ve done to make our products a reality and all you will do to get them into customers’ hands. Yesterday we released iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and watchOS 8, and Friday marks the moment when we share some of our incredible new products with the world. There’s nothing better than that. We’ll continue to measure our contributions in the lives we change, the connections we foster, and the work we do to leave the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYdPUg"&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVUzUt"&gt;Tim&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Guardians of the Galaxy is part action RPG, part dysfunctional family simulator</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3k6oxZjnSh9xfHaUFrUpUNz5ntg=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892958/MGG_2021_09_22_SCR_13_NOLOGO.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lBgaZG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22519348/guardians-of-the-galaxy-game-square-enix-eidos-montreal-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Square Enix’s latest attempt at adapting a Marvel franchise into a successful video game, is best described as — and I mean this as a glowing compliment — a Dysfunctional Family Management Sim. As Peter Quill, your job is to motivate, reassure, comfort, and lead your merry band of found-family misfits through dialogue choices designed to profoundly impact gameplay and story. I had the opportunity to play a full chapter of the game ahead of its release, and I gotta say, I’m impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YUYhj"&gt;It is, however, fair to say that my enthusiasm for what I’ve seen of &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; so far is because I kept my expectations in check. There have been excellent Marvel games in the past — one need only look over yonder to what Insomniac has done with &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; and will probably do with &lt;em&gt;Wolverine&lt;/em&gt;. But Square Enix’s specific track record with the Marvel franchise has been underwhelming. Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; had an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21422708/marvel-avengers-review-single-player-campaign-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;excellent single-player campaign&lt;/a&gt;, but it was largely overshadowed by a repetitive loot grind, lack of significant endgame content (heh), and a performance plagued by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545477/marvels-avengers-bug-ip-address-on-screen-square-enix"&gt;nasty bugs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojXmog"&gt;People have a right to be skeptical, but what I’ve seen of &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; makes me think things will be different. It’s as though Square Enix and developer Eidos-Montréal took what was best about &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; and spun that out into its own game. It’s a choice-driven, story-focused game that can at times feel more like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338970/guardians-of-the-galaxy-telltale-game-episode-one-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Telltale Guardians game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than a Square Enix action RPG. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jbzeea7tjWFLj-UNOu_BZKF5-aE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869624/guardians.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QqXxB9"&gt;The demo started on the Milano, the Guardians’ ship, and I was given free rein to walk about having casual conversations with Gamora, Groot, Drax, and Rocket. As you speak to them, you’re presented with dialogue choices and a timer, ala Telltale’s &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;. These choices grant you different bits of your friends’ history and the chance to develop a connection with the people you’ll be entrusting your life to later in combat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l48AcO"&gt;Player choice in action games can sometimes feel a bit shallow, especially when the consequences end up being, at best, a slightly different bit of dialogue. &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; does a decent job of making it feel like your choices mean something. Your decisions as Star-Lord can mean the difference between fighting a horde of mind-controlled enemies or escaping unseen and unheard without a scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfsluw"&gt;Both Mary DeMarle, senior narrative director, and Patrick Fortier, senior gameplay director, emphasized the importance of choice in &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; and the extent to which it impacts the game. “Some of the choices that you make will ultimately determine at the end of the game the secret weapons and people who you might have in your arsenal as you’re going up against the Big Bad,” DeMarle says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K282AZ"&gt;Fighting in &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; is typical action RPG fare. Playing as Star-Lord, you zip around the battlefield in your rocket boots as you shoot up enemies with elemental bullets. Skill points unlock powerful moves that increase your combo meter and, thereby, the rewards you get at the end of a fight. Your companions are controlled by AI to fight as they please, but you, as the leader, can command them to execute special moves when you need some heavier hitting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYHOyd"&gt;Though the combat in &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; isn’t particularly revolutionary, I found myself chuckling aloud at times, amused by the combos I was able to pull off. You can direct your Guardians to take advantage of environmental hazards. I got a big kick out of commanding Gamora to cut down a piece of construction to squish a particularly troublesome enemy after I had frozen him in place with my ice bullets. In combat, there are lots of opportunities to create those kinds of unique one-two punches, and they enhance the idea that the Guardians can be a functional, loving, kick-ass family when they stop bickering and get their shit together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F4_LPGGAhqCQKl4yssWUnskEPVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869637/guardians2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4tItUx"&gt;Choice in &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; not only affects how you experience the game and the success of combat but how your companions react to you as well. A cold word said or deed done to Rocket in an earlier chapter influences whether or not he wants to cooperate with you later in the game. There’s a moment in the demo in which Rocket stubbornly refuses to hack a lock because he was pissed off that I didn’t take his side in a disagreement. It made me choose Rocket-friendly options going forward, to both soothe his hurt feelings and to get him to do his job. It’s a nice change of pace that an AI companion had a story reason to ignore me rather than a mechanical one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71b3yy"&gt;I love when characters adapt and respond to the way you treat them. That kind of cause and effect storytelling is well-suited to the highly temperamental personalities that make up the Guardians. It takes these characters from one-dimensional combat helper-bots to fully actualized companions. I had my doubts about &lt;em&gt;Guardians,&lt;/em&gt; and those doubts largely disappeared in the short time I spent with this game. Knowing there’s a full game on the horizon, I’m excited to see more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2C6hL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dv1o7f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The imaginary rocket driving a small-town spaceport</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cumberland Island National Seashore, Georgia" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a3KZWpseoL3-BMbU914nSwGL71Y=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892681/578022564.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Is the FAA licensing spaceports that are doomed to fail?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="YGwrnt"&gt;The latest launch attempt out of Kodiak, Alaska’s spaceport shows in vivid detail just how quickly things can go sideways.  In the video, rocket maker Astra’s 3.3 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdohwm8Quc&amp;amp;t=80s"&gt;skids &lt;/a&gt;horizontally for hundreds of yards, then shoots some 20 miles upwards, listing off course. Ground crew terminates the flight, and the craft free falls back to Earth in pieces, landing in a fireball. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="Zc1iil"&gt;None of Astra’s six test flights from Kodiak’s Pacific Spaceport Complex have made it into orbit, and five have exploded. But, as Jeff Bezos says, failure and innovation are inseparable twins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1niN2z"&gt;Analysts expect the commercial space industry to be worth &lt;a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space"&gt;$1 trillion&lt;/a&gt; by 2040, and increasingly, &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/08/08/michigan-spaceport-marquette-aerospace-manufacturers-association-wurtsmith-oscoda-airport/3323976001/"&gt;small&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2021/02/13/news/aroostook/historic-rocket-launch-makes-maine-a-viable-spaceport-location/"&gt;towns&lt;/a&gt; are angling to get in on the action. One such community is Camden County, Georgia, where a group of county commissioners is longing for their own spaceport — and the economic growth and diversification they hope will come with it. There’s one caveat: Spaceport Camden’s sole proposed launch trajectory would, in an unprecedented move, cross &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/21/style/space-race-cumberland-island-georgia.html"&gt;two populated islands&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a federally protected marshland and wilderness, just a few miles from the toxic brownfield set to become the launch site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSh1bV"&gt;To some residents, this seems like an astronomically bad idea. But failures — even explosive ones — don’t faze Camden County: according to spaceport planners, Astra is a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/SpaceportCamden/posts/2921889351419214"&gt;prime launch tenant candidate&lt;/a&gt;, and Alaska Aerospace Corporation, which runs Kodiak’s spaceport, could become an &lt;a href="https://akaerospace.com/news/alaska-aerospace-corporation-and-camden-county-sign-mou/"&gt;operation partner&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0f8f3"&gt;All they need to get this plan off the ground is an operation license from the Federal Aviation Administration. And to secure that, they aren’t basing their proposal on rockets like the one that blew up in Alaska — instead, they’re using models of rockets that don’t exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ftW7Y6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lofty Ambitions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="8nHIVn"&gt;In the FAA’s nearly 40 years of commercial rocket oversight, the agency has never permitted anyone to launch vertical rockets directly over populated areas closer than 500 miles away. (The US once launched a rocket over Cuba in the 1960s; debris landed in a field there, 511 miles from the launch pad, and apparently killed a cow, spurring anti-American protests in Havana.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="IMYwDE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The county has spent more than $10 million to secure an FAA license&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e3HBKZ"&gt;Unfortunately, this unprecedented move is critical to Camden County’s plan, leaving some people worried about &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wanzong/status/1433637810943135749"&gt;falling debris&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.wabe.org/warnock-urges-faa-not-to-cut-corners-on-spaceport-review/"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; igniting the flammable palmetto and oak forests that coat the archipelago in the flight path.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edizga"&gt;But the county’s spaceport steering committee is so confident that it can break the mold, it has spent &lt;a href="https://www.spaceportfacts.org/money-spent"&gt;more than $10 million&lt;/a&gt; in the past nine years to help secure this FAA license. According to emails obtained through open-records requests, this spend has gone to consultants, lobbyists, and some creative publicity efforts, like facilitating the placement of &lt;a href="https://www.savannahnow.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/25/us-rep-buddy-carter-tried-to-speed-review-of-spaceport-with-amendment/114873454/"&gt;a June 2020 op-ed&lt;/a&gt; designed to compel then-president Trump to pressure the FAA into a faster decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZK6Fwr"&gt;It didn’t work; the FAA has yet to issue their verdict. Their record of decision is &lt;a href="https://www.permits.performance.gov/permitting-projects/spaceport-camden-proposed-launch-site-environmental-impact-statement"&gt;slated for this month&lt;/a&gt; — the last regulatory step that comes before the licensing determination. Everything hinges on whether or not operating a spaceport out of Camden’s county seat of Woodbine, population 1,400, could launch, according to the FAA, “at least one type of launch vehicle” safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMyPVS"&gt;Together, county and federal agency officials have put together an &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/space/environmental/nepa_docs/camden_eis/"&gt;Environmental Impact Statement&lt;/a&gt; that lays out the evidence: a master document filled with the results of risk analyses based on rocket size, thrust, weight, trajectory, behavior, failure rate and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeqCm9"&gt;Published in June, this document does not look at the Astra rockets officials say they may one day launch — the ones that routinely crash. Rather, to prove safety, they bring in data from a much more reliable rocket, a “hypothetical” one that has yet to be invented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8ZKJkd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That is exactly the sort of catastrophic failure that can happen over our coast”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ObvPqL"&gt;Present-day rockets are too heavy, so the officials made their hypothetical rocket much lighter. They don’t gain altitude quickly enough, so the officials devised a first-of-its-kind “lofted trajectory.” If something goes wrong on a small-lift vehicle launch today, humans on the ground analyze data before terminating the flight, which could take several seconds. Camden’s proposed rocket has a sleek automated flight termination system that works in fractions of a second instead. And today’s small-lift vehicles — this class of small, uncrewed utilitarian rockets like Astra’s — are too big to be safe in this scenario, so the officials envision something almost half the size of the smallest rocket currently being developed, much less deployed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzjCIi"&gt;A tested and proven craft with these characteristics is nowhere on the horizon. While companies were “&lt;a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-09-03/why-private-companies-are-racing-build-small-rockets"&gt;racing&lt;/a&gt;” to build small rockets as of 2016, early in Camden County’s application process, today, the business case for super-small rockets is &lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-11-small-rockets.html"&gt;debated&lt;/a&gt;, and companies who have been most successful in this niche to date are pivoting to bigger craft &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/rocket-lab-not-yet-close-to-profitability-proxy-statement-reveals/"&gt;in search of profitability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFzkJh"&gt;But spaceport critics like Steve Weinkle, a retired head of design engineering who lives a few miles from the proposed launch site, argue a hypothetical rocket isn’t useful when it comes to calculating actual risk. Kodiak, he says, is what’s real, and the launch history there should be a wake-up call for the county. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uTsWD7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FAA says it accounts for “a non-zero probability of failure”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R7TSAT"&gt;“That is exactly the sort of catastrophic failure that can happen over our coast, Cumberland Island, and near Kings Bay [the county’s naval base, where large ordnance is stored],” Weinkle wrote on his &lt;a href="https://www.spaceportfacts.org/"&gt;spaceport watchdog blog&lt;/a&gt;, pointing to Astra’s dramatic Kodiak crash. “Yet, for some unknown reason, the FAA tells us that we have nothing to worry about since their calculations assume that everything on their ‘representative rocket’ will work perfectly.” ​​ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="LA6gd4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessing the impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="OT7VVr"&gt;In Spaceport Camden’s EIS, the FAA declines to put numbers to the possibility of failure on the basis that the potential for “adverse impacts associated with launch failures” is “not planned” and would be “unlikely.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNxCwZ"&gt;The executive director of the agency’s Office of Operational Safety, Daniel Murray, leaned hard on this optimism in an August letter responding to concerns about damage to cultural resources. “There is no anticipation of any fire or damage during a nominal launch,” Murray assured Georgia’s Advisory Council on Historic Preservation — with a footnote specifying that “nominal” refers to a launch where all aspects of the flight go “as expected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rzymyB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“irresponsible, at best”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BlDphx"&gt;A spokesperson for the FAA clarified in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the agency has never said the hypothetical rocket will “work perfectly” and that their risk analyses did account for “a non-zero probability of failure (i.e., there could or would be a failure).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6eFNU"&gt;But after tracking the frequent catastrophic failures among launches that are happening, Weinkle said it’s “irresponsible, at best” to issue a license declaring the site safe for a spaceport “when your measure of safety is that you don’t plan on anything going wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="StAtQ3"&gt;The county and its consultants argue that to keep up with a rapidly changing industry, innovators need to be constantly looking ahead. It would be impossible to prove safety looking just at the current landscape: more than 100 companies are trying to design the next small-lift success, 10 are in development, and of those, only one — Rocket Lab’s Electron — has ever even made it into orbit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="X7noaA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Officials acknowledged the risk in internal FAA emails&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A3imQA"&gt;Electron was a major source of inspiration for Camden County planners, cited by name in the EIS. But while it may be the safest rocket of its kind, when asked if it might be safe enough to launch over a populated area, its maker, Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck, said he wouldn’t try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HiN6dP"&gt;“We have a very deep commitment to public safety here, so we certainly would not ever endanger the public in that way. It’s just — not cool,” Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck said of launching over people just 50 miles into the rocket’s flight path. “But, I mean, there’s just no way that the FAA would agree to that. I just can’t imagine how that would ever happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nhnu0R"&gt;Internal emails show the agency was hesitant, too. Officials acknowledged back in 2017 that the risk to people on the islands in the proposed flight path was “&lt;a href="https://www.wabe.org/faa-struggled-to-get-safety-info-on-camden-spaceport-for-years-emails-show/"&gt;a problem from the very beginning&lt;/a&gt;.” Writing internally, even Murray himself expressed concerns. “I’m not sure a small vehicle is safe enough,” he wrote in an internal FAA email. “I think they need to speak to why they are not assuming an explosive impact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1bljs"&gt;According to Ramon Lugo, the director of the Florida Space Institute at the University of Central Florida who has worked with NASA since 1975, that won’t necessarily pose an obstacle to securing an operation license for the spaceport itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="nrNZAJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“My guess is... there aren’t going to be a lot of rockets lined up to launch from Spaceport Camden.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pJqZBt"&gt;“The FAA Commercial Space Transportation Office’s mission is not to deny licenses,” Lugo said, noting the agency’s “dual mandate” to both regulate and foster the industry. “Their mission is to try to find a way to make it work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0siGJ"&gt;And just because a spaceport site has an operation license doesn’t guarantee future operators will be successful in securing launch licenses, Lugo added. That is a separate process altogether — and a more rigorous one that requires verifiable data from existing rockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uyiy7"&gt;The FAA has granted just 413 of these in 40 years of launching commercial satellite payloads into orbit. If that hurdle is overcome for Spaceport Camden, a launch operator would theoretically need to have a vehicle as safe as the rocket as the project’s EIS suggests. And then, they’d have to insure the flight — a daunting proposition considering the unusual launch trajectory, Lugo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ixZFp"&gt;“My guess is when that part comes to pass, there aren’t going to be a lot of rockets lined up to launch from Spaceport Camden,” he said. (Astra did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IT6Nbk"&gt;Still, it’s surprisingly common for commercial spaceports to lie unused after approval. Commercial projects in &lt;a href="https://okcfox.com/news/fox-25-investigates/twenty-years-in-was-oklahomas-space-investment-worth-it"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/04/24/adams-county-space-port-japanese-pd/"&gt;Colorado,&lt;/a&gt; Texas, and elsewhere have secured their operation licenses years ago and are still waiting for their first launch and the economic windfall that is supposed to come with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="4vpg9h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spaceports That Don’t Take Off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="3Y0UED"&gt;Stacy Studebaker, a retired schoolteacher who has lived on Kodiak Island for 30 years, remembers the song and dance about economic development: “The people who started it came in and said, ‘We’re going to turn these fishermen into rocket scientists,’ and ‘We’re going to have college classes,’ and they had astronauts come into town, and had big meetings with the public saying, ‘Oh, this is going to be the greatest thing for the Kodiak economy,’” she recalled of the spaceport’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/washington/12missile.html"&gt;scandal-ridden&lt;/a&gt; establishment in 1998. “It’s proved to be pretty much smoke and mirrors.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJGRa7"&gt;Even if it didn’t yield the economic boom some hoped for, it’s a relative success story. After 20 years of government-funded launches, Kodiak has hosted six commercial launch attempts since 2018, while &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/spacex-georgia-business-science-c3055985c2526fb7670e363fc64d71ad"&gt;more than half&lt;/a&gt; of the dozen commercial spaceports in the US have hosted none at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="iINYSF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Is this really the right thing for a county like Camden?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sGwvD5"&gt;In Midland, Texas, public officials secured their own spaceport operations license in &lt;a href="https://www.mrt.com/business/article/FAA-approves-spaceport-license-for-Midland-7415553.php"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;. Their application also revolved around a representative rocket: a Branson-style experimental space-plane called the Lynx Mark I, under development by a company called XCOR. But, the rocket was never built, and XCOR went bankrupt in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFKTkr"&gt;In the meantime, Midland spent about $20 million on the venture. That amount included “$10 million in recruitment for a company that’s nowhere to be found,” Midland Councilman Spencer Robnett &lt;a href="https://midlandtx.swagit.com/play/10152019-2094"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; at a 2019 city council meeting. Robnett called the project a “waste of taxpayer dollars” and entreated colleagues to “take a hard look” at the return-on-investment so far, compared to the oil and gas economy, which has bounced back in recent years, boosting the local economy, while the spaceport has drained it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQSjjE"&gt;“We don’t need... spaceport jobs. We need houses. We need roads. We need infrastructure; we need police officers and firefighters and all those things,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGNTQ0"&gt;XCOR may be “nowhere to be found,” but its former CCO and CEO, Andrew Nelson, is now on the Spaceport Camden team, helping to guide the application process. So far, he’s received more than $1 million in consulting fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3QFtW"&gt;In mid-August, a city councilman in Camden County’s other town — St. Marys — called &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ConcernedAboutSpaceportCamden/posts/1904006773092666"&gt;for a grand jury investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Spaceport Camden’s finances.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ny7J4p"&gt;Meanwhile, owners of 91 out of the 100 residential lots on Little Cumberland Island — one of the islands in the flight path — have signed letters to the FAA asking the agency not to approve the spaceport. The National Park Service and Department of the Interior have expressed serious concerns about the plan’s safety. Leaders of more than a dozen regional environmental advocacy organizations had signed a letter to voice concern about the “dangerous precedent that the FAA’s mishandled review could set,” and Senator Raphael Warnock requested in a letter that the agency not “cut corners” on assessing social and environmental impacts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFTmOP"&gt;For these parties, the best-case scenario is that the FAA denies Woodbine a site license. But surveilling the landscape, Lugo doesn’t see that as a win either: if the site is licensed, the county will continue to spend “millions annually” on spaceport infrastructure and maintenance in a gamble with no certain payoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sP1Zte"&gt;“Is this really the right thing for a county like Camden, which is not the wealthiest county?” he asked. “If I’m a taxpayer in Camden County, [I’ve] basically enabled people that have a ‘field of dreams’ vision of a launch site. What will be the opportunities lost because of that?”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s behemoth CRG9 gaming monitor is $200 off right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d9_2BW9jWXLo_myoPgCz8PrlXRA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892555/crg9monitor.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="knWbBo"&gt;The 49-inch Samsung CRG9 is a stunning gaming monitor. Boasting an immersive 1800R curvature, it’s capable of more deeply immersing you in whatever it is you’re doing, gaming or otherwise. As you can imagine, however, its price is usually just as jaw-dropping as its size. Today, however, it’s a little less so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGZthn"&gt;Right now, you can get the best bang for your buck with a gaming monitor that does the work of three. Instead of $1,100, the 49-inch Samsung CRG9 is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L9HCJ2V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently $900 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, matching the monitor’s lowest price to date. As one of the most immersive monitors on the market, it offers a curved screen with a 32:9 aspect ratio, as well as bright 1,000 nit HDR, and low input lag. The 1440p monitor also supports AMD FreeSync 2, in addition to having a high 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="STZ5ld"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9690066"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cy1qnb"&gt;If you picked up a PlayStation 5 and are currently looking to increase your console’s storage capacity, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GLX7TNT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 980 Pro SSD&lt;/a&gt; is currently sitting at its best price to date on Amazon. Normally $230, the 1TB NVMe model is now available for $180, more than 20 percent off the list price. One of the few drives that meets (and exceeds) Sony’s requirements for speed, it’s also one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives"&gt;our picks for the best M.2 SSDs for the PS5&lt;/a&gt;. Note, however, that you will have to purchase a compatible heatsink alongside it and install it yourself. Samsung plans on releasing a model with a built-in heatsink later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JL3WjW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use the PS5’s M.2 SSD expandable storage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="RksEKt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nktw3Y"&gt;Not a gamer? Fret not: we also found plenty of non-gaming deals you might be interested in today. Right now, for instance, you can pair up your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;soon-to-be-released iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; with the latest Apple Pencil, which is currently available for one of its best prices to date. Through September 29th, or while supplies last, &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13140759?sid=TheVergeDailyDeals092121&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation-6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot is selling the second-generation stylus&lt;/a&gt; to Amazon Prime members for $110 instead of $125 — $10 shy of its all-time low at Amazon. Unlike its predecessor, which awkwardly charges via the Lightning port, the newest Apple Pencil can wirelessly charge while magnetically docked to the side of the latest iPad Pro, iPad Mini, or iPad Air. Note, however, it doesn’t work with the forthcoming, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;entry-level iPad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EMflJ4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10764401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6fYMHu"&gt;If you’re in the market for an affordable laptop that excels at the basics, the lower-specced configuration that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;my colleague Monica Chin highly recommends&lt;/a&gt; is down $200 at Best Buy. Regularly $529, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfC92IuJuRS#dotnolink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;retailer is temporarily selling&lt;/a&gt; the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 with 4GB RAM, a 64GB SSD, and Intel 10th Gen Core i3 for $330. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8an7jB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730313"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ri7GO3"&gt;Also at Best Buy, you can get a huge discount on this hefty gaming laptop from Asus. Normally $1,000, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDtypFX0dY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TUF Gaming laptop is a great value for $800&lt;/a&gt;. It has a 17.3-inch display that’s capable of a 144Hz refresh rate, and it has Intel’s 11th Gen Core i5-11260H processor, 8GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and most notably, Nvidia’s RTX 3050 Ti graphics chip. So long as you don’t mind the fact that this isn’t a very portable machine, you’re in for a bargain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="np3afE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10767005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DXyIEn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BsWwtp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction 10:20AM, 09/22/2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article originally stated that the Samsung monitor deal was for the Odyssey G9, but it was for the CRG9. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood’s crypto wallets are finally ready for a test run</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eIFBT1mI1r6emvEnH3MVwqyNQzs=/117x0:1383x844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892472/1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xDtyFN"&gt;Robinhood is &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/9/22/crypto-wallets-are-coming-to-robinhood"&gt;finally adding cryptocurrency wallets to its platform&lt;/a&gt; so that users can spend and trade their Bitcoin and Ethereum. The wallets will start as a test, and the company’s setting up a waitlist where people can sign up to be among the first to get access. However, this doesn’t mean that you can use Robinhood to buy stocks with Bitcoin. If you don’t mind the extra steps, the company says you can sell crypto for another currency and use that money to buy stocks. Still, it represents a big step in the company’s crypto journey, one that some of its users have been asking it to take for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CX86yM"&gt;Robinhood says it’ll start testing wallets with an “alpha” group in the next few weeks. Speaking to Robinhood’s crypto lead Christine Brown, she says the company will take the alpha users’ feedback and address it publicly (meaning on Twitter and its blog). She says people on the waitlist will start getting access to wallets by the end of 2021 and that Robinhood’s crypto wallets will be generally available in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q23CI2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’ll have to join a waitlist if you want to be one of the first to store your crypto with Robinhood&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JvOqL5"&gt;Wallets have been a popular request from community members who feel like buying cryptocurrencies on Robinhood doesn’t really let them &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; crypto (for example, you currently can’t use your Ethereum holdings in the app to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;buy an NFT&lt;/a&gt;). While &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undefined/comments/mz86sx/comment/gw2jyps/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Robinhood has said&lt;/a&gt; that buying one Bitcoin on its platform means that the company goes and buys one Bitcoin, then stores it in a wallet, some users argue that not being able to use it themselves defeats the purpose. Storing crypto in a wallet that the user can access allows users to transfer or spend the coins without converting them into another currency first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIUTAF"&gt;Robinhood’s wallet will initially only support holding the coins Robinhood Crypto supports, covering major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and (yes, I’m counting it) Dogecoin. Brown tells me the company is looking to expand the currencies available on its platform in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NV5LHS"&gt;In August, the company’s CEO &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/78903/robinhood-crypot-wallet"&gt;promised that wallets would be coming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-2021-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf"&gt;said that the company wanted&lt;/a&gt; its security to be “bulletproof.” Robinhood now says that wallets will have identity verification and multifactor authentication (which will sometimes include asking for a picture of your ID or a selfie to ensure that it’s actually you trying to carry out a transaction), as well as email and phone verification. The company is trying to walk a line, though, between security and customer experience. At this point, stories about people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227535/nyt-bitcoin-millions-forgot-passwords-digital-wallet"&gt;losing millions of dollars because they forgot their wallet’s password&lt;/a&gt; are well known, and Robinhood doesn’t want to show up in similar headlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ry48Ok"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood manages your wallet for you, rather than giving you direct control over its keys&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NWnTbb"&gt;The concerns about security versus user experience were part of the reason why Robinhood decided to make its wallets &lt;a href="https://phemex.com/academy/custodial-wallets-vs-non-custodial-wallets"&gt;custodial&lt;/a&gt;, Brown tells me. The company will be responsible for the keys used to unlock your wallet instead of managing it yourself. It means giving up some level of control (which you’re entrusting to Robinhood), but it also takes away a lot of responsibility. However, Robinhood says that you’ll be able to move crypto purchased on the platform into other wallets if you so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsE5WU"&gt;If you’ve been pining for wallets, you’ll want to get in line using Robinhood’s waitlist. The plan is to let “super eager” people earn a jump in line if they refer Robinhood to a friend. For example, if you’re number 1,000 on the waitlist, you can become number 500 if a friend signs up (and number 250 if you convince another friend). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gOI1qM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wallets make Robinhood’s cryptocurrencies more currency-like&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cgJ65D"&gt;Brown says she hopes Robinhood introducing wallets will open the door for many people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft"&gt;using the blockchain&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Until now, it seems like Robinhood has treated cryptocurrency mostly like a stock. With wallets, it’s starting to treat it like a currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLmilg"&gt;In addition to wallets, Robinhood also says that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663251/robinhood-cryptocurrency-recurring-investment-dollar-cost-averaging-bitcoin-ethereum"&gt;recurring crypto investments it announced earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; are now available to all its users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford will recycle its EV batteries with ex-Tesla exec’s startup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mTZ0-uW-KEmghC7TrfU-rl6X_D0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892377/sokane_210125_4386_1789_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="in0zAd"&gt;Ford has tapped startup Redwood Materials — run by former Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel — to handle the recycling of its electric vehicle batteries. The two companies also plan to use this new partnership to help build out the battery supply chain in the United States, which is something that the Biden administration has stressed as a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0snfdt"&gt;As part of the deal, Ford is investing $50 million into Redwood Materials, which Straubel said is part of the startup’s &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/"&gt;recently announced $700 million funding round&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcqPEh"&gt;This is not the first customer Redwood Materials has lined up — Straubel’s startup already recycles batteries from Nissan, Specialized (which has an increasing number of e-bike batteries), and scrap from Tesla and Panasonic at the original Gigafactory in Reno, Nevada. (Redwood Materials is headquartered just south of the factory in Carson City.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="527YXv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford invested $50 million in the startup, which just raised $700 million&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pzLrLB"&gt;But with Ford, Redwood Materials is looking to be more deeply integrated than just a recycling partner. Straubel’s startup is working with the Detroit automaker to figure out plans for everything from helping to process scrap material, to finding new life for worn-down batteries with ample capacity remaining, to helping Ford create new batteries out of salvaged lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPA1j2"&gt;The companies were light on specifics, but the overarching goal is one that Straubel has talked about frequently since founding Redwood Materials. The idea is to create a “circular” or “closed loop” system where the stuff that makes up lithium-ion batteries gets recycled and reused, which could theoretically drive down the cost of an EV’s battery while reducing the automaker’s reliance on imported materials and (one day) mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uYNeCk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ford teams up with South Korea’s SK Innovation to build EV batteries in the US","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445688/ford-sk-innovation-ev-battery-production-joint-venture"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uDFeC1"&gt;The deal with Ford could provide a lot of opportunity for Redwood Materials to work all that out. Like many of its competitors, Ford is now deeply committed to electric vehicles. It released the Mustang Mach-E earlier this year and has an all-electric version of its F-150 coming in 2022, and those are just the first two flagships of an impending fleet of EVs coming from the automaker in the next decade. As part of that push, Ford is also planning to build batteries with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445688/ford-sk-innovation-ev-battery-production-joint-venture"&gt;South Korea’s SK Innovation in the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYF4pn"&gt;Ford’s not alone, though. General Motors — which is also in the midst of a massive push into electric vehicles — recently &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/gm-and-lg-chems-ultium-cells-partners-with-li-cycle-to-process-manufacturing-waste/"&gt;tapped Canadian company Li-Cycle&lt;/a&gt; to recycle the scrap waste from the batteries it’s going to make with SK Innovation’s rival, LG Chem.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="9QUJke"&gt;Rad Power Bikes’ electric commuting bike, the RadCity, is getting a serious makeover. The Seattle-based company has completely redesigned the bike’s powertrain, including a semi-integrated battery, and made a number of other upgrades to make riding easier, faster, and more intuitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRiSDS"&gt;The RadCity 5 Plus is the second bike in Rad Power Bikes’ lineup to receive many of these design updates, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22583925/radrover-rad-power-bikes-integrated-battery-price"&gt;the flagship RadRover fat-tire bike&lt;/a&gt;. It shows how Rad Power Bikes is evolving as it settles into its position as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266143/rad-power-bikes-investment-electric-ebike"&gt;the number one e-bike manufacturer in North America&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GOH9k5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new RadCity will climb hills 40 percent faster&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="03jPyf"&gt;Rad Power Bikes says the new RadCity will climb hills 40 percent faster than the previous generation. The bike’s range has also been improved by 11 percent, thanks to custom-made tires that operate more efficiently on paved roads. But the range estimate is &lt;a href="https://electricbikereview.com/rad-power-bikes/radcity/"&gt;the same as the fourth-generation version of the bike&lt;/a&gt;, where, depending on your level of assist, Rad says you’ll get between 28–50 miles of range. And the stopping power has been improved with the inclusion of hydraulic disc brakes with long-lasting ceramic pads. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qlsEiLA0Pek4gpEp7Jhz04d0ohk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867691/ahawkins_210914_4767_0010.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dr2oYw"&gt;Last week, I got a chance to test out the new RadCity with Redwood Stephens, chief product officer at Rad Power Bikes. Before taking the bikes for a leisurely ride around Central Park, he told me how the company’s engineering team approached the challenge of squeezing more power out of the bike’s battery and motor. Much of what was accomplished derived from a successful pairing between the bike’s motor and its speed controller, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xljWyz"&gt;“Our engineering team has spent a lot of time dialing in on the user interface, the programming at each pedal assist level, the programming on the throttle, and really getting that controller-motor pairing to be ultra-efficient,” Stephens said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nUrkgZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The RadCity proves itself to be a fast, nimble, and effortlessly fun bike to ride&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JSLQ50"&gt;That efficiency shines through on the pavement, where the RadCity proves itself to be a fast, nimble, and effortlessly fun bike to ride. The motor is noticeably quieter than Rad’s older models, but it isn’t nearly silent like some of the newer Bosch motors tend to be. But the new geared hub motor (rated for 750W, like all of Rad’s bikes) has a lot more pick-me-up than the previous generation model’s gearless motors. Geared hub motors are slightly heavier than gearless motors, but not so much that you compromise on range. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RgYNbBAZcRxQu9jhpLv-kA7Mytg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867692/ahawkins_210914_4767_0011.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UMrk2M"&gt;The cockpit of the bike is also redesigned, with two displays rather than just one. The square-shaped display in the center of the handlebars shows real-time stats, like speed, power output, and trip time. A smaller display on the left features a big orange power button and two even bigger up and down arrow buttons for toggling between power settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwAN2d"&gt;Rather than integrate the wires in the frame of the bike, Rad is sticking with the rats nest look, which Stephens says helps with maintenance and repair issues. It can also be useful when selling the bike in markets with different regulations. For example, the throttle can be disconnected if the bike is sold in a country that prohibits throttles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNowpv"&gt;Speaking of different markets, the RadCity 5 Plus will be the commuter bike’s debut in the European market, where Rad has recently started selling its bikes. Europe is going to be a bigger focus for Rad Power Bikes, with the company seeing “triple-digit” sales growth there year over year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3ZUB6h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10766131"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YI3rCK"&gt;The semi-integrated battery is still removable, which, in my opinion, is preferable compared to fully integrated, non-removable batteries. While some of the battery is still sticking out, it’s not as unsightly as the external batteries in Rad’s older models. And the ability to leave your heavy bike outside while you bring the battery indoors for charging can’t be underestimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92vlEQ"&gt;For the first time, the RadCity will be offered in two frame sizes: a high-step model and a step-through one. Being able to appeal to a wider range of riders — including older customers, people with knee issues, and others who would prefer not to have to swing their leg over a top tube — is key feature in the new RadCity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0kxaj"&gt;It’s exciting to see a company like Rad Power Bikes take what works about its bikes and make them better, while also introducing new ideas and new designs. Rad will need to continue to innovate as e-bike sales continue to grow, incumbent bike makers roll out their own designs, and rival direct-to-consumer brands release newer, more powerful bikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BYxHx"&gt;There is a lot of money flowing into this space right now, and talk of tax breaks for consumers will certainly fuel even more hype and investment in the future. Rad Power Bikes has captured the top spot with a simple but well-designed lineup of powerful and affordable e-bikes. And with the new and improved RadCity, the company is proving that it’s not content to rest on its laurels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onmgkh"&gt;The RadCity 5 Plus is available for preorder online starting on September 22nd for the US price of $1,799, and it will be coming to Europe in the winter of 2021–2022 for €1,799.&lt;/p&gt;
