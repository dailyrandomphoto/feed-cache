    <title>Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition review: the right parts at a high price  </title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Long battery life, fast performance, questionable value&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="LTBhVZ"&gt;The new Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition is a slight undoing of progress, depending on how you look at it. As many gaming laptops are going thinner, this one is heavier and thicker than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21459895/alienware-m15-r3-gaming-laptop-review-intel-rtx-nvidia-15-inch"&gt;previous generations&lt;/a&gt;. Its design has been tweaked slightly in ways both good and bad, and it has fewer ports than before, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47EX9J"&gt;Despite all of that, it’s a cause for a small celebration because of the Ryzen processor it uses, marking AMD’s return to Alienware products after a 14-year gap when the brand exclusively used Intel CPUs. And it’s a welcome return, even if this laptop won’t appeal to everyone. AMD’s high-end mobile processors have been a boon to gaming laptops for the last couple of years, bringing long battery life and fast performance that sometimes outpaces and undercuts laptops that have competing Intel processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wD8NBH"&gt;The Ryzen 7 5800H processor brings that magic to the M15 R5 Ryzen Edition, and gaming performance with its RTX 3060 doesn’t struggle to get above 60 FPS in graphically-demanding games — all thanks to being a high-wattage component. This R5 that I tested has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD for a total cost of about $1,616 currently, which isn’t cheap despite being close to the most affordable version that Alienware makes. If money isn’t an issue, it can be upgraded to the more powerful Ryzen 9 5900HX with Nvidia’s RTX 3070 and more storage and RAM for $2,379. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OxCgpr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10590627"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dpH0QK"&gt;The high price is something that I couldn’t ignore while reviewing this laptop, especially since Dell (Alienware’s parent company) makes a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeM15R5Review060421&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fgaming-laptops%2Fg15-ryzen-edition-gaming-laptop%2Fspd%2Fg-series-15-5515-laptop%2Fgn5515esxus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,225&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368010/dell-g15-amd-ryzen-edition-15-inch-gaming-laptop-release-date-price-specs"&gt;G15 Ryzen Edition&lt;/a&gt; that has &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/help-me-choose/cp/hmc-g-series-video-card-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;similar GPU specs&lt;/a&gt; that should come close to what this pricier M15 R5 can do. And, if you can settle for a slightly lesser processor, there’s a $900 model in the works that has the RTX 3060, but it isn’t available yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/guD4hJMKoPrMUKowDC8q4iViNPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513767/cfaulkner_20210511_4579_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alienware ditched the glossy bezels for an all-matte look that I prefer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RSFWQOFhnK9vCAFEsaOZLQwJrEM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513763/cfaulkner_20210511_4579_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This model comes in a single colorway. It’s a dark gunmetal grey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YpkWUo"&gt;The value doesn’t fare well outside of Dell’s world either. Asus is currently the go-to brand for excellent AMD-based gaming laptops that are easier to recommend for people who want something more portable and feature-packed, without sacrificing battery life. Compared to a similar M15 R5 configuration, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt; offers a QHD display, more storage, a better processor and a powerful RTX 3070 (albeit a lower-powered GPU than you’ll find in the M15 R5) for a few hundred dollars less. The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Strix G15 Advantage Edition&lt;/a&gt; looks more garish next to Alienware’s laptop, but it also has fast gaming performance and high-end features for a lower price. Neither of these models feature a webcam, but that might be something you can live without. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="3WfM7n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10591033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AouYJZ"&gt;The M15 R5 is 19.25mm (0.75 inches) thick for most of the machine (thinner at the front, but slightly thicker in the back) and it weighs 5.34 pounds. Some configurations weigh more, going up to 5.93 pounds. Its heft is jarring if you’ve picked up an ultrabook recently, but it’s an asset in helping its high-wattage RTX 3060 graphics chip (125W maximum graphics power, 1,702MHz boost clock) to perform similarly to a low-wattage RTX 3070. Compared to thinner laptops that have a low-powered 3070, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22276367/asus-tuf-dash-f15-2021-intel-core-i7-nvidia-rtx-3070-review-gaming-laptop-specs-price"&gt;Asus’ TUF Dash 15&lt;/a&gt;, Alienware’s laptop makes up for the difference in CUDA cores with sheer power. It will likely be a solid performer well into the future — perhaps longer than some lower-powered 3070s —  despite having a technically lesser component. It’ll just be more of a chore to lug around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWVLTW"&gt;The M15 R5 Ryzen Edition fared well while running some demanding games at their highest settings. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; managed to reach 63 frames per second. &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; ran at about 80 frames per second with its ray tracing shadows feature and DLSS switched on. &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; ran at an average of 68 frames per second. None of them came close to fully taking advantage of the default 1080p display’s 165Hz refresh rate, but most people likely have older games in their library that should be able to display at very fast frame rates on this laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hRVdCTPFejOAFt1ge1jvnXhBRGE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513768/cfaulkner_20210511_4579_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best parts of Alienware’s styling have been preserved from previous generations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KY7VLAdE23PihLTAx6N9PGe0en0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513764/cfaulkner_20210511_4579_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Though, the keyboard layout has gotten a little more cramped with this generation. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="of5Abq"&gt;It didn’t take long for this laptop to make a good impression with gaming performance. It took even less time to learn that it gets warm to the touch even while idling with no apps, and that when games (especially graphically-demanding ones) are running, it can get very loud. A fast and quiet gaming laptop is an oxymoron, and the M15 R5 is really just one of many offenders. But I didn’t notice signs of thermal throttling after long periods of gaming, nor did I encounter unexplainable slow-down. You just might want to wear some headphones while gaming. The speakers shoot sound out of the sides of the laptop. It’s serviceable for YouTube videos or video calls, but it doesn’t deliver enough depth or bass for entertainment purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLo0pu"&gt;This Ryzen-based gaming laptop can handle any sort of casual browser-based workflow with ease. It shouldn’t have surprised me that the M15 R5 has great battery life, since AMD’s processors have proven to bring efficiency to other gaming laptops, but it still did. This one’s 86Wh battery lasted for about seven hours of mixed use, through sustained use of Microsoft Edge with 10 or so tabs, Spotify, Slack, and some video calls. That’s great for an Alienware laptop. The M15 R3 that I reviewed last year clocked in at just one hour. Though, other AMD-based gaming laptops have the M15 R5 beat. The Strix G15 Advantage Edition lasted over nine hours for my colleague Monica Chin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4kCs9"&gt;One area where the Ryzen Edition got a little hung up is with a video export test in Adobe Premiere Pro. Our video team’s five-minute, thirty-three second 4K file took just over seven minutes to finish exporting. That’s not a bad result, but it’s not going to be fast enough for creators to quickly turn around projects and not nearly as fast as laptops with Intel processors can manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v0M114yexxBQa08Rp3zUojIUQ9E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513766/cfaulkner_20210511_4579_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The display has generous viewing angles and a satisfying amount of contrast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fmloy2WnfoM9QZ1bIBgjoAM_OdI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513770/cfaulkner_20210511_4579_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike some gaming laptops, this one has a webcam (though it’s not great).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="w60SyS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10590952"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aWmvRj"&gt;The M15 R5’s design is different from earlier models in minor ways. Sometimes, it’s for the better. For instance, this newer model is matte-textured all around, including on its screen bezels, which looks better than the glossy bezels used in previous generations. Some people might like the M15 R3 and R4’s two-toned color design, but the R5 comes in a gunmetal silver color that is striking, and the black plastic covering the keyboard is relatively free of distractions, aside from the backlit keyboard and illuminated Alienware logo. One of my favorite changes is inside of the laptop: Alienware lets you easily upgrade the RAM and storage if you want. Some previous models had RAM soldered onto the motherboard, but this one’s more futureproof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZO8CW"&gt;Alienware shuffled around the keyboard layout, though, and it’s worse off than before. The M15 R5’s keys are still enjoyable to type on, but I make more typing mistakes because the volume keys have been delegated to the right side of the keyboard instead of the top. Also, the arrow keys were previously positioned a little lower than the rest of the keyboard to make them easy to find, but those have been shoved up in this model, resulting in a smaller right shift key. This might not be a problem once you get accustomed to typing on the M15, but it still feels like a step backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxacMt"&gt;The port selection isn’t as generous, either. The Ryzen Edition features three USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port, an HDMI 2.1 port (capable of 4K output at up to 120Hz), a headphone jack, and a 2.5Gbps ethernet port. It’s not a bad lineup, but it could be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPOoJG"&gt;Missing from this model, and all other new models that Alienware recently unveiled, is the proprietary amplifier connector for its external GPU enclosure, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/6/1/22464110/dell-alienware-graphics-amp-egpu-discontinued"&gt;officially discontinued&lt;/a&gt;. Intel-based versions of Alienware’s newest laptops, like the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeM15R5Review060421&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmember%2Fshop%2Flaptops%2Falienware-m15-r6-laptop%2Fspd%2Falienware-m15-r6-laptop%2Fwnm15r6erbrs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M15 R6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeM15R5Review060421&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Falienware-x15-r1-laptop%2Fwnx15r1esos" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;X15&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeM15R5Review060421&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Falienware-x17-r1-laptop%2Fwnx17r1esos" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;X17&lt;/a&gt;, will support Thunderbolt eGPUs, but the M15 R5 won’t because it lacks a Thunderbolt port. So, you’re just stuck with the GPU that’s inside. Thankfully, the graphics performance is great by default, but there’s a lot of unused space on the R5’s rear where that amplifier port used to be. It would have been nice if Alienware had filled it with an SD card reader and an extra USB-C port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7IkNjwS4qeS4A6n6beXmJeNhtEc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513772/cfaulkner_20210511_4579_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alienware should have put more ports where its GPU amplifier port (RIP) used to be located.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ls0JFP0YMcMlD4tumG_U-ooKkrU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513765/cfaulkner_20210511_4579_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Alienware logo is just one of a few elements that glows when the laptop is powered on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s4Gr3s"&gt;The M15 R5’s performance didn’t come into question during my testing. I don’t think I’ll ever tire of seeing the great battery life AMD’s processors bring, and it’s great that this GPU can hold its own next to pricier components like the RTX 3070.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="H6ZNJz"&gt;But as a whole, Alienware missed the landing when it comes to value. If you want more features for your money, even if it involves swapping some of the M15 R5’s power for a QHD screen and better portability, you should look elsewhere. The M15 R5 isn’t the jaw-dropping value that it needed to be (and that I’d hoped it would be) to steer everyone away from the 2021 gaming laptop frontrunner (so far), the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pandemic was the bloodiest year for driving in over a decade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="weather" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sFMNOUkTGx79r-9Kn4Q59LqZT-A=/0x57:4800x3257/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69407067/1228316860.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZiGX0t"&gt;Road deaths jumped 7.2 percent in 2020 from the year before, hitting a 13-year high, even though people weren’t driving as much, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). But while &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/2020-fatality-data-show-increased-traffic-fatalities-during-pandemic"&gt;NHTSA’s numbers&lt;/a&gt; paint a grim picture, they offer only a glimpse at what’s shaping up to be a historically bloody year of driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJZNFu"&gt;Overall, 38,680 people died in car crashes in 2020, the highest number since 2007. But it’s worse than it sounds, since the number of miles driven in the US dropped by 13 percent. That means every mile someone drove last year was more dangerous than it was the year before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27ql0J"&gt;Heeding the call to “stay home,” Americans drove less during this pandemic year. But those who did get behind the wheel engaged in more reckless behavior, like drinking and driving, speeding, and failing to buckle up. But while this certainly raises questions about our judgment as drivers, it also cast a harsh light on the hidden dangers in our nation’s road system.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nRAIFk"&gt;“It’s mind-boggling and extremely frustrating to see the tremendous loss of life from COVID compounded by preventable traffic crashes,” Pam Shadel Fischer, senior director of external engagement at the ﻿Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA), said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qz5n2C"&gt;NHTSA found that fatalities rose in most major categories, including passenger vehicle occupants (up 5 percent), motorcyclists (up 9 percent), and bicyclists (up 5 percent). The number of pedestrian deaths in 2020 — 6,205 — was flat compared to 2019, which is still alarming, given that year was among the deadliest for pedestrians in 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZrS8o"&gt;These estimates are &lt;a href="https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/motor-vehicle/overview/comparison-of-nsc-and-nhtsa-estimates/"&gt;actually fairly conservative&lt;/a&gt;, since deaths in driveways, parking lots, or private roads are excluded. Also, if someone dies more than 30 days after their crash, it doesn’t count. That means as many as 1,000 deaths aren’t getting counted every year, according to the National Safety Council (NSC), a 108-year-old nonprofit focused on health and safety in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZ0hBm"&gt;Using the NSC’s criteria, last year was even worse than the government is willing to admit, with an estimated total of 42,060 road deaths, up 8 percent from 2019. This also takes into account a similar decrease in total vehicle miles traveled compared to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6aBXU"&gt;There’s plenty of anecdotal evidence to back this claim of more reckless driving. A report from last year by the GHSA noted that police in Colorado, Indiana, Nebraska, and Utah have clocked drivers going more than 100mph on highways, while in New York City, automated speed cameras issued 24,765 speeding tickets on March 27th, 2020, early in the lockdown, which was nearly double the number issued daily a month earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rencmQ"&gt;But the rise in reckless driving may say more about road design in the US than it does about Americans’ skills as drivers, said Greg Shill, associate professor at the University of Iowa College of Law and a faculty member at the National Advanced Driving Simulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n74aGb"&gt;The assumption of many traffic engineers in the US is that wide roads are safer. This relates to the concept of “induced demand,” in which road-widening projects encourage more people to drive, thus failing to improve congestion. In a year with less driving, those wide roads proved to be dangerously tempting to many drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uaKBt"&gt;“I’d call it the monkey’s paw of highway engineering,” he said. “Highway engineers got their wish (free flowing traffic, “Level of Service A” in the parlance) but with it came an extraordinary increase in deaths per mile traveled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ienkbo"&gt;It’s very difficult to reverse these projects once they’ve been completed. Racial justice advocates are calling for some urban highways to be torn down altogether, but more in the name of reinvesting in communities of color that have been destroyed by racist highway projects, and less so in the name of safety. And Vision Zero, the project aimed at reducing the number of traffic fatalities to zero, has been criticized as an empty slogan without a proven record of success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtfKa5"&gt;Shill argues that better transit is needed to get people out of their cars, but in a pandemic year, when public transit ridership across the country &lt;a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TRANSIT"&gt;plummeted&lt;/a&gt;, it’s unclear what benefit better subways and buses would have brought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ieJ5bO"&gt;There are a host of other ideas: automated speed enforcement; reforming &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3846597"&gt;the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways&lt;/a&gt;, the 862-page manual governing traffic signs and signals; and cutting speed limits in dense areas to 20 or 25 mph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGVX8d"&gt;“I don’t want to overstate it, because turning around a transportation system is like turning a battleship,” Shill said. “But the new administration and new USDOT leadership seems to be genuinely concerned with this and is engaging with it. I’m eager to see what they do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIPcOC"&gt;But the likelihood of progress in the near term is bleak, and in the meantime, over 100 people are dying in vehicle crashes every day. We have internalized these deaths as the necessary trade-off for having the freedom to drive as much as we want. And in a year when we weren’t driving as much, those costs were laid bare for all to see. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story about why it’s time to scrap racist bird names  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Maui parrotbill" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sewd3CDM2ebYtxUDC-DjRGa9Va8=/0x192:4734x3348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69407061/558233783.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bYFUhi"&gt;Some 150 birds named for people tied to slavery and white supremacy could eventually&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;get new monikers as part of an ongoing reckoning with racism within the world of birding. That includes Jameson’s firefinch, named for a British naturalist who bought a young girl while in Africa “as a joke” and then drew pictures of her being brutally killed. In a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2021/bird-names-racism-audubon"&gt;new story&lt;/a&gt; this week, &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reporter Darryl Fears breaks down the horrific history of ornithology that has managed to be scrubbed clean in many history books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z7F6HZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Indigenous peoples understood the animals long before white settlers supposedly “discovered” them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TKlLoC"&gt;Fears also writes about the names these birds already had, given to them by Indigenous peoples who understood the animals long before white settlers supposedly “discovered” the creatures. There’s a push now to return to some of those names or use new ones in local languages, which continue to be mocked by a cadre of birding elite that is still largely white. Just last year the American Ornithological Society &lt;a href="https://americanornithology.org/an-apology-from-aos/"&gt;apologized&lt;/a&gt; for “inappropriate comments” its members made &lt;em&gt;nearly 10 years ago&lt;/em&gt; about a proposal to rename the Maui parrotbill to the Hawaiian name Kiwikiu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9ViUr"&gt;I can’t do justice to Fears’ reporting here; you’ll have to read it yourself. But I can tell you that while the movement to end systemic racism within environmental science and conservation has picked up steam, it’s far from new — and there’s still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2gMle"&gt;The Audubon Society, the leading bird conservation nonprofit in the US, is still named after a man who enslaved Black people and &lt;a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/the-myth-john-james-audubon"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; the emancipation of enslaved people in the Caribbean. In April, the CEO of the Audubon Society, David Yarnold, &lt;a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/national-audubon-society-announces-ceo-david-yarnold-step-down"&gt;stepped down&lt;/a&gt; after employees &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/12/audubon-society-claims-intimidation-threats-436215"&gt;came forward&lt;/a&gt; with their experiences with racism and sexism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="R62G6H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Environmental organizations cannot operate with impunity”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YcQ1wA"&gt;“Environmental organizations cannot operate with impunity … For too long, boards have looked the other way as executive leaders have ignored or directly perpetuated racism,” said Andrés Jimenez, executive director of nonprofit Green 2.0, in &lt;a href="https://diversegreen.org/audubon-change-in-leadership-opens-door-for-opportunity/"&gt;a statement responding&lt;/a&gt; to the leadership shakeup. Jimenez’s organization puts out a report each year that has tracked diversity within environmental organizations and foundations since 2017. This year’s &lt;a href="https://grist.org/justice/green-groups-promised-a-racial-reckoning-in-2020-is-it-happening/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; found a slight bump in the average number of people of color and women on staff. It was a show of some progress — but fell far short of a full reckoning with the legacies of racism and discrimination against Black, Indigenous, and other people of color &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286924/science-racism-strike-stem-black-lives-matter-protests"&gt;within science&lt;/a&gt; and environmentalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1TO1r"&gt;Fears’ recent reporting follows Black birders and ornithologists making inroads in spaces that have often pushed people of color to the margins. He tells the story of Corina Newsome, one of the original organizers of the Black Birders Week that began last year following a now-notorious episode of a white woman calling the police on a Black birder in New York’s Central Park. (It’s Black Birders Week again this week.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xDr81O"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Black people, especially Black women, queer and trans people, people with disabilities, and other systemically marginalized groups have to go above and beyond to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SafeInNature?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SafeInNature&lt;/a&gt;.

(@hood_naturalist) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hood_naturalist/status/1400642352453128195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mdhN94"&gt;“A lot of times when you think about Black people in nature, a lot of people associate that with a threat — that Black people can’t exist in nature without being threatened,” Anna Gifty Opoku-Agyeman, another organizer of the first Black Birders Week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279801/viral-video-christian-cooper-black-birders-week-protests"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;. “So this idea that Black people are thriving in nature — they are embracing nature, they are incredibly joyful and excited about showcasing the natural world to the rest of us — is a perspective that we desperately need.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2606L"&gt;Still, navigating the birding world while Black is fraught, Fears writes. Newsome, an ornithologist and community engagement manager for Georgia Audubon, tells Fears about the stereotypes she faces in the field. And she’s candid about what it feels like to work under the name “Audubon.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7o4Ec"&gt;But if a new, more diverse generation of birders is successful in their push to rename both birds and institutions, a lot of titles could eventually change — including several birds named after John James Audubon. Check out Fears’ &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2021/bird-names-racism-audubon/?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=131599593&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz%E2%80%94EfBBEzUP2qwQ02JCmgyajxveoy3zUDuSvEWmGzAuQMjBEzjMhqJ0iVuvSZlQc_6uz1uNei4G2zmfT17zemlyeZpGC0158J5TZIlIE214FDnD20uY&amp;amp;utm_content=131599593&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;full story&lt;/a&gt;: it shows just how much is in a name. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook gives Trump a 2-year suspension after Oversight Board decision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RPbGHiB7HgUIzDda7GmC8igsitg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69407002/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s3XtjS"&gt;Facebook has &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/06/facebook-response-to-oversight-board-recommendations-trump/"&gt;commuted former President Donald Trump’s indefinite ban&lt;/a&gt; into a two-year suspension that will end January 7th, 2023. Facebook will then reevaluate Trump’s ban to “assess whether the risk to public safety has receded.” If he’s reinstated and violates Facebook’s rules again, it will implement a “strict set of rapidly escalating sanctions” that could lead to a permanent ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhqgTJ"&gt;The suspension accompanies a change in how Facebook treats “newsworthy” posts that break its rules. Facebook will still allow some violating content that is “newsworthy or important to the public interest” to remain online. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22474738/facebook-ending-political-figure-exemption-moderation-policy"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, it will begin publishing the “rare instances” when it’s applied. And it won’t grant special status to politicians’ posts, a sharp reversal from its previous policy that shielded them from rules that applied to other users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xVXO80"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In response to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OversightBoard?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@OversightBoard&lt;/a&gt;'s ruling, Facebook is suspending Donald Trump’s accounts for 2 years, effective from the date of the initial suspension in January this year. At that time, we will assess the public safety risk and extend the restrictions if conditions require. &lt;a href="https://t.co/23JTzX2pfx"&gt;https://t.co/23JTzX2pfx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nick Clegg (@nickclegg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nickclegg/status/1400852721398288395?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o25alz"&gt;“When we assess content for newsworthiness, we will not treat content posted by politicians any differently from content posted by anyone else,” writes Facebook in a blog post. “Instead, we will simply apply our newsworthiness balancing test in the same way to all content, measuring whether the public interest value of the content outweighs the potential risk of harm by leaving it up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJLJiC"&gt;Facebook made the change in response to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; from the Oversight Board that it clarify its policies around Trump’s ban.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tinder will start letting you block people by their phone number</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TtZUa2HcJ9oqSzFziC-B9VCQR1s=/74x0:1573x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69406971/phone_en_US.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tinder&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y1bQWC"&gt;Tinder is finally letting you avoid all your exes, friends, colleagues, relatives, and anyone else you might not want to run into on a dating app. The company announced today it’ll start allowing people to &lt;a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039684672-Block-Contacts-"&gt;block their phone contacts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5AHlB"&gt;Romance-seekers can access the feature from their settings, under the “Block Contacts” menu, where they can define which contacts they’d like to block — meaning these people won’t surface for them, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEdCSv"&gt;Users can either upload their full contacts list to Tinder or add them individually. Tinder says it won’t store everyone’s contacts — only the ones they’ve chosen to block — and people can unblock or disconnect their contacts list at any time. Blocked contacts won’t be notified they’ve been blocked. Of course, there’s no easy way of knowing if an ex or other undateworthy person even has a Tinder account; it’s more of a preventative measure. And if a blocked individual has since changed their phone number and joins Tinder, their account could still surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZhQnV"&gt;People have wanted to avoid the possibility of an awkward digital run-in forever, and this might, finally, give them a fighting chance at doing so. However, it also feels years late. I don’t know why Tinder took so long to launch this, but hopefully new users won’t have to know the misery of running into an ex on Tinder ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The tiny Playdate handheld gets a price bump but double the games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dEe5QcaaJEuex5puyvWMexHh0fI=/0x2:1454x971/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69406687/F558C979_3BAF_4B2D_ADC3_CDFC275FFA64.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EfecXt"&gt;Panic is finally sharing some more information about its delayed Playdate, the tiny yellow handheld with a crank. The quirky little gadget is going up in price, launching at $179 instead of $149, but its first “season” of games that will be rolled out to the Playdate over time is being doubled from 12 to 24. The device will also have 4GB of storage instead of 2GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGgFNQ"&gt;The company is also announcing a Playdate Update video set for June 8th at 12PM ET where it will share news, a look at games coming to the device, and information on preorders. The company says that preorders won’t go up immediately following the update, so don’t worry if you can’t catch the show live. You’ll be able to watch the 15-minute Playdate Update on &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/PanicVideo"&gt;Panic’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVL8T8"&gt;Panic first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/22/18628360/playdate-panic-teenage-engineering-qwop-katamari"&gt;announced the Playdate in 2019&lt;/a&gt; with an expected early 2020 ship date, but that date eventually slipped to 2020 and then to 2021. The handheld was designed in collaboration with Swedish hardware company Teenage Engineering, and you can look forward to games from renowned indie developers like &lt;em&gt;Katamari Damacy&lt;/em&gt; creator Keita Takahashi and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21334116/good-sudoku-iphone-ipad-app-game-zach-gage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good Sudoku&lt;/em&gt; creator Zach Gage&lt;/a&gt;. Personally, I can’t wait to see what developers do with that crank.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch chats are about to get more chaotic with animated emotes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7p0KD9Z_QGbZWfoRgZ84piqDauU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69406685/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5jKONP"&gt;Twitch is announcing some big updates to emotes on Friday, including that animated emotes will soon be available on the live-streaming platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzJq0e"&gt;Emotes are a huge part of the experience of Twitch. They’re everywhere in Twitch chats, and Twitch partners and affiliates can offer custom emotes to subscribers that can be used in chats on other channels. Every user on Twitch also has access to a set of &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/creatorcamp/en/learn-the-basics/emotes/"&gt;global emotes&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280810/twitch-pogchamp-komodo-dragon-komodohype-replacement"&gt;the wide-mouthed Komodo dragon “PogChamp”&lt;/a&gt; that’s often spammed in chats to express hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9wHrpM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Animated emotes could make chats more lively (or chaotic)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lKAOeS"&gt;Right now, though, all emotes are static, so animated emotes could give streamers new ways to make their chats even more lively (or chaotic, depending on the chat). Twitch partners will be able to offer as many as five animated emotes as perks for their subscribers. If streamers don’t want to make brand-new emotes, they can also choose to apply one of six different animated effects to existing ones, such as shaking, spinning, or a rave-like multicolor effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRSJ6h"&gt;Twitch plans to let partners offer animated emotes in a few weeks, and expects that affiliates will be able to do so by the end of this year. And if you as a viewer don’t want to see animated emotes at all, you’ll be able to turn them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqhzgB"&gt;Twitch streamers are also getting a new way to offer custom emotes to more people. Instead of making custom emotes available exclusively to paid subscribers, Twitch is going to let streamers offer up to five custom emotes to followers as well. (Following a channel, unlike subscribing, is free.) Those emotes could be a nice perk to encourage viewers to hit that follow button, but unlike emotes you get as a subscriber, which you can use in any other chat on Twitch, a streamer’s follower emotes can only be used in that streamer’s chat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3aqusc"&gt;Follower emotes will be available to select partners and affiliates in beta in late June, Twitch tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and the company hopes to start rolling out follower emotes more broadly later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKKQMJ"&gt;Twitch is also introducing a new way for streamers to better manage their emotes, even ones that aren’t active, which Twitch calls the Library. Twitch plans to roll the Library out in phases, with all partners and some affiliates getting it in late June, the company says. All partners and all affiliates should have access within a few months, according to Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 hospitalization rates in adolescents went up during March and April</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VNQruz"&gt;In March and April, when COVID-19 vaccinations were starting to keep older adults out of the hospital, more and more children between 12 and 17 years old were being admitted. Many were seriously sick: around one-third of kids in this age group who were in the hospital for COVID-19 this year were in the intensive care unit, a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7023e1.htm?s_cid=mm7023e1_w"&gt;report shows&lt;/a&gt;. None died. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fJ0mI"&gt;The risk of getting seriously ill and needing to be hospitalized from COVID-19 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html"&gt;increases with age&lt;/a&gt;, but kids and teenagers can still get sick. Hospitalization rates from COVID-19 in this group were, overall, around 2.5 to 3 times higher than those from the flu over the last three flu seasons. The new CDC data underscores the importance of COVID-19 vaccination for adolescents, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WHCOVIDResponse/status/1400470124306612225"&gt;during a press briefing&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. Vaccine shots are now authorized for anyone over the age of 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXCOrO"&gt;“[The findings] force us to redouble our motivation to get our adolescents and young adults vaccinated,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGBFV7"&gt;The CDC report looked at data from a network of health centers in 14 states. It found that 204 adolescents were hospitalized for COVID-19 between January 1st and March 31st, 2021. Of that group, 64 were admitted to an intensive care unit and 10 were placed on a ventilator. Around two-thirds had underlying medical conditions, but about 30 percent did not, showing that healthy kids can still get seriously sick. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cXTMvPmHtX-MwHG5EvzFGCXhIEE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22637273/Screen_Shot_2021_06_04_at_10.14.53_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Hospitalization rates for adolescents with COVID-19 peaked in January before declining, but went up again in March.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="js9OAG"&gt;Hospitalization rates for this age group peaked during January, dropped off in February, and then started climbing back up during the beginning of March. Maryland and Michigan both had their highest ever rates in April — &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/maryland-covid-cases.html"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/michigan-covid-cases.html"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; saw overall surges in case numbers during that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3U2Gs6"&gt;A combination of factors may have contributed to that uptick, the CDC report said. Kids started returning to school and in-person extracurricular activities during that time, and COVID-19 outbreaks can occur in those environments. In addition, variant forms of the virus that can spread more easily were circulating. Some areas also started to ease up on COVID-19 restrictions as adults got vaccinated against the disease, which could have let the virus spread among people, including adolescents, who weren’t yet eligible for the shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLFzKy"&gt;Almost &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;6.4 million kids&lt;/a&gt; between 12 and 17 in the US have had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, as of June 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWLWYc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14 basics: how to quit an app on your iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fgEerp6jUFsMW4StV7QQVqy-HvE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69406377/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBAgE4"&gt;Even iOS apps occasionally misbehave — they can crash, or freeze, or otherwise stop working. If you’re new to iOS, or just haven’t had this happen before, you may not know how to actually quit an app (as opposed to just swiping it off your screen). Here’s how to quit an app using iOS 14:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fFpjG3"&gt;Open the App Switcher by either swiping up from the bottom of the screen and then pausing in the middle, or (if you have a Home button) double pressing the Home button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vYnTbm"&gt;You’ll see an overlapping view of all your open apps. Swipe to the right or left until you find the app you want to quit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HZCbTg"&gt;Swipe up on the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Open the App Switcher and swipe sideways to find the app you want to quit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zpaPAZ_gFiuw50kCvgvDaYPH8j8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554891/IMG_A27F4BD48743_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open the App Switcher and swipe sideways to find the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you’ve found the misbehaving app, swipe it up to quit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h3_ou0hV4pgpbnjCrn9sFtkrgrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554901/IMG_9FA2A8039FFE_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you’ve found the misbehaving app, swipe it up to quit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n10e51"&gt;Unfortunately, there isn’t any way to close all of your apps at once, should you wish to do so — you’ll have to simply swipe them off one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtwsFo"&gt;If for any reason swiping the app off doesn’t solve the problem, then &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/restart-iphone-iph841379c3d/14.0/ios/14.0"&gt;shut down your phone&lt;/a&gt; by pressing and holding the side button and either volume button until you see sliders appear. Drag the one that says “slide to power off” to the right. (If you have an iPhone with a Home button, instead, press and hold the side or the Sleep / Wake button.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLm1Bc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok updates US privacy policy to collect ‘faceprints and voiceprints’ (but won’t explain what they are) </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uonr3tviUKodKdtIHzcj405XuX8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69406214/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H7xqmQ"&gt;TikTok has updated &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy?lang=en#privacy-us"&gt;its privacy policy in the US&lt;/a&gt; to notify users that the app might, in future, collect new types of biometric information including “faceprints and voiceprints.” But when reached by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, TikTok was unable to explain what types of data these terms referred to, or why the app might need to access this information in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhUGNi"&gt;The company’s privacy policy was updated on June 2nd, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (An archived version of the old policy can be &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210601030054/https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy"&gt;read here&lt;/a&gt;.) The new policy lays out in some detail the ways in which the TikTok app now has permission to analyze users’ content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7UKOS"&gt;The policy states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hDZaBQ"&gt;“We may collect information about the images and audio that are a part of your User Content, such as identifying the objects and scenery that appear, the existence and location within an image of face and body features and attributes, the nature of the audio, and the text of the words spoken in your User Content. We may collect this information to enable special video effects, for content moderation, for demographic classification, for content and ad recommendations, and for other non-personally-identifying operations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="lRqpKF"&gt;As is often the case with privacy policies, there’s a lot of conflation here between outcomes that users are probably fine with (like adding video effects) and outcomes they might think are more invasive (like ad targeting and “demographic classification.”) There’s also a lot of broad language used in order to cover any future updates TikTok might add to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKi7An"&gt;The new privacy policy is more explicit that the app can now collect biometric data — that is, the measurement of physical characteristics, including the aforementioned “faceprints and voiceprints.” The policy says TikTok will seek consent from users before collecting this information, but only when it is required to do so by the law. As &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; notes, this doesn’t mean an awful lot in the US, given that only a &lt;a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/biometrics/biometric-data"&gt;few states&lt;/a&gt; (including Illinois, Texas, and California) offer these sorts of legal protections. And indeed, TikTok might think that agreeing to its terms of service constitutes all the consent it will need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vK1kPk"&gt;It’s possible that the changes to TikTok’s privacy policy are a response to a recent national class action lawsuit against the company, in which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301704/tiktok-92-million-settlement-class-action-privacy-lawsuit"&gt;agreed to pay $92 million&lt;/a&gt; to claimants alleging a variety of privacy violations. As we reported on the case in February: “As part of the settlement, TikTok has agreed to avoid several behaviors that could compromise user privacy unless it specifically discloses those behaviors in its privacy policy.” When asked if these changes were a response to the class action lawsuit, though, TikTok declined to comment on the record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kjjOG"&gt;In response to various questions about what data the company is now collecting on users, how it defines “faceprints and voiceprints,” what data it might collect in the future, and what it might do with that information, a spokesperson said only: “As part of our ongoing commitment to transparency, we recently updated our Privacy Policy to provide more clarity on the information we may collect.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgHLkX"&gt;There’s more information, yes, but still not a lot of clarity. For an app that has struggled with various privacy issues (the perception of which is often exacerbated by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322612/tiktok-security-china-bytedance-spying-app-privacy"&gt;political paranoia&lt;/a&gt;), it seems there’s more work yet to do.&lt;/p&gt;
