    <title>TikTok parent company ByteDance still holding off on launching IPO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ByteDance, parent company of TikTok, may put its IPO on hold indefinitely" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1tUHBVs0gktvxmloWRC6Mcq6nmU=/0x1:5000x3334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571103/1232551963.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E7RqSX"&gt;TikTok parent company ByteDance is not planning an initial public offering anytime soon, and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bytedance-shelvedipo-intentions-after-chinese-regulators-warned-about-data-security-11626078000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; Monday that such plans have been “indefinitely” shelved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8gCLn"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;reported that ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming made the call to postpone IPO plans in March after meeting with regulators who suggested the company should focus on data security concerns. Beijing-based &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-24/bytedance-hires-xiaomi-executive-as-cfo-while-it-weighs-ipo"&gt;ByteDance hired Shou Zi Chew&lt;/a&gt; as its chief financial officer in late March, which led to conjecture that an IPO may be imminent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8CIjD"&gt;“We don’t comment on rumors or speculation,” a ByteDance spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Monday in response to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTv3lp"&gt;The company has not publicly announced any potential IPO plans, and in response to what it called speculation in the media, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/bytedance-ipo-idUSL4N2MG3DW"&gt;ByteDance said in April&lt;/a&gt; that the company was “not ready at this stage and do not have IPO plans yet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nPluwa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"WeChat deleted accounts of student LGBTQ groups in China","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568597/wechat-lgbt-groups-deleted-accounts-censorship-tencent"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6VGe38"&gt;Over the past several weeks, China’s regulators have been &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-tech-clampdown-is-spreading-like-wildfire-11622971802?mod=article_inline"&gt;cracking down on the country’s tech companies&lt;/a&gt; with a focus on anti-competitive practices, inconsistent pricing, and how companies and their apps handle users’ data. Earlier this month, Chinese ride-hailing company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/4/22562912/china-regulator-orders-didi-ride-hailing-app-removed"&gt;Didi removed its app&lt;/a&gt; from app stores in the country after the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) accused the company of illegally collecting users’ personal data. Didi &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/30/investing/didi-china-us-ipo-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;went public on June 30th&lt;/a&gt; in one of the biggest IPO offerings ever of a Chinese company on a US stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cc0CdK"&gt;ByteDance and TikTok were among the Chinese companies targeted by the Trump administration via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358505/trump-tiktok-wechat-tencent-bytedance-china-ban-executive-order-legal-sanctions-rules"&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215961/trump-executive-order-prohibiting-transactions-eight-chinese-apps-alipay-tencent-qq-wechat-pay"&gt;executive orders&lt;/a&gt; that blocked such apps from US app stores. None of the orders ever took meaningful effect, and in June, President Biden signed an executive order &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525953/biden-tiktok-wechat-trump-bans-revoked-alipay"&gt;revoking the bans&lt;/a&gt;. Biden’s EO also provided a framework for assessing any national security risks that the companies and their apps might present. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Apple’s Private Relay feature with iCloud Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BJ9c9nReExFghy0D1qAUuly2oT4=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571099/og__ishslgdhhimq.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XNwXJ6"&gt;One of the more interesting new features available with iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey is iCloud Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;Apple’s upgraded iCloud subscription service&lt;/a&gt; that adds a few key privacy features. Chief among those features is Private Relay, a VPN-like service that’s designed to mask your internet traffic on your devices from anyone trying to snoop in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDxn53"&gt;Here’s how to use it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR0wae"&gt;To start, you’ll have to be using iOS 15, iPadOS 15, or macOS Monterey and be a subscriber to one of Apple’s iCloud plans. All &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201318"&gt;paid iCloud plans&lt;/a&gt; — including the $0.99-per-month 50GB plan — are eligible, as are shared family iCloud plans or ones purchased through a shared Apple One subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdgVn7"&gt;Turning on Private Relay is extremely simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="g9kVyX"&gt;On an iPhone or iPad, head to Settings &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; iCloud &amp;gt; Private Relay and then toggle on the “Private Relay” switch &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TTeoOd"&gt;On a Mac, head to System Preferences &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; iCloud, and check the box labeled “Private Relay”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dcwhq_PV63TgieTpsy7OMRDqLsI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712561/IMG_2946.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The toggle for Private Relay in iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iJtHa8bKqvJZ30MYqv9Drcr5GEo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712565/IMG_2947.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Private Relay limits masking your IP address within your existing country and time zone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D89MqC"&gt;Unlike most VPNs, Private Relay only offers one configurable option: the ability to choose your IP address location. Apple gives you two choices here: you can use your “general IP address” so that websites can still give you approximate location data, or you can choose a broader IP address somewhere in your country and time zone (which offers greater anonymity at the expense of more accurate online content). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFMDzO"&gt;Notably, though, Private Relay still only lets you navigate the web through your existing (rough) geographic location, so you can’t use it for more popular VPN activities — like streaming Netflix content from a different country or skirting local sports blackout rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vnmLtG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s missing a few major VPN features&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qT2H4x"&gt;Apple says Private Relay is actually more secure than a traditional VPN, noting that traffic is masked twice. When you navigate to a URL in Safari, it’s first sent to Apple, which strips out your identifying IP address information, and then sends it on to a second server — maintained by an as-yet-unidentified third party — to assign a new, temporary IP address. The net result is that neither Apple, the third-party relay company, nor the website can track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MYW61"&gt;There are some limitations to Private Relay. To begin, it’ll be unavailable in a number of countries: China, Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda, and the Philippines. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/apples-new-private-relay-feature-will-not-be-available-china-2021-06-07/"&gt;Apple tells &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this is due to regulatory limitations in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YthMoV"&gt;In addition, Private Relay only works with Safari — not other web browsers or apps — making it a far more limited option than other VPN services, especially when combined with the fact that it can’t be used for dodging geographic location limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnDmvA"&gt;But considering Private Relay is included as a free add-on for iCloud subscribers, it’s a nice addition, especially if you’re the kind of user who is more interested in the privacy benefits of a VPN for regular web browsing than more specific VPN use cases. The Safari-only limitation could help push users toward using Apple’s browser over competitors like Chrome or Firefox, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LeBron James is coming to Fortnite this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TATdPs7mC1fpd9IUPNPl5lzwPOA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571048/LeBron_James_Tune_Squad.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bkWZ9R"&gt;LeBron James is the latest celebrity to enter the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; metaverse. Starting on July 14th, players will be able to purchase two different versions of the NBA star: a regular LeBron with a handful of outfits, and another modeled after his role in the upcoming movie &lt;em&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLkooR"&gt;The two skins, and their associated accessories, will also be available as part of a bundle. And both will sport the player’s upcoming shoe, the Nike LeBron 19. Even better: one of the optional outfits pays homage to a classic LeBron game day look from 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T6Xvfx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10648111"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0aqdhB"&gt;Rumors of a LeBron skin have existed since May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417523/fortnite-party-royale-lebron-james-zion-the-rock-epic-apple"&gt;when some of developer Epic’s plans came out as part of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt;. Real-world celebrities have increasingly become an important part of the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; universe, including everyone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21065235/ninja-fortnite-skin-announced-stream-tyler-blevins-available-date"&gt;from streamer Tyler “Ninja” Blevins&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;rapper Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, the spotlight has turned to sports, with skins featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443608/fortnite-nba-uniform-jerseys"&gt;the uniforms of NBA teams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;professional soccer clubs&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399880/fortnite-neymar-skin"&gt;stars like Neymar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo2XJ9"&gt;The same leak that revealed a LeBron skin &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; suggested a skin based on The Rock could be coming to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, so the celebrity train likely isn’t stopping any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1PUlvb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10645189"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Android 12 will let you play games as you’re downloading them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MNaU-sne2wdELQdP-hgPzXMM_2k=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571040/VRG_1777_Android_12_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wtuR7x"&gt;Google is announcing a big new feature for its upcoming Android 12 update on Monday: you’ll be able to play games as you’re downloading them. For particularly large games, this could be very useful, as it means you won’t have to wait as long to jump into a game and start playing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ketsu6"&gt;You can get an idea of just how much faster you might be able to hop into a game in the below GIF shared by Google. The difference, at least in this case, is quite noticeable, and Google says it is already “seeing games being ready to open at least 2 times faster.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YgXJsprL7GsPgM9QClLa4_Fdats=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22711564/ezgif_4_9c47602cb947.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bp7DjE"&gt;The feature works with games that use the &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/asset-delivery"&gt;Play Asset Delivery system&lt;/a&gt;. If they do, developers won’t need to do anything to turn the feature on, according to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5d5w6"&gt;The news comes as part of the &lt;a href="https://developersonair.withgoogle.com/events/game-dev-summit-2021"&gt;Google for Games Developer Summit 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which runs from July 12th through the 13th. At the event, Google also announced a new game dashboard for Android 12 that gives you easy access to utilities like screen capture and recording. The dashboard will be available on “select devices” later this year, Google says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pexHoq"&gt;Android 12 is also set to bring a bunch of other big changes to Android, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;including a major new design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SpDzvH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Authenticated brand logos in Gmail will roll out over the coming weeks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yai1whB5paxAA8vaen087siDmn0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571036/acastro_180424_1777_gmail_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uYkZk0"&gt;Authenticated brand logos in Gmail, a security feature that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333886/google-gmail-bimi-logo-authentication-trial-brand-indicators-for-message-identification"&gt;first announced last July&lt;/a&gt;, will be rolling out over the coming weeks, Google announced on Monday. The feature is enabled by the Brand Indicators for Message Identification (&lt;a href="https://bimigroup.org/"&gt;BIMI&lt;/a&gt;) standard, which Google joined the working group for &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/google-joins-authindicators-working-group-and-commits-to-bimi-pilot-300890074.html"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDf3WE"&gt;The idea is that an organization’s logo will show up in your inbox when they send you an email that’s authenticated &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2466580?hl=en"&gt;using the DMARC standard&lt;/a&gt; to help reduce the likelihood that you’ll open and act on an email posing as one from a legitimate source. Ideally, the authenticated brand logos will function like a verified badge you might see on social networks that tell you that an account is actually owned and operated by the entity it claims to represent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/irZdPPqzepb0ebxogN8-ROyDjE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712571/Mobile_Default_Camera_Move_B.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E47pOy"&gt;Here’s how it works behind the scenes, according to Google:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pogAMb"&gt;Organizations who authenticate their emails using Sender Policy Framework (SPF) or Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) and deploy DMARC can provide their validated trademarked logos to Google via a Verified Mark Certificate (VMC). BIMI leverages Mark Verifying Authorities, like Certification Authorities, to verify logo ownership and provide proof of verification in a VMC. Once these authenticated emails pass our other anti-abuse checks, Gmail will start displaying the logo in the existing avatar slot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Jnodfj"&gt;Gmail users won’t have to do anything to see the authenticated brand logos, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft acquires cybersecurity firm RiskIQ as the threat of ransomware intensifies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3KOioh-DAxlLRiQT4HtiFbFwUwo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69570969/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R4l3JY"&gt;Microsoft is officially acquiring RiskIQ, a security software vendor. RiskIQ provides management tools and threat intelligence gathering against a wide range of cyberattacks across Microsoft’s own cloud services, AWS, on-premises servers, and supply chain attacks. While Microsoft hasn’t valued the deal, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-11/microsoft-is-said-to-be-buying-cybersecurity-company-riskiq?sref=rfAB4PXT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the company is said to be paying more than $500 million for RiskIQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="waKAKV"&gt;The cloud-based RiskIQ software detects security issues across networks and devices, and the company lists Box, the US Postal Service, BMW, Facebook, and American Express as customers. RiskIQ was originally founded in 2009 and has gradually become an important player in analyzing security threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HoPEUj"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t laid out a detailed plan for how it will integrate RiskIQ into its own security offerings, but it’s bound to utilize RiskIQ’s software across Microsoft 365 Defender, Microsoft Azure Defender, and Microsoft Azure Sentinel eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UUArh"&gt;“RiskIQ has built a strong customer base and community of security professionals who we will continue to support, nurture, and grow,” &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F07%2F12%2Fmicrosoft-to-acquire-riskiq-to-strengthen-cybersecurity-of-digital-transformation-and-hybrid-work%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says Eric Doerr&lt;/a&gt;, vice president of cloud security at Microsoft. “RiskIQ’s technology and team will be a powerful addition to our security portfolio to best serve our mutual customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRQaeS"&gt;Microsoft has been gradually growing and improving its security tools amid an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545675/ransomware-cryptocurrency-regulation-hacks"&gt;intense battle with ransomware&lt;/a&gt;. The software maker even &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F06%2F02%2Fmicrosoft-acquires-refirm-labs-to-enhance-iot-security%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;acquired ReFirm Labs last month&lt;/a&gt; to help protect servers and Internet of Things devices from security attacks. The acquisitions come after months of troublesome ransomware attacks. The Russia-linked REvil ransomware group has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22564054/ransomware-revil-kaseya-coop"&gt;wreaking havoc with ransomware&lt;/a&gt; and supply chain attacks in recent weeks, and the security industry is still reeling from a sophisticated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22248631/solarwinds-hack-cybersecurity-us-menn-decoder-podcast"&gt;SolarWinds hack&lt;/a&gt; that breached everything from Microsoft to US government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Death Stranding: Director’s Cut isn’t a director’s cut, says director Hideo Kojima</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Death Stranding" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-TQoGWOh9q_7C-xiTUxWbc3G9ZY=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69570882/DEATH_STRANDING_20200406165104.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fJpU8s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22569182/death-stranding-directors-cut-new-features-release-date-ps5"&gt;coming to the PS5 on September 24th&lt;/a&gt; — but don’t call it a director’s cut, according to director Hideo Kojima (&lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-12-kojima-disagrees-with-death-stranding-directors-cut-title"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGviEl"&gt;“A director’s cut in a movie is an additional edit to a shortened version that was either released reluctantly because the director did not have the right to edit it, or because the running time had to be shortened,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1414442896367915015"&gt;Kojima explained on Twitter this morning&lt;/a&gt;. “In the game, it is not what was cut, but what was additionally produced that was included. Delector’s [sic] Plus? So, in my opinion, I don’t like to call ‘director’s cut’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jhmg63"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2/2&lt;br&gt;In the game, it is not what was cut, but what was additionally produced that was included. Delector's Plus? So, in my opinion, I don't like to call "director's cut".&lt;/p&gt;— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1414442896367915015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eYxdTB"&gt;Based on Kojima’s tweets, it seems that the new content coming to &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; isn’t missions or mechanics that had to be cut out due to time or budget. Kojima’s directorial vision for the game isn’t only now being restored; the PS5 version is just getting new elements that are created specifically for this re-release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUjzxa"&gt;It’s a misuse of the idea of a director’s cut that Sony has already started to lean on with the recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559264/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-sony-ps4-ps5-sucker-punch-iki-island"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which adds a new island to explore with added story content, characters, armor, and enemies; a long-awaited fix for proper lip-syncing for the game’s Japanese voiceover; and DualSense-specific features like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. They’re nice additions, but no one at Sony or Sucker Punch seems to be claiming that they’re part of &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; directors Nate Fox and Jason Connell’s original restored vision. (Neither Fox nor Connell is &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/07/01/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-arrives-on-ps5-and-ps4-consoles-on-august-20/"&gt;even mentioned in the announcement&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qqUN6T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ghost of Tsushima is getting an enhanced director’s cut on the PS4 and PS5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559264/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-sony-ps4-ps5-sucker-punch-iki-island"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="U9ztsL"&gt;Rather, it seems that Sony is using “director’s cut” as a catch-all phrase for an expanded edition of a game that it’s re-releasing for next-generation consoles with some added DLC. It’s the sort of title that gives the re-releases a veneer of artistic high ground that an “expanded edition” or “game of the year” release doesn’t. Charging an extra $10 or $30 for a PS5 version of a title with a few minor upgrades is a tough sell. But charging that price to play Kojima’s unadulterated vision of &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding &lt;/em&gt;is presumably an easier sell, even if the reality just isn’t the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tn2XKJ"&gt;Of course, contentious director’s cuts are nothing new: consider the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/3/16404444/which-blade-runner-version-to-watch-ridley-scott-theatrical-cut-final"&gt;infamous &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was based on a workprint version of the movie but wasn’t actually produced directly by director Ridley Scott. (Scott was able to produce a version of the film with total artistic control in 2007, known as &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner: The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cm1r9B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok gets a Fire TV app in the UK, France, and Germany</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/riO8ZfmY8haINXGDHBvsPt1dh7g=/201x0:2358x1438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69570785/ApplicationFrameHost_qin6ujiovB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o4yKjg"&gt;TikTok is now available on Fire TV devices in the UK, France, and Germany, the &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-is-now-on-amazon-fire-tv"&gt;video platform announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The app, which will be available starting today, lets viewers watch content from the service’s “For You” and “Following” feeds. There’s also a “Discover” page to help users find trending content. The app is available to download from the Amazon Appstore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nl68q6"&gt;The service’s Fire TV app follows its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174064/tiktok-tv-app-samsung-uk-fire-amazon"&gt;launch on Samsung TVs last year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-on-google-tv-and-android-tv-is-here"&gt;Google TV and Android TV in February&lt;/a&gt;. Thus far, these apps have been exclusive to Europe, but the company recently &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/tiktok-tv-bytedance"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it’s working on bringing them to more markets.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Meanwhile, in the US, TikTok launched an app called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357300/tiktok-amazon-fire-tv-app-launch-free-tv-mobile"&gt;“More on TikTok” on Fire TV devices&lt;/a&gt; last year. That app is limited to a more curated selection of popular videos, rather than the personalized feeds TikTok’s other apps are built around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SWAPCp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Vertical videos on landscape TVs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zss1pC"&gt;TikTok’s experiments with TV apps are seen as an attempt for the service to reach a wider audience, but they could also allow it to benefit from the premium rates associated with TV-based advertising, according to &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;. The launch of the TV apps has also coincided with TikTok’s push into longer videos. Earlier this month, it started letting all users publish videos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;up to three minutes long&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60TAwB"&gt;These TV apps present challenges for a service designed around quickly swiping through vertically shot videos on mobile. Using a remote typically isn’t as fast as a touchscreen interface, and each vertical video only takes up a small sliver of the middle of a landscape TV screen. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five ‘Dead Startups’ from Juicero to Coolest Cooler parodied as toys</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GF8gKNsq-7kGv-O5_iU_RdEG_M0=/0x0:1869x1246/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69570699/msedge_B1KdLel803.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five toys based on iconic startup failures.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://deadstartuptoys.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Dead Startup Toys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UuJpUg"&gt;For its latest drop, internet collective MSCHF is releasing five famous startup failures as miniature toys for $40 each, or $160 for a set. The &lt;a href="https://deadstartuptoys.com"&gt;Dead Startup Toys drop&lt;/a&gt; is comprised of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15357340/juicero-juicer-not-actually-necessary-for-juicing"&gt;Juicero&lt;/a&gt; juicer, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17233946/olpcs-100-laptop-education-where-is-it-now"&gt;One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)&lt;/a&gt; rugged laptop, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348766/theranos-minilab-machine-edison-scandal"&gt;Theranos miniLab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682780/jibo-death-server-update-social-robot-mourning"&gt;Jibo social robot&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21003445/coolest-cooler-update-business-tariffs-kickstarter"&gt;Coolest Cooler&lt;/a&gt;, which MSCHF calls the “poster child for the pitfalls of crowdfunding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dw3gIH"&gt;“This is not a memorialization,” MSCHF says, “but perhaps they are a form of necromancy: we celebrate their pale shadows, deprived of their original context.” Describing the toys as the equivalent to “a line of heads on stakes,” MSCHF invites us to “behold these beautiful mutants, hoisted on petards of their own solid-aluminum-unibody construction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c98Uq9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10648036"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yeDsy5"&gt;The failures range from the overly ambitious and misguided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17233946/olpcs-100-laptop-education-where-is-it-now"&gt;One Laptop Per Child project&lt;/a&gt; — which attempted to build an open-source $100 laptop for use by children in the developing world — to the Juicero juicer, which squeezed proprietary bags of pre-prepared juice roughly as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15357340/juicero-juicer-not-actually-necessary-for-juicing"&gt;a pair of human hands&lt;/a&gt;. Then there’s the Coolest Cooler, a do-too-much cooler that went through a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/18/9758214/coolest-cooler-amazon-kickstater-shipping-production-delay"&gt;chaotically mismanaged crowdfunding campaign&lt;/a&gt;. Rounding out the collection are toys based on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682780/jibo-death-server-update-social-robot-mourning"&gt;Jibo social robot&lt;/a&gt; (which had “little to no practical functionality,” according to MSCHF) and the Theranos miniLab, a printer-sized blood-testing machine that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/15/17469310/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-biotechnology-health-science"&gt;fraudulently&lt;/a&gt; claimed would diagnose a range of illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oigrt0"&gt;Many of MSCHF’s previous projects have raised the ire of the companies they’ve parodied. It recently initiated a “voluntary recall” of its run of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374480/nike-mschf-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-lawsuit-settled"&gt;unofficially modified Satan-themed sneakers&lt;/a&gt; in response to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357225/nike-sues-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-mschf"&gt;trademark dispute from Nike&lt;/a&gt;. It also received pushback from Boston Dynamics after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295091/mschf-drop-boston-dynamics-spot-paintball-gun-art-gallery"&gt;strapped a paintball gun&lt;/a&gt; to the back of one of the company’s Spot robot dogs and let members of the public control it in an art gallery. “We condemn the portrayal of our technology in any way that promotes violence, harm, or intimidation,” Boston Dynamics said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgjeCI"&gt;The limited edition toys are available now, &lt;a href="https://deadstartuptoys.com/"&gt;direct from MSCHF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California’s power grid has a big drought problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="California Drought Conditions at Lake Oroville" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-ONrCrKIGFAIQCMbEIYh9nNzZg=/2x0:5998x3997/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69570672/1324150033.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In an aerial view, houseboats whose owners chose to leave them in the lake, float at a water level nearly 200 feet below normal at the Lime Saddle Marina for Lake Oroville near Paradise, California, on June 8th, 2021. Drought has caused the water level to drop in Lake Oroville several hundred feet, leaving houseboat owners to make a choice to leave their craft in the water or to remove them since boat ramps will not reach the low level of the water as it drops lower and lower.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Carlos Avila Gonzalez / The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g1JX4H"&gt;Drought is putting pressure on California’s already stressed-out grid. As water reservoirs run dry, there’s been a significant drop in hydroelectric generation. Without enough water pressure to quickly turn turbine blades, there could be electricity shortages right when residents need it the most.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXDQLB"&gt;Rolling blackouts have already become a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20908434/california-blackouts-utilities-fires-lawsuits-san-francisco-bay-area-pge-pacific-gas-electric"&gt;new norm&lt;/a&gt; for the state as utilities shut down power lines in an attempt to avoid sparking fires during hot, dry weather. But summertime outages also occur when residents crank up their air conditioners to beat the heat and demand outpaces the available power supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p2tlef"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“California relies on hydro for so much of its demand, so any drought can put the state in a tight position.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1UIFjU"&gt;“California relies on hydro for so much of its demand, so any drought can put the state in a tight position,” said Lindsay Aramayo, an industry economist with the US Energy Information Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJ6v0a"&gt;Hydropower is a significant source of energy for the state. &lt;a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/data-reports/energy-almanac/california-electricity-data/2020-total-system-electric-generation/2019"&gt;In 2019&lt;/a&gt;, it made up about 17 percent of California’s electricity mix. And while California is no stranger to drought, this is particularly bad. More than a third of the state is experiencing “exceptional drought,” and more than 40 percent of its residents are living under a drought state of emergency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhAdSs"&gt;The two largest reservoirs in California, Lake Shasta and Lake Oroville, are both at less than half of their capacity. Water levels are even lower at Lake Mead, which hit its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527600/hoover-dam-reservoir-lake-mead-record-low-drought"&gt;lowest mark &lt;/a&gt;since the Hoover Dam was built in 1931. The drought is expected to &lt;a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/06/24/lake-oroville-level-falls-hydro-power-shut-first/"&gt;force Oroville’s hydropower plant offline&lt;/a&gt; for the first time ever. Smaller reservoirs are in trouble, too. At California’s Folsom Lake, the remains of a plane that went down in 1986 &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/16/california-folsom-lake-mystery-plane-crash"&gt;surfaced&lt;/a&gt; because the reservoir was so empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHMhB1"&gt;While farmers &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com./2021/05/23/facing-a-drought-californias-farmers-make-hard-choices/"&gt;abandon thirsty crops&lt;/a&gt; and the state’s governor &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-08/newsom-new-drought-declarations-california"&gt;pleads with residents&lt;/a&gt; to save water at home, the drought has already cut into the state’s power supply. Hydroelectric generation dropped by 37 percent during the first four months of the year compared to the same period in 2020. It’s down a whopping 71 percent compared to that time in 2019. That trend is expected to continue this year, the US Energy Information Administration &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=48616"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LISObN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Drought has already cut into the state’s power supply&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vr1tU5"&gt;Earlier this month, state energy authorities decided to purchase additional power to avoid outages this summer. It’s a step that’s only taken when a “&lt;a href="http://www.caiso.com/Documents/CapacityProcurementMechanismSignificantEvent-Intent-Solicit-DesignateCapacity-070121.html"&gt;significant event&lt;/a&gt;” poses a risk to the reliability of the grid. It could purchase energy from other states, but places it typically imports from, like the Pacific Northwest, are also &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47456"&gt;facing drought&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCRNAw"&gt;“Summer has barely begun and we have already had repeated extreme heat events creating dangerous conditions and shattering records across the country,” said a &lt;a href="http://www.caiso.com/Documents/CapacityProcurementMechanismSignificantEvent-JointStatementandLetter.pdf"&gt;July 1st joint statement&lt;/a&gt; from the heads of the California Public Utilities Commission, California Energy Commission, and California Independent System Operator. “Unprecedented” heat and drought driven by climate change are forcing California to act, the statement said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BM1C9p"&gt;Water and energy shortages may force the state to turn to more fossil fuels for electricity. Natural gas power plants frequently step in to meet peak demand during the summer. That can mean slightly higher utility bills for residents since hydropower is pretty cheap in California. A drought from 2012–2015 cost ratepayers about $2 billion, according to one &lt;a href="https://pacinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Impacts-Californias-Ongoing-Drought-Hydroelectricity-Generation-2015-Update.pdf"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by the nonprofit research group Pacific Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cQ5rkV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’d like to break that cycle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RvIsUc"&gt;There’s another problem: natural gas power plants, unlike dams, pump out greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. Droughts were actually responsible for roughly 10 percent of average annual carbon dioxide emissions from generating power in California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington from 2001 and 2015, according to a &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/press-releases/2018/12/21/droughts-boost-ehydropower-dries/"&gt;Stanford analysis&lt;/a&gt;. All of those emissions fuel more climate change, which, in turn, drives even more severe droughts in the Western US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ys3Emf"&gt;“That’s a bad cycle, and we’d like to break that cycle, so that during droughts we’re making up our lost hydro power with other non-carbon [polluting] energy sources,” says Peter Gleick, climate scientist and president emeritus of the Pacific Institute. The good news is there’s now more solar and wind energy online to fill in the shortfall from hydropower. But Gleick is still concerned that the drought will ultimately result in more pollution while further stressing California’s power grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuBDwA"&gt;“It’s really an indication that we’re going to have to invest in strengthening the grid across the country in the face of climate change,” Gleick says. &lt;/p&gt;
