    <title>NZXT’s H1 PC case gets recalled after that whole ‘catching on fire’ thing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NZXT H1" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/08RLYnJrO5M_raXkvSZq4riVjoc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832999/nzxth1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This case has been recalled, which is a shame as it looks stunning&lt;/em&gt; | NZXT&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gipiLS"&gt;PC case and peripheral maker NZXT has recalled its H1 mini-ITX case due to the possibility of a fire hazard under normal use (via &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nzxt-officially-recalls-h1-case-us-canada"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you used the metal screws included with the $350 case to secure your graphics card or other PCIe device to the riser, there was a chance you’d create sparks, or a fire, if it came into contact with a trace in the printed circuit board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eslzg"&gt;NZXT seemed to know this &lt;a href="https://info.nzxt.com/h1-safety-notice/"&gt;in late 2020&lt;/a&gt; when it opted to send out nylon plastic screw kits for H1 owners (upon request) to use in place of the metal ones. But it didn’t issue a full recall at that point, instead opting to resume selling the case. It &lt;a href="https://blog.nzxt.com/details-on-h1-case-safety-issue/"&gt;initially stated&lt;/a&gt; that the issue affected “fewer than ten H1 cases,” but more recently &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA"&gt;YouTube channel Gamers Nexus&lt;/a&gt; argued that the nylon screws don’t solve the root problem. If owners ever switched to using a metal screw in the rise, they’d reintroduce the possibility of a fire. It could also spell trouble for people who use metal screws and aren’t aware of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Wp3FS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9XIKOSrQdQ0?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1261&amp;amp;start=1261" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JatXuK"&gt;Gamers Nexus helped to further expose this hazard in a series of videos (here’s parts &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XIKOSrQdQ0&amp;amp;t=0s"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjUscSRLwks&amp;amp;t=0s"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDWxiFvUtE&amp;amp;t=0s"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;), showing its work along the way, which essentially proved the design to be flawed — and dangerous. According to its research (and confirmed by NZXT &lt;a href="https://blog.nzxt.com/a-message-from-our-ceo-johnny-regarding-the-h1-safety-issue/"&gt;in the FAQ section of this post&lt;/a&gt;), the screw’s thread can brush up against the trace in the circuitry as it’s twisted into place. Gamers Nexus worked with NZXT and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), a government agency, &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/NZXT-Recalls-H1-Computer-Cases-Due-to-Fire-Hazard"&gt;which issued a Fast Track recall of the PC case on February 12th&lt;/a&gt;. CPSC says you should stop using the recalled case, a situation which isn’t convenient ever — especially during a pandemic when it’s tougher to get a different case quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CwUK4H"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QtCqXM"&gt;The recall affects 32,000 cases sold in the US, along with about 1,024 sold in Canada. The CPSC notes that the recall involves “cases with model numbers CA-H16WR-W1 (matte white) and CA-H16WR-B1 (matte black) and serial numbers 1200233400001 to 1203962204202, 00648999610844189725 to 00648999610844206361, and 0120AC00100001 to 01211C01900285.” You can find that info on the bottom of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FP4pkT"&gt;As noted on the CPSC site, if you’re affected, you can call NZXT toll-free at 888-965-5520 from 11AM to 9PM ET (8AM to 6PM PT) Monday through Friday, or contact the company by email at &lt;a href="mailto:h1support@nzxt.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;h1support@nzxt.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;online at &lt;a href="https://info.nzxt.com/h1-recall/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://info.nzxt.com/h1-recall/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nzxt.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287950%2Fnzxt-h1-pc-mini-itx-case-recall-cpsc-gamers-nexus-nylon-metal-fire-hazard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.nzxt.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and click on “Contact” then “Customer Support” for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMC A-List subscribers can now wait until July to reactivate due to lack of new Hollywood releases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Entertainment &amp;amp;amp; Tourism Industries In New York City Struggle Under Pandemic Restrictions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zK_6MVqt5A1GTiylpo_-X7RlX9Y=/0x117:5187x3575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832903/1292873510.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zYopNh"&gt;AMC Theatres has announced another extension for subscribers of its Stubs A-List membership who are mulling over when to reactivate. Now, existing members of the MoviePass-style plan can wait until July to decide whether they’d like their plan to resume or whether they’ll cancel instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BNwNh"&gt;Previously, AMC said in November it would give subscribers a deadline of March 1st to reactivate or cancel their membership. Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, AMC Theatres has allowed its A-List members to keep their plans but pause payments due to widespread theater closures and a severely constricted pipeline of new Hollywood releases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6QDrc"&gt;AMC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17482918/amc-subscription-moviepass-stubs-a-list"&gt;launched A-List in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, following MoviePass’ meteoric rise and prior to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20872984/moviepass-shutdown-subscription-movies-helios-matheson-ted-farnsworth-explainer"&gt;disastrous crash&lt;/a&gt;. The service, an extension of the AMC Stubs rewards program that lets customers pay around $20 per month (although more in markets like California and New York) to see three movies per week, quickly became a huge boon to AMC’s business, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2019/05/amc-stubbs-a-list-800000-moviepass-members-number-1-subscription-movie-ticket-1202619105/"&gt;amassing 800,000 subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in its first year. Yet A-List, like the theater business at large, has been hit hard by COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KxXFmh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AMC is hoping summer 2021 will help Hollywood and the theater industry turn the corner&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mSJAf2"&gt;It looks like AMC is now signaling that the new release schedule won’t be improving at the very least until this summer. The company would likely much rather keep people signed up with the prospect of becoming paying customers again in the future rather than risk letting a once-paying subscriber cancel altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ay6bLk"&gt;“We understand that it still may be less than ideal to reactivate your membership at this time. Since there is not a steady stream of new releases, we have once again extended the pause on your A‑List account for four additional months, until July 1, 2021,” AMC wrote in an email to existing A-List subscribers. “We anticipate a robust movie calendar by summer, so all A‑List memberships that remain in a paused state are planned to be automatically reactivated on July 1, 2021.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNR1wV"&gt;With vaccinations on the rise and various states in the US slowly reopening, there is a strong possibility that AMC’s prediction of a robust summer theater schedule pans out and brings in waves of new attendance. And &lt;em&gt;Collider&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://collider.com/upcoming-movies-2021-release-dates/"&gt;up-to-date 2021 release calendar&lt;/a&gt; does show some promising midyear releases on the horizon, like Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;(May 7th) and &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick &lt;/em&gt;(July 2nd). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlaeEK"&gt;However, some of the most high-profile releases of last year that were delayed due to COVID-19 are still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243496/bond-uncharted-ghostbusters-movie-delays"&gt;not scheduled until the second half of 2021&lt;/a&gt;, including Denis Villeneuve’s &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; adaptation (October 1st), the newest Bond entry &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die &lt;/em&gt;(October 18th), and &lt;em&gt;Matrix 4&lt;/em&gt; (December 22nd). There’s also no telling whether the pace of COVID-19 vaccination will make it largely safe to resume indoor activities come this May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gUyRn"&gt;AMC last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248335/amc-bankruptcy-debt-movies-delay-streaming"&gt;staved off bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; by raising nearly $1 billion in new funding since December of last year, just shortly before the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;shares received a temporary boost&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the hordes of Reddit retail investors promoting GameStop and similar stocks. That means AMC should be on more solid ground until at least the summer months, when the company expects Hollywood releases and theater attendance to turn the corner. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is ordering way more kids’ content to compete with Netflix and Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Dk3bxBN5Zgv9pwTknC3Z-WH-_M=/195x0:1317x748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832726/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_3.46.56_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eqJEaI"&gt;With orders for new shows, specials, and movies from some of Cartoon Network’s biggest franchises — including &lt;em&gt;Ben 10&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Teen Titans Go!&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; The Amazing World of Gumball — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeHBOMaxisOrderingWayMoreKidsContent02172021&amp;amp;source=verge"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; is leaning hard into kids’ and family content in an effort to compete with top players like Netflix and &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeHBOMaxisOrderingWayMoreKidsContent02172021&amp;amp;source=verge"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2prJF"&gt;At the center of WarnerMedia’s plans to make HBO Max a must-have streaming service for families in the way that Disney Plus and Netflix have is “unveiling” Cartoon Network as the core family brand at WarnerMedia. The &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/ca/media-release/hbo-max/warnermedia-expands-kids-family-offerings-cartoon-network-and-hbo-max-under-new"&gt;new series and specials ordered&lt;/a&gt; for HBO Max will join a library of shows and movies that make up 3,000 hours of content. Branding is important — and hard — but it’s what works for a studio like Disney. Disney Plus is built around its biggest franchises, including Pixar, which makes it an easy sell for families. By leaning into Cartoon Network, which already has a dedicated hub on HBO Max’s homepage, and producing more content, WarnerMedia is likely hoping that some families will spend more time on HBO Max instead of Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBWY2r"&gt;Kids’ content is a hot commodity, and it’s not difficult to see why. A Morning Consult &lt;a href="https://morningconsult.com/2020/08/20/youtube-netflix-and-gaming-a-look-at-what-kids-are-doing-with-their-increased-screen-time/"&gt;study from August 2020&lt;/a&gt; found that YouTube and Netflix ranked as the top two platforms on which kids aged five to 12 spend time. Roughly 65 percent of kids pick YouTube as their go-to entertainment source, while 55 percent pick Netflix. At the same time, cable networks like Nickelodeon are losing large swaths of their audience — seeing a drop of nearly 50 percent of its viewership between 2015 and 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnchmielewski/2020/02/24/viacomcbs-has-lost-its-children-nickelodeon-is-looking-for-them-on-youtube/?sh=256e156b7a70"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; While viewership on cable is down, the time kids spend on screens is way, way up. They’re just getting it directly from streaming platforms and apps like YouTube or TikTok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dI6b1U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;WarnerMedia is likely hoping that some families will spend more time on HBO Max instead of Disney Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LfT1VL"&gt;Another study found that about &lt;a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/355322/78-of-us-households-now-have-one-leading-svod-s.html"&gt;55 percent of households&lt;/a&gt; are interested in having two subscription-based streaming services (think two premium subscription services like Netflix and HBO Max). If companies are trying to figure out how to scale their streaming platforms, and then keeping said subscribers, giving families everything they need in one place is crucial. Streaming platforms have to be something for everyone when everyone is looking for something. That’s especially true right now when people are stuck at home looking to keep themselves and their family members entertained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qH8bzz"&gt;For HBO Max, a platform that is most associated with adult-oriented TV shows and films, it’s tougher to get the “family” message across. AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey told a virtual audience &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/john-stankey-att-warnermedia-restructuring-hbo-max-1234809499/"&gt;during a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; conference&lt;/a&gt; that part of HBO and HBO Max content head Casey Bloys’ new job was figuring out a way to allocate content spending, which will “hit that entire breadth of the family.” While HBO orders teen-centric shows, like &lt;em&gt;Euphoria &lt;/em&gt;and the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Generation&lt;/em&gt;, Cartoon Network (and shows like &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt;) will likely have a bigger presence on HBO Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEFxDa"&gt;WarnerMedia isn’t the only company trying to figure it out, either. Today, Apple announced a multiyear deal with Skydance Animation, which will include feature films and shows targeted at families. YouTube announced that its YouTube Kids app has more than 35 million weekly viewers, and it’s giving parents more customization power to let kids watch even more within the app. Netflix has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287965/tim-burton-live-action-addams-family-spinoff-wednesday-for-netflix"&gt;Wednesday Addams series from Tim Burton&lt;/a&gt; that will likely find a tween and teen audience. Finally, next week ViacomCBS will unveil its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238502/paramount-plus-launch-date-cbs-all-access-streaming-event-shows-movies"&gt;Paramount Plus streaming service&lt;/a&gt;, including talking about how Nickelodeon and family content fits into the company’s strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vtgXgj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For HBO Max, a platform that is most associated with adult-oriented TV shows and films, it’s tougher to get the “family” message across&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eGmxzQ"&gt;WarnerMedia has the right tools to be a leader in the kids’ and family space, too. Cartoon Network is a treasure trove of IP. Add in &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Looney Toons&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and streaming rights to the Studio Ghibli collection in the United States, and there’s a lot for kids and families to watch. That’s on top of Warner Bros. films, HBO shows, and more. The only issue WarnerMedia still faces with HBO Max is getting that message out. Again, families know what they’re getting with Netflix and Disney Plus — what they get with HBO Max isn’t always as obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 12 series is already driving 5G adoption in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3vAkeyL_t_xPNV7uq5rUlpNvT38=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832611/cgartenberg_201105_4276_006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The $1,099 iPhone 12 Pro Max is currently the top 5G phone in the US, according to research firm M Science.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ArLmxh"&gt;Some new data &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/one-phone-dominates-us-5g-sales-can-you-guess-what-it-is"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; indicates that the iPhone 12 Pro Max, 12 Pro, and 12 are already the three top-selling 5G phones in the US. That the phones are just four months old speaks to the continued popularity of the iPhone in the US and just how big of a role it will play in driving 5G adoption in this country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04QSPM"&gt;These reports come from research firm M Science’s sales data and information gathered from Ookla Speedtest users. M Science tracks cumulative sales of 5G phones in the US. This data set includes sales as of the week of January 23rd and notably does not include Galaxy S21-series phones, which hadn’t started shipping at that point. These are third-party reports, so they should be taken with a grain of salt, but M Science’s findings line up with previous reports of &lt;a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/iphone-12-series-launch-review/"&gt;strong 12 Pro Max sales&lt;/a&gt; out of the gate and &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/iphone-12-mini-sales-reportedly-well-below-expectations/"&gt;less-good 12 mini sales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LSPm5E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple is responsible for a bit less than half of all mobile phone shipments in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kfB53P"&gt;Apple, as it is wont to do, took its time adding 5G to its phones. Samsung started in 2019 with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18231384/samsung-galaxy-s10-5g-verizon-announcement-specs"&gt;Galaxy S10 5G&lt;/a&gt; and added 5G &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21128230/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-ultra-price-camera-5g-features-video-hands-on"&gt;across its S20 series&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. Outside of those two manufacturers, 5G has trickled down from a once-premium feature into the budget phone class more recently. Despite this growing range of options, adoption has been slow. Since Apple is responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/us-market-smartphone-share"&gt;a bit less than half of all mobile phone shipments&lt;/a&gt; in the US, it makes sense that a 5G iPhone would give adoption rates a nudge. So far, that seems to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x21j74"&gt;In the US, 5G’s slow start certainly hasn’t been helped by a less-than-stellar product. While each major carrier offers nationwide 5G coverage, performance is often about the same as 4G — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196060/verizon-5g-slower-than-lte-speed-test"&gt;sometimes even worse&lt;/a&gt;. That’ll change when more spectrum becomes available to the carriers later this year and into next, but not before a lot of new iPhone 12 owners (unfortunately?) experience 5G for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Burton is making a live-action Addams Family spinoff about Wednesday for Netflix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NqhS7EVC2_ApxmDQdvJrVeIfprk=/47x0:797x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832520/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Hnfyb"&gt;Director Tim Burton is making a new live-action &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/wednesday-addams-takes-center-stage-in-new-netflix-live-action-series"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addams Family&lt;/em&gt; spinoff series for Netflix&lt;/a&gt;: a coming of age series focused on Wednesday Addams that will fittingly be called &lt;em&gt;Wednesday&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BK8aq0"&gt;The show — which has yet to announce any details on cast or release date — will mark Burton’s directorial debut for television. Burton is known for his work on gothic horror and comedy, and his filmography includes movies like&lt;em&gt; Beetlejuice&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Nightmare Before Christmas&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Corpse Bride&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Dark Shadows&lt;/em&gt;, as well as the campy superhero films&lt;em&gt; Batman &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Batman Returns. &lt;/em&gt;A live-action Addams Family spinoff would seem to fit perfectly in his oeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BW50PJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Are you ready for the best Wednesday ever? A Wednesday Addams live action series following the spooky icon’s coming of age is coming to Netflix. And with it, Tim Burton will be making his TV directorial debut! &lt;a href="https://t.co/rKQ7oZU645"&gt;pic.twitter.com/rKQ7oZU645&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NX (@NXOnNetflix) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1362129695651753984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NOVBii"&gt;In addition to Burton, &lt;em&gt;Wednesday&lt;/em&gt; will also feature &lt;em&gt;Smallville&lt;/em&gt;’s Alfred Gough and Miles Millar as showrunners and executive producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ruGuI"&gt;According to a blog post announcing the series, the first season of &lt;em&gt;Wednesday&lt;/em&gt; will span eight episodes and follow Wednesday Addams as she heads off to attend the “peculiar” Nevermore Academy. The show will see Wednesday deal with relationships around school, her psychic abilities, and mysteries surrounding both a murder in the local town and her parents’ own supernatural pasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uaDJq9"&gt;The new series is apparently unrelated to previous adaptations of the comedic horror franchise, which most recently was adapted into an animated film in 2019, featuring the voices of Oscar Isaac, Charlize Theron, Chloë Grace Moretz, Finn Wolfhard, Nick Kroll, Snoop Dogg, and Bette Midler as the various members of the titular family. A sequel to that animated &lt;em&gt;Addams Family&lt;/em&gt; film is set to hit theaters on October 1st, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit’s lead GameStop hypebeast is being sued for his role in the stock surge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TdcYQ8Q9CYZsga1_oEP4d0KZ1Ms=/0x0:1788x1192/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832476/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_9.35.15_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roaring Kitty/Keith Patrick Gill&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uSGCNJ"&gt;“Roaring Kitty,” also known as u/DeepFuckingValue on Reddit and Keith Patrick Gill in real life, is now the target of a lawsuit (which you can view below) that claims he manipulated the market to increase GameStop’s stock price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Li0Eo"&gt;The lawsuit claims that he created a “fake persona” of an investment newbie, while actually having several financial certifications and working for an insurance company. That company, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, is also named as a defendant, with the case saying that it should’ve prevented Gill from talking about the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6h2fWB"&gt;Gill is well known on the WallStreetBets subreddit, where he’s been &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1g7x0/hey_burry_thanks_a_lot_for_jacking_up_my_cost/"&gt;posting for a year&lt;/a&gt; about GameStop’s stock, its value, and how much he has invested. He would also post &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAGEeYpAto4"&gt;hourslong videos on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; discussing the stock and why he thought it was undervalued. The videos are absolutely packed with financial jargon and discussion about GameStop’s business model and position in the market. He was even &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/keith-gill-drove-the-gamestop-reddit-mania-he-talked-to-the-journal-11611931696"&gt;profiled by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the stock began to soar, which reported that he was set to make tens of millions of dollars from his investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6kDsF"&gt;But the legal complaint claims that Gill’s 10 years in the finance and investment industries, along with the financial licenses and qualifications he has, don’t square with the “amateur, everyday fellow” persona he put out on his YouTube channel, Reddit account, and Twitter — and that he used that persona to illegally manipulate the market by posting about it to his “legion of fans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYRv1t"&gt;However, that “legion” consisted of around 529 subscribers on YouTube, and 550 followers on Twitter, as of December 25th, 2020, &lt;a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BA/BA00/20210218/111207/HHRG-117-BA00-Wstate-GillK-20210218.pdf"&gt;according to Gill’s written testimony&lt;/a&gt; for the House Financial Services Committee, which was also released today. In it, he claims that he was very clear that his advice wasn’t meant for most investors, and that he posted his analysis to social media to both share it and receive critiques on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhCZgM"&gt;Lawyers argue that his financial certifications also made it illegal for him to share claims about stocks that he knows are “false or misleading,” which the plaintiff claims he did. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v_sEBUna9aIN1KA3wdMmxErRZhQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310190/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_10.11.52_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The list of securities licenses and qualifications the suit claims Gill has. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zHm5tJ"&gt;The complaint also tries to paint Gill as something of a mastermind, claiming he personally “incited a market frenzy” on Reddit and “actively recruited traders” on YouTube and Twitter as part of a plan to profit while damaging others’ finances in the process. The plaintiff claims they lost money in the case after the stock’s value shot up, allegedly due to Gill’s manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlNfR6"&gt;Even the plain clothing he wore in videos was part of Gill’s scheme to defraud, lawyers suggest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VNa8K2"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20485494-02-16-21-gamestop-complaint/?embed=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="02-16-21-gamestop-complaint (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aJAYC1"&gt;Gill &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/13/22281698/ceo-reddit-robinhood-roaring-kitty-testify-gamestop-hearing-congress-stocks"&gt;is slated to speak at a congressional hearing about GameStop trading on February 18th&lt;/a&gt;, along with the CEOs of Reddit and Robinhood. The hearing aims to determine if there was market manipulation involved in the rapid rise and fall of the GME stock. In his statements, which were released before the hearing, Gill claims that he “did not belong to any groups trying to create movements in the stock price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlEarh"&gt;The plaintiff in the case hopes to turn it into a class action suit, and the law firm behind it, Hagens Berman, &lt;a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/gme"&gt;has set up a page&lt;/a&gt; for investors to send in their complaints. The firm has had success with class actions in the past; it’s won notable settlements from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/21/11991526/apple-ebook-price-fixing-refunds-begin-for-consumers"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/visa-mastercard-atm"&gt;Visa-Mastercard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/volkswagenaudi-emissions"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJDLCC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 17th, 4:13PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statements from Gill’s written testimony, which was released before the hearing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Special thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simonghales?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@simonghales&lt;/a&gt; for all his incredibly hard work, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikebodge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@mikebodge&lt;/a&gt; for laying the groundwork, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cyberdees?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@cyberdees&lt;/a&gt; for encouraging me to apply to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GrantForTheWeb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GrantForTheWeb&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/AOdzNvCeha"&gt;pic.twitter.com/AOdzNvCeha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Andy Baio (@waxpancake) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/1361752495400259584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zLyxup"&gt;As you explore a Skittish world, you’ll be able to catch snippets of conversations or overhear something exciting going on thanks to spatial audio, which makes sounds fade in and out depending on how near you are to the source. (If you’ve played a game with &lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/friday-the-13th-sea-of-thieves-and-how-proximity-chat-continues-to-be-online-gamings-most-exciting-evolution-in-years/"&gt;proximity-based voice chat&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a similar concept.) If you hear something interesting, you can mosey over to it to learn more, like you might at an in-person event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzRmBS"&gt;And if you’re the one organizing an event on Skittish, the platform is designed to give you lots of tools to craft a space that’s tailored to your needs. Baio showed me an early version of Skittish, and it was simple to place not just environmental objects like rocks and trees, but also entire screens playing YouTube videos and even portals to new areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PKRlr"&gt;Baio also sees an opportunity for Skittish to be used by creators to host things like private meetups for supporters or as a place to debut a new YouTube video or a song. And I could totally see it — with how flexible the Skittish spaces seem even at this early stage, I think there’s a lot of possibility for people to use them in creative ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lLy3jE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The project was inspired by Baio’s time attending virtual events during the pandemic”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7v6Hyy"&gt;The project was inspired by Baio’s time attending virtual events during the pandemic — many of which weren’t all that great, by his estimation. “A lot of them didn’t feel like events to me,” Baio said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “They weren’t social in any meaningful way.” Some felt like “sort of like watching a YouTube video with a chat room,” while others had elements like breakout rooms that were intended to recreate a social experience that just weren’t the same as an in-person event. (And Baio &lt;a href="https://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2019/09/12/seven-years-of-good-luck-at-the-xoxo-festival/"&gt;knows how to pull off good events&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVZzWB"&gt;But Baio still did see good event virtual spaces, like 2020’s &lt;a href="https://roguelike.club/event2020.html"&gt;Rougelike Celebration&lt;/a&gt;, which had a custom-built social space that &lt;a href="https://dev.to/lazerwalker/using-game-design-to-make-virtual-events-more-social-24o"&gt;resembled an old-school text-based adventure game&lt;/a&gt;, and LikeLike’s experimental online video game exhibitions, which include a “&lt;a href="https://likelike3d.herokuapp.com/#"&gt;First Person Soother&lt;/a&gt;” and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21209548/likelike-online-experimental-art-games-gallery-itsy-bitsy-crisis"&gt;pixelated gallery space / MMO&lt;/a&gt;. Baio also spoke highly of some of the hit games of the pandemic, such as &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, which he played “like every day for months and months.” Those events, games, and the idea of using proximity chat all provided inspiration for what would eventually become Skittish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2nk3d"&gt;Baio tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he plans to add things like text chat, moderation tools, and more customization options to Skittish. He plans to charge for the service and may offer a limited free tier at some point, but there are financial costs and concerns about moderation to consider with a free tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URkdEk"&gt;“You can’t just ignore the potential problematic uses of social spaces,” Baio says. “You can’t just say, ‘we’ll just open it up to everybody and we’ll just see what happens.’ You have to be cognizant of the potential misuse, abuse, and harm that could be done when creating a social platform. Having an unlimited free tier without having the moderation resources to understand how it was being used would be irresponsible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgMcfq"&gt;The project is still early, with no set timeline for when it might be available to more people. But if you want to help with beta testing, or just want to keep up to date on the project, there’s a &lt;a href="https://skittish.com/"&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt; you can sign up for now.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zillow’s 3D Home app can now use AI to guess the size of your house</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/esVcWiVQB8sYOAnQtPrNebH3gLo=/39x137:2669x1890/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832426/Zillow3DHomeTour.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zillow&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d6Wrxl"&gt;Zillow’s 3D Home app can now generate home floor plans based on scans a user uploads, &lt;a href="http://zillow.mediaroom.com/2021-02-17-Zillow-Launches-Next-Generation-3D-Tours#assets_28775_137692-135:22124"&gt;the company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The new feature, powered by the company’s artificial intelligence technology, is available today in the Zillow 3D Home app and could prove useful for people looking to relocate during the pandemic — or just anyone fantasizing about living in a mansion in Nebraska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSX17c"&gt;Zillow 3D Home &lt;a href="http://zillow.mediaroom.com/2019-04-22-Zillow-Launches-AI-Powered-3D-Home-Tours-Across-United-States-and-Canada"&gt;was originally launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; as a way to offer customers a more immersive way to view listings on its site and real estate agents and property managers an easier way to create them. Using a phone or a 360° camera and the Zillow 3D Home app, you can upload a series of photographs that the app can stitch into a 3D tour. It’s not quite the same as wandering through an open house, but it could tell you more about a space than photo or video tours can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AEwNcQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Zillow can generate a floor plan of your house based off photos you upload&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RwLV53"&gt;The new AI-generated floor plans add another layer of information to that equation. Anyone viewing a listing on Zillow’s site or app with a 3D Home tour and floor plan available can click on a specific room in the floor plan to jump to that part of the tour. Zillow says the floor plans can be uploaded for use in industry-standard sites like an MLS (multiple listing service). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFIRgk"&gt;Beyond just generating a map of your home, Zillow also says the AI can predict the dimensions and square footage of rooms based on the photos you upload. It’s hard to say without testing just how accurate the AI is at guessing these measurements, but with the feature available now in 25 markets, with more coming over the course of the year, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to try for yourself soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbUP71"&gt;Expanding 3D Home’s features makes sense for people looking to relocate during the pandemic without the ability to necessarily view a home safely, but it could also speak to Zillow’s awareness of its use as a source of entertainment for millions of people stuck at home. The whole idea is captured pretty succinctly in a recent Saturday Night Live skit featuring actor and writer Dan Levy, focused on using Zillow to “spice up” people’s love lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k7jGl1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yEfsaXDX0UQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tg0Ksg"&gt;Zillow knows it’s used for escapism, Zillow CEO Rich Barton admitted as much in &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/zillow-hopes-to-turn-real-estate-porn-users-during-covid-into-actual-sales.html"&gt;a CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;interview where he acknowledge the skit&lt;/a&gt;. Capturing people who enjoy “Zillow Surfing,” as &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/zillow-hopes-to-turn-real-estate-porn-users-during-covid-into-actual-sales.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ Taylor Lorenz explored&lt;/a&gt;, could be improved by making Zillow more engaging, and piling on different ways to “experience” homes is a good way to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcFoUm"&gt;Whether those people ever get funneled into buying or renting a home is a whole other problem, but if Zillow remains popular, there’s a good chance they’ll head there first when they’re ready to move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y843IJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTocYm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFhPf5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nomad’s rugged leather iPhone 12 cases now come with MagSafe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wW-mVhVPfjngex-xEjTyaqNXQC8=/0x84:5000x3417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832362/iPhone_12_Series___Rugged_Case___MagSafe___Lifestyle_01___Rustic_Brown.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L19jlq"&gt;Nomad has updated its lineup of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fcollections%2Fiphone-12-cases&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287731%2Fnomad-rugged-leather-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rugged leather iPhone cases&lt;/a&gt; for the iPhone 12, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max, and 12 mini with the much-anticipated addition of support for Apple’s MagSafe charging standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQLDrF"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Frugged-case-magsafe-horween-leather-rustic-brown-iphone-12-pro-max&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287731%2Fnomad-rugged-leather-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$59.95 for the regular case&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Frugged-folio-magsafe-horween-leather-rustic-brown-iphone-12-pro-max&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287731%2Fnomad-rugged-leather-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79.95 for the folio-style one&lt;/a&gt;, the Nomad cases aren’t cheaper than, say, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHKF3ZM%2FA%2Fiphone-12-12-pro-leather-case-with-magsafe-saddle-brown%3Fafid%3Dp238%257Cs2WYrmxgd-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_487089504857_pgrid_121054926211_%26cid%3Daos-us-kwgo-pla-btb--slid---product-MHKF3ZM%2FA&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287731%2Fnomad-rugged-leather-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s official leather MagSafe cases&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, they’re actually $10 more than &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Frugged-case-horween-leather-rustic-brown-iphone-12-pro-max&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287731%2Fnomad-rugged-leather-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nomad’s original line&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Frugged-folio-horween-leather-rustic-brown-iphone-12-pro-max&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287731%2Fnomad-rugged-leather-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;of iPhone 12 cases&lt;/a&gt;, which look virtually identical from the outside. (The new MagSafe cases will replace the older models once stock runs out, the company says.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8zSAyq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KxylumIPCk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3wpQ4I"&gt;But the Nomad cases are more solidly put together than Apple’s own offerings. As the “rugged” in the name suggests, the Nomad models feature a plastic shell and rubber frame that promises to protect the phone against drops from up to 10 feet. That protection does come at a cost, though: only the back of the case is actually covered with leather (which is the same Horween leather that Nomad uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176171/nomad-new-leather-macbook-pro-sleeves-luxury-expensive-price-release-date-hands-on"&gt;on its other products&lt;/a&gt;). In 2017, my colleague Dan Seifert said the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16744278/apple-iphone-x-leather-case"&gt;iPhone X version of the case&lt;/a&gt; “feels more like a leather skin on top of a rubber case than a full leather experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uzFO6"&gt;The standard Rugged Leather case is available in three colors: black, brown, and natural leather, while the Rugged Folio case comes in black and brown. Both models are available to order today from Nomad’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
