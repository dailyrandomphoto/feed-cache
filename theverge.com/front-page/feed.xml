    <title>WhatsApp begins testing a yellow pages-style business directory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QWoGji3-OfC6t9PD760h3gqVqT0=/0x0:3840x2560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69865539/E_Vsa4mVEAEul1L.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvQOnZ"&gt;WhatsApp is piloting a new business directory in São Paulo, Brazil that lets users find local shops and services with a presence on the app, the service’s head &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1438175348533829635"&gt;Will Cathcart has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Screenshots show how WhatsApp will show businesses sorted by categories like “grocery store” and “restaurant,” before letting users chat directly with them. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/whatsapp-business-idUSKBN2GB1SV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the test will include thousands of businesses in the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbTnmT"&gt;Although the Facebook-owned messaging service is most famous as a person-to-person messaging service, e-commerce has become an increasingly important part of its offering in recent years. As of last October, WhatsApp reported that &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/shopping-payments-and-customer-service-on-whatsapp"&gt;over 175 million people globally&lt;/a&gt; used the service to message a WhatsApp business account every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ovXeLN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I'm excited we’re starting to pilot a local business directory within &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;.  This will help you find and contact local businesses, like your neighborhood coffee shop, florist, clothing store and more.&lt;a href="https://t.co/kNvUtn7FWR"&gt;https://t.co/kNvUtn7FWR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Will Cathcart (@wcathcart) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1438175339541188608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kNeXLd"&gt;WhatsApp has offered a standalone app for small businesses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/19/16908810/whatsapp-business-app-launch-small-businesses"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and since then has added features like support for product catalogs and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163106/whatsapp-carts-feature-shopping-in-app-ecommerce"&gt;shopping carts&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22420029/whatsapp-payments-brazil-launch-regulations-fight"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552325/whatsapp-payment-service-india-launches-regulatory-approval-upi-graded-ncpi"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also started offering in-app payments, letting users make purchases &lt;a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/payments/business/br"&gt;directly from businesses&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to sending money to friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RefIMP"&gt;But this e-commerce push created problems for WhatsApp earlier this year when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;updated its privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;. The changes were widely interpreted as giving WhatsApp the ability to share data from people’s personal chats with Facebook, when in fact the changes only applied to chats with businesses, which may see data stored on Facebook servers. The new policy generated an outcry, with WhatsApp competitors &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1349014065931284480"&gt;Telegram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk"&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt; reporting a surge in new users in response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYHYHY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1438175348533829635"&gt;Cathcart said&lt;/a&gt; WhatsApp is not logging users’ location or which businesses they browse when using the new directory feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R79zDw"&gt;As well as its app for small businesses, WhatsApp also offers a WhatsApp Business API to connect larger businesses with customers. It’s notable for being one of the few ways WhatsApp is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/1/17636418/facebook-whatsapp-ads-monetize"&gt;monetized directly&lt;/a&gt;, since it currently doesn’t show ads like Facebook and Instagram. Although WhatsApp reportedly backed down from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069422/facebook-whatsapp-ads-sales-advertising-plans"&gt;immediate plans to show in-app ads last year&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s vice president of business messaging Matt Idema told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that “over the long term” he expects ads to be part of WhatsApp’s business model “in some form or another.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gV08Nt"&gt;Although the pilot is limited to one city in Brazil for now, Idema said that India and Indonesia were among the candidates for expansion in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1D3PE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqhV5y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Electric scooter startup Gogoro is going public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WnoYYOUurldpR7Kv0Ai4NHOz138=/450x0:2880x1620/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69865521/gogoro_1_burnout.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Gogoro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cOGFX8"&gt;Gogoro is the latest EV company to jump on the trend of going public by merging with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;, or SPAC. The Taiwanese e-scooter and battery-swapping tech startup announced Thursday that it will combine with a SPAC called Poema Global Holdings, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The deal — which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022 — will net Gogoro around $550 million, and will value the startup at more than $2.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imR1KZ"&gt;It’s a huge step for the scooter company, which has been rapidly expanding this year. In April, Gogoro announced a partnership with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394575/gogoro-india-hero-motorcorp-electric-scooters-battery-swap-stations"&gt;largest two-wheeler manufacturer&lt;/a&gt; in the world to bring its electric scooter and battery tech to India. That was Gogoro’s most major push outside of Taiwan to date — until May, when it announced an expansion into China through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440780/gogoro-china-electric-scooters-battery-swap-dcj-yadea"&gt;two more partnerships with established local players&lt;/a&gt;. Then, in June, Gogoro announced a &lt;a href="https://about.bach.gogoro.com/news/foxconn-gogoro-partnership-battery-swapping-smartscooters/"&gt;partnership with Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn&lt;/a&gt; — which has been rapidly pushing into electric vehicles — that is supposed to “accelerate Gogoro’s global expansion” even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUFk5x"&gt;Foxconn is contributing an undisclosed amount to the so-called “Private Investment in Public Equity” portion of the SPAC merger — essentially a fundraising round that happens concurrently with the transaction. (The PIPE will contribute a total of a little more than $250 million, while $345 million will come from the Poema Global Holdings SPAC.) The iPhone assembler is also working with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569992/foxconn-fisker-wisconsin-electric-vehicle-factory-talks"&gt;EV startup Fisker Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, and has a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-foxconn-geely/geely-and-foxconn-form-partnership-to-build-cars-for-other-automakers-idUSKBN29I0P9"&gt;deal with China’s largest private automaker&lt;/a&gt;, Geely. It’s also been developing its own EV platform for other automakers to use. (At least one of its forays into EVs has failed, though, as &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/Apple-supplier-Foxconn-s-EV-project-with-China-s-Byton-halted"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reported this week&lt;/a&gt; that Foxconn has walked away from its investment in struggling Chinese startup Byton.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnI2Ud"&gt;Founded in 2011 by a pair of former HTC executives, Gogoro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7484171/gogoro-smartscooter-electric-scooter-removeable-battery"&gt;came out of stealth mode at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show&lt;/a&gt; where it revealed a slick electric scooter powered by two small swappable batteries. (In fact, it won our “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/9/7509787/verge-awards-best-of-ces-2015"&gt;best in show&lt;/a&gt;“ award that year.) The company has spent the six years since executing on the vision it laid out during that debut: building out an expansive network of battery-swapping stations across Taiwan that make it easy for owners to quickly “recharge” their scooters. Gogoro takes the tech even further, though, by letting those battery-swap stations interact with — and occasionally help power— the local electrical grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1oD1n"&gt;The company has also toyed with some other ideas along the way. It has offered its two-wheelers up for a number of different scooter-sharing programs around the world. And it also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344679/gogoro-eeyo-1s-e-bike-review-score-price-date"&gt;released a “sports car” of an e-bike in 2020&lt;/a&gt; meant to promote an all-in-one motor that the company designed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet’s Project Taara laser tech beamed 700TB of data across nearly 5km</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Project Taara link" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UMDaaIcOoqLvFtDmfPbJfKihNAE=/0x109:1179x895/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69865487/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Project Taara link | Image: X&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1c2BOG"&gt;In January, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243484/alphabet-google-shutting-down-loon-internet-balloon-company-x"&gt;shut down Project Loon&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative exploring using stratospheric helium balloons to distribute wireless internet (an attempt to use solar-powered drones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/11/14240236/alphabet-ending-stopping-solar-drone-titan"&gt;folded in 2017&lt;/a&gt;). However, some technology developed as a part of the Loon project remained in development, specifically the Free Space Optical Communications (FSOC) links that were originally meant to connect the high flying balloons — and now that technology is actively in use providing a high-speed broadband link for people in Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2czUXj"&gt;Sort of like fiber optic cables without the cable, FSOC can create a 20Gbps+ broadband link from two points that have a clear line of sight, and Alphabet’s moonshot lab X has built up &lt;a href="https://x.company/projects/taara/"&gt;Project Taara&lt;/a&gt; to give it a shot. They started by &lt;a href="https://blog.x.company/exploring-a-new-approach-to-connectivity-861a0159f63e"&gt;setting up links in India a few years ago&lt;/a&gt; as well as a few pilots in Kenya, and &lt;a href="https://x.company/blog/posts/taara-beaming-broadband-across-congo/"&gt;today X revealed what it has achieved&lt;/a&gt; by using its wireless optical link to connect service across the Congo River from Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo and Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B3lg6z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The wireless optical link achieved 99.9 percent availability over 20 days&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dwHaMX"&gt;In 20 days, Project Taara lead Baris Erkmen says the link transmitted nearly 700TB of data, augmenting fiber connections used by local telecom partner Econet and its subsidiaries. The reason for testing the technology in this location is not only the climate, which the team admits is better suited to wireless optical communications than a foggy city like San Francisco but the obstacle created by the deep and fast-flowing river. The cities are only a few miles apart as the crow flies, but Taara says a fiber link to Kinshasa has to run nearly 250 miles (400 kilometers), making it five times as expensive to get online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKCcmk"&gt;Despite sending its communications without the protection of a physical fiber, Taara says that during the test period, its link had 99.9 percent availability. The team tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that end users don’t know when their communications are using FSOC instead of fiber and that it aims to provide an indistinguishable experience. They also said that they hadn’t experienced any weather conditions in the Congo that affected the connection on this link so far. They credit its resilience in the face of haze, light rain, birds, and other obstacles to the ability to adjust laser power on the fly, as well as improved pointing and tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Project Taara pointing and tracking system" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jUye7h_veVKEUVmdMHdw_mAO2S0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22854621/unnamed.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: X&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Project Taara pointing and tracking system&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JpZ20J"&gt;Project Taara links are placed high up, naturally, since they need to be able to see each other, and as you can see in the GIF above, they’re capable of automatically adjusting their mirrors to connect “a light beam the width of a chopstick accurately enough to hit a 5-centimeter target that’s 10 kilometers away.” The system can adjust itself within +/-5 degree cone, and the team says that if that fails for some reason, they can attempt to remote control them into a connection before sending technicians out. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How do you cross-examine a whistleblower?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5fD94ICUNGdCKI-QrFBnWGC1Mxs=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69865023/1235132528.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;David Odisho / Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Theranos lab assistant-turned-whistleblower Erika Cheung testifies in the Elizabeth Holmes wire fraud trial&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZLmaDL"&gt;Erika Cheung, who took the stand yesterday for her direct testimony, which continued today, is known for being one of John Carreyrou’s sources for his &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;blockbuster article about Theranos&lt;/a&gt;. You know, the article that’s part of the reason we are now witnessing US v. Elizabeth Holmes. (Holmes is on trial for several counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCMDX5"&gt;Cheung is, famously, one of the people who blew the whistle on Holmes. She’s even &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/erika_cheung_theranos_whistleblowing_and_speaking_truth_to_power?language=en"&gt;given a TED talk about it&lt;/a&gt;. The other major source for Carreyrou was her friend, Tyler Shultz, who also worked at Theranos and was the grandson of one of the board members. He is expected to testify later in the trial, since he tried to bring problems in the lab to Holmes’ attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GfI6QG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t feel comfortable running the patient sample.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Kxu3Y"&gt;At Theranos there were two labs, Cheung testified: the research and development lab and the clinical lab. She worked in both, starting with the R&amp;amp;D lab. Her position in both labs was largely the same — an entry-level job that involved running quality control tests to make sure the machines were working properly. About a quarter of the Theranos machines failed the test at any given time, Cheung said. By comparison, the commercially available machines failed much less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0WFjS"&gt;Theranos was Cheung’s first job out of college, and she worked there only about six months. During that time, she testified, she saw problems with the Theranos blood tests that gave her serious pause about their use on patients. In one email we saw today, Cheung wrote that she was happy to do quality control on a hepatitis C sample to confirm the test worked, but “I don’t feel comfortable running the patient sample,” she wrote. She didn’t want to give results to a patient from something that failed so often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQf97D"&gt;Cheung was “stressed and uncomfortable with what was going on,” she said on the stand. “Behind closed doors, we have all these problems and they [patients] think they have accurate results” they can use for medical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ev2qgl"&gt;Cheung’s testimony established what the policy was for running VIP samples at the Theranos labs, that some results were thrown out so that machines could pass quality control, and that Cheung raised her concerns quite high up the food chain — though never directly to Holmes. Instead, Cheung talked to both Sunny Balwani, Holmes’ co-defendant who is being tried separately, and George Shultz, a member of Theranos’ board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w51cdJ"&gt;Balwani told her she was unqualified to critique Theranos, and that she should unquestioningly run the tests or quit. So she quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SI0ke6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The failures in the lab aren’t really in question&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WQ0JED"&gt;She eventually went to Carreyrou and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which are the regulators that oversee those labs. As a result, she was served with threatening legal papers by Theranos’ law firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWSZXs"&gt;The failures in the lab aren’t really in question — the defense acknowledged them in opening statements. Those failures, argued Lance Wade, Holmes’ lawyer, just weren’t Holmes’ fault. And so, in his cross, he made a point of establishing in tedious detail all the experts that Cheung worked with, and the existence of their PhDs and medical degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LygSMi"&gt;And instead of trying to call Cheung’s credibility into question, Wade used Cheung to introduce the people in her chain of command — emphasizing her distance from Holmes. He also used her to introduce documents about lab regulations from CMS. There was a 120-page long document that set out standards from the lab assistants like Cheung to the very top of the lab. Per these regulations, a lab assistant — the lowest-level employee — must have a bachelor’s degree in science. That means Holmes wasn’t qualified even to do that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="3l6xQv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The person who supposedly invented this revolutionary technology couldn’t work in her own lab&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YZMBIo"&gt;You can look at that two ways. One is that Holmes, unqualified founder, couldn’t have known how bad things were in the lab because she didn’t have a degree. The other is that it is &lt;em&gt;a big red flag &lt;/em&gt;that the person who supposedly invented this revolutionary technology couldn’t work in her own lab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pHjLG"&gt;Wade also went through documentation that showed that throwing out “outlier” samples was mentioned — bolstering his opening argument that nothing Theranos was doing was secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEpKyE"&gt;We saw pages of documentation with signatures affirming the procedures. Cheung was asked to read the signatures aloud. None of them belonged to Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="RS9hqA"&gt;It’s still possible Wade will rip Cheung apart on Friday — I’ve seen some gnarly cross-examinations — but this approach so far is like water. He’s agreeing with some of the damning things Cheung has to say, but laying the blame elsewhere. For the defense, it’s maybe the smartest move on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xxsstu"&gt;Sony’s update adding the much-anticipated support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22664808/ps5-playstation-5-update-m2-ssd-sony-software"&gt;for M.2 SSD storage expansion is here&lt;/a&gt;, letting you install more PS5 games than the 825GB built-in SSD allows. When the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599593/sony-ps5-m2-ssd-support-beta-features"&gt;first launched in beta&lt;/a&gt;, Sony provided a &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd"&gt;list of requirements&lt;/a&gt;, making it clear that you wouldn’t necessarily be able to just grab any SSD and chuck it in your PS5. We’ve tried to list as many of the compatible ones as we can, as stock has seemingly been hit pretty hard — the more options you have, the more likely you are to actually get your hands on one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="E1aa6b"&gt;Which SSDs work with the PS5?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="jV7ZmR"&gt;Sony’s main requirements are that the SSD is PCIe Gen4 and at least 250GB. However, Sony makes it very clear that your SSD needs a heatsink, which can complicate things, given the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1420811116083662855"&gt;limited amount of space in the PS5’s SSD bay&lt;/a&gt;. What SSDs you’ll want to consider will depend on whether you want to install a heatsink yourself or not, and whether you’re a “play by the rules” type or a “let’s see what I can get away with” type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SrTNPU"&gt;The best no-hassle SSDs: Install them and never think about it again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FD0cFH"&gt;WD told us that, based on Sony’s requirements, its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fwestern-digital-500gb-black%2Fp%2FN82E16820250184" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WD Black SN850 drives&lt;/a&gt; (available in 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB capacities) would work, and that it was in the process of testing compatibility. The drive easily surpasses Sony’s speed recommendations, but you’ll want to make sure you’re buying the version with a heatsink — for the 1TB model, the heatsink version costs $20 more than the non-heatsink version and has a big orange line on the front. It’s also the SSD that the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cerny/status/1421686135936348161"&gt;PS5’s lead system architect bought for himself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RnZs9N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678003"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XvsMRw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/seagate-confirms-its-first-ps5-ready-ssd-will-cost-275-for-1tb/"&gt;Seagate says&lt;/a&gt; its upcoming &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fseagate-500gb-firecuda-530%2Fp%2FN82E16820248196" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Firecuda 530 drives&lt;/a&gt;, which have the option for an included heatsink, will work in the PS5 as well. When they release at the end of August, it’ll be $160 for a 500GB model, $260 for a 1TB model, and $540 for a 2TB model. You can tell the heatsink models by the orange vertical stripe near the connector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RidVXB"&gt;If you can &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fgigabyte-1tb-aorus-gen4-7000s%2Fp%2FN82E16820009022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;find one in stock&lt;/a&gt;, Gigabyte’s 1TB &lt;a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Solid-State-Drive/AORUS-Gen4-7000s-SSD-1TB#kf"&gt;Aorus Gen4 7000s SSD&lt;/a&gt; has a built-in heatsink, and runs at 7,000MB/s. (Note: If you’re willing to spend a ton of money on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-Nanocarbon-Aluminum-Heatsink-GP-AG70S2TB/dp/B08XY93JT3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 2TB model&lt;/a&gt;, you may have better luck finding it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="9xK7Cv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A helpful guide to installing an SSD in a PS5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="0rbha4"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tM2YBF"&gt;PS5 heatsinks: For those willing to put in some work and / or roll the dice a little&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="y2wIlm"&gt;For an SSD that meets the speed requirements, Crucial told us its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fcrucial-1tb-p5-plus%2Fp%2FN82E16820156280" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;newly announced P5 Plus SSD&lt;/a&gt; is compatible with the PS5, but you’ll need to install your own heatsink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9nyhSC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683698"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfPqDn"&gt;Heatsinks should be low profile — for the ones that are just going over the top of the SSD, &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd"&gt;Sony wants you to add&lt;/a&gt; no more than 8mm of height, including the heatsink and thermal interface. Because of that, low-profile heatsinks like the ones below are going to be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5UZipZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683722"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ZCfuOb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683838"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RutnfF"&gt;If you’re looking to go all-out on speed but are still okay with installing a heatsink, Samsung’s blazingly fast 980 Pro is another option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u5Dq1S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fPlE7H"&gt;If you’re looking at the 980 Pro, this heatsink from EK Water Blocks is compatible with single-sided SSDs. It also fits within Sony’s height requirements (and looks pretty, though it’ll be buried in your PS5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2hyUeJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10677975"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SNr0zx"&gt;If you’re willing to stick to 1TB of storage, Sabrent’s Rocket 4 Plus is another option. It does come in 2TB and 4TB capacities, but those seem to be double-sided, meaning that heatsinks for them are much more difficult to find. &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/sabrent-rocket-4-plus-m2-nvme-ssd-review"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, though, the 1TB version is single-sided, making PS5-compatible heatsinks for it readily available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8CLWhH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Ucha1H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T7bRzv"&gt;If you’re looking for something that’s got a built-in heatsink, but you’re willing to roll the dice on speed, Patriot’s Viper Gaming SSD matches Sony’s requirements. However, it falls short of Sony’s recommended speed, though it’s still rated as a Gen4 SSD. There’s also Gigabyte’s Aorus NVMe Gen 4 SSD, which has an official speed rating that’s lower than Sony’s recommendations, though &lt;a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/us/Solid-State-Drive/AORUS-NVMe-Gen4-SSD-1TB/sp#sp"&gt;the company says&lt;/a&gt; it runs at 5,600MB/s when plugged into a PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="urMepF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10677939"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="OQEv9p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10755341"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="X28FsF"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WpBZfA"&gt;I’m a loose cannon willing to bend the rules to expand my storage.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FyM2Ph"&gt;Some SSDs are double-sided, meaning that they have chips on both the front and back of the PCB. We reached out to StorageIO’s storage analyst and operator Greg Schulz to see if that meant that both sides needed to be covered by a heatsink, and he told us that “the denser the packaging, the more need to remove the heat.” According to him, the heat would have to be dealt with by airflow (which the SSD in the PS5 doesn’t seem to have much access to), or other methods ranging from “heat sinks to small fans to thermo tape among other approaches depending on packaging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eBWZNn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to find a heatsink compatible with double-sided SSDs and Sony’s size requirements&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oNjQg8"&gt;For that reason, we’re putting the double-sided SSDs without included heatsinks into this category. While there are plenty of heatsinks that are compatible with double-sided SSDs, I struggled to find many that weren’t taller than Sony recommended (though we’ll come back to that note in a bit). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pd11AB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683818"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RfyjaF"&gt;If you can’t find a double-sided compatible heatsink that fits with Sony’s specifications, you’d either have to run the SSD with a heatsink on only one side and just hope it doesn’t overheat, or you’d have to try to MacGyver on two ultra-slim heatsinks like the ones below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V64oEq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tMxi8y"&gt;So with all those warnings out of the way, here are the SSDs for those who like to live on the edge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eef8LC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to"&gt;We’ve tested&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fsabrent-rocket-nvme-4-0-1tb%2Fp%2F1Z4-00H3-00016" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sabrent Rocket NVMe&lt;/a&gt; ourselves (though without a heatsink). It comes in 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB capacities, and despite the fact that it’s slower than Sony’s recommended speed, it seemed to work just fine. It does &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/sabrent-rocket-nvme-40-m2-ssd-review-a-high-performance-value"&gt;appear to be double-sided&lt;/a&gt;, though, so the heatsink situation may be sketchy. The same goes for the 2TB and 4TB versions of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sabrent-Internal-Extreme-Performance-SB-RKT4P-2TB/dp/B08P2CG4JK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;faster Rocket 4 Plus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GsEjLU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10677993"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JPio4X"&gt;Our contact at Sabrent told us that he had tested the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F0D9-001Y-00027" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company’s own heatsink&lt;/a&gt; in a PS5 and that it fit — despite the heatsink’s listed height being way outside Sony’s spec (it’s just over double the height). He says that the console can close back up with the heatsink on, and provided pictures, but it’s still going in this category because of how different it is from Sony’s numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqOonx"&gt;Finally, there’s the PNY XLR8 CS3040. It meets all of Sony’s requirements and recommendations, but it also &lt;a href="https://www.servethehome.com/pny-cs3040-1tb-pcie-gen4-nvme-ssd-review/"&gt;appears to be double-sided&lt;/a&gt;. Again, this means your mileage may vary when it comes to heatsinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fDvOUS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10677952"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="cAY7TT"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FFmqmE"&gt;SSD speed and spec requirements if you want to find one for yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xB4eVB"&gt;Sony says your SSD has to be at least Gen4 and have at least a 250GB capacity. It also recommends SSDs that run at 5,500MB/s or faster. PCIe Gen3 SSDs aren’t supported (we tried), and neither are SATA ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-pUtS16ODVV1WvJqvxenGHAyRcM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748004/photo1627558599.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s requirements screen that shows up when you install an incompatible drive. In this case, it was a Gen3 drive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G5aqAw"&gt;SSD size requirements: what size will fit?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OCS8df"&gt;The PS5 is compatible with 2280-type SSDs, which seems to currently be the most widely available size. You can see a list of all the sizes the PS5 supports on Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd"&gt;requirements page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RTjJiB"&gt;What are Sony’s heatsink requirements?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0XrQbU"&gt;It depends on whether the heatsink goes on one side of the SSD or encloses it on both sides, but Sony has diagrams &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd"&gt;on its requirements page&lt;/a&gt; that show the exact measurements that will fit. Basically, though, SSDs with a built-in heatsink, or a double-sided one attached, can be up to 11.25mm tall. If you’re using a single-sided heatsink, you’re limited to one that adds less than 8mm of height. The maximum height not only includes the heatsink, but the thermal pads you use to attach it to your SSD as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bF75ow7OtsXQRYS1PyYn3_cUVtQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757183/m2_heatsink_double_sided_en.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony has very specific size / spacing requirements for SSD heatsinks, so you’ll want to pay close attention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EVryHS"&gt;You’ll also want to make sure your SSD and heatsink are compatible; heatsinks come in the same sizes as SSDs do, and the sizes have to match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQKa8b"&gt;As noted previously, you’ll also want to pay very close attention to whether your SSD is single or double-sided. That can be hard to determine from the product pictures, so you may want to either wait until you actually have your SSD in hand to order your heatsink or take a careful look at the heatsink’s compatibility list (if it has one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XQFlAs"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="leqych"&gt;When in doubt, check it out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ma521S"&gt;Sony warns that even a drive matching all of its requirements may still not work. If you don’t want to deal with uncertainty, it’d be best to stick to the SSDs that people have tested and know are good, rather than trying to wander into the Newegg wilderness to find one for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmAPqt"&gt;If you’ve picked up an SSD for your PS5, you can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to"&gt;our install guide here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX launches its first private crewed mission to space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zlRdLYfytlao0lWPhidnyR7k6LE=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69864733/IMG_6341.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KP79gQ"&gt;SpaceX launched four private citizens to space on Wednesday, kicking off the first-ever crewed mission&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to orbit without any professional astronauts on board. Dubbed Inspiration4, the mission marks the latest private foray into space as companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX compete to normalize space travel for paying tourists, not just government astronauts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhsGjT"&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket lifted off on time at 8:02PM ET from the company’s 39A launchpad at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, soaring from Florida’s east coast under clear night skies. Inside the capsule is billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, a trained pilot and founder of payment-processing firm Shift4 Payments, and three others he picked and paid for to ride with him: Hayley Arceneaux, a 29-year-old physician assistant and cancer survivor; Christopher Sembroski, a data engineer at Lockheed Martin; and Sian Proctor, a geoscientist and former NASA astronaut candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3K8aZW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Dragon capsule and crew are in a nominal orbit”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="otHuHT"&gt;The crew was buckled inside SpaceX’s Crew Dragon &lt;em&gt;Resilience &lt;/em&gt;capsule at the top of the rocket, reusing the spacecraft that sent four government astronauts to the International Space Station nearly a year ago. But for Inspiration4, the capsule won’t dock to the space station. It’s poised to spend roughly three days orbiting Earth at a higher altitude, some 360 miles above ground — the farthest human spaceflight since the last NASA space shuttle mission to repair the Hubble telescope in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOSExg"&gt;Roughly nine minutes after liftoff, Falcon 9’s first stage booster returned to Earth for a landing on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean. Minutes later, the Crew Dragon capsule separated from the rocket’s second stage as it was leaving Earth’s atmosphere, sending the Inspiration4 crew further toward orbit. The capsule will spend the next hour and a half gradually raising its orbit via intermittent thruster firings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GpFyi"&gt;“The Dragon capsule and crew are in a nominal orbit,” SpaceX engineer and livestream anchor Andy Tran said. A live camera from inside the capsule showed the crew waving and giving double thumbs up. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8aNH4RmqDNMa_Mn2w8qqp5UXLPo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22854133/Sep_15_2021_20_37_13.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="75fYH7"&gt;The mission serves as a multimillion dollar fundraiser for St. Jude Children’s Hospital, a non-profit research center that also provides free care for kids with cancer. Isaacman donated $100 million to the hospital and, with the Inspiration4 mission, aims to raise another $100 million. That part of the fundraiser has raised about $30.8 million so far. Isaacman, bankrolling most of the mission, won’t say how much he paid for each Crew Dragon seat, but they typically cost roughly $55 million a pop, according to a government watchdog report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWa6ML"&gt;Inspiration4’s Crew Dragon capsule was tailored for a more touristy experience than what NASA astronauts have on their trips to the ISS. Months before the mission, SpaceX installed a massive glass dome, where the capsule’s station docking door normally is, to give Inspiration4 passengers a 360-degree view of space while in orbit. Though the glass dome hasn’t been tested in space, SpaceX’s director of crew mission management, Benji Reed, said it was put through a rigorous testing and qualification process before validating it as safe for flight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i5ue_zMb94QZiADNdb4Isl3Cz_g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22854140/_MG_5194.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Joey Roulette/The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Exhaust from SpaceX’s Falcon 9 is illuminated by the sun just after liftoff, which occurred less than an hour after sunset.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Babuhu"&gt;The crew has a few activities planned during their stay in orbit — Sembroski is expected to play a ukulele made by Martin Guitar that’s stowed onboard as one of the several sponsorships riding along for the mission. Proctor brought along poetry and some personal art. And the whole crew is participating in a study on the effects microgravity has on the human body. SpaceX, Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH) at Baylor College of Medicine and investigators at Weill Cornell Medicine will collect biological samples from the passengers before the mission and plan to gather biomedical data on the passengers during the mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6HknX"&gt;Exactly where and when the capsule reenters Earth’s atmosphere after its three-day mission depends on the weather conditions around the coasts of Florida. The capsule can spend up to a week in orbit if need be, Isaacman has said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Usu9rw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 8:45 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with photos and additional information from SpaceX’s livestream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple rumors were wrong</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mKHVS98oRvLVujwbE22WM_qpH0E=/243x0:2637x1596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69864614/Screen_Shot_2021_09_15_at_1.34.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4822ua"&gt;For many who follow tech news closely, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;Apple’s event on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; had a few big surprises — not because there were completely unexpected announcements, but because we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;didn’t see things we really thought we’d be getting&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors that had enough smoke to be almost a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21508779/apple-iphone-12-october-event-what-to-expect-hi-speed-rumors"&gt;sure-fire thing in previous years&lt;/a&gt; ended up falling flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpQrSZ"&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knom6u"&gt;The Apple Watch was rumored to get a complete redesign, featuring flat edges and a flat screen. We saw this design in renders, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-watch-series7-cad-larger-display/"&gt;reportedly leaked CAD files&lt;/a&gt; (which act as a 3D blueprint for products), and even heard that it’d be happening from noted Apple reporter Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-12/what-s-new-about-apple-aapl-iphone-13-and-apple-watch-series-7?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;two days before the event&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;the Apple Watch that showed up on stage&lt;/a&gt; does have some design tweaks, it looks nothing like what we were expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N1vUzoxNV7Zba4LIgjYD0Afx0nc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850146/Capto_Capture_2021_09_14_01_24_25_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Series 7 has a refined version of the same design we’ve had for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="scaNm7"&gt;Another notable analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, also &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/12/kuo-airpods-3-to-be-announced-at-september-event-airpods-2-to-remain-in-the-lineup/"&gt;reported days before the event&lt;/a&gt; that Apple would debut a new set of AirPods, redesigned to include shorter stems. The wireless earbud redesign has also been &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-26/apple-developing-smaller-airpods-pro-revamped-entry-level-model?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;rumored for months&lt;/a&gt; by Gurman, we’ve even &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/airpods-3-redesign-new-images/"&gt;seen alleged pictures of them&lt;/a&gt;, and some noted publications wrote that Apple was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;set to start production on the buds in August&lt;/a&gt;. With this rumor, though, it’s possible that just the timing was off, and that Apple will release them at an (of course!) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1437140403803672581"&gt;already-rumored future event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mddFlo"&gt;Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/18/iphone-13-always-on-display/"&gt;also suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone 13 could feature an always-on display, thanks to the (accurately rumored) LTPO display that could theoretically allow for the low refresh rate needed to make always-on not destroy the phone’s battery. The always-on rumor was also &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/14/iphone-13-always-on-display-matte-back/"&gt;backed up by well-known leaker&lt;/a&gt; Max Weinbach earlier this year. Alas, Apple didn’t announce this display feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672551/iphone-13-display-lock-screen-always-on-variable-refresh-android"&gt;has been a staple on Android phones&lt;/a&gt; for years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OlWDU1hldO__KA_AdXUW7bHsRj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850539/iW5zNz7dVo.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro has a display that could enable always-on, but the feature is absent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IEO7Ea"&gt;There was also just some general weirdness with rumors this time around. Only a few weeks before the iPhone 13 was announced, Kuo wrote that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647252/the-iphone-13-5g-leo-satellite"&gt;it might have the ability to communicate with satellites&lt;/a&gt;, letting you make calls or texts without cell service. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22649340/apple-iphone-13-satellite-connectivity-emergency"&gt;The next day&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; offered its own interpretation, saying that Apple was working on a satellite communications feature for emergency use, and that the iPhone 13 may include hardware for it, but probably not software. However, when the iPhone 13 spec page hit Apple’s website, it &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/that-whole-iphone-satellite-thing-was-bogus"&gt;didn’t include any mention&lt;/a&gt; of the cellular bands that started the starry-eyed rumors in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e9w6RR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rumors have always needed a grain of salt, but this year seemed to have some big misses&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SHA3DM"&gt;Of course, rumors have always had to be taken with a grain of salt, as anyone trading in them is almost certainly going to be working with incomplete information. Still, some of the big names like Kuo and Gurman get it right so often — the rumors about the iPad Mini redesign, high refresh-rate iPhone display, and smaller notch all came true, and we even saw the rumored cinematic camera mode. Success like that, and how accurate rumors have been in years past, can make it easier to forget the tenuousness of rumors — no matter how many times &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1429768663658377218"&gt;people like Marques Brownlee remind us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Na5eAM"&gt;This isn’t to laugh at those who believed the rumors, or say that there’s no place for rumors in the buildup to events — it can be exciting to feel like we’re getting a peek at what’s coming next, and to start thinking about whether we’ll pick up the new device, and how we’ll use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUvsSK"&gt;P.S. Remember this moment if Apple announces something that looks suspiciously like a Mac event later this fall. This isn’t to say that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;14- and 16-inch redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; with all the ports and processing power you ever wanted &lt;em&gt;aren’t &lt;/em&gt;coming, but treating them as a sure thing could lead to some real heartache. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7YkH6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung begins mass-producing 90Hz OLED laptop screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user uses the ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED, drawing on the touchpad with a stylus and operating the Asus Dial. The laptop sits on a small circular table with scattered pens to its left." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lAIxJM7jFOjMrY06rHj0Vu77BmE=/0x0:1731x1154/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69864570/ProArt_Studiobook_16___Pro_16_OLED_H5600_W5600_Unbeatable_combination_of_CPU___GPU_power.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OLED lives on this ProArt Studiobook 16.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Gc38E"&gt;Samsung Display is following through on its promise to ramp up OLED production. The company has begun mass-producing laptop-sized 90Hz OLED panels, which will appear in multiple upcoming 14-inch laptops from Asus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNizcl"&gt;“The demand for laptops is increasing steadily as working from home and remote learning become the new norm,” Asus Vice General Manager Y.C. Chen said in a statement. “OLED displays can meet consumers’ various needs as they’re using laptops for school, virtual meetings, video streaming, gaming, and more.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfC3PS"&gt;In a statement, Samsung Display said, “The 90Hz OLED panel offers more options for consumers who are looking to enjoy high-performance content on their laptops. With our innovative OLEDs, we’re further pioneering and leading the market in display technologies that offer superior image quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3a0MvG"&gt;Samsung Display first announced that it would soon begin mass-producing OLED panels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242005/samsung-display-oled-laptop-production-90hz-14-inch"&gt;back in January&lt;/a&gt;, though it did not specify a list of partners. “OLED panels can best satisfy the diverse consumer needs for laptops used in telework, online education, video streaming, and gaming,” the company &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210120005673/en/Samsung-Display-to-Introduce-First-90Hz-OLED-Laptop-Display/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-Q-tiwWZwkcswR1UZtV7eGe24xL9TZOyQUMS3J72mJlQ7fxFuNFTHSunhvli30RlBNXya2izy9YOgHlBiZQk2LOzmn6JePCpHPCiYGaEx4DL1Rq8pNwkf3AarimpDzQGuQ=="&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; at that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x6uBu1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“OLED panels can best satisfy the diverse consumer needs for laptops used in telework, online education, video streaming, and gaming.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SuIZ32"&gt;While this is Samsung Display’s first official confirmation that mass-production has begun, the announcement shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who’s been watching the laptop market. With a few exceptions, OLED has largely been featured on large, high-end laptops in recent years — but it’s soon to become much more commonplace in smaller and more affordable notebooks, if recent OEM announcements are anything to go by. In the past month, major manufacturers including Asus and Lenovo have announced a slew of OLED laptops across sizes and price tags, many with a 90Hz option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUyqql"&gt;Per Samsung, the new 90Hz panels will appear on an upcoming 14-inch Zenbook (presumably the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22652934/asus-zenbook-14x-oled-laptop-ultraportable-notebook-samsung-screen-display"&gt;Asus Zenbook 14X&lt;/a&gt;) and 14-inch Vivobook Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JU4xwj"&gt;The Zenbook 14X, which Asus announced September 2nd, will be available with either a 4K OLED HDR display or a 2.8K OLED 90HZ display, with models starting at $1,399.99. (That’s a jump from Asus’s most recent ultraportable OLED Zenbook, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538867/asus-zenbook-13-oled-review-amd-ryzen-specs-features-price"&gt;Zenbook 13&lt;/a&gt;, which has an FHD OLED screen and &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM090000002/A17602-ASUS-ZenBook-13-Ultra-Slim-Laptop%2C-13.3%E2%80%9D-OLED-FHD-NanoEdge-Bezel-Display%2C-Intel-Core-i5-1135G7%2C-8GB-LPDDR4X-RAM%2C-256GB-SSD%2C-NumberPad%2C-Thunderbolt-4%2C-Wi-Fi-6%2C-AI-noise-cancellation%2C-UX325EA-DS51"&gt;starts at $799.99.&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="We6Lcv"&gt;Asus has also outfitted a number of its product lines with new OLED panels. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22652549/asus-proart-studiobook-16-pro-oled-vivobook-expertbook"&gt;ProArt StudioBook 16 OLED and ProArt StudioBook 16&lt;/a&gt;, expected in Q4, are among the first 16-inch laptops to include 4K OLED HDR displays. The 14-inch, 15-inch, and 16-inch models in the budget-oriented VivoBook line (starting at $749.99) have also been outfitted with OLED, as has the dual-screen ZenBook Pro Duo 15 and the company’s ultra-light ExpertBook business line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nK3VCG"&gt;Not to be outdone, Lenovo also announced a slew &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661307/lenovo-ideapad-slim-7-carbon-oled-screen-light-laptop"&gt;of OLED notebooks&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month (also using Samsung OLED panels). An IdeaPad Slim 7 Carbon with a 90Hz OLED screen is coming in October, which Lenovo claims will be the lightest 14-inch OLED laptop on the market at just 2.37 pounds. (That will be a QHD+ OLED screen, lower resolution than the 4K panel on the Zenbook 14X). Also expected in October is the 13.3-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22660761/lenovo-chromebook-duet-detachable-release-oled"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet 5&lt;/a&gt;, an OLED Chrome OS tablet with a detachable keyboard case. Starting at just $429.99, it’s likely to be one of the most affordable laptops ever to feature OLED technology.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 event was a case study in Tim Cook-era product refinement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nY-wgBmscZppIFjXnbt-lR0xykI=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69864483/caZMw9TLgc.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L12bxo"&gt;For the past ten years, Tim Cook’s greatest accomplishment as Apple CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;has been vastly more of the same&lt;/a&gt;. More iPhones, more iPhone accessories, more apps, and &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; more money. While the Mac and iPad have occasionally fallen into disrepair, the company keeps coming back with new reasons to buy its greatest hits every year — and this year’s iPhone 13 event is a near-perfect case study in how far refinement can take you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfHWL7"&gt;As my colleague Jon Porter points out, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675797/iphone-13-12s-upgrade-cycle-iterative-improvements"&gt;the iPhone 13 is effectively the iPhone 12S&lt;/a&gt;, an iterative, incremental update to last year’s phones instead of something that feels brand new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dXLvBc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tim Cook’s Apple, ten years later","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fZSCix"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Almost everything got better&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9rX6ak"&gt;But oh, what an update. What company wouldn’t dream of being able to say they improved the processing power AND the battery life AND the cameras AND the displays AND the storage capacity AND the connectivity AND the design in the course of a single year, all without changing the price one bit? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wS1uT"&gt;In 2021, the same $829 you’d pay last year now buys you &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; the storage, a whopping 2.5 additional hours of quoted battery life, more 5G bands, and an additional 175 nits of brightness over the iPhone 12, plus the 47 percent larger sensor and sensor-shift stabilization system that was previously exclusively available in the $1,099-and-up iPhone 12 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673545/iphone-13-pro-camera-cinematic-mode-video-features-macro"&gt;A new cinematic video mode&lt;/a&gt; isn’t exclusive to the Pros, either (though smooth 120Hz screens, a new macro photography mode and ProRes video will be.) And while the company doesn’t offer any real numbers to back it up, Apple claims even the iPhone 13 Mini will give you the fastest processor available in any smartphone on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FppkXh5u16t5F49SXpgCmjY-yaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853924/aCizUZJtka.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini bento box of upgrades. Notch at lower left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mg0Hef"&gt;Also, you can’t say the design didn’t change at all. While&lt;em&gt; the notch &lt;/em&gt;still exists, it’s smaller! (I like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;the iPhone 13 Pro’s blue&lt;/a&gt; an awful lot, too.) The only tradeoff I can find this year — ahead of our reviews, that is — is that the iPhone 13 lineup is oh-so-slightly thicker and heavier. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22674143/apple-iphone-13-pro-12-samsung-galaxy-pixel-android-comparison-specs"&gt;You can find our comparison charts here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kd0ptM"&gt;This year’s iteration is so compelling that I’m vaguely tempted to upgrade my perfectly good iPhone 12 Mini to get that better camera with sensor-shift and an additional hour or so of battery life. (I probably won’t, since the announcement means the resale value of my existing phone has likely already tanked, but I do worry Apple might still cut off the Mini next year due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;reportedly lackluster sales&lt;/a&gt;.) If I had an iPhone 11 or earlier, it’d be a no brainer — I’d definitely be preordering one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665165/apple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u12G4J"&gt;The story’s a little bit different with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;the 6th-gen iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, mind, since it starts $100 higher than before at $499. But the upgrade incentives are still strong: it’s a crystal-clear update over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;its predecessor&lt;/a&gt; with a larger and higher resolution 8.3-inch screen despite its slightly smaller and lighter frame, with a magnetic connector to dock a 2nd-gen Apple Pencil. It’s got the A15 Bionic chip from the new iPhone 13, but with the extra graphics core you’ll only otherwise fined on the iPhone 13 Pro. The camera’s bigger and faster at 12MP and f/1.8 (compared to 8MP and f/2.4), with 4K video for the first time, and both the Wi-Fi 6 and 5G support that the 2019 model lacked. Just don’t go looking for a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMqdPy"&gt;Apple is managing all of this during a pandemic and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;a global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;, and so far there’s only been a single indication that Tim Cook’s giant manufacturing machine can’t keep up: The new Apple Watch Series 7 was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;rumored to be delayed due to production issues&lt;/a&gt;, and while it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666305/apple-series-7-manufacturing-issues-resolved-september-mass-production"&gt;reportedly overcame them&lt;/a&gt;, we don’t have any release date for the new watch save “later this fall” and Apple’s being cagey about the details.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h2wfR6eU2cufFTX1Lpx7Ey-y5uA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853915/BCslcISSRg.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XWhnSI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1nc9br15gf0scjb/Apple%20Watch%E2%80%94Then%20and%20Now%20%28Sept%202020%29_L568943A-en_US.pdf?dl=0"&gt;A leaked spec sheet for the watch&lt;/a&gt; suggests it was supposed to ship in September alongside the new phones, but the fine print says even its specs are “subject to change without notice,” and Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment about the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlMIUA"&gt;The watch is why I say this year’s event is a &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt; perfect case study: it’s not as clear why someone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674258/apple-watch-series-7-upgrade-worth-waiting-for"&gt;would buy the Series 7 over a discounted Series 6&lt;/a&gt;, despite the larger and reportedly more durable screen. With the same battery life and no reason to believe there’s more processing power or functionality, plus a late start, it might be the one insufficient iteration this year.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Finally, some good news for Quibi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a7VfS-VJGDE9KdIW2VaMoF-04FQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69864337/acastro_200403_3960_quibi_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NkA0Kj"&gt;Quibi’s zombie may finally be able to rest its weary head. The company’s successor has settled an ongoing feud with eternal thorn-in-its-side Eko.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWXrBz"&gt;Eko, an interactive video company, and Quibi's successor QBI Holdings &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/09/15/2297837/0/en/Eko-and-Quibi-Settle-Litigation.html"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that they’d reached a settlement in the legal battle over Quibi’s perspective-shifting Turnstyle feature, which Eko alleged the streaming service had swiped from its own proprietary video technology. Both companies have agreed to dismiss their legal action against one another, and Quibi will hand over both the video technology and Turnstyle IP to Eko as part of their agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2jZtw0"&gt;“This result will help ensure that Eko remains the undisputed leader in interactive storytelling technology,” Eko boss Yoni Bloch said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xsr6v"&gt;Quibi was founded by Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman and debuted last year amid a flurry of streaming launches. The mobile-first service was meant to fit those in-between moments on the train or while waiting in line when users had time to kill on their phones, with Quibi serving up high-production-value “quick bite” videos backed by leading creators and A-list talent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XWQ366"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Katzenberg and camp are “satisfied with the outcome”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rScmCh"&gt;The problem was that the service launched amid the pandemic when those on-the-go viewers it hoped to find were stuck indoors. At first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271346/quibi-apple-ios-airplay-google-chromecast-june-tv"&gt;reluctant to implement&lt;/a&gt; casting support, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21318060/quibi-subscriber-count-free-trial-paying-users-conversion-rate"&gt;service struggled&lt;/a&gt; to hold on to paying subscribers. Quibi was plagued by myriad problems straight through to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527197/quibi-streaming-service-mobile-shutting-down-end-katzenberg"&gt;untimely demise&lt;/a&gt; less than a year after its launch, including but certainly not limited to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/3/21245864/activist-hedge-fund-eko-lawsuit-quibi-turnstyle-elliott"&gt;ongoing legal battles&lt;/a&gt; against Eko. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezwylB"&gt;Eko, an interactive storytelling platform, claimed that Quibi stole the idea for its Turnstyle technology that allowed Quibi users to view certain perspectives from a title based on the orientation of their phone in either portrait or landscape mode. Eko called Quibi’s technology “a near-identical copy of its own, from the patented smart video response system down to the way files are created, formatted and stored.” Eko was granted a patent for its own video technology in October 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mIdbM"&gt;Quibi finally shut down in December, and Roku &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220426/quibi-roku-channel-acquisition-content"&gt;swooped in&lt;/a&gt; to snap up the IP remains from its corpse for its own streaming service, The Roku Channel. But it left behind the Turnstyle tech and its legal woes, which remained unresolved prior to this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQOMDd"&gt;In a statement, Katzenberg said that his camp was “satisfied with the outcome of this litigation, and proud of the independently created contributions of Quibi and its engineering team to content presentation technology.” If only anyone had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528404/quibi-shut-down-cost-subscribers-content-tv-movies-katzenberg-whitman-tiktok-netflix"&gt;actually used it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
