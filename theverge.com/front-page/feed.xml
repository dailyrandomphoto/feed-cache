    <title>Why Demon’s Souls is my game of the year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FqcAXvuckp7tVKqt9R7qOKbDDMg=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68508948/demons_souls_screenshot_17_disclaimer_en_09nov20.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I4ERdY"&gt;I nearly gave up on &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZAK6x"&gt;I should have known what I was getting into. I bought the &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; remake for the PlayStation 5 as my opportunity to finally play a “Soulsborne” game. After hearing about the genre for more than a decade, I knew that the game would be extremely hard, that I’d die multiple times, and that the challenge was all part of the process of learning about and enjoying the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pgHvc"&gt;But I wasn’t too worried — I like hard games. I loved the early hours of &lt;em&gt;Hollow Knight&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Beating Celeste’s grueling DLC chapter was a thrill. I figured that since I had gotten through those, and because I knew &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; would be a challenge going in, I would be able to stick with it no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xIuuLc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;My resolve was tested immediately&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oxafSG"&gt;That resolve was tested immediately. I died about a dozen times in the first level by brazenly swinging my sword as a knight. Following a fit of frustrated Googling, I switched to the royalty class so that I could use a long-range magic spell that made taking on enemies easier. While that helped, I was still in over my head and dying repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4yNJY"&gt;An early level, the Prison of Hope, nearly broke me with its punishingly narrow pathways inhabited by magic-slinging tentacle-headed monsters. After yet another death (I believe it was the one where I fell down a hole after 30 minutes of barely surviving the level’s harrowing halls), I put the game down and considered the $70 I paid for it a sunk cost. I was ready to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EWb2P1cR3f_narAM0Lb05KzaJE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141828/demons_souls_screenshot_11_disclaimer_en_28oct20.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These tentacle-headed monsters haunted me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kBR1R6"&gt;But two days later, I allowed myself just one more attempt at the game. Instead of yet another hellish trip through the Prison of Hope, though, I went to the fourth world, hoping that a change of scenery might do me some good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyQWrF"&gt;Right away, I was faced with a new monstrosity: a blue-eyed skeleton wielding a giant sword that began rapidly somersaulting toward me. I thought it was all over. But using the skills I had learned taking on the tentacle-headed beasts in the Prison of Hope, I pulled off a few well-timed dodges and blasts of magic, and before I knew it, the skeleton was defeated. And then I took down the next one, and the next one, and the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Uw0sI"&gt;It was that moment that turned &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; around for me. Looking back on it, I realized that the game had been constantly teaching me how to get better, even if I didn’t know it, and that I could use the skills I was subconsciously learning to play better. The challenge was indeed part of the process. From then on, I was completely obsessed with the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qGBH2P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The rest of the game wasn’t easy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T7JH2K"&gt;That’s not to say the rest of the game was easy. At one point, that first skeleton was joined by a menacingly red demon that could defeat me in one stroke of its sword. One difficult boss stymied me when an exact clone joined the fight partway through. A later swamp-themed level was so filled with danger that I had to inch my way through, fearing that any crucial mistake could cost me nearly an hour of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRFIa7"&gt;But thanks to that first lesson with the skeletons, I learned that every challenge in &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;, no matter how hard it might seem, could eventually be overcome. I kept at it. And as sappy as it sounds, it’s kind of a beautiful lesson for real life, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwodQa"&gt;I plan to try later games like &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt; or the &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, but for now, I can revel in my victory of having seen the credits roll in &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;. I’m glad I didn’t give up, because I got to experience my favorite game of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pornhub just removed most of its videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pTP5kgyAJCfHIbM6sF1zqxgx6Sc=/0x134:740x627/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68508942/pornhub-billboard-1-sq.0.0.1438872408.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Pornhub&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZwonH2"&gt;Pornhub is removing all videos uploaded to its site by unverified users, millions of videos in total, as part of a crackdown on user-uploaded content after two major payment processors suspended service. The decision, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqjjy/pornhub-suspended-all-unverified-videos-content"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, stems from &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; that found the site was hosting videos of people who are underage and videos showing children being assaulted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47jS6O"&gt;The site announced last Tuesday that it would begin limiting uploads to verified users only. Uploads now have to come from official content partners or members of Pornhub’s “Model Program,” which requires age verification to sign up. &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;reports that all previously uploaded videos are now being pulled “pending verification and review” beginning in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uqYD3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More than 8 million videos have been wiped out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jvgXMK"&gt;“This means every piece of Pornhub content is from verified uploaders, a requirement that platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter have yet to institute,” Pornhub wrote in a blog post this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lLcGf"&gt;Pornhub appears to have wiped out more than 8.8 million videos as of this writing. &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;said the site boasted 13.5 million videos on Sunday night; it has 4.7 million as of Monday morning. While the site hosts professional videos, its main function operates much like YouTube — allowing users to upload videos of their own and make money off of ad revenue. These videos represented the bulk of Pornhub’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rm5XGJ"&gt;Following the &lt;em&gt;Times’ &lt;/em&gt;report last week, Visa and Mastercard said they would investigate whether the site was hosting illegal content. On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168240/mastercard-ending-pornhub-payment-processing-unlawful-videos"&gt;both companies cut off service&lt;/a&gt;, preventing customers from making purchases on Pornhub through two of the most popular payment methods available. The suspension of service could pose a significant problem for Pornhub, which also sells videos, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7v33d/sex-workers-what-visa-and-mastercard-dropping-pornhub-means-to-performers"&gt;and for the sex workers&lt;/a&gt; who use the platform’s sales as a source of income.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gmail, YouTube, Google Docs, and other Google services hit by massive outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hbj8WSnkG8sqkNpzVL0S3fMGoS8=/82x0:1405x882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68508540/image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many of Google’s most popular services were hit by the outage.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: DownDetector&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F5AJ7l"&gt;Multiple Google services and websites including YouTube, Gmail, Google Assistant, and Google Docs were down for around an hour on Monday morning after being hit with a widespread outage. Google &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=issue&amp;amp;sid=1&amp;amp;iid=52f0b876cce03b08d13dc753c55fc3b2"&gt;acknowledged the issues&lt;/a&gt; with Gmail, affecting both its business and personal services, at 6:55AM ET, and said the problem was fixed for the “vast majority” of users at 7:52AM ET. Identical notices were posted across the status pages for the rest of Google’s services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2E3uP"&gt;Reports quickly mounted on Twitter after users couldn’t access Google’s basic services, causing the hashtag “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23YouTubeDOWN&amp;amp;src=trend_click&amp;amp;vertical=trends"&gt;#YouTubeDOWN&lt;/a&gt;” to trend. At its peak, the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=status"&gt;status page for Google’s services&lt;/a&gt; was a sea of red, to indicate they were all suffering an outage. All services are now green indicating that they’re fully operational.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/otQ0523FLgpUPk-lVc1dU6CRc4o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22168632/msedge_FzHNOaWZBI.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=status" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of Google’s services reported an outage at one point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KJrdkG"&gt;The world’s dependence on Google services led to a truly staggering number of reports on DownDetector, with the number of reported YouTube problems &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/youtube/"&gt;peaking at over 100,000&lt;/a&gt;. Some users found YouTube was still functional if they visited it in an incognito browser without signing in. Google Workspace apps like Docs and Meet were also down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOzewl"&gt;Users also reported that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joemfbrown/status/1338452107419148290?s=19"&gt;smart home gadgets&lt;/a&gt; integrated with Google Assistant were experiencing issues. We verified that a Nest Hub smart display was unable to control a connected smart heater, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQK1Uv"&gt;Third-party apps and services that rely on Google’s back end services, &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/pokemon-go/"&gt;like Pokémon Go&lt;/a&gt;, were also hit by problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOJKFW"&gt;However, despite the outage affecting numerous Google services, its core search product continued to function, and third-party ads were still showing in results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gbgzbm"&gt;The outage was worldwide. We verified that services experienced issues in the US, UK, Netherlands, and Japan, and DownDetector’s outage reports spanned the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat is releasing Bitmoji Paint, a massively multiplayer online painting game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshots of Snapchat’s Bitmoji Paint game showing Bitmoji characters standing on grids of pixel art." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p31hr0M0P_vtC8rI_ELIC3U-rP8=/5x0:1253x832/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68508641/Bitmoji_Paint_Press_Asset.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u33c7Z"&gt;Today, Snapchat is getting a new original game called &lt;em&gt;Bitmoji Paint&lt;/em&gt;. As the name suggests, the game involves Bitmoji — those cutely grotesque customizable avatars — and painting. It’s Snap Inc.’s second title from its internal games studio, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525168/snapchat-games-bitmoji-party-developers"&gt;which began putting out games last year&lt;/a&gt;. “Our goal with Bitmoji has always been to be the world’s avatar, to give people a digital version of themselves that represents them and lets them be themselves online,” says Ba Blackstock, co-founder of Bitmoji. “And so now with games, it’s also letting people play together in a really new and fun and exciting way.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JSBfr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bitmoji Paint&lt;/em&gt; places players on a gigantic, pixelated grid, and lets them paint those squares as a shared canvas. Zoom out, and you get pixel art. You get there by pressing the rocket icon or through search; the first thing you’ll see are floating islands in space, which are different servers you can join with hundreds of other players. There are three modes — move, paint, and map — and users can also interact with other players around the world using stock emotes. There’s also a voice chat function in Snap’s game menu so you can talk to your friends while you’re scribbling. Creations persist, so you can keep working on the things you’ve started. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1oMnkBjHB3WfPk6PscYav_42WzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22163607/BP_3.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NeaAqC"&gt;“A lot of the playability in the game is things like simple scribbles,” says John Imah, head of games and entertainment partnerships at Snap. “You can send fun messages, and also even [make] giant landscapes, all these things are all possible in &lt;em&gt;Bitmoji Paint&lt;/em&gt;.” He’s been playing the game for a while now and says he’s excited for the world to see it, and then to see how people have fun with it.  (As far as moderation goes, players can’t see each other’s Snap IDs unless they’re already friends, and the company emphasized that it’ll provide easy access to reporting tools.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGYCdg"&gt;Snap has used games and unique filters to pull people into its app and stand apart from competitors like TikTok and Instagram. Its recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525427/snapchat-earnings-q3-2020-anime-lens-3-billion-uses"&gt;anime lens&lt;/a&gt; went viral outside the app and was used 3 billion times in its first week. That said, to hear Imah tell it, the games program has already been a big success. “To date, we’ve had more than 100 million Snapchatters play our games, which we’re incredibly proud of,” he says. “An average of 20 minutes are played per player every day, when they’re playing &lt;em&gt;Bitmoji Party&lt;/em&gt;,” Imah says. Sounds like &lt;em&gt;Bitmoji Paint&lt;/em&gt; has some large shoes to fill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OilIsY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6um0I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit buys TikTok rival Dubsmash</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V7FOlbedTN-blbYC1_wl6jBAbGA=/165x0:1035x580/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68508430/rd_banner.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Reddit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r7zSyt"&gt;Reddit has acquired “short-form video social platform” Dubsmash, &lt;a href="https://redditblog.com/2020/12/13/reddit-welcomes-video-platform-dubsmash-to-team/"&gt;the company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Under the terms of the deal, the TikTok rival will continue to exist as a separate platform and brand, but its “innovative video creation tools” will be integrated into Reddit. Although Reddit has supported native video uploads since 2017, its video-editing tools are limited, and much of the video content posted on the platform is hosted elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rb2ORF"&gt;In a post announcing the acquisition, Reddit said it is looking forward “to bringing our teams together to combine the unique creator experience of Dubsmash with the community growth engine of Reddit.” The sum paid for the New York-based company was not disclosed as part of the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z8mP86"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Dubsmash provides a welcoming platform for creators and users who are under-represented in social media”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OcwInx"&gt;According to data from App Annie &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/31/dubsmash-songs/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, Dubsmash’s share of the USA’s short-form video market is second only to TikTok. Although its co-founder and president, Suchit Dash, declined to share the service’s total number of users in an &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddit-snaps-up-dubsmash-to-expand-in-fast-growing-video-app-market-11607912841"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, its videos are reportedly viewed over a billion times per month, and 30 percent of its users log on daily to create videos. Reddit, meanwhile, recently disclosed that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754984/reddit-dau-daily-users-revealed"&gt;52 million users are active on its platform daily&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkpSu2"&gt;Reddit specifically cites Dubsmash’s diverse user base as one of the reasons for its acquisition. According to Reddit around 25 percent of Black teenagers in the US use the service, and that 70 percent of its users are female. “Dubsmash provides a welcoming platform for creators and users who are under-represented in social media,” Reddit’s announcement notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qst2cg"&gt;Earlier this year, Reddit said it would be &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/"&gt;making efforts to address hate speech on its platform&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21279601/reddit-dark-subreddits-protest-police-violence-racism-hate-speech-policies"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21281744/reddit-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-resigns-board"&gt;resignation of one of its co-founders&lt;/a&gt;. When Alexis Ohanian resigned, he asked for his position to be filled by a Black candidate. He was subsequently replaced by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21285835/reddit-board-replacement-alexis-ohanian-michael-seibel-y-combinator"&gt;Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 developer says disappointed players can ask for refunds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LtnyczyWiaHEgCJU3wAyj0sGKLc=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68508170/Cyberpunk2077_No_Future_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gjGfur"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; developer CD Projekt Red has acknowledged the performance issues plaguing the game on base last-gen consoles, and has apologized for not showing the game running on the original PS4 and Xbox One prior to its release. “We should have paid more attention to making it play better on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,” it said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1338390123373801472"&gt;notice published on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. The developer said it is hoping to fix the “most prominent problems” with a series of patches to be released over the coming months, but added that anyone who doesn’t want to wait will be able to return their copy of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJHWYf"&gt;The statement follows numerous ports about how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167303/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-console-google-stadia"&gt;poorly the game runs on the older machines&lt;/a&gt;. Players have reported choppy frame rates, weird physics, texture pop-in, and screen tearing. Its performance has quickly become an online meme, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/9/22166912/cyberpunk-2077-base-ps4-xbox-one-bugs-issues-glitches-performance-trees-bushes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon &lt;/em&gt;reports, &lt;/a&gt;and videos and screenshots of the issues have been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Legolas/status/1336768342993104899"&gt;going viral on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WWrZsO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/jtF5WKCiro"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jtF5WKCiro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1338390123373801472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2yXLrL"&gt;CD Projekt Red gave the PC version of the game to most reviewers, and seemingly did not provide console versions of the game, meaning these performance issues have only received widespread attention after the game’s release. In an investor call last month, CD Projekt Red joint-CEO Adam Kaciński even said the game runs “&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4391610-cd-projekt-s-otglf-ceo-adam-kicinski-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt;surprisingly well&lt;/a&gt;” on last-gen’s base hardware. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"&gt;reviewed the game on PC&lt;/a&gt;, and although we found it was buggy, we didn’t see any of the more serious issues that players are reporting on the base PS4 and Xbox One. CD Projekt Red apologized for not showing the game on base last-gen consoles before its release “and, in consequence, not allowing you to make a more informed decision about your purchase.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwRQID"&gt;The developer promises that a host of fixes are coming to fix the performance problems, starting with another round of updates that’ll be released in the next seven days. In January and February, CD Projekt Red plans on releasing a pair of large patches that it says “should fix the most prominent problems gamers are facing on last-gen consoles.” However it cautions that “they won’t make the game on last-gen look like it’s running on a high-spec PC or next-gen console, but it will be closer to that experience than it is now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYLice"&gt;It says the PC version of the game will also be receiving regular updates and fixes. There’s also an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1273963818113216513"&gt;upgraded next-gen console version of the game&lt;/a&gt; on the way, though there’s no word on when exactly that’s arriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmugAL"&gt;Although fixes are on the way, the developer says that players are free to request refunds if they don’t want to wait. Digital purchases can be returned via Sony and Microsoft’s respective refund systems (&lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-players-are-seemingly-getting-refunds-after-complaining-about-performance"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; many buyers have already reported successfully claiming refunds via these methods, which isn’t usually possible in cases like this), and it says players should attempt to return boxed versions of the game to wherever they bought it. It has set up a dedicated email address for players to contact over the next week if they have trouble returning their copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJecUl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA is buying Codemasters for $1.2 billion to take lead in racing game market</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_XFbajObSeg7gAjJsZeLI0ltLjA=/150x0:1850x1133/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68508136/XlPL0pXmRyiUcwac_SxURA.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nBQXPk"&gt;Electronic Arts has agreed to buy out UK developer Codemasters in a move that could see the US publishing giant wrest control of the racing video game genre. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year for £6.04 (~$7.98) a share, valuing Codemasters at around $1.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNZFJ6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/games-giant-electronic-arts-gatecrashes-725m-codemasters-takeover-12160582?awc=11005_1607932504_f635c04741f6c3ae9f7e6abbb5b5e4b8&amp;amp;dcmp=afc-103504-na-na-longtail&amp;amp;dclid=CIrGyq7_zO0CFQwEvAodKHoGoQ"&gt;Sky News first reported&lt;/a&gt; EA’s interest in Codemasters over the weekend, saying that the British company had previously agreed a $970 million deal with Rockstar Games and 2K Sports owner Take-Two Interactive. EA &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201213005036/en/Electronic-Arts-Reaches-Agreement-for-Recommended-Acquisition-of-Codemasters-Group-Holdings-PLC"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the agreement early Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvXU3g"&gt;Codemasters is one of the oldest British game developers, having been founded in the ‘80s and producing early hits like &lt;em&gt;Dizzy &lt;/em&gt;for systems that were popular in the UK like the ZX Spectrum and the Commodore 64. In recent decades it’s been best known for creating racing games like the &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Grid&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Formula 1&lt;/em&gt; series, and last year acquired the developer behind &lt;em&gt;Project Cars&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ezZtca"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dirt 5 reminded me how much I needed MotorStorm back in my life","url":"https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/17/21571850/dirt-5-motorstorm-impressions-tracks-courses"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vu70I7"&gt;EA, of course, owns the &lt;em&gt;Need for Speed&lt;/em&gt; franchise, so the Codemasters addition would give it further control over a huge chunk of the racing game market. The main competitors would be Sony’s &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt; and Microsoft’s &lt;em&gt;Forza&lt;/em&gt; series, both of which are exclusive to their publishers’ respective platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KPtNM"&gt;“We believe there is a deeply compelling opportunity in bringing together Codemasters and Electronic Arts to create amazing and innovative new racing games for fans,” EA CEO Andrew Wilson says in a statement. “Our industry is growing, the racing category is growing, and together we will be positioned to lead in a new era of racing entertainment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePYZV3"&gt;“Electronic Arts and Codemasters have a shared ambition to lead the video game racing category,” says Codemasters chairman Gerhard Florin. “The Board of Codemasters firmly believes the company would benefit from EA’s knowledge, resources and extensive global scale — both overall and specifically within the racing sector. We feel this union would provide an exciting and prosperous future for Codemasters, allowing our teams to create, launch and service bigger and better games to an extremely passionate audience.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hackers backed by Russian government reportedly breached US government agencies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6H9bf1FQ7mwx4qExq8JM7LSCxAA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68506684/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2vGgQG"&gt;The same Russian government hacking group responsible for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165027/fireeye-cybersecurity-attack-red-team-tools"&gt;security breach at FireEye&lt;/a&gt; compromised the Treasury and Commerce departments and other US government agencies, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russian-government-spies-are-behind-a-broad-hacking-campaign-that-has-breached-us-agencies-and-a-top-cyber-firm/2020/12/13/d5a53b88-3d7d-11eb-9453-fc36ba051781_story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;reported. The group, known as APT29, or Cozy Bear, was responsible for hacking the US State Department and the White House during the Obama administration, according to the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, and is the group that officials believe &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327021/russia-hackers-covid19-coronavirus-vaccine-attacks-uk-us-canada"&gt;targeted COVID-19 vaccine research&lt;/a&gt; over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmnJLU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-amazon-com-exclsuive-idUSKBN28N0PG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that in addition to hacking Treasury and the Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), the hackers may have breached other US government entities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OyqO0t"&gt;Government officials considered the hack dire enough that the National Security Council held an emergency meeting at the White House on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrQVzM"&gt;An NSC spokesman told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that the government was “aware” of the reports, adding “we are taking all necessary steps” to remedy the situation. It’s not yet clear exactly what information may have been stolen or which foreign government was involved. But the “highly sophisticated” hackers were able to break into NTIA’s Microsoft Office software, tricking authentication controls in order to monitor staff emails for months, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TI4nN5"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/"&gt;released details&lt;/a&gt; on the methods used in the hack, late Sunday night. Microsoft says the hackers operating on behalf of an external nation state compromised &lt;a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory"&gt;SolarWinds’ Orion monitoring and management software&lt;/a&gt; giving attackers a foothold in target networks. Intruders were then able to “impersonate any of the organization’s existing users and accounts, including highly privileged accounts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYhaS8"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/13/customers-protect-nation-state-cyberattacks/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and SolarWinds are making countermeasures available to customers to help detect, protect, and respond to the threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9eD4V"&gt;Several federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, are investigating the breach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFeJau"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 14th, 4:47AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added details provided by Microsoft and SolarWinds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New video of Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus shows thin bezels around a flat display </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mO2Ijmjo7XNWNK_NEI3QZOZVlqQ=/0x202:804x738/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68506381/random_stuff_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Lf3p_1m4NE&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;amp;ab_channel=RandomStuff2" target="_blank"&gt;Random Stuff 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dvjok6"&gt;Plenty of details about the Samsung Galaxy S21 have already leaked ahead of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167208/samsung-galaxy-s21-january-14th-launch-india-plus-ultra-s-pen"&gt;expected January release&lt;/a&gt; date. But a new video gives a glimpse of the Galaxy S21 Plus model, showing a flat display with thin bezels around it, and a punch hole selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcZkfw"&gt;The quality of the video from user Random Stuff 2 isn’t the greatest, and it has some sort of distracting music playing under the user’s commentary. It also doesn’t provide a lot of detail about the back of the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F9QMXn"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pLsQIIUdGDA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OZpHhk"&gt;Three Galaxy S21 models are expected: a standard, a Plus and an Ultra. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;series of leaked teaser trailers&lt;/a&gt;, showed off redesigned camera bumps, showing what appears to be five cameras on the S21 Ultra and three each on the S21 and S21 Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijk7mf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; reported last month&lt;/a&gt; that the S21 will have a 6.2-inch display, the Plus will be 6.7 inches and the Ultra will have a 6.8-inch display. The phones will all have batteries ranging in size from 4,000 mAh to 5,000 mAh, and all three are expected to have either a Snapdragon 875 or Exynos 2100 processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGFdvd"&gt;The phones are all expected to have 5G, with the S21 and Plus both with Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1, and Wi-Fi 6E in the Ultra. The S21 Ultra is also expected to be compatible with Samsung’s S-Pen, but rumor has it the S-Pen won’t be sold with the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8VmCs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXAShG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oracle moves its HQ from California to Texas</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vy8b8W"&gt;Software giant Oracle moved the company headquarters from Redwood City, California to Austin, Texas, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/oracle-moves-headquarters-to-texas-joins-exodus-from-california"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, the latest tech firm to depart Silicon Valley for the Lone Star State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqcuIu"&gt;Oracle did not immediately reply to a request for comment Sunday, but &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/oracle-is-moving-its-headquarters-from-silicon-valley-to-austin-texas.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it was putting into place “a more flexible employee work location policy,” and that the move to Austin would “best position Oracle for growth and provide our personnel with more flexibility about where and how they work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujBwyf"&gt;Oracle, founded in 1977, is one of the older Valley tech firms, and is a staple of the area; the San Francisco Giants play at Oracle Park, and the company’s Redwood City campus features its well-known cylindrical buildings. It already has a campus in Austin, which it opened in 2018. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott heralded the news in a tweet, saying “Texas is truly the land of business, jobs, and opportunity.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;BREAKING: Oracle just announced they have moved their Headquarters to Austin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Texas is truly the land of business, jobs, and opportunity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We will continue to attract the very best.&lt;/p&gt;— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1337518818013405190?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HrUs5k"&gt;Several other firms have announced plans to leave California in recent months, with some company leaders blaming the state’s political climate as unfriendly to business. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334860/tesla-cybertruck-factory-austin-texas-location-model-y"&gt;Tesla is building a new plant&lt;/a&gt; near Austin and CEO Elon Musk has threatened to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21253127/elon-musk-lawsuit-alameda-coronavirus-tesla-fremont-lockdown"&gt;move the company out of California&lt;/a&gt; altogether after tussling with local officials over coronavirus lockdowns, but Tesla still has a plant in Fremont. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163805/elon-musk-texas-moved-california-tesla-spacex"&gt;Musk said he moved his personal residence&lt;/a&gt; to Texas, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akkROG"&gt;And another Silicon Valley company, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/houston-california-greg-abbott-texas-1ce5ef41c6e20e84b5954de11fa3c8a7"&gt;Hewlett Packard Enterprise, announced plans&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month to build a 440,000-square-foot campus in a Houston suburb for its new headquarters. HPE already has Texas locations in Austin and Plano, near Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;
