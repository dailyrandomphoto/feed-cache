    <title>Finicky COVID-19 vaccines raise the stakes of power outages</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RgXyQr"&gt;Winter storms paralyzing the United States have left &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/16/968230163/millions-without-power-in-texas-northern-mexico-as-blackouts-and-bitter-cold-con?utm_campaign=storyshare&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;millions without power&lt;/a&gt; and sent health officials scrambling to protect freezers full of COVID-19 vaccines, which have to be kept at extremely low temperatures or risk going bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHFuDj"&gt;Rolling blackouts through Texas took out at least &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/texas-officials-scramble-administer-8000-covid-vaccines-power/story?id=75911159"&gt;one set of freezers&lt;/a&gt; full of the Moderna vaccine; 5,000 doses were sent to a university, a jail, and a handful of hospitals before they expired. The &lt;a href="https://www.kptv.com/news/winter-storm-causes-power-outages-to-freezers-protecting-covid-19-vaccine-doses-in-oregon/article_95cc2336-7000-11eb-bb34-7362ce54e5e9.html"&gt;Oregon Health Authority&lt;/a&gt; is moving vaccines to places with power, although the agency isn’t disclosing which storage sites have their systems down. As part of its storm preparations, Kentucky made sure places holding COVID-19 vaccines had contingency plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6WVUG"&gt;“For each provider they have a generator on site that is ready to go on, or they have a partner who…can immediately pack it up and provide it,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear &lt;a href="https://www.wkyufm.org/post/kentucky-officials-warn-icy-roadways-power-outages-due-winter-storm#stream/0"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during a press briefing last week. “That should make sure that no doses and no vials are wasted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nmXxE"&gt;Power outages are challenging for hospitals and health care facilities at the best of times. The health care system is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20932780/california-blackout-healthcare-electricity-fires"&gt;reliant on a steady supply of power&lt;/a&gt; to keep people healthy. Facilities need electricity for lights, electronic health records, ventilators, and refrigerators full of medications. Many people with illnesses rely on power in their homes for things like &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/02/16/winter-storm-live-updates/"&gt;oxygen tanks&lt;/a&gt;. During outages, they also can’t heat or cool their homes to counteract extreme temperatures, which can be dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3Wri5"&gt;Hospitals are required to have backup generators, but outpatient and community clinics don’t face the same regulations. And generators sometimes fail — the downed freezers in Texas were supposed to be powered by a backup that ended up not working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9DZOU"&gt;“We’re so used to having an uninterrupted supply of power,” Grete Porteous, an anesthesiologist and emergency medicine specialist at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20932780/california-blackout-healthcare-electricity-fires"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. “It really blows people’s minds to understand that all of this is very fragile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuf86f"&gt;A public health emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic amplifies the risks of power outages. Hospitals, public health departments, and other health care facilities are already stretched thin. Many doctors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20932780/california-blackout-healthcare-electricity-fires"&gt;aren’t used&lt;/a&gt; to treating patients with limited power and may have to navigate it on the fly when they’re already strapped for resources. Shelters for people without power, like &lt;a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/north-texas-cities-open-warming-centers-as-millions-of-texans-face-bitterly-cold-night-without-electricity/2552659/"&gt;warming centers&lt;/a&gt; in Texas, could risk spreading COVID-19 even though they’re critical to keep people from freezing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkJndS"&gt;And any facility storing COVID-19 vaccines has to devote attention to the freezers keeping them safe in addition to managing power to their health records or their oxygen supply. Doses are still limited, and any vial lost because it warmed up too quickly means fewer people can be protected from COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOi5eF"&gt;The stakes of a power outage for health care are always high. But when the system is already unstable and run ragged by one emergency, a second stressor compounds the pressure to keep the lights on and the freezers running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92tVvS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Six free alternatives to the LastPass password manager</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Digital lock (Shutterstock)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BS_5Dr3dKivxmRjDEq73BeXLB-g=/0x42:1000x709/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68825516/shutterstock_71973916.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nSqJyn"&gt;Free is always nice, and when a free app is no longer free (or when the free version becomes so limited it is virtually useless), then you have to decide whether to pay up or move on. This happened with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12052056/evernote-price-changes-basic-plus-premium"&gt;Evernote note manager almost five years ago&lt;/a&gt;, and now it is time for users of the popular password manager LastPass to make the same decision. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;LastPass is changing its free version&lt;/a&gt; so that it will only work on one type of device — either your computer or your mobile device. If you, like most of us, use both a phone and a computer, then you will have to either start paying $3 a month or find an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldLQTp"&gt;If you’d rather not pay at all, there are other password managers out there that have free versions that may work better for you. And there are, of course, other alternatives. Most browsers, such as Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox, have their own password managers. In addition, many security apps such as Norton offer their own password managers, so if you already subscribe to one, you may have a password manager on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JolJwE"&gt;But if you’d rather use an independent password manager, here are a few that are currently available. We have not yet tried them out; this is just a brief look until we have a chance to make recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ob1s0TSFmQrEx0mlBW64_mR8GdU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307300/Screen_Shot_2021_02_16_at_11.37.38_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bitwarden&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DicWdP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/"&gt;Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="szKm7f"&gt;Bitwarden is a well-known open-source password manager that offers a solid selection of features, including saving unlimited items, syncing across devices, and generating passwords. For day-to-day password usage, Bitwarden could be a good alternative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVgn0J"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/pricing/business/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other pricing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; For $10 a year, you can add 1GB of encrypted file storage and two-step login, among other extras. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/te5Nptg-a0LIJ9LVkmym530PCqE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307342/Screen_Shot_2021_02_16_at_11.44.25_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zoho&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qsy1lR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zoho.com/vault/"&gt;Zoho Vault&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Kv4R6W"&gt;Zoho Vault, which is one of Zoho’s wide variety of productivity apps, has a free version that includes unlimited storage of passwords and notes, access from both computers and mobile devices, two-factor authentication, and password generation, among a fairly impressive number of other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujKtRU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zoho.com/vault/pricing.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other pricing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Zoho’s paid plan, which starts at $1 / month per user, offers business options such as password sharing and expiration alerts. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/79ticNbeYjoSPQU_vRP-TrMbR0o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307349/Screen_Shot_2021_02_16_at_11.45.53_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: KeePass&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WCuwuc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://keepass.info/"&gt;KeePass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qWG0v7"&gt;KeePass is another free open-source password manager, but judging from its website, it may be a little difficult for less technically adept users to adopt. Nothing is kept in the cloud, so while that can be more secure (you can store your passwords in a master key-locked encrypted database), it is also less convenient. However, if you don’t mind manually transferring your password database from one device to another, this could be worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhiT5U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other pricing: &lt;/strong&gt;None&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HcOmtPHMiUb9Rm2818__eDyYGgo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307390/Screen_Shot_2021_02_16_at_11.52.36_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LogMeOnce&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="D8lr5e"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logmeonce.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22285499%2Fpassword-manager-lastpass-free-bitwarden-zoho#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LogMeOnce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7QRcxL"&gt;LogMeOnce’s free version provides unlimited passwords and use on unlimited devices, along with autofill, sync, password generation, and two-factor authentication. LogMeOnce uses ads to fund its free version, so that could be a setback, depending on your tolerance for advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZLUjq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logmeonce.com%2Fconsumer-password-manager-and-password-recovery%2Fpricing-and-comparison%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22285499%2Fpassword-manager-lastpass-free-bitwarden-zoho#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other pricing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Additional features start at $2.50 a month and include emergency access, additional password sharing, and priority technical support, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p6dPaqO4o8olwBff2j1etzmY-JQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307414/Screen_Shot_2021_02_16_at_11.54.31_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nordpass&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mnTV80"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnordpass.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22285499%2Fpassword-manager-lastpass-free-bitwarden-zoho#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NordPass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="g7YQ7t"&gt;NordPass has a free version that includes unlimited passwords and syncing across devices. While there is no limit on the number of devices you can use, only one can be active at a time — so, for example, if you use it on your phone, you will be logged out of your computer’s version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJnleg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnordpass.com%2Fplans%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22285499%2Fpassword-manager-lastpass-free-bitwarden-zoho#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other pricing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The premium version of NordPass lets you have up to six active accounts running at a time, and it includes secure item sharing and a data breach scanner, among other features.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kENLbswzutZt6ZR0lEwhelsWvUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307420/RF_StartScreen_LightMode.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: RoboForm&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9OM9oN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roboform.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22285499%2Fpassword-manager-lastpass-free-bitwarden-zoho#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RoboForm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DIZgox"&gt;RoboForm has been around for a while, although it’s never been as well-known as LastPass or 1Password. Its free version offers unlimited passwords, form filling, and emergency access, among other features. However, it does not sync across devices, which can be a definite inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcytD6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roboform.com%2Feverywhere&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22285499%2Fpassword-manager-lastpass-free-bitwarden-zoho#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other pricing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; RoboForm Everywhere costs $18 for a one-year subscription, and it lets you sync across devices, perform cloud backup, and use two-factor authentication, among other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkF0WN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSETLo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>IBM sets new climate goal for 2030</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inside IBM Research Headquarters" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WwvwpJ9Y34PbcWag0mfK3Q5VxMA=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68825452/468943455.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Inside IBM Research Headquarters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jQwMfU"&gt;IBM plans to get rid of its planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions from its operations by 2030, the company announced today. And unlike some other tech companies that have made splashy environmental commitments lately, IBM’s pledge emphasized the need to prevent emissions rather than developing ways to capture carbon dioxide after it’s released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xSBODp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;IBM is pledging to do “all it can across its operations” to stop polluting&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jAujnj"&gt;The company committed to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the end of this decade, pledging to do “all it can across its operations” to stop polluting before it turns to emerging technologies that might be able to capture carbon dioxide after it’s emitted. It plans to rely on renewable energy for 90 percent of its electricity use by 2030. By 2025, it wants to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 65 percent compared to 2010 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSxFgk"&gt;“I am proud that IBM is leading the way by taking actions to significantly reduce emissions,” said IBM chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-commits-to-net-zero-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-2030-301228742.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4Hx8f"&gt;IBM is putting more emphasis on its cloud computing and AI after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508974/ibm-split-into-two-companies-newco-hybrid-cloud-legacy-it"&gt;announcing in October&lt;/a&gt; that it would split into two public companies and house its legacy IT services under a new name. That pivot puts IBM in more direct competition with giants like Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud market, which is notorious for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41558-020-0837-6&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F16%2F22285669%2Fibm-climate-change-commitment-cut-greenhouse-gas-emissions#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;guzzling up energy&lt;/a&gt;. Data centers accounted for about 1 percent of global electricity use in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/data-centres-and-energy-from-global-headlines-to-local-headaches"&gt;according to the International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;, and can strain local power grids. All three companies have now made big pledges to rein in pollution that drives climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpGDLw"&gt;Microsoft’s climate pledge focuses on driving the development of technologies that suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere; it reached net zero emissions in 2012 but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;still relies heavily on investing in forests&lt;/a&gt; to offset its carbon pollution. Amazon committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2040. Amazon’s emissions, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300427/amazon-climate-change-commitments-greenhouse-gas-emissions-jeff-bezos"&gt;continue to grow&lt;/a&gt; as its business expands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="zRghpC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There is still room for more ambition in IBM’s new climate commitment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pgPgWZ"&gt;There is still room for more ambition in IBM’s new climate commitment since the company so far is not setting targets for reducing emissions coming from its supply chain or the use of its products by consumers. These kinds of indirect emissions often make up a majority of a company’s carbon footprint. IBM does not track all of the pollution from its supply chain, but other indirect emissions (like those from the products it sells) made up the biggest chunk of its carbon footprint &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/environment/climate/ghg.shtml"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://d39w7f4ix9f5s9.cloudfront.net/a4/ad/b9eca67e4578b35e8f995c8b4f9c/amazon-carbon-methodology-september-2019.pdf"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, consider all of these sources of emissions in their climate pledges. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook users rarely saw voting misinformation labeled ‘false,’ says study — especially if it came from Trump</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IMPjqG"&gt;Facebook addressed false election information with understated warnings like “missing context” rather than more direct flags, &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/02/16/trumps-false-posts-were-treated-with-kid-gloves-by-facebook"&gt;research from &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; suggests&lt;/a&gt; — and the company appeared hesitant to label false or misleading statements from now-banned former President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYMMiD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; has released &lt;a href="https://github.com/the-markup/citizen-browser-flags"&gt;new data&lt;/a&gt; from its Citizen Browser, which captures snapshots of what 2,200 volunteers see in their Facebook feeds. Its report covers December and January, two contentious months where then-President Trump falsely claimed victory in the election. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21552064/facebook-election-winner-instagram-notification-president-trump-biden"&gt;implemented special banners&lt;/a&gt; and labeling systems to inform users about election results and fact-check false posts. The Citizen Browser Project offers a window into a seemingly complicated and hyper-nuanced process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlA2Bp"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;, only a minority of participants saw any flagged content: 330 people were served a total of 682 posts labeled “false, devoid of context, or related to an especially controversial issue, like the presidential election.” The vast majority of these labels just directed people toward voting results, and they were added to “anything election-related.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0JjCLd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The vast majority of people didn’t see any election-related flags at all&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3TXwM"&gt;Most of the remaining flags were applied to Trump posts, and some of those posts contained clearly false information, like a claim that it was “statistically impossible” for President Joe Biden to win the election. But &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; notes that these posts were never labeled “false” or “misleading.” Instead, Facebook did things like add generic warnings about election integrity. Overall, “false” labels only appeared on a total of 12 posts — including ones “linking Bill Gates to a world domination plot, or one that said ‘Biden did not win legally.’” Facebook was more likely to use a flag for “missing context,” which appeared 38 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnQrmK"&gt;Facebook told &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; that “we don’t comment on data that we can’t validate, but we are looking into the examples shared.” And &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; notes that Facebook claims to reduce the spread of false claims, so users may have been simply prevented from seeing many posts flagged as “false.” However, it also describes “missing context” flags getting applied to posts that clearly but indirectly endorsed false conspiracy theories — something that makes it “much less obvious that the post was untrue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gF7v4b"&gt;Overall, the Citizen Browser Project only offers a limited picture of what’s going on inside the platform, although it’s still valuable for filling in gaps left by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/22/21332774/facebook-crowdtangle-kevin-roose-nyt-tweets-interactions-reach-engagement"&gt;Facebook’s own analytics tool&lt;/a&gt; CrowdTangle. But the research does suggest that, as &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; writes, Facebook treated Trump posts with “kid gloves” until it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;outright suspended him&lt;/a&gt; following the January 6th attack on the US Capitol. That decision will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256821/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board-public-feedback"&gt;reviewed by the Facebook Oversight Board&lt;/a&gt; in the near future — and if it’s reversed, Facebook may end up facing the same moderation questions again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trello is redesigning its project management platform for a remote work future</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gw5Mz49Hjgl0SEHiMdhOCueNpWM=/300x0:2100x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68825315/trello_redesign.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Trello&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0qkpK"&gt;Productivity app Trello, a virtual whiteboard-style platform for organizing and managing projects, is announcing a major redesign today in addition to new features for helping businesses manage third-party integrations. The platform is getting a visual overhaul, both to its logo and the illustrations it deploys across its website and apps. It’s also getting multiple new ways to both customize cards and view your workload beyond the core whiteboard column view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5Hcou"&gt;“During the pandemic, Trello became many people’s new offices in a remote-first world. The overnight shift to distributed work coupled with the frantic adoption of digital tools led to an exponential increase in digital work artifacts scattered across apps, some of which now resemble a graveyard of ‘tried-and-tossed’ tools,” explains Trello co-founder Michael Pryor, who leads up the platform at enterprise software giant Atlassian following its acquisition in 2017, in a blog post published on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i64RdS"&gt;Pryor says Trello has accumulated well over 50 million users, and the company wants to expand the way Trello works with third-party services like Google Drive, ticketing platform Jira, and Slack. “Today, we are unveiling the beginning of a whole new Trello, built specifically to support teams as they usher in a new era of work. These features, along with our plans for the future, will give users a central vantage point from which to view, plan and tackle their work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oZ3S5X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Trello is treating third-party services as key to its platform going forward&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aGRU7n"&gt;The new cards include both mirror cards and link cards, which the company hopes will make it easier to manage other apps and services from within Trello. Link cards, for instance, can now display previews if they contain a link to a third-party service like Dropbox, Google Docs, and YouTube. Another new card type, mirror cards, will let you pair together cards across multiple boards, so changes to one are reflected on all the others. Trello says this should help cut down on confusion and unnecessary interoffice updates, because more basic information about the status of a project will be automatically available instead of having to be manually communicated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZ1dCB"&gt;Trello is also introducing five new board views that deviate from the standard column layout the platform helped popularize. These include team table view for turning multiple Trello boards into something more akin to a spreadsheet for easy viewing; timeline view for organizing a complex project by upcoming deadlines; calendar view for tracking projects and even simply individual to-do list items on a monthly basis; map view for organizing projects that incorporate information (like real estate); and dashboard view for visualizations of data and other project information into bar, line, and pie charts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oquj0N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10345238"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gVTnag"&gt;These changes may help Trello, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, stay competitive against alternatives like Asana, as well as the scores of smaller project management apps all vying for a coveted spot among the ever-growing list of software tools used by small startups and large corporations alike. Key to that, Pryor says, is acknowledging that Trello can’t be the one app that does everything you want it to do, but rather that it needs to be flexible enough to let companies and small teams connect to the tools they do need and have it all be accessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MiREO6"&gt;“‘Hey, we’re just going to get everyone to use our tool, we will be the project management tool to rule them all.’ When you look at how people work, that strategy is a little myopic,” Pryror told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an interview last week. “There’s a lot of different tools people use to get their job done and they’re not all the same thing to different people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jfwdo"&gt;The goal for Trello going forward, he added, is figuring out “how can we expand the card metaphor to different tools and to give you a perspective on all the work that’s happening.” New types of cards, and new ways of visualizing Trello’s signature whiteboard, could help expand those metaphors and, Pryor hopes, make people more productive in the process. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Flight Simulator’s new UK update brings famous castles and football stadiums to life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZbEDZkvDBZCQCx5Yt_YaBTUddUs=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68825255/flightsim.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator UK update.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eBVSy4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is getting a big update today focused on the UK and Ireland. The World Update III, as Microsoft puts it, includes high-resolution 3G imagery for cities like London, Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, and Oxford. &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/02/16/microsoft-flight-simulator-world-update-iii-uk-ireland-now-available-for-free/"&gt;More than 70 custom landmarks&lt;/a&gt; and points of interest have been improved, including famous bridges, palaces, cathedrals, and famous Premier League football (soccer!) stadiums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzMaK1"&gt;If you’ve tried to visit some Premier League clubs in &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; already, you’ve probably noticed they’re usually just a giant generic-looking apartment block. This update aims to improve that experience with detailed views of exactly where the Premier League is played week in week out. Likewise, Buckingham Palace, the Queen’s London residence, now looks greatly improved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21376978/microsoft-flight-simulator-glitches-maps-bugs"&gt;compared to before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liverpool Football Club in Microsoft Flight Simulator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jLJ_h5P-85xo8PA1hNaTwoPApZ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307308/9XwqpKB.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chelsea Football Club in Microsoft Flight Simulator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8G3VHT"&gt;Microsoft is also adding in hand-crafted airports for Barra, Liverpool, Land’s End, Manchester-Barton, and Out Skerries. Another particular part of this update is detailed architectural elements for British manors and Victorian homes. Even countryside stone structures like castles and churches will look a lot better. Some of the views across Scotland look particularly stunning now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acPJH9"&gt;Alongside all the imagery improvements, Microsoft is adding in three new activities for those exploring the UK and Ireland. There’s a new flight in the Northern Isles and two landing challenges: one in the Shetlands and another in the Southeast of England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pb64Z"&gt;This new UK and Ireland update is available free for all owners of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator &lt;/em&gt;today. It’s a big download, though, weighing in at 48GB on PC. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia is requiring laptop makers to be more transparent about RTX 30-series specs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GGkFO5nAOrnsUmAJF7szxbdGn4s=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68774775/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J5GHXZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 16th, 11:21AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bullet list at the bottom now reflects that Asus and Gigabyte have updated all of its product pages with the required information about the RTX 30-series graphics chips its laptops use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emYkbk"&gt;Nvidia is now requiring, not just encouraging, companies selling laptops with its new RTX 30-series graphics chips to be more transparent about the kind of power people can expect. Nvidia tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;these companies will have to disclose specific clock speed stats and total graphics power on online product pages — all of which tells people everything they need to know about a laptop’s graphics potential, for better or worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXHuKd"&gt;However, companies won’t have to mention that these chips are Max-Q variants because, according to an Nvidia spokesperson, “Max-Q is no longer part of the GPU name.” Rather, Max-Q is now solely used to communicate that a laptop with an RTX 30-series graphics chip ships with efficiency features like Whisper Mode 2, Dynamic Boost 2, and Advanced Optimus. Previously, seeing Max-Q branding made it easy to determine a laptop’s general performance without having to know its specific clock speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2DsTp"&gt;It’s encouraging to see Nvidia no longer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22243065/nvidia-gaming-laptop-graphic-chips-capability-manufacturer-transparency"&gt;allows companies to hide this vital information&lt;/a&gt; from marketing materials. It should go far enough in helping buyers make an educated purchase without having to wait on reviewers and early adopters to report on the specs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RsrBF"&gt;By sharing these specs, companies can make it much easier for consumers to understand how it’s possible that, in some instances, the RTX 3070 in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22244409/msi-gp66-leopard-gaming-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;MSI’s GP66 Leopard&lt;/a&gt; can outperform an RTX 3080 in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;MSI GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt;, which is something we saw first-hand. Since the Max-Q brand no longer signifies a graphics chip’s power capabilities, being transparent with clock speed and how much power it can consume is more crucial than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nvidia RTX laptops" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W7bY5R4IZGgiPi2jLRWNzVa8gRA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260491/nvidia_ampere_mobile_gpus_tdp.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia now requires companies share the clock speed and power on laptop product pages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P7RJdo"&gt;“We’re requiring OEMs to update their product pages to the Max-Q technology features for each GeForce laptop, as well as clocks and power — which communicates the expected GPU performance in that system,” an Nvidia spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpvjoM"&gt;Nvidia says manufacturers have already begun sharing this info, including Asus and Gigabyte, which we confirmed at the time of publishing. We’re going to keep tabs on some models coming out soon (and those currently on the market) to see how long it takes for these requirements to roll out across the industry. Let us know in the comments if you notice that one has been updated with info or needs to be added to this list.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sennheiser says it’s open to selling its consumer audio business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p4CD1eKYi3S1dP_8C_ZhqwE7qxE=/20x0:1685x1110/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68825090/CX_400BT_True_Wireless_Product_Shot_In_Use_Black.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sennheiser&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U0wAzi"&gt;Sennheiser &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen-us.sennheiser.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fsennheiser-to-reposition-its-business-units-independently-of-each-other-s5jh2n%3Fasset_type%3Dattachment%26asset_id%3Dd88176f4-727f-4f25-8e0b-abe35e9c21e4%23attachment-d88176f4-727f-4f25-8e0b-abe35e9c21e4&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F16%2F22285497%2Fsennheiser-investors-selling-consumer-headphones-soundbars-business#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; it’s looking for a new partner to buy its consumer audio business, which consists of headphones and soundbars. It’s going to shift its focus entirely to professional audio, including its Neumann microphone division and what Sennheiser calls business communications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJPvJq"&gt;In a press release, Sennheiser says it wants to increase visibility in the competitive headphone and soundbar markets, and it thinks its products can be popular amid “strong competitive pressure.” But it needs an investor to make that happen. It also says that talks with potential partners will start soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMLEHm"&gt;“To be best able to exploit the potential in each of these markets, we are concentrating our own resources on the three business areas in the Professional division and are looking for a strong partner to invest in our Consumer business,” Daniel Sennheiser, co-CEO of Sennheiser, says in the press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j4Imjl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All options are open,” say the Sennheiser brothers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PbhGgE"&gt;German publication &lt;a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/handel-konsumgueter/audiospezialist-sennheiser-sucht-investor-fuer-die-kopfhoerersparte/26919186.html?ticket=ST-7274310-DereG1gbH3bE9ifKfmQ5-ap1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Handelsblatt &lt;/em&gt;recently posted an interview&lt;/a&gt; with Daniel and fellow co-CEO Andreas Sennheiser, in which the two brothers point to a number of potential reasons why Sennheiser is now exploring selling its consumer business. For one, the company was late to jump onboard with truly wireless headphones, which have become a very popular audio hardware segment. While Sennheiser apparently had record sales in 2019 (€393 million, representing 52 percent of its 2019 sales), it ended up slightly negative after taxes and interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADPz4c"&gt;More recently, headphone sales haven’t been as good as expected. Daniel Sennheiser said during the summer that “competitive pressure has increased significantly,” and its profit margins at the time were “under pressure.” It also cut 650 jobs worldwide, leaving the company with around 2,800 employees currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pkz1ac"&gt;Sennheiser’s press release makes it seem like the company is interested in partners to fund its consumer audio business, but it isn’t opposed to selling it off completely. The Sennheiser brothers told &lt;em&gt;Handelsblatt &lt;/em&gt;that “all options are open,” and that “it is important to us that all business areas emerge stronger from the realignment.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Corsair grows its roster of streaming brands with Visuals by Impulse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MfO7h5Go6HmpcHjnH3fZwReA63s=/0x46:1000x713/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68825069/CORSAIRLogo2020_stack_K.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="24Trih"&gt;Today, gaming peripheral brand Corsair is announcing that it has purchased streaming visuals company Visuals by Impulse (VBI), which it’s organizing under its other streaming brand, Elgato. If reading that makes your eyes cross, don’t worry — all it means is that some of the biggest names in streaming technology have come together under Corsair’s roof. Think of the consolidation like a one-stop shop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkW6u8"&gt;It’s a smart move on Corsair’s part, too. The company scooped up Elgato — the biggest name in streaming tech — in 2018, and then a year later, it picked up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708388/corsair-acquiring-origin-pc-custom-build-gaming-software-hardware"&gt;Origin PC&lt;/a&gt;, which makes custom prebuilt PCs, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21028367/corsair-acquires-scuf-gaming-controllers-origin-pc-elgato"&gt;SCUF Gaming&lt;/a&gt;, which makes custom professional-grade controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDbEBh"&gt;This month’s acquisition of VBI means Corsair now has a complete set of products related to streaming: you can get everything from a streaming PC to a suite of custom visuals under one larger roof. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BOGNp"&gt;“With the addition of Visuals by Impulse to the Elgato family, we’re excited to extend our core mission of empowering content creators. Design is a crucial element shaping a creator’s identity, and VBI has been at the forefront of making beautiful and interactive design accessible to anyone,” wrote Julian Fest, SVP and general manager at Elgato, in a press release. “Together with the talented team at VBI, we plan to push the boundaries of what design can mean for creators.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VJi6a"&gt;If nothing else, Corsair’s consolidation is convenient. It’ll be interesting to see what the company buys next. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LastPass’ free tier will become a lot less useful next month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dhufGUw_FLjBf4OolT0OfJOplVM=/0x0:1395x930/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68824844/msedge_qX48b5uD4r.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LastPass&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wUzPIM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.logmeininc.com/lastpass/help/what-can-i-expect-to-change-for-lastpass-free-on-march-16-2021"&gt;LastPass is adding new restrictions&lt;/a&gt; to its free subscription tier starting March 16th that’ll only allow users to view and manage passwords on one category of devices: mobile or computer. Mobile users will be limited to iOS and Android phones, iPads, Android tablets, and smartwatches. Computer subscribers will be able to use their passwords from Windows, macOS, and Linux desktops and laptops, the LastPass browser extension, and Windows tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKoRfZ"&gt;Users on LastPass’ free tier will be asked to pick between the two options the first time they log in after March 16th, and the company says they’ll be able to switch between categories up to three times after they’ve picked. Although customers are restricted to a single category of devices on the free tier, they’ll still be able view and manage passwords from an unlimited number of devices within either the mobile or computer category. LastPass says no users will be locked out of their accounts or lose access to their passwords as a result of the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bhQx0d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Paid tiers start at $3 a month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="waB1ae"&gt;As well as restricting its device types, LastPass is also changing the kinds of customer support free tier users will be able to access. From May 17th, free users will lose access to email support, the company announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdVzpZ"&gt;LastPass is clearly hoping the new restrictions are enough to encourage people to upgrade to its Premium or Families tiers. LastPass Premium starts at $3 a month, while a Families subscription costs $4 and includes licenses for up to six people. In an &lt;a href="http://blog.lastpass.com/2021/02/changes-to-lastpass-free/"&gt;accompanying blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company says it now has over 20 million users around the world, though it’s unclear how many of these use the service’s free tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QHq6Ow"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Six free alternatives to the LastPass password manager","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22285499/password-manager-lastpass-free-bitwarden-zoho"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="J9vxL8"&gt;Compared to a lot of other password managers, which ask you to subscribe to access even their basic features, LastPass’ free tier has always been pretty generous. But these upcoming changes could make it a lot harder to use the service for free in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
