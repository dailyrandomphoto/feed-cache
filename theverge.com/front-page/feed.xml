    <title>Now is the best time to play the Yakuza series (on Xbox)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/meO6rQTwzHa3Sw8Xgr6vHelli64=/110x0:1291x787/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68739394/apps_1.46310.14037151017640712.b7408538_4c5c_44fa_98d0_4a876ebf3064.e4d2a38e_d900_4ace_9bcd_7a2dd5f8b739.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JMRXJH"&gt;For almost a decade and a half, the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; franchise was all but exclusive to Sony’s PlayStation consoles. Other than a Japan-only Wii U remaster of the first two games, every single mainline entry or spinoff was released solely on the PlayStation 2, PSP, PS3, or PS4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFIjT0"&gt;Then Microsoft came along. Along with &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; has slowly become a flagship Japanese series for Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass service. It all started under a year ago with the addition of &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 0&lt;/em&gt;, and as of this week you can play almost every mainline &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; game on Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCAFxk"&gt;Couple this with the fact that the next-gen version of &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like A Dragon&lt;/em&gt; is still exclusive to Xbox Series consoles, with a PS5 version not set to arrive until March, and the improbable conclusion is clear: Xbox — including the PC branch of the ecosystem — is now the easiest and best way to get into the series.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ODsMdudxzPLlw0m_ZyaT153z4Xg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22267736/apps_1.46310.14037151017640712.b7408538_4c5c_44fa_98d0_4a876ebf3064.e4d2a38e_d900_4ace_9bcd_7a2dd5f8b739.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gix0dm"&gt;What’s changed this week is the addition of three new mainline &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; games. Remastered versions of &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;5&lt;/em&gt; are all now on Game Pass for Xbox and PC after getting a bundled PS4 release in 2019. (You can also buy the trio for $39.99.) These games originally all came out on the PS3, meaning they wouldn’t otherwise have been playable on modern systems through backwards compatibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfyfU9"&gt;These aren’t particularly impressive ports on a technical level. Like most other &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; games on the Xbox, they run at 1080p and 60fps with little apparent benefit for the more powerful Xbox consoles. But honestly, given the aging source material, that’s perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aY2SqB"&gt;What matters is that you’ll be able to play almost the entire mainline &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; series for the price of a Game Pass subscription. And I definitely think you should do that, because this series is incredibly good. There’s really nothing like the way &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; blends brutal violence, goofy comedy, and incredible pathos in the context of a crime drama action RPG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrmvyF"&gt;Without spoiling anything, here’s how I’d recommend getting into it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Xvv0Az"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Start with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza 0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Normally you’d want to play the first game in a series before tackling its prequel, but &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; is different. &lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt; is set decades before &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;, in bubble-era ‘80s Japan, and it’s widely considered to be one of the best in the series. It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/19/14323874/yakuza-0-ps4-review"&gt;perfect place to start&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll tell you all you need to know about the background for what’s to come. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AXzESW"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Next, play &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza Kiwami&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/29/16220662/yakuza-kiwami-ps4-review"&gt;a full-on remake of the original &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was released for the PS2 in 2005. &lt;em&gt;Kiwami&lt;/em&gt; came out shortly after &lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt; and is technically very similar, with a bunch of narrative callbacks to the prequel, which is why it makes sense to play &lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt; first. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TgnNGd"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Up next, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza Kiwami 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Like &lt;em&gt;Kiwami&lt;/em&gt;, this is a remake of a PS2 game, 2006’s &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 2&lt;/em&gt;. But it moves to the PS4-era Dragon Engine, first seen in &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 6&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s a much bigger and more accomplished game than &lt;em&gt;Kiwami&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XY1oEg"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Now play &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. At this point I’m guessing you’re pretty into the series, so the prospect of three straight-up PS3 remasters won’t seem intimidating at all. I think &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt; is the best of these three games, but you’re going to want to get through all of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YlLWln"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wait for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza 6: The Song of Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to come to Game Pass&lt;/strong&gt;. That won’t be too long a wait — it’s happening on March 25th. Or you could just play it on a PS4 before then. But make sure you do play it, either way, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17242280/yakuza-6-song-of-life-review-ps4"&gt;because it’s wonderful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kBEaFl"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Now it’s time for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Otherwise known as &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 7 &lt;/em&gt;in Japan, I actually think you could start with this one too if you really just wanted to play the newest game. It’s very different to the others, with an all-new cast and turn-based battle system, and right now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21558093/yakuza-like-a-dragon-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;it’s best on the Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. But you will get a little more out of it if you’ve played the other games in the series, so I’d hold off if you can. It’s also not on Game Pass — you’ll have to buy it separately. And as a final warning, it’s two or three times longer than most of the other games. (But worth it!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="GmXlEC"&gt;You may also want to play &lt;em&gt;Judgment&lt;/em&gt;, which is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18744110/judgment-game-review-ps4-yakuza"&gt;pretty good spinoff&lt;/a&gt; set in the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; Cinematic Universe, but it’s not important to the overall story and is still only on PS4. I’d slot it in after &lt;em&gt;6&lt;/em&gt; if you have the chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZPoIf"&gt;The other &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; spinoffs aren’t really worth worrying about. There’s &lt;em&gt;Kenzan&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ishin&lt;/em&gt;, two separate samurai-era games that were never localized into English. That was also the case for the PSP-exclusive &lt;em&gt;Kurohyo&lt;/em&gt; and its sequel. And while &lt;em&gt;Dead Souls&lt;/em&gt;, a PS3 zombie shooter set on the streets of Tokyo, did make it out in the West, you’re better off pretending it never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8GN6F"&gt;I’ve been playing the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; series from day one on the PS2, but back then I never imagined it’d get so expansive or accessible. I’d recommend these games to anyone, and the barrier to entry is so low now for anyone with an Xbox or a PC and a lot of spare time on their hands. If you haven’t gotten into the series yet, it might be the single best reason to subscribe to Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood restricts crypto trading as Dogecoin soars 300 percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dogecoin logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sc0PJ9qPkQa5b64rWsFPQnqx2OM=/21x0:539x345/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68739310/Dogecoin_logo.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4tTtSv"&gt;Robinhood has started restricting trading in cryptocurrencies this morning, just as the price of joke cryptocurrency Dogecoin has soared more than 300 percent in 24 hours. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-restricts-crypto-trading-as-bitcoin-dogecoin-surge.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Robinhood users started noticing instant deposits for cryptocurrencies were no longer working on Friday morning, and the company has confirmed it has put restrictions in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFvEex"&gt;“Due to extraordinary market conditions, we’ve temporarily turned off Instant buying power for crypto,” says a Robinhood spokesperson in a statement to CNBC. “Customers can still use settled funds to buy crypto. We’ll keep monitoring market conditions and communicating with our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K0a1PJ-0zwLYBLw_09VUqQtfaQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22267815/RlMpjva.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Coindesk&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dogecoin price on Friday morning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2q5Rcl"&gt;Dogecoin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/29/5665470/dogecoin-has-its-day-the-unlikely-success-of-a-joke-cryptocurrency"&gt;came to life in 2013&lt;/a&gt; off the back of a Twitter joke — a play on bitcoin and &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/31/5248762/doge-meme-rescue-dog-wow"&gt;the doge meme&lt;/a&gt;. Its price started soaring yesterday, and Dogecoin currently stands at a more than &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/dogecoin"&gt;$7 billion market cap&lt;/a&gt; thanks to a huge volume of transactions over the past 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SojMbQ"&gt;The market activity and restrictions over the past 24 hours have now made Dogecoin a popular meme among the r/WallStreetBets investors. Dogecoin has been consistently spammed in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253892/discord-wallstreetbets-server-virtual-trade-floor-reddit"&gt;WallStreetBets Discord server&lt;/a&gt; over the past couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TlRaU"&gt;Bitcoin is also on the move, up nearly 20 percent over the past 24 hours. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also changed his Twitter profile to include #bitcoin and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1355068728128516101"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; “in retrospect, it was inevitable.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgCwEKSp556jgViV-DbCf4Hf-qo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22267812/T8rYdhy.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elon Musk’s Twitter profile now mentions bitcoin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VUnOgO"&gt;Robinhood’s latest crypto restrictions come less than a day after the company moved to restrict its users from buying or trading any of the popular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;Reddit r/WallStreetBets stocks&lt;/a&gt;, including GameStop ($GME), AMC ($AMC), BlackBerry ($BB), Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond ($BBBY), Nokia ($NOK), and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhN74y"&gt;It’s a move that has been met with widespread criticism, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;Google was forced to salvage Robinhood’s one-star rating&lt;/a&gt; on the Google Play Store by deleting nearly 100,000 negative reviews after unhappy users review-bombed the app. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255031/robinhood-gamestop-stop-purchases-reddit-wsb-stock-market"&gt;Robinhood says &lt;/a&gt;it will now allow “limited buys” of stocks like GameStop starting Friday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla Roadster production delayed to 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vFXEt7Uckst77IpvcvQSR8dePtM=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68738962/Roadster_Hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ukmjax"&gt;Tesla CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354869981146738693"&gt;Elon Musk says&lt;/a&gt; production for the company’s upcoming Roadster isn’t due to begin until “next year,” roughly two years after the car was initially set to enter production. Tesla announced its $200,000 Roadster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16669024/tesla-roadster-2017-fastest-car-world"&gt;back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, when Musk said the car would start being built in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZSLRl"&gt;In a tweet, Musk suggested that work on the car’s “Tri-motor drive system &amp;amp; advanced battery work” were to blame for the delay. Musk says that Tesla hopes to finish engineering this year, and to have a “release candidate design drivable in late summer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b02spe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Finishing engineering this year, production starts next year. Aiming to have release candidate design drivable late summer. Tri-motor drive system &amp;amp; advanced battery work were important precursors.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354869981146738693?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z7VDUZ"&gt;The hope, however, is that whenever it does arrive, the Roadster will be a vehicle with formidable specs. When it was announced, Musk said that Roadster would be able to hit 620 miles on a single charge, and hinted at a top speed in excess of 250 mph. He also said that its triple-motor drive system (which includes one electric motor in the front and two at the rear) will allow the car to accelerate from 0 to 60 in just 1.9 seconds, and from 0 to 100 in 4.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dB18Kw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKrztk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook reportedly plans newsletter tools after explosion in popularity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IXXL_7-6WkblSIbXTh4vxzPu_OM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68738832/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bXjWLC"&gt;Facebook is planning to offer newsletter tools for independent journalists and writers, &lt;a href="https://nyti.ms/36hBCTB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. These are thought to include features for helping writers build a following using the social network, curate their email lists, and manage their paid subscriptions. Although work on the project is in its early stages, executives reportedly hope the features could launch as soon as this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QhuRK"&gt;The news comes as interest in newsletters is booming. Newsletter service Substack boasted over 250,000 paying subscribers across its service &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/pandemic-spurs-journalists-to-go-it-alone-via-email-613ca2d5-e8d5-4235-9582-48cc028e9d8b.html"&gt;as of September last year&lt;/a&gt;, and just this week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250156/twitter-revue-newsletter-acquisition-email-service"&gt;Twitter acquired newsletter rival Revue&lt;/a&gt;. A number of high-profile journalists have left traditional publications to start up independent newsletters, lured by the promise of complete editorial control over their work and the ability to profit more directly from the subscription revenue it brings in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MqLIOF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We want to do more to support the independent journalists and experts who are building businesses and audiences online”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hMKZI6"&gt;Facebook has been attempting to better highlight news sources on its platform. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285656/facebook-news-tab-section-launch-us-local-publishers-partnership"&gt;News Tab&lt;/a&gt; is a section of the service featuring content from partnering media organizations, some of which are paid for the inclusion of their articles. While the News Tab has seen Facebook improve its relationship with traditional publishers, the newsletter tools are thought to be an attempt to court individual writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pKaXI"&gt;In a statement given to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, a spokesperson for Facebook didn’t directly confirm the report, but said the company is working on ways to support independent journalists. “We want to do more to support the independent journalists and experts who are building businesses and audiences online,” Facebook’s vice president for global news partnerships Campbell Brown said. “We’re exploring ways to help them benefit from the news products we’ve built, like Facebook News and subscriptions, while also building new tools to complement what journalists already find useful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ga2AxE"&gt;Given the explosion in the popularity of newsletters, it was only a matter of time before Facebook started exploring the area. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly told his team to make the project a priority after noticing the trend. But jumping onto the bandwagon is unlikely to go down well with Facebook’s critics. As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1355044530278567938"&gt;Kara Swisher put it in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;, “Does Facebook have one fresh idea or do they need to swipe them all?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCsYw1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal adds mainstream chat features to lure wider audience</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Signal logo seen in the background of a silhouette hand holding a mobile phone." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jcEQ4AyHaakar8q2gQvAHxBEqrU=/0x1:5000x3334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68738816/1230608869.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DouYvU"&gt;The latest version of Signal for both iOS (5.3.1) and Android (5.3.7) brings a number of new additions to the increasingly popular encrypted messaging app. These include mainstream features like chat wallpapers, animated stickers, and an “About” section in your profile. The iOS app now handles data more efficiently, too, bringing it closer to feature parity with the Android app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTogdR"&gt;Messaging apps like Signal and Telegram have seen a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;surge in growth&lt;/a&gt; in recent weeks. Signal was helped by a recommendation from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, while both benefited from the backlash to Facebook’s confusing new privacy policy for WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYCe93"&gt;The new features were first announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1348785240819466242"&gt;on January 11th&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; reported on them rolling out in the beta version of Signal for Android &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/22/signal-starts-catching-up-to-whatsapp-by-adding-custom-wallpapers-and-animated-stickers-apk-download/"&gt;last week Friday&lt;/a&gt;. With chat wallpapers, you can pick from a number of presets or select a photo of your own, and you can also set a wallpaper for a specific conversation or all of them. The beta had 24 animated stickers, according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRqVo1"&gt;The iOS app, meanwhile, is also more efficient with data. iPhone users will see a new setting to lower data usage during calls, an option to automatically pause attachment downloads during calls, and improved image compression among other enhancements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eqbi3B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's a sneak peek at some new Signal features that will start rolling out in a few days:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Chat wallpapers!&lt;br&gt;• About field for your Signal profile&lt;br&gt;• Animated stickers&lt;br&gt;• For iOS: Media auto-download settings and full-screen profile photos (to match Android)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good morning   ! &lt;a href="https://t.co/KEAbhMswRI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KEAbhMswRI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Signal (@signalapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1348785240819466242?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mlkElX"&gt;Signal has long been a popular messaging option for those focused on the security of their communications — the European Commission told staff to switch to Signal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150918/european-commission-signal-encrypted-messaging"&gt;in February 2020&lt;/a&gt;, for example — and Signal is still focused on releasing new security-focused features, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175923/signal-video-calls-new-groups-five-people-max"&gt;encrypted group video calls&lt;/a&gt;. But more consumer-focused features like wallpapers and stickers could make Signal feel more approachable for users coming to the app from WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger, and, ideally, keep them on Signal over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="RArVhf"&gt;Xiaomi has &lt;a href="https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/01/29/forget-about-cables-and-charging-stands-with-revolutionary-mi-air-charge-technology/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; “Mi Air Charge Technology,” a wireless charging system that the company claims is able to charge devices “within a radius of several meters.” Multiple devices can be charged at 5W at the same time, according to Xiaomi, and physical obstacles apparently don’t reduce charging efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX2fpH"&gt;Xiaomi says the technology will also work with smartwatches and fitness bracelets. Another goal is to make “living rooms truly wireless,” with speakers, lamps, and smart home devices all being powered by the same remote system. A Xiaomi representative confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, however, that no commercial products will include the technology this year, and declined to provide a timeframe for release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzrwjL"&gt;Here’s how Mi Air Charge Technology works, in Xiaomi’s words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="J40LtW"&gt;The core technology of Xiaomi’s remote charging lies in space positioning and energy transmission. Xiaomi’s self-developed isolated charging pile has five phase interference antennas built in, which can accurately detect the location of the smartphone. A phase control array composed of 144 antennas transmits millimeter-wide waves directly to the phone through beamforming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDIHy0"&gt;On the smartphone side, Xiaomi has also developed a miniaturized antenna array with built-in “beacon antenna” and “receiving antenna array”. Beacon antenna broadcasts position information with low power consumption. The receiving antenna array composed of 14 antennas converts the millimeter wave signal emitted by the charging pile into electric energy through the rectifier circuit, to turn the sci-fi charging experience into reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4vsiv"&gt;Needless to say, you should be skeptical about the prospects of this technology making it to market until evidence suggests otherwise. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14124938/energous-truly-wireless-charging-apple-ces-2017"&gt;Companies like Energous&lt;/a&gt; have been making announcements about “truly wireless charging” at CES and beyond for several years, but the technology is yet to gain serious traction. Xiaomi has demonstrated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522730/xiaomi-mi-80w-wireless-charging-technology-announced"&gt;wireless charging engineering breakthroughs&lt;/a&gt; in the past, however, and has the advantage of owning a huge hardware ecosystem that it could theoretically leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Welcome to Twitter, Jon Stewart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jon Stewart anti social network" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9s9-6K0bIJs8vewnvuJ7SqBP6Wo=/0x19:400x286/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68737853/jon-stewart.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V8kEiG"&gt;Jon Stewart has just joined Twitter, and is now the proud owner of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jon_actual/"&gt;a verified account&lt;/a&gt;. And, of course, his first tweet was about the redditors on r/WallStreetBets and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254857/robinhood-gamestop-amc-shares-sold-surprised-users"&gt;their stonks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqdUdU"&gt;While it may be the first time he’s made an appearance on Twitter, Stewart is already fitting right in — with a profile picture that’s not actually of him, but a dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9WFixW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is bullshit. The Redditors aren't cheating, they're joining a party Wall Street insiders have been enjoying for years. Don't shut them down...maybe sue them for copyright infringement instead!!&lt;br&gt;We've learned nothing from 2008.&lt;br&gt;Love&lt;br&gt;StewBeef&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Stewart (@jon_actual) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jon_actual/status/1354901018564321287?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2cPCyg"&gt;Fellow late-night commentator Stephen Colbert jumped in to welcome him to the platform, giving Stewart a quote tweet hours before his account was verified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f2SXmg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Well, one thing changed since 2008- a friend of mine joined Twitter. &lt;a href="https://t.co/XowK9xXu4D"&gt;https://t.co/XowK9xXu4D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StephenAtHome/status/1354911389379391489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hCQOWW"&gt;In his &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jon_actual/status/1354967777166172163"&gt;second tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Stewart thanked everyone for the warm welcome, but says he only plans to use Twitter in a “sporadic and ineffective manner.” (Opposed to the rest of us, who use it constantly and ineffectively.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uRxqD2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thanks for the warm welcome! I promise to only use this app in a sporadic and ineffective manner.&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Stewart (@jon_actual) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jon_actual/status/1354967777166172163?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M0sTzL"&gt;It’s unclear what the future holds for Stewart on Twitter. Will he use it to promote his upcoming return to television &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537071/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-announced"&gt;with his Apple TV show&lt;/a&gt;? Will he actually say the word “stonks”? Whatever his plan is, it’ll be seen by a large audience — he’s racked up more than 120,000 followers in the nearly five hours since he first tweeted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="al0XQV"&gt;From all of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIGC3CfFxY4"&gt;welcome to Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood denies claims that it sold GameStop shares out from under its traders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Trading Platform Robinhood Fined 65 Million By Securities And Exchange Commission" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QgnDztU3yGNrIps2Pu1iFIGpg7I=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68737774/1291817081.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HrSPad"&gt;No, Robinhood tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, it didn’t sell off full shares of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop, AMC, and other buzzy stocks&lt;/a&gt; without permission from its traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9qz0P"&gt;That contradicts the stories of twelve people who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;saying that the app unexpectedly sold off their holdings in some of these companies. Quite a number of Robinhood users expressed their surprise on social media today that the app was selling off their stakes, and we tracked down a dozen of them. These traders didn’t believe they had prompted the sales, and they said they weren’t aware of anything on their account that would have automatically triggered them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZTzgT"&gt;“I didn’t have any triggers to sell the stock whether it went up or down. I certainly wouldn’t have put it at $197 when it had just been almost $500,” Jett Flores, who said he was holding stock in GameStop and AMC through Robinhood, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oPcjb5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The small traders planned to hold onto their stock, rather than sell&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IoLdvA"&gt;A spokesperson for Robinhood said these small sellers are wrong about how their shares were sold. “I can confirm that claims that Robinhood proactively sold customers’ shares outside of our standard margin-related sellouts or options assignment procedures are false,” the spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laWYcl"&gt;On Wednesday, Robinhood warned some investors with options in GameStop and AMC that it may automatically sell off their stakes to reduce risk, the spokesperson said. But these investors told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they didn’t have options in GameStop or AMC and hadn’t purchased the stocks on margin. They had purchased the shares outright, they said, and were planning to hold onto them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kr6KcG"&gt;Margin orders occur when an investor borrows money from the broker (in this case Robinhood) to complete a sale, and brokers can call in those shares if they’re worried the investor can’t pay up. According to Robinhood, most of its actions have been calling in options to purchase shares — a more aggressive move, but not unprecedented. But if users fully owned their shares, as these traders claim they did, selling the holdings would be far more unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0bJ13"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;saw screenshots from six traders indicating that their purchase of GameStop or AMC stock had been filled within Robinhood. Six traders sent screenshots showing that their stock in these companies had been sold, with four clearly indicating that they had been sold today. Another trader sent screenshots showing a purchase of Naked Brand stock being filled and then sold within the app. The screenshots don’t indicate how the purchases were funded or how the sales were initiated, but in several of them the app displays a message saying, “We’ve received your order to sell [#] shares of [stock] at the best available price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qykRDd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I certainly wouldn’t have put it at $197 when it had just been almost $500.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s1AHtZ"&gt;Traders who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;said they were disappointed to lose their stake in these companies. The traders had been planning to keep the stock for longer, and several said they certainly wouldn’t have sold it at the point that they believe Robinhood pushed through the transaction, as GameStop’s stock was faltering from a nearly $500 high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Mp7Fl"&gt;“It’s extremely dishonest trade on their part and unacceptable,” Ian Q., who said Robinhood unexpectedly sold his shares in GameStop this morning, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2J8hJ"&gt;The surprise selloff isn’t happening to everyone — plenty of people on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit (and one person I know, who told me they purchased GameStop stock days ago) say they weren’t impacted. And though traders may be outraged by the surprise, Robinhood’s terms of service grant it permission to close a trader’s position under a number of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEn2Ij"&gt;While r/WallStreetBets has been at the center of the frenzy around GameStop and AMC stocks, Robinhood has been the tool of choice for many of the small-time and brand new traders jumping in to take part. But this morning, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;Robinhood blocked new purchases&lt;/a&gt; of stock from GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Nokia, and others that were spiking in large part because of purchases coming through the app. The company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254168/robinhood-gamestop-ban-amc-nokia-public-webull-ameritrade-stock-buy-trade"&gt;now facing widespread backlash&lt;/a&gt; from users, celebrities, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254909/senate-banking-stocks-sherrod-brown-aoc-gamestop-reddit-hearing"&gt;politicians&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255031/robinhood-gamestop-stop-purchases-reddit-wsb-stock-market"&gt;re-open purchases on a “limited” basis&lt;/a&gt; on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3YKLEt"&gt;It’s still not clear what happened to cause these users’ stakes to be sold off today. But at the very least, it means Robinhood has even more unhappy customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>University will stop using controversial remote-testing software following student outcry</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new challenges facing college athletes on campus including legal and ethical questions about COVID-19 guidelines" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xWZMPSERHdYLobfzgJMQumYpxHM=/0x66:2000x1399/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68737762/1223311899.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Students head to class at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. | E. Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UEgGHl"&gt;The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign &lt;a href="https://emails.illinois.edu/newsletter/1970177238.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will discontinue its use of remote-proctoring software Proctorio after its summer 2021 term. The decision follows almost a year of outcry over the service, both on UIUC’s campus and around the US, citing concerns with privacy, discrimination, and accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGBLzk"&gt;Proctorio is one of the most prominent software platforms that colleges and universities use to watch for cheating on remote tests. It uses what its website describes as “machine learning and advanced facial detection technologies” to record students through their webcams while they work on their exams and monitor the position of their heads. The software flags “suspicious signs” to professors, who can review its recordings. The platform also enables professors to track the websites students visit during their exams, and bar them from functions like copy / pasting and printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KB23V"&gt;Though Proctorio and similar services have been around for years, their use exploded in early 2020 when COVID-19 drove schools around the US to move a bulk of their instruction online. So, too, has scrutiny towards their practices. Students and instructors at universities around the country have &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/students-are-pushing-back-against-proctoring-surveillance-apps"&gt;spoken out&lt;/a&gt; against the widespread use of the software, claiming that it causes unnecessary anxiety, violates privacy, and has the potential to discriminate against marginalized students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWTjeK"&gt;In an email to instructors, ADA coordinator Allison Kushner and Vice Provost Kevin Pitts wrote that professors who continue to use Proctorio through the summer 2021 term are “expected to accommodate students that raise accessibility issues,” and that the campus is “investigating longer-term remote proctoring options.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TRO48O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The service “was never considered to be a long-term campus proctoring solution.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GLEdHm"&gt;Proctorio has been controversial on UIUC’s campus since the service was introduced &lt;a href="https://dailyillini.com/news/2020/04/17/proctorio-concerns/"&gt;last spring&lt;/a&gt;, and concerned students only grew more vocal through the fall 2020 semester. (Due to COVID-19, the school now operates with a hybrid of online and in-person instruction.) Over 1,000 people signed a &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/uiuc-stop-proctoring-exams-through-proctorio-proctoru?redirect=false"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; calling on the university to stop using the service. “Proctorio is not only inefficient, it is also unsafe and a complete violation of a student’s privacy,” reads the petition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xWp9y"&gt;UIUC is one of &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/students-are-pushing-back-against-proctoring-surveillance-apps"&gt;many campuses&lt;/a&gt; where remote proctoring has faced backlash. A &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/miami-university-end-proctorio-use-at-miami-university"&gt;Miami University petition&lt;/a&gt;, which gathered over 500 signatures, declared that “Proctorio’s design invades student rights, is inherently ableist and discriminatory, and is inconsistent with peer reviewed research.” Over 3,500 signatories have called on the &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/university-of-regina-administration-call-on-the-university-of-regina-to-remove-proctortrack?redirect=false"&gt;University of Regina&lt;/a&gt; to end its use of ProctorTrack, another automated proctoring service. A 1,200-signature petition urges the &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/university-of-central-florida-ask-ucf-to-stop-using-honor-lock-which-is-a-severe-invasion-of-privacy"&gt;University of Central Florida&lt;/a&gt; to dump Honorlock, another similar software, declaring that “students should not be forced to sign away their privacy and rights in order to take a test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5cVtd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"&gt;Professors and staff&lt;/a&gt; have criticized the service as well. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166023/epic-proctorio-examity-privacy-online-testing-school-lawsuit-proctoring"&gt;filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Proctorio (alongside four other test-proctoring services), claiming that the services’ collection of personal information amounts to “unfair and deceptive trade practices.” Even US senators have gotten involved; a coalition including Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) sent an &lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-leads-call-for-virtual-exam-software-companies-to-improve-equity-accessibility-and-privacy-for-students-amid-troubling-reports"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to Proctorio and two similar services in December citing a number of concerns about their business practices. “Students have run head on into the shortcomings of these technologies—shortcomings that fall heavily on vulnerable communities and perpetuate discriminatory biases,” wrote the senators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GDJ1qj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Proctorio is not only inefficient, it is also unsafe and a complete violation of a student’s privacy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QSdsqZ"&gt;The complaints largely revolve around security and privacy — Proctorio’s recordings give instructors and the service access to some of test-takers’ browsing data, and a glimpse of their private homes in some cases. (Proctorio stated in its &lt;a href="https://epic.org/privacy/dccppa/online-test-proctoring/Proctorio-senate-response-010721.pdf"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; to the Senators’ letter that “test-taker data is secured and processed through multiple layers of encryption” and that Proctorio retains its recordings “for the minimum amount of time required by either our customer or by applicable law.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OP15AB"&gt;Accessibility is another common concern. Students have reported not having access to a webcam at home, or enough bandwidth to accommodate the service; one test-taker told &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that she had to take her first chemistry test in a Starbucks parking lot last semester. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rEzh4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/style/testing-schools-proctorio.html"&gt;Students have also reported&lt;/a&gt; that services like Proctorio have difficulty identifying test-takers with darker skin tones, and may disproportionately flag students with certain disabilities. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215727/examsoft-online-exams-testing-facial-recognition-report"&gt;Research has found&lt;/a&gt; that even the best facial-recognition algorithms make more errors in identifying Black faces than they do identifying white ones. Proctorio stated in its response that “We believe all of these cases were due to issues relating to lighting, webcam position, or webcam quality, not race.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="xv21w0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Instructors utilizing Proctorio should inform students that they are aware of the challenges that Proctorio presents”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sBBJj4"&gt;“We take these concerns seriously,” reads UIUC’s email, citing student complaints related to “accessibility, privacy, data security and equity” as factors in its decision. It recommends that students for whom Proctorio presents a barrier to test-taking “make alternative arrangements” as the program is phased out, and indicates that accessibility will be considered in the selection of the next remote-proctoring solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1A8G9C"&gt;We’ve reached out to UIUC and Proctorio for comment, and will update this story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
