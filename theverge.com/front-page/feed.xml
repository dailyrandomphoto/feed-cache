    <title>You’ll never believe it, Samsung made a black phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fF3uCp8D1dcO1E7uQvdfXxfojKY=/33x0:1047x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68668285/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_8.11.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GQrXei"&gt;Samsung’s just announced a ton of new products: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G&lt;/a&gt; is the company’s latest flagship and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;SmartTags&lt;/a&gt; are a Tile and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875341/apple-tags-location-rumor-roundup"&gt;(maybe) Apple AirTags&lt;/a&gt; competitor. But the real innovation, the thing that Samsung spent almost three minutes waxing poetically about during its 2021 Unpacked presentation, was the color black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIiEBE"&gt;Specifically, “phantom black,” the company’s “new” version of black for the Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. A black that Samsung describes as “strong, fluid, and modern,” and also “unapologetic,” “resonant,” and “unforgettable,” despite looking more or less like the black phones Samsung’s rolled out almost every year. Call it Samsung entering its Adult Goth phase or maybe just a way to pad out a presentation that was light on news. You can get a glimpse of Samsung’s... passion for the color in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q7sbp7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eQtVzO1Rs_w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kYMgbk"&gt;“When it comes to design” the video’s serious disembodied designer voice starts, “black isn’t just a color, it’s all colors in one.” In terms of art, that’s accurate, as to print something in black requires multiple “subtractive colors” (like magenta or yellow) combined together, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fcreativecloud%2Fdesign%2Fdiscover%2Fis-black-a-color.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F14%2F22230934%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s21-phantom-black-phone-color#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to Adobe&lt;/a&gt;. In the world of physics, black is the absence of light, but Samsung’s “haze glass” covered take isn’t quite shine free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SS6tOq"&gt;The style of the video takes the exact same, “I just discovered this” tone of Apple’s design videos, specifically Apple’s Jony Ive-voiced explanation of the jet black version of the iPhone 7. It’s an overview of processes that any phone would go through to be finished with color, but delivered with the reverence of someone explaining their method of curing the common cold. Self-satisfied might be an inaccurate description for the traditionally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/14/4106268/watch-this-samsungs-complete-and-completely-weird-galaxy-s4"&gt;weird Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, but it gets mighty close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q890np"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aEh0cJCwmTc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OcH6Lm"&gt;Samsung apparently journeyed through the worlds of fashion, automobiles, and art to settle on its version of the color, which should look like, well, black, from every angle with minimal glare. It’s a “quest” that maybe didn’t need to happen, or at least, didn’t need to be immortalized in video, especially because the “experience” of black can be found by standing in a dark room, closing your eyes, or &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/business/products/mobile/phones/galaxy-s/galaxy-s20-ultra-5g-128gb-at-t-sm-g988uzkaatt/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;looking at an S20 from last year&lt;/a&gt;. But Samsung’s specific, serious (is it serious? I’ve watched the video multiple times and am no longer sure) consideration of the color and choice of name seems like a deliberate attempt to connect a smartphone to a real scientific breakthrough: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20813054/vantablack-ultrablack-black-material-surrey-nanosystems-carbon-nanotubes-science-materials"&gt;Vantablack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUOgyE"&gt;Vantablack is an “ultrablack” material made from carbon nanotubes that was discovered by accident in the pursuit of other, potentially more useful scientific breakthroughs. Nanotubes could one day fortify space equipment or act as a futuristic conductive material, but for now they’re about as useful as Samsung’s video explaining the color black. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You’ll soon be able to upload files as big as 250GB to OneDrive, Microsoft Teams, and SharePoint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dZjxI5EKXYG9PrhIOM9Xteo5Ex4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68668241/acastro_180226_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1jrCvz"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/gain-more-flexibility-with-250-gb-file-size-support-in-microsoft/ba-p/1847728?ocid=usoc_TWITTER_M365_spl100001789796125"&gt;will soon&lt;/a&gt; let you upload even bigger files to OneDrive, Teams, and SharePoint, increasing the limit from 100GB to 250GB. The bigger file size limit could be good news for people who are working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic and need to upload large projects like 4K and 8K video, CAD files, or scientific datasets to the cloud so they can be shared with colleagues and clients. The change will also carry over to OneDrive for personal use, according to Microsoft, which could make it easier for you to upload large photo or video collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XtWLFx"&gt;Microsoft says the 250GB file size upload limit will begin rolling out by the end of January. The company expects the new limit to be generally available by the end of this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMyNTa"&gt;This is Microsoft’s second recent increase for file upload sizes — the company upped it from 15GB to 100GB &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310182/microsoft-onedrive-teams-sharing-integration-100gb-file-upload-limit"&gt;last July&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung partners with Audi, BMW, Ford, and Genesis to turn your phone into a car key</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdxL747p6uH9izPwK3kngBShjPE=/37x0:1164x751/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667968/samsung_car_partnership_key.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="buyPJS"&gt;The dream of using your phone to unlock your car door (instead of carrying around a bulging key fob) may be one step closer today: Samsung has announced partnerships with Audi, BMW, Ford, and Genesis to do just that, saying the feature may be available as soon as August 2021. And excitingly, those digital car keys should work with Apple iPhones and across other Android brands, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zejfc"&gt;That’s because Samsung is part of multiple standards bodies that are working on the tech, including the Car Connectivity Consortium and the FiRa Consortium, of which Apple is also a leading member. “You’ll even be able to share your digital key across smartphones, regardless of brand or platform,” Samsung’s Kevin Chung announced during the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt; event today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDEZRx"&gt;Unfortunately, it’s not yet clear which automakers will support the coolest, securest version of this tech: UWB. It uses small, standardized beacon-like pulses of low-power energy, preferably from multiple parts of your car at once, to figure out exactly where you are in relation to your car’s handle from a sizable distance away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjiEwc"&gt;Samsung says with the new digital keys, “you’ll be able to unlock your car door when you reach it, no sooner, no later,” but I’m pretty sure it’s only referring to UWB there. The fallback is NFC, where you’d likely need to pull your phone out and tap it to your car, like you do with tap-to-pay NFC transactions today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VvvcJOdfgzjFCSVEpoEdCK1_ptc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235445/uwb_car_finder_samsung.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AR viewfinder for UWB-equipped phones and cars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tEHadb"&gt;Samsung also showed off how the tech can let you find your car in a crowded parking lot, with an augmented reality viewfinder it says it’s bringing to Samsung phones — but the fine print says it only works with UWB-equipped cars and UWB-enabled phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZN4xk1"&gt;Every iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 comes with UWB now, but Samsung says only the Galaxy Z Fold 2, the new S21 Plus and S21 Ultra (so, not the S21?), and the “Galaxy Note 20+” (presumably referring to the Note 20 Ultra, which has UWB) will support the AR viewfinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAUJvz"&gt;Apple is also waiting for carmakers to adopt UWB and had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299182/apple-carkey-ios-14-13-digital-key-unlock-car-iphone-wwdc-2020"&gt;roll out its own version of digital car keys with NFC to start&lt;/a&gt;, and only on the 2021 BMW 5 Series. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230569/bmw-digital-key-plus-iphone-unlock-u1-chip-ultra-wideband"&gt;BMW announced earlier today&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll support UWB, branded as “Digital Key Plus,” with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21558833/bmw-ix-inext-electric-suv-range-price-specs"&gt;electric BMW iX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtOt6h"&gt;Samsung’s also introducing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;a UWB-based tracking tag for finding your lost gadgets later this year&lt;/a&gt;, though — like the car keys — it’s starting off with a less impressive Bluetooth version instead that won’t let you locate them as precisely.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s object eraser will let you remove people from the background of your photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U_66xE05DLbIKNRXaX7-eO_-EPI=/72x0:777x470/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667952/Jan_14_2021_08_57_55.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Video: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8K4gq2"&gt;Samsung revealed new One UI 3 details at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227561/samsung-galaxy-s21-event-news-announcements-biggest-products-unpacked"&gt;today’s Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt;, including an interesting new photo trick called object eraser, which lets you delete people from the backgrounds of your images. After a photo is taken, you can simply tap on the people you want to remove, and AI will (in theory) do the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7Vsoe"&gt;If it works well — and that’s a big if — this is no small feat. Removing an element from a photo and intelligently filling in the background to replace it would be similar to what Adobe does with its Content-Aware Fill tool. We wouldn’t expect this feature to perform quite on that level, but it’s a tricky problem usually left to sophisticated image editing software to solve. If Samsung can pull this off convincingly, it’ll be a good trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5IJu5"&gt;This feature will be available first on Samsung’s S21 series phones, but it should come to compatible Galaxy devices with an Android 11 update early this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Samsung Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P8A0dzHGIxoeM1CiU288TcgffH4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667935/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yhHXHw"&gt;During Samsung’s Unpacked event, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227561/samsung-galaxy-s21-event-news-announcements-biggest-products-unpacked"&gt;unveiled three new phones&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Galaxy S21 lineup — the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and the S21 Ultra — which will be available to preorder starting January 14th and will release on January 29th. As a reminder, their prices range from $999.99 to upward of $$1,379.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMchhq"&gt;We will be reviewing the S21 line soon, but if you are interested in preordering the phone, we’ve compiled a list of retailers that currently have product listings available. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2020 was a preview of hotter years to come</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Icebergs in Greenland" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d6ZjnwXPRqkA7UbCr7UJ5tSz2b4=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667797/1229413961.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="otfQun"&gt;2020 ranks among the hottest years on record, several science agencies said today. &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/the-climate-events-of-2020-show-how-excess-heat-is-expressed-on-earth"&gt;NASA said&lt;/a&gt; that 2020 shares the top spot with 2016, following a &lt;a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/2020-warmest-year-record-europe-globally-2020-ties-2016-warmest-year-recorded"&gt;similar determination&lt;/a&gt; by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service last week. The World Meteorological Association (WMO), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and UK Met Office all released figures putting 2020 within the top three warmest years recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkpFYz"&gt;They all agree that 2020 continued a trend of climbing temperatures, which is changing what’s considered “normal” on our planet. The warmest six years in recorded history have all taken place &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21427943/2020-global-warming-record-5-year-period-united-nations-report"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;. We just climbed out of the hottest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21003596/climate-change-end-of-decade-2019-temperature-storms-wildfires-effects-emissions"&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt; on record, and it already looks like the decade ahead will get hotter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="222xkD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can basically expect more of the same.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zGSzuJ"&gt;“We can basically expect more of the same,” says Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “We’re not going back to temperatures in the 1980s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNR7Hm"&gt;Each agency uses its own methods to come to independent conclusions, which is &lt;a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2015/01/21/why-so-many-global-temperature-records/"&gt;why there are slight differences&lt;/a&gt;. But the differences between the three hottest years — 2020, 2019, and 2016 — are “indistinguishably small,” according to the WMO, which incorporates findings from regional agencies to make its call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsXF8U"&gt;NASA tends to land at slightly higher global average temperatures than other agencies. That’s because it uses readings from nearby weather stations to estimate temperatures across regions with limited data collection — like the Arctic. That’s significant because the Arctic has warmed at a rate more than three times faster than the rest of the globe since 1970, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-noaa-analyses-reveal-2019-second-warmest-year-on-record"&gt;according to NASA&lt;/a&gt;. So including more of the region into its global analysis gives NASA a more comprehensive perspective. It corrects for a “cold bias” that can affect other data sets that are missing figures from the Arctic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWUKM1"&gt;What was even more alarming about 2020 compared to previous years was that it was exceptionally hot despite a La Niña event, which typically has a cooling effect on the planet. Had a La Niña not developed toward the end of last year, 2020 might have won the title for hottest year on record hands down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CB1ovT"&gt;The world as a whole in 2020 was about 1.2 degrees Celsius hotter than it was from 1850–1900, the preindustrial period that’s considered a baseline. The goal of the Paris climate agreement is to keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius in order to prevent the most severe effects of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I1sbEE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Climate-related disasters, however, are already here&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CdIG7b"&gt;Climate-related disasters, however, are already here. “A small increase in the global temperature can lead to big changes in extreme weather events. We’ve already seen some of those,” says Ahira Sánchez-Lugo, a physical scientist at NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. The US experienced the most active &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726487/2020-atlantic-hurricane-season-end"&gt;Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/202013#:~:text=Based%20on%20preliminary%20analysis%2C%20the,have%20all%20occurred%20since%202012."&gt;most active western wildfire season&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPqmnZ"&gt;The world isn’t transforming evenly. Some places are hit harder and faster by climate change because of their unique vulnerabilities. The Arctic, which also experienced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-020-02568-y&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22230914%2F2020-global-temperature-record-climate-change#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;unprecedented blazes&lt;/a&gt; last year, got up to 6 degrees Celsius hotter in 2020 compared to the average temperature from 1981 to 2000, according to Copernicus. It’s heating up faster in part because warmer weather means less ice and snow to reflect sunlight. Darker surfaces, revealed by melting ice, absorb more heat. And because the world’s seas are heating up faster than land, warmer water is also speeding up change at the sea ice-covered poles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgOTdB"&gt;Similar phenomena take place in other regions with vast shorelines and snowy winters. Take the US Northeast, which is warming at a &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/center-news/northeast-warming-faster-rest-us#:~:text=%E2%80%9CVariability%20over%20the%20ocean%20is,being%20exacerbated%20by%20climate%20change."&gt;faster rate&lt;/a&gt; than the rest of America and is projected to &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168697"&gt;keep doing so&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s important to realize that two degrees Celsius [of warming] globally, means three degrees Celsius warming locally in the Northeast,” says Ambarish Karmalkar, a research assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="671EXw"&gt;We are heading “quite strongly” toward the temperature thresholds set by the Paris accord, says Schmidt. “All of these things are making an impact now on sea level, on all sorts of things that real people are having to deal with right now,” he says. “It’s only going to get worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9G1lOj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1Mv2W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy S21 event: the biggest announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YV0RSC-rkbPJkorp0vY61wKO5E4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667564/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8rmWgJ"&gt;Samsung just finished its first Unpacked event of 2021. The headline announcements were the three new phones in its S21 lineup, but the company also announced new true wireless headphones, an item tracker, and a few other things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnCzZS"&gt;We’ve rounded up all of the biggest announcements from the event right here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nW1DZw2s8CszwwLruPWVY8PPGyc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232924/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T6OKVx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21991813"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus will launch on January 29th&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Caz0kP"&gt;Samsung announced the $799 Galaxy S21 and $999 S21 Plus, which are available for preorder today ahead of availability on January 29th. They’re largely the same phones (except for their physical size), and their camera module takes up an entire corner of the phones, giving them a whole new look. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x1fJYPTkfuKz2n_hkJlD-KKe9uo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233315/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6QfS1q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21991813"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra is compatible with the S Pen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6iI9Bu"&gt;Samsung announced the $1,199 Galaxy S21 Ultra, its newest top-of-the-line flagship smartphone. It has a bigger screen and more cameras than the S21 and S21 Plus, and, in a first for Samsung’s S-line of smartphones, it has support for the S Pen stylus. It’s also available for preorder today and will launch on January 29th. Samsung is working on an S Pen Pro with Bluetooth, which is coming later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HfeF9PeMncaIVpZwABYhZsorqEA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235236/galaxy_s21_5g_highlights_box.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Plus box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IulYwV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21989971"&gt;Samsung’s S21 lineup won’t include a charger in the box&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4LZXZ"&gt;Samsung is following Apple in not including a charging brick in the box with its newest phones. The phones will come with a USB-C to USB-C cable, but you’ll need to own a compatible charging brick or buy a new one if you want to plug your brand-new phone into a wall. The S21 lineup also won’t include headphones in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n3CyMPp3keMhYFgIcFHra0jV7fU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233200/BudsPro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F1Gy1N"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21992988"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro are Samsung’s most premium wireless earbuds yet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uBSCN7"&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy Buds Pro true wireless earbuds have improved active noise cancellation, a refined ambient sound mode, an IPX7 rating for water resistance, and more. They cost $199, are available for preorder today, and you’ll be able to buy them in stores on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gKwRvaFw-fWFLQvkCbcQcv5SigE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232918/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0003.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qKuu8e"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21991662"&gt;Samsung announced the SmartTag and SmartTag Plus Tile-like item trackers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4Xqze9"&gt;Samsung announced a Tile tracker competitor called the SmartTag. It’s a small Bluetooth Low Energy dongle that you can attach to things, and you can pair it with Samsung’s SmartThings app. The SmartTag only works with Galaxy devices, though. The SmartTag will be available on January 29th and it will cost $29.99. Samsung also announced the Galaxy SmartTag Plus, which uses ultra-wideband for more precise tracking. The SmartTag Plus is launching later this year, and you’ll be able to buy one for $39.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O51FpVSG8Iljxu_i4g4xwcP0YHY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667561/budswater.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KhvWxd"&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy Buds Pro are aimed right at Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds in terms of features. They feature active noise cancellation, and Samsung claims that they’ll offer the deepest sound out of its lineup of truly wireless earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22228947/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-price-release-date-unpacked"&gt;My colleague Chris Welch has more details on the Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m here to tell you how you can buy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWx6L8"&gt;They’re available for pre-purchase now for $199.99 — just $30 above the retail cost of the bean-shaped Galaxy Buds Live (though those have been selling at $130 for some time). They’ll start shipping on January 15th. Samsung has released the Galaxy Buds Pro in three colors: phantom black, phantom silver, and phantom violet, but that last one’s region-specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2A7gZh"&gt;We expect several more retailers to sell the Galaxy Buds Pro, but so far it’s just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=nav_youraccount_switchacct&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=a132b1c0443d9aa673bcdd905d045c6c&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729413439535861358" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729412138524734388" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; offering them currently. &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Faccessories%2Fheadphones%2Fgalaxy-buds-pro-wireless-earbuds-phantom-black.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; is selling them online and in stores, as is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeEvergreen/https://www.verizon.com/products/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D86221763247419220562345969261647763933%7CMCORGID%3D843F02BE53271A1A0A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1610642528&amp;amp;mboxSession=d341a7c8c9c740b195a92c70a7d0ba75&amp;amp;vendorid=CJM&amp;amp;cjevent=3add7d96543211eb807402d60a1c0e12" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy S21 phones don’t include microSD card support</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Nf9Dj"&gt;It’s official: Samsung is ditching the microSD card on all three of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt; models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afCzjY"&gt;We asked Samsung about this, and the company’s rationale seemed to be that it doesn’t think it’s necessary. A spokesperson told us that it only costs $50 to upgrade from 128GB to 256GB and that this is cheaper than what competitors are charging to step up storage. They also noted that cloud storage is an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99M8RU"&gt;That’s all well and good, but it’s still likely that this change will be a bummer for some potential customers. It means the maximum amount of storage you’ll be able to get on the S21 phones (without wrangling up additional cloud storage) is the 512GB configuration of the S21 Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbTUHE"&gt;As &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/what-is/microsd-support/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s website advertises&lt;/a&gt;, the microSD slot on last year’s S20 lineup gives users access to potentially over 1TB of storage. That means for customers who are already using high-capacity microSD cards with those older models, the S21 line will be a storage downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21 Ultra will max out at 512GB of storage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1mEgVQ"&gt;Samsung has toyed with removing the microSD slot before. It attempted to pull the port from its Galaxy S6 but brought it back to the S7 in response to customer complaints. Some modern flagships are also SD-less, though, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/20/18233832/samsung-galaxy-fold-no-headphone-jack-design-35-mm-folding-phone"&gt;Galaxy Fold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20754566/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-2-size-price-release-date-s-pen-dex-laptop-unpacked-event"&gt;Note 10&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21353196/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-price-release-date-camera-stylus-specs"&gt;Note 20&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After years of following pro sports, League of Legends esports leagues are ‘finally free to be ourselves’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z1hggn"&gt;For years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/27/17616532/overwatch-league-of-legends-nba-nfl-esports"&gt;competitive gaming has done its best to mimic professional sports&lt;/a&gt;, whether it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20856826/nike-league-of-legends-china-lpl-jerseys-partnership-esports"&gt;players wearing Nike jerseys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406041/post-malone-envy-gaming-dallas-empire-fuel"&gt;big-name celebrity investors&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18516124/overwatch-league-esports-home-games-arena-stadium"&gt;ambitious plans for home-and-away games&lt;/a&gt;. But Chris Greeley, commissioner of the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; Championship Series — the game’s top professional league in North America — believes that esports has moved beyond mimicking existing sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZ5szh"&gt;“We had this idea in the beginning that, because esports is a sport, and we wanted to be taken seriously, we should look like a sport,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The LCS looked like the NBA on TNT. It was great for validation and for investors and sponsors to look and say ‘Hey, this looks just like a sport, therefore this is an easy translation.’ But we’ve outlived that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuMOGJ"&gt;So starting in 2021, the league is making some big changes, both in terms of how it looks and how it’s structured. “We feel like we’re finally free to be ourselves,” Greeley says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mydPu0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People hate change.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hvsjtC"&gt;The most obvious change is visual. The league has a new logo — it’s a crystal made of the letters LCS — and a refreshed graphic design for broadcasts. Whereas the previous logo was a shield that wouldn’t have looked out of place in college football, the new one clearly represents a video game. It follows similar redesigns for the other top &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; competitions around the world, including Europe, China, and Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SuXNA1"&gt;(Greeley says the logo has received a mixed reaction from fans so far — which was expected. “People hate change. We’ve seen it from pretty much every esports rebrand,” he says, adding “You don’t want [a logo that] looks like it came off of a can of soup. It has to be resonant.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vLuecY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Riot used tech from The Mandalorian to build Worlds’ astonishing mixed reality stage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21529317/league-of-legends-world-championship-high-tech-stage-riot-mandalorian"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1_NHNfECJTLdzvAFic0Ws6mI-PU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232863/Logo.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GpzdYS"&gt;The idea behind the refresh, he says, is to give the LCS its own distinct voice in an increasingly crowded field. “It’s not just about a new color or a new logo, but it really is about how we’re going to follow with our broadcast and our content,” he says. “You’re not going to tune in this week and see a finished product. We’ll be iterating over the next year or two, but I think this is a really great start.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bYLsB7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s not just about a new color or a new logo.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ccBKgD"&gt;To go along with this, the LCS is also introducing some &lt;a href="https://lolesports.com/article/2021-lcs-season-updates/blte6f00fe5b287ffd5"&gt;major format changes&lt;/a&gt;, with a bigger focus on tournaments, including one to kick off the year that starts on January 15th. Previously, the competition closely resembled something like the NFL, with a slate of regular season matches culminating in the playoffs; the best teams then moved on to international competitions. The goal is to find a balance between the thrill of knockout tournaments and the familiarity of regular season play. “Tournaments are exciting,” Greeley explains. “The problem is, if everything is a tournament, if everything is meant to feel exciting, then nothing feels exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VuDqnK"&gt;Despite problems caused by the pandemic, the LCS — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238268/league-of-legends-csgo-esports-leagues-twitch-viewership"&gt;along with many other esports leagues&lt;/a&gt; — experienced &lt;a href="https://lolesports.com/article/behind-the-numbers-a-record-breaking-2020-lcs-summer-split/blt1654440fda7c9e6b"&gt;tremendous growth&lt;/a&gt; in terms of viewership last year. But the league struggled on a competitive level. At the annual &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championship, North American teams were far behind the competition and didn’t pose much of a threat to the big clubs from Europe, China, and Korea. Much of the blame was put on the region’s developmental scene. Instead of encouraging up-and-coming local players, many LCS teams relied on aging or imported stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCGuXo"&gt;The league is hoping to change that with &lt;a href="https://lolesports.com/article/2021-amateur-ecosystem-updates/blt69197d4426878cfd"&gt;a revamped amateur system&lt;/a&gt;, with the goal of opening things up, so that the developmental squads for each LCS team — known as academy teams — are able to play in different tournaments against other amateur and college teams. This will culminate in an end-of-year tournament called LCS Proving Grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k78STK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJmsIBM6FxI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qzUdCf"&gt;According to Greeley, these changes were in the works prior to Worlds — but the feedback was still welcome. “The criticism around the need for NA to make changes to develop players, that actually was satisfying to hear, because I knew this was coming,” he says of the amateur changes. “We hadn’t announced it, it was nearly final at that point, but we were just figuring out how we were going to roll it out. When you’re developing a solution, and then everyone stands up and says ‘We need a solution,’ and it’s done and ready to show, that’s actually a pretty good feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PptRH"&gt;2021 will also see the league continue to operate remotely. Typically, LCS matches take place in a Los Angeles studio with fans in attendance. That obviously hasn’t been possible during the pandemic, but Greeley says that this could slowly change throughout the year. The first step is to get the broadcast team in the building, and the hope is that by the time playoffs come around, players can be present as well. Viewers, meanwhile, will likely have to stick to watching on Twitch and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCAy3v"&gt;“We’re not rushing getting fans back into the arena,” Greeley says.&lt;/p&gt;
