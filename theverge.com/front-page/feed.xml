    <title>The first plug-in hybrid Jeep Grand Cherokee is here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dQKe_0HGHRO6ZXI3-JFZiDoaGv0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925135/JP022_105GC.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zoH340"&gt;Jeep revealed the 2022 Grand Cherokee 4xe, the first plug-in hybrid version of the automaker’s best-selling SUV. It is the second Jeep vehicle to get an electrified version, following the hybrid 2021 Wrangler 4xe released last year. Jeep also announced an off-roading version of the Grand Cherokee, the Trailhawk, which also comes with a hybrid motor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8u5MtL"&gt;Tellingly, Jeep is not announcing a pure electric version of the Grand Cherokee, nor selling any battery-electric vehicles. The automaker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568306/jeep-ev-hybrid-wagoneer-wrangler-cherokee-stellantis"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would release “zero-emission” versions of all of its vehicles by 2025, along with plug-hybrid variants. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WK1kIhY10vdxIxSRaaiYSG6DziE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885761/JP022_112GC.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DnUjXn"&gt;The Grand Cherokee 4xe (“four by E” in Jeep parlance) is estimated to get 25 miles of all-electric range and 57 miles per gallon equivalent (MPGe) for a total driving range of more than 440 miles (708 km). Jeep says that its plug-in hybrid propulsion system includes two electric motors, a 400-volt battery pack, 2.0-liter turbocharged, four-cylinder engine, and an eight-speed automatic transmission. Overall, the 4xe system delivers 375 horsepower (280 kW) and 470 lb.-ft. (637 Nm) of torque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pVUdgJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Drivers can tailor the energy output to best suite their driving situation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YwXuwD"&gt;Drivers can tailor the energy output to best suit their driving situation. There are three modes to choose from: Hybrid, which blends torque from the electric motor and gas engine; Electric, which operates on zero-emission electric power only until the battery is depleted; and eSave, which prioritizes the engine, saving the battery charge for later use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrVGbK"&gt;Owners can monitor the hybrid system through the infotainment screen, as well as the amount of power created by regenerative braking. Regen can be adjusted for minimum and maximum levels to best suit driving styles and the amount of power it creates. Drivers can also schedule charging times to take advantage of lower electric rates and view their driving history with detail of electric and gasoline usage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LlG3epV-8C2TDMMGIM8UVbPWqs8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885744/JP022_126GC.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ryauVv"&gt;The Grand Cherokee’s 4xe system also includes something called an Integrated Dual Charging Module (ICDM) that combines a battery charger and a DC/DC converter in a single unit and a Power Inverter Module (PIM) that is reduced in size. These are mounted under the vehicle and protected with steel shields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2JJec"&gt;Jeep’s are meant to be taken off-road, and as such, the company claims its electronic are properly sealed and waterproofed. Jeep says the Grand Cherokee 4xe is capable of water fording up to 24 inches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFRfpE"&gt;Jeep did not announce pricing for the 2022 Grand Cherokee, though if the Wrangler’s window-sticker price is any indication, it won’t be cheap. (The 2021 Wrangler 4xe Sahara starts at $52,520, the Rubicon at $56,220, and the High Altitude at $58,340.) The federal EV tax credit of $7,500 should take some of the sting out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SyKqsP2bIi0zGgvRmPNKVDNClFw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885748/JP022_132GC.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c7OwXb"&gt;Whether customers flock to Jeep’s new hybrid powertrains remains untested. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/2021-jeep-wrangler-unlimited-rubicon-4xe-a-hybrid-that-comes-up-short-11632498123"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s Dan Neil&lt;/a&gt; recently panned the 2021 Wrangler 4xe, calling it “shameless greenwashing, unable to clear the lowest speed bump of skepticism.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="477TdT"&gt;The company, which is an iconic American brand, has been slow to embrace electric vehicle technology compared to its competitors. Whether the new Grand Cherokee can help Jeep pick up the pace remains to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Razer Blade 15 Advanced is $600 off at Best Buy today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7gerdt_3Gt3iO9tom3D_XUMqbeI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925017/cfaulkner_200929_4214_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AgpNDo"&gt;Despite not being the newest model, the 2020 Razer Blade 15 Advanced still offers plenty of power, which makes its current, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfF60uDiEQl#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$600 discount at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; something to consider. Although we saw an even deeper discount on the 15-inch laptop earlier this month that brought it down to $1,600, today’s $1,800 price remains a solid deal for a laptop that has an RTX 2070 Super graphics chip and a fast 300Hz refresh rate display. It even comes packaged with a free month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, allowing you to give your new hardware several benchmark tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUwg8o"&gt;There are plenty of options when it comes to gaming laptops, but it's tough to beat the Razer Blade 15 Advanced in terms of performance and portability. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our 2020 Razer Blade 15 Advanced review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="8IwWSm"&gt;The Anker Nebula Capsule Max is a great way to watch movies in your backyard or even while camping. The diminutive, can-shaped projector has a built-in battery for up to four hours of playback and comes equipped with Android 8.1, letting you download and stream content in 720p from YouTube or Netflix without having to connect the device to an external source. Weighing in at just 1.6 pounds, the Anker Nebula Capsule Max is a great companion for any camping trip or backyard movie night, whether you intend to project a 100-inch image on your wall or something a bit smaller. Normally $470, it’s currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TF834PT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $399&lt;/a&gt;, its second-best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yBq2j3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10778031"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jazOyI"&gt;Aukey’s Basix Pro Wireless Power Bank — which is currently &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Faukeyplus.com%2Fcollections%2Fpower-bank%2Fproducts%2Faukey-basix-pro-wireless-power-bank-20000mah&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F29%2F22697131%2Frazer-gaming-laptop-anker-projector-aukey-charger-xbox-hard-drive-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Aukey for $20&lt;/a&gt; with promo code &lt;strong&gt;VERGE20 &lt;/strong&gt;— is one of the most versatile power banks we’ve seen recently. The slim battery pack holds up to 20,000mAh of juice and can provide any of your Qi-compatible devices with up to 10 watts of power, allowing you to charge a device like the iPhone 11 four times over. The compact device also comes with USB-C and USB-A ports that provide up to 18 watts of power, a kickstand that allows it to function as a charging stand, and a handy LED readout on the side that notes the pack’s current charge level at the press of a button. While the bank itself does need to be plugged in to charge, not having to worry about where you left the cord for your phone when it's on its last legs is definitely handy.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uZyEz6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10778571"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6tJNPf"&gt;If you’re on the hunt for a capable pair of headphones, the Beyerdynamic Lagoon might be for you. These classy and durable headphones can last up to 45 hours on a single charge — or 24.5 hours with active noise cancellation enabled — and can be controlled either via voice commands or with their touch-sensitive ear cups. The LED lighting inside the ear cups is more functional than decorative, too, and changes colors to indicate the battery level and Bluetooth pairing status. These headphones are great for anyone who’s in the market for a solid pair of cans and, right now, they’re available for their &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fbeyerdynamic-715517-black%2Fp%2FN82E16826380045" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lowest price ever ($150) at Newegg&lt;/a&gt; with promo code &lt;strong&gt;972HRFCL88&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FHF2fW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10778654"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wk1hZk"&gt;If those massive file sizes have got your Xbox feeling a little bit heavy, this external hard drive from Western Digital is currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfF8JeuX705#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Best Buy for $150&lt;/a&gt;, nearly its best price to date. The 1TB drive is optimized for Xbox consoles, but thanks to USB 3.0 connectivity, it’s compatible with PCs as well. The drive does use a slower HDD and caps out at a 400MB/s transfer speed, but this shouldn’t be too much of an issue unless you’re transferring massive files on a regular basis. There are definitely faster drives on the market, but the WD Gaming Drive is a good option for anyone looking to quickly expand the storage capacity of their Xbox or PC.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As privacy issues worsen, Congress looks to the FTC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ox3481r2HJwwH44X2JsF3jbi6EM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69924995/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qzguN"&gt;Lawmakers are preparing to hold the first in a series of data privacy hearings on Wednesday in a fresh effort to bolster consumer data protections on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="za971w"&gt;On Wednesday, the Senate Commerce Committee plans to discuss the creation of a new privacy bureau at the FTC and “the need for a comprehensive federal privacy law.” It’s an uncomfortable dodge since Congress has thus far been unable to pass any such privacy law. But with states enacting their own privacy framework, there’s more pressure than ever for some part of the federal government to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4XXQX"&gt;As legislative efforts have stalled, the FTC could be the Biden administration’s best bet at regulating the tech industry’s grasp over consumer data, even if it could take years to finish the agency’s rulemaking process. Still, experts fear the agency may not have the power, by itself, to issue strong enough rules to truly reel in tech’s data power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rrbBLO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That is not an effective way to build trust with consumers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bx4fhd"&gt;“If Congress doesn’t pass privacy laws, and we spend the next six to 15 years in a [rulemaking] process where the FTC has to hobble together a set of rules within the confines of their existing regulatory authority, that is not an effective way to build trust with consumers about the way companies are handling their data,” Morgan Reed, President of The App Association, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an interview Tuesday. Reed is expected to testify at Wednesday’s hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvDbHy"&gt;Still, the FTC is in the best position to enact some form of privacy regulation — and lawmakers have started piling on the pressure for the agency to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmzPf4"&gt;Last week, several lawmakers, including a handful on the Senate Commerce Committee, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684394/ftc-data-privacy-facial-recognition-blumenthal-warren-khan"&gt;wrote a letter&lt;/a&gt; to FTC Chair Lina Khan calling on the commission to write its own data privacy rules. The request came just a few months after the FTC voted to update its rulemaking procedures, making it easier for the agency to issue data rules. The letter also followed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671880/biden-alvaro-bedoya-privacy-ftc-commissioner-facial-recognition"&gt;President Joe Biden’s nomination &lt;/a&gt;of Alvaro Bedoya, a longtime privacy and facial recognition critic, to become the third FTC Democrat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhAPWm"&gt;“In parallel to congressional efforts to create federal privacy laws to give power back to consumers, the Commission should take advantage of every tool in its toolkit to protect consumers’ privacy,” the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684394/ftc-data-privacy-facial-recognition-blumenthal-warren-khan"&gt;lawmakers wrote&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sleE6z"&gt;Congress is also mulling over the possibility of sending the FTC an additional &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/us-panel-votes-approve-1-billion-ftc-privacy-probes-2021-09-14/"&gt;$1 billion in funding&lt;/a&gt; through the proposed $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package to build out a new bureau to focus solely on privacy enforcement. But with Republicans and moderate Senate Democrats opposed to the trillions in additional funding, the money could be left in legislative limbo until both the House and Senate approve a separate bipartisan infrastructure package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XY7HzP"&gt;“The FTC is not very well-funded to do this kind of work. It has limited resources and limited capabilities to engage in privacy work, plus all of the other work it has to do,” Sara Collins, privacy policy counsel at Public Knowledge, said Tuesday. “It’s a competition authority. It’s a general consumer protection authority. They have to have more resources to do this work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjdQ5T"&gt;Still, experts like Collins are optimistic that any new FTC rulemaking could force Congress’ hand on legislative reform. Several states, including California and Colorado, have already enacted their own state bills as well. This patchwork of regulation could build more momentum for lawmakers to tackle a federal law once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fSbe8"&gt;“I think it’s really important to develop strong privacy laws while also giving the Commission the authority to enforce those and to conduct rulemaking specifically on privacy technology vendors,” Jeff Gary, policy director at Georgetown’s Technology, Law and Policy Institute, said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuUojp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCMovp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ah fuck: YouTube takes down classic ‘I can’t believe you’ve done this’ meme </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EhnpJwMGpKhxqrprRzgqzzKvZoI=/78x0:749x447/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69924627/Screen_Shot_2021_09_29_at_10.19.08_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;‘&lt;em&gt;Ah, fuck’&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;em&gt;a frame of Weedon getting socked in the face by his friend Tim from the original upload. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JP9Z5p"&gt;Whether it wants to be or not, YouTube is a guardian of internet history, with countless classic videos sitting in its archives. That makes it jarring when the company acts like what it is: a multinational corporation with no real understanding of this value. Case in point, this week YouTube removed the original upload of the “&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-cant-believe-youve-done-this"&gt;Ah fuck, I can’t believe you’ve done this&lt;/a&gt;” meme, rejecting an appeal from its creator (and the guy who can’t believe this was done) and claiming that the clip violates the company’s “violent or graphic content policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADM4jv"&gt;In the words of &lt;a href="http://paulweedon.co.uk/"&gt;Paul Weedon&lt;/a&gt; himself, star of and uploader of the original video: Ah, fuck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cypzMC"&gt;Weedon tweeted out the news of the takedown and his unsuccessful appeal, noting that the video had been on YouTube for 14 years, and racked up 12 million views in that time with “no issues whatsoever.” The clip itself is a classic: low-res, contextless, and instantly funny. And, of course, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/O7lRV1VHv1g"&gt;countless re-uploads&lt;/a&gt; still exist (alongside the other, legitimately horrible content that YouTube is happy to leave up). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70haGN"&gt;“It completely out of the blue,” Weedon told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; regarding the takedown. “I made the case that it’s been online going on 15 years and is basically part of internet culture.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R4Cc32"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Well, that's that then. A fittingly stupid end to a stupid era. &lt;a href="https://t.co/UmZwwzrAjx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/UmZwwzrAjx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Paul Weedon (@Twotafkap) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twotafkap/status/1443099098438045697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TYDRV4"&gt;The video has been &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-cant-believe-youve-done-this"&gt;remixed and re-memed&lt;/a&gt; in countless ways since it first went viral in the mid-2010s, and Weedon himself has an interesting relationship with the content. In an &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4avnqj/my-life-as-a-meme-i-cant-believe-youve-done-this-revisited"&gt;article for &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year, he describes how the clip was part of a series of “stunts” he and his friends filmed in the vein of &lt;em&gt;Jackass&lt;/em&gt;, and how he sold the original rights for the video to the now-defunct &lt;a href="http://Break.com"&gt;Break.com&lt;/a&gt; and isn’t now sure who even owns the IP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmVoXM"&gt;“At the time, going viral wasn’t really comparable to any other experience and it certainly wasn’t something I could discuss in solidarity with my friends,” writes Weedon. “All of a sudden you’re everywhere and it’s out of your control. You either try to fight it and get destroyed, or embrace it and try to cash in. After yanking down several other videos on my YouTube channel, I opted for the latter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ieeNQv"&gt;To add insult to injury, Weedon is currently exploring the possibility of making a documentary about the meme, so this takedown adds a little twist to the proceedings. “This takes things in a completely different direction,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It says a lot about where YouTube is going. On Twitter, people seem to be saying the same thing: that this is a video that represents what YouTube used to be, and they’ve torched it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXLG9y"&gt;Weedon says he’s found all the footage from the day the meme was shot, and that he and a group of friends are still exploring how to tell the story. “We’re still figuring out what we want to do with it,” he says. “Though I definitely regret promising the documentary would be coming ‘soon’ in the teaser. I forgot how impatient people on the internet can be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="26eezh"&gt;We’ve reached out to YouTube for comment and will update this story if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve reportedly developing standalone VR headset codenamed ‘Deckard’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EgD3KeU2wVIr3bAQZHXrDKMBLI0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69924588/akrales_190528_3450_0047.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valve’s first VR headset, the Index.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DuUjII"&gt;Valve could have a second VR headset in development with a standalone design similar to what’s currently offered by Facebook’s lineup of Oculus Quest headsets. Evidence for the new headset was brought to light by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp42lQYVzwo"&gt;YouTuber Brad Lynch&lt;/a&gt;. He found multiple references in Valve’s SteamVR code to a device codenamed “Deckard” which he then cross-referenced against the company’s recent patent applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nztFh6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/a-new-standalone-valve-vr-headset-teased-by-deep-steamvr-file-dive/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; subsequently confirmed&lt;/a&gt; with its own sources that much of Lynch’s findings are accurate, and that Valve does have a second headset prototype in development. In contrast with the company’s first VR headset, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102584/valve-index-steamvr-headset-review-shipping-today"&gt;Valve Index&lt;/a&gt;, released in 2019, the new headset has a built in processor that could allow it to work without being tethered to a PC by a cable. Valve also reportedly has ambitions for it to be able to track movement without needing external base stations (aka “inside-out” tracking). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L2mQH5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dp42lQYVzwo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HqTnM3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars’ &lt;/em&gt;claims broadly line up with the code references Lynch outlines in his video. These include use of the term “standalone” and a code string that suggests it might have some internal processing power, which could allow it to function independently from an external PC. There are also references that suggest the new headset might have some measure of wireless connectivity, potentially via Wi-Fi. &lt;em&gt;Ars &lt;/em&gt;also reports that details about updated optics are also accurate, which could allow the headset’s lenses to be positioned closer to the user’s face for better comfort and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y50ZQw"&gt;Reports of a standalone headset are interesting in light of the announcement of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;Valve’s handheld Steam Deck console&lt;/a&gt;, which runs on a semi-custom AMD processor. A Valve FAQ has made it clear that the current console is “&lt;a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/faq"&gt;not optimized&lt;/a&gt;” for VR, but in an interview the company expressed an interest in one day using the processor in a standalone VR headset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElDHdn"&gt;“We’re not ready to say anything about [using the AMD processor in a VR headset],” Valve’s Greg Coomer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;recent Steam Deck interview&lt;/a&gt;, “but it would run well in that environment, with the TDP necessary... it’s very relevant to us and our future plans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYUXei"&gt;Of course, Valve developing something internally is no guarantee it’ll ever see a commercial release. &lt;em&gt;Ars &lt;/em&gt;points towards the company’s &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/valve-secrets-spill-over-including-half-life-3-in-new-steam-documentary-app/"&gt;famous history&lt;/a&gt; of working on projects internally, only to kill them off. But the fact that the company has already released one VR headset, and is on the cusp of releasing its own standalone handheld console, has us hopeful that Deckard might one day make it to market.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s automotive efforts appear to be taking a pit stop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qD9pfJo4NjXvKIDYZg6Z5ZQRuH0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69924540/vpavic_190730_3575_0051.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n51aAa"&gt;Amazon laid out its plans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696187/amazon-alexa-ambient-disappearing-computer-limp-interview"&gt;to make ambient computing an even bigger part&lt;/a&gt; of its customers’ lives at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22690309/amazon-fall-hardware-event-rumors-news-announcements"&gt;its hardware and services event on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. But while that vision includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692048/ring-always-home-cam-drone-amazon-price-release-date-specs"&gt;surveillance drones&lt;/a&gt; and being followed around your home by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;a rolling Alexa-on-wheels called Astro&lt;/a&gt;, it was missing products for the other place people spend a lot of their time — their cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ir2EmT"&gt;That left an automotive-sized hole in Amazon’s presentation, and there are some good reasons to find it odd. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691287/amazon-echo-alexa-devices-wall-mounted-soundbar-auto-robot"&gt;Rumors in the lead-up to Amazon’s event&lt;/a&gt; pointed to the launch of a second generation Echo Auto, alongside several other predictions that ended up being true, like the wall-mounted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22693503/amazon-echo-show-15-smart-display-wall-price-specs-features"&gt;Echo Show 15&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540298/amazon-ring-car-dash-cam-image-support-article"&gt;Leaks of the Ring Car Cam&lt;/a&gt; in June also seemed to suggest that the Amazon-owned home security company would announce launch dates for its line of car products, which featured prominently in Amazon’s fall hardware event last year. But not this one: neither device appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A3RMClVN_xkhMOSHs7GaBDcHr5U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21905888/20200921_image_lockup_ringcaralarm_iphone_fcc_rgb_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Car Alarm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MBHA37"&gt;Ring’s side of the mystery seems to be easier to solve, because the brand assures us its devices are still coming. The company announced its expansion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453632/ring-car-alarm-security-camera-connect-tesla-price-specs-features-amazon"&gt;into car security in September 2020&lt;/a&gt; with the introduction of the Ring Car Cam, Ring Car Alarm, and Ring Car Connect API. The products marked Ring’s first move outside of the home and come with smart features like the ability to connect to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448926/amazon-sidewalk-ring-echo-tile-wifi-mesh-ble-location-tracking"&gt;Amazon’s Sidewalk network to send alerts&lt;/a&gt; or record police traffic stops with a simple voice command for added security. When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked why these specific products didn’t appear at Amazon’s event, a Ring spokesperson offered the following response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Md5I21"&gt;This is a completely new category for Ring, and we’re excited to get these auto security devices in the hands of customers once they are ready. Currently our auto devices are with our product testers right now so we can create the best experience possible. We’ve received great feedback thus far, and are looking forward to sharing more in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ReMCXU"&gt;(We also wonder if the delay might have something to do with that Sidewalk network, which Amazon didn’t mention even once during the showcase. Some were angry when Amazon revealed it would retroactively add the feature to many Echo and Ring devices, requiring customers who didn’t want it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463257/amazon-sidewalk-privacy-how-to-opt-out"&gt;to opt-out&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yg17Tm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Maybe now’s not the moment for add-on car tech&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nl4CwM"&gt;Echo Auto, on the other hand, is a much bigger unknown. Amazon first launched the voice-enabled add-on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882126/amazon-echo-auto-alexa-car-features-bluetooth-price"&gt;as a way to get Alexa into cars in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. The device was far from perfect &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20754404/amazon-echo-auto-review-alexa-car-price-specs-features"&gt;when we tested it in our review&lt;/a&gt;, struggling with location-based queries and saddled with the connection issues of whatever phone it was attached to. That leaves plenty of room for improvement for a second-generation device, but Amazon had nothing new to share at its event, and didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the future of the device. It’s a little odd for a product the company was proud to say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/9/18175559/amazon-echo-auto-preorder-numbers"&gt;was preordered by over a million people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXljc2"&gt;Spending more time at home due to the pandemic might have made automotive products less of a necessity — it certainly worked for car washes in my case — so getting Alexa into every car through a hardware solution is possibly not as urgent as it once was. Amazon has partnerships with automakers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/9/16870370/toyota-lexus-amazon-alexa-models-camry-ces-2018"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/27/16372566/bmw-alexa-integration-2018"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt; to help fill that gap anyways, and even bigger plans to let car companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231336/amazon-alexa-auto-ai-custom-digital-assistants-car-makers"&gt;integrate Alexa into their cars with custom wake words&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLqHQq"&gt;An update to the Echo Auto would be appreciated — it’s cheaper than buying a new car with Alexa built-in — but it seems Amazon’s eyes are on an entirely different set of wheels.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Withings’ latest hybrid smartwatch poses as a luxury dive watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WgRQwejB3N6LQThZYK7Cn3yfCfw=/0x109:3860x2682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69924461/WiThings_Horizon_Retouch_CHOIX_MESURE_BLUE_SPO2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Withings ScanWatch Horizon showing SpO2&amp;nbsp;oxygen saturation.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Withings&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l1ktWe"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.withings.com%2Fnl%2Fen%2Fscanwatch-horizon&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F29%2F22697955%2Fwithings-scanwatch-horizon-sleep-apnea-afib-smartwatch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ScanWatch Horizon&lt;/a&gt; is Withings’ latest hybrid smartwatch to combine a digital display with a traditional mechanical format. You buy a Withings because you hate the look of typical health-focused wearables and abhor the bombardment of notifications that plague other smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ9ugj"&gt;Withings says it took design inspiration for the 43mm ScanWatch Horizon from “luxury dive watches” like the &lt;a href="https://www.rolex.com/watches/submariner.html"&gt;Submariner&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.omegawatches.com/watches/seamaster/diver-300-m/gents-collection/product"&gt;Seamaster&lt;/a&gt; — influences that can be seen in the reflection-free sapphire-glass casing with titanium finish, a stainless-steel rotating bezel, and &lt;a href="https://image-cache.withings.com/site/media/wi_products/scanwatch-horizon-43b-luminova.png?&amp;amp;h=1000"&gt;luminescent watch hands and indicators&lt;/a&gt; for visibility in low light. Its water resistance is only rated at 10 ATM, however, making it ill-suited for deep dives. But it should be fine for swimming, surfing, snorkeling, and other water activities above 100 meters (330 feet). Dive watches from Rolex and Omega are typically waterproof at a depth of up to 300 meters (980 feet).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H3e64K5Qtb34lNwHsy35b35-V2o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884156/WiThings_Horizon_Retouch_AQUA_SILICONE_GREEN_CALORIES_FR.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Withings&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ScanWatch Horizon in green. Though inspired by dive watches, it’s not waterproof enough for diving.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oIIdbk"&gt;As a fitness tracker, the ScanWatch Horizon can automatically recognize and track more than 30 activities, including walking, running, swimming, and cycling. It’s fitted with Bluetooth to use your phone’s GPS to track your routes, with a battery that can last up to 30 days before needing a recharge. Collected data is synced back to the Withings Health Mate (&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id542701020?pt=131936"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.withings.wiscale2"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;) app on your phone, where performance can be monitored or linked to Apple Health, Google Fit, Strava, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nmTVXj4y-VQxD9bFnvXuvKsM-1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22886964/scanwatch_horizon_43b_lifestyle_side.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Withings&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Withings ScanWatch Horizon from the side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3pubN2"&gt;The watch comes slathered in sensors to measure heart rate and blood oxygen to assess your estimated VO2 Max fitness level. It can also prompt a wearer to record a 30-second “medical grade” ECG when it detects signs of an irregular heart rhythm. The ScanWatch Horizon also tracks sleep. And like the original ScanWatch announced last year, the Horizon can detect and warn wearers of possible disorders that might indicate sleep apnea, a condition where breathing stops during sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCZPV8"&gt;Notably, the ECG claims are holding up both the ScanWatch and ScanWatch Horizon from going on sale in the US since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/13/17855006/apple-watch-series-4-ekg-fda-approved-vs-cleared-meaning-safe"&gt;FDA Clearance&lt;/a&gt; is required. Withings initially expected clearance in 2020, but these “unusual times” have created a delay, according to the company. Withings says that it’s in regular contact with the FDA and now expects approval “within weeks.” It already has &lt;a href="https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013982637"&gt;regulatory approval in Europe, Australia, and the UK&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVD3Rm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibF7ki"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tc67Zd"&gt;Remember, as we said in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455863/withings-scanwatch-review-health-sleep-features-price"&gt;science-based review of the Withings ScanWatch hybrid&lt;/a&gt;, doctors don’t trust smartwatches alone to detect sleep apnea&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; and neither should you. And while blood oxygen is an important metric to monitor patients with COVID-19, wrist-worn sensors like this lack the accuracy of pulse oximeters that take measurements on a finger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7cJcP"&gt;The ScanWatch Horizon is available today in the UK, France, and Germany for €499.95/£499.95. Withings says it should be available in the US sometime in Q4 2021, by which time it expects to have FDA Clearance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 ‘unlock with Apple Watch’ bug fixed in iOS beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The buttons are unchanged on the Apple Watch Series 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v2L1cr9xo_3HsyPQNPHTY9v9Cs8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69924432/vpavic_200929_4216_0111.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cYRrZl"&gt;Apple has reportedly fixed the issue that broke the “unlock with Apple Watch” feature on iPhone 13 models. The feature, which lets Apple Watch users unlock their iPhones without a password when wearing a mask, now works again as of the second iOS 15.1 beta, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/28/ios-15-1-beta-2-fixes-unlock-with-apple-watch-bug-for-iphone-13-users/"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yH0EIC"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22694679/apple-fix-issue-unlock-apple-watch-feature-iphone-13"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; on its support page a few days ago that it was working on this problem. I’ve run into the issue myself on my personal iPhone 13 Pro and can confirm that it’s been pretty annoying after having gotten used to the feature since it was introduced earlier this year. Newer iPhones don’t have fingerprint readers, so the only way to unlock them when your mask interferes with Face ID is by using a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ftf1oh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS 15 is here, but we’re still waiting on a few new features","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PWIhrY"&gt;There’s no word on when iOS 15.1 will be released to the public, but it’ll likely contain more than just this fix.

    <title>Amazon Astro is ‘terrible’ and will ‘throw itself down’ stairs, developers reportedly claim</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZsjNiQvHf2kpkkqJrR1eXOb2pKU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923157/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you see a flight of stairs.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xaEiqf"&gt;Some of the people building Amazon’s Astro home robot are not impressed with it, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ypp8/leaked-documents-amazon-astro-surveillance-robot-tracking"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. One person who worked on the robot, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;was announced today&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly called it a “disaster that’s not ready for release,” while another said it was “terrible,” and the idea that it’d be a useful accessibility device (part of Amazon’s pitch is that Astro can help with elder care) was “absurdist nonsense.” The sources also mentioned that the bot doesn’t handle stairs well, with one even saying that it would “throw itself down” them “if presented the opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0wMrR"&gt;To make matters worse, &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the robot is fragile and that several devices had broken. That’s not great news for a $1,000 (or $1,449) robot that lives on the floor, where it’s prone to being stepped on by children, kicked by inattentive adults, or attacked by pets displeased with its presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2dtkw"&gt;After the publication of this article, Amazon sent a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and suggested the documents cited in the story were outdated and that the characterizations don’t reflect how well Astro works today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7Mz2z9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Astro is always watching&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sJBBVd"&gt;Leaked documents and videos of developer meetings obtained by &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; also show that Astro is doing a lot of surveillance with its facial recognition systems, and the feature where it follows people around if it doesn’t recognize them. &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;’s sources say that it’s not great at actually figuring out who people are, which could lead to Astro annoyingly nipping at the heels of people it should know. One of the people who worked on it called its data collection “a privacy nightmare.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGxqWN"&gt;Here is Amazon’s statement in response to this story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9Oqq9N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;These characterizations of Astro’s performance, mast, and safety systems are simply inaccurate. Astro went through rigorous testing on both quality and safety, including tens of thousands of hours of testing with beta participants. This includes comprehensive testing on Astro’s advanced safety system, which is designed to avoid objects, detect stairs, and stop the device where and when necessary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="aXU5Uq"&gt; It’s not necessarily surprising that Astro is always watching, though — it comes with a Ring Protect Pro subscription, and Amazon’s own marketing for the robot shows off that it can be used as a security device (but in the context of wild animals entering your home rather than people). The most surprising thing is that we’re seeing leaked documents, videos, and hearing from grudging developers on the&lt;em&gt; same day &lt;/em&gt;the device was announced. Someone, or multiple someones, inside Amazon must not be swayed by the robot’s charms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gib41L"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sj1t3msy8dc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yizb2o"&gt;The leak also somewhat recontextualizes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698401/amazon-astro-invite-preorder-how-to-info-early-access-price"&gt;Amazon’s invite-based rollout&lt;/a&gt;. You currently can’t just buy the robot, you have to request an invite, a process which requires filling out a survey to indicate whether your house would be a good fit for Astro (which includes a question about what style stairs you have). It’s possible Amazon is trying to put these bots into the best case scenario, to see if they can even survive that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dWF3A"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 10:10PM ET, Sept 28th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with statement from Amazon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Was Elizabeth Holmes like Steve Jobs? Her emails say no</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BDmWnAddAH3ty131inBf-can1eU=/0x0:3909x2606/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923754/1341968233.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jane Tyska/Digital First Media/The Mercury News via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A Steve Jobs biography makes an appearance in court — but it doesn’t explain Theranos’ problems&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="0kcX9n"&gt;Lance Wade didn’t say “snitches get stitches” out loud, but with his behavior in the courtroom today he didn’t have to. It’s the most aggressive performance we’ve seen so far from Elizabeth Holmes’ defense attorney, and that’s probably because the latest testimony is &lt;em&gt;just that bad&lt;/em&gt; for Holmes’ case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCnvlC"&gt;On the stand today was former Theranos lab director Adam Rosendorff, who was responsible for the lab where patient results were processed. In his opening statement, Wade was clear that he was prepared to blame Theranos lab directors — including Rosendorff — for many of the company’s problems. His questioning of Rosendorff drew two successful objections from the government, for argumentativeness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="T9TxGi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Had Rosendorff been coached by the government on his answers?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HW6lX1"&gt;Until now, the defense used a softer approach. Faced with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676789/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-wire-fraud-erika-cheung-whistleblower"&gt;whistleblower Erika Cheung&lt;/a&gt;, Holmes’ lawyers didn’t try to demolish her credibility. Wade was solicitous, even kind — and used her to introduce some documents and testimony that would bolster his client’s case. With Surekha Gangakhedkar, who worked in R&amp;amp;D and helped develop many of the company’s tests, Wade &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22687026/theranos-patient-bad-test-miscarriage-pregnancy"&gt;introduced evidence suggesting that Holmes was a thoughtful boss&lt;/a&gt;, one who even tried to talk Gangakhedkar out of quitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkrO2E"&gt;But today, Wade appeared trapped from the beginning of his cross-examination. Rosendorff’s testimony earlier in the day had brought into evidence emails that looked awful for Holmes, who is on trial for wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. They showed Rosendorff getting increasingly frustrated with the tests, management, and Holmes’ brother, Christian, who’d been inserted between Rosendorff and complaining doctors. Perhaps that’s why Wade began by aggressively attacking Rosendorff’s credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0zyyS"&gt;Wade listed a number of federal agents — with the FBI, the Postal Service, and the FDA — that Rosendorff had been in a room with, and seemed consternated that Rosendorff didn’t remember all their names. (In some cases, Rosendorff testified, those agents hadn’t even spoken to him.) Had Rosendorff been coached by the government on his answers? Wade demanded, nearly shouting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HpmVsH"&gt;Wade did manage to score some points, like when he got Rosendorff to say that Holmes never told him to report an inaccurate result. He showed that Rosendorff had previously answered a question about why he’d left Theranos slightly differently while under oath two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeRJa1"&gt;Wade also got Rosendorff to say that the patient launch we’d heard about last week — the one Rosendorff wanted to delay — was for friends and family only. I’m not sure that soft launch testimony helped Wade, though. After all, wouldn’t friends and family be &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;understanding if the company needed extra time to get things right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1O35dF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wade held up Walter Isaacson’s biography of Jobs as he asked questions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XzyOqP"&gt;The tone shifted after we returned from a brief break. (Lawyers often read reporters’ live-tweets of their trials, as well as our stories. Hi, Lance!)  Wade began to portray Holmes as a Steve Jobs-like marketing genius. Noticeably quieter and friendlier to Rosendorff, he got the former lab director to say part of the reason he’d joined Theranos was because he thought it would be the next Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpj4nx"&gt;Wade held up Walter Isaacson’s biography of Jobs, which Rosendorff said he’d read, as he asked questions. Part of Apple’s success was its intense focus on marketing, right? (Chiat Day, which later worked with Theranos, came up with Apple’s “Think different.”) And Apple was crazy-focused on secrecy, right? Judge Edward Davila interrupted this line of questioning to say “this isn’t the time for a book report,” but by that point Wade had hit the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfMipR"&gt;There was, however, a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; problem for the Steve Jobs metaphor: Elizabeth Holmes’ brother, Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="RxxB87"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You handled this excellently,” Holmes wrote to her brother&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rRvc0R"&gt;In one email chain, Christian — who had no medical or scientific background — appeared to be usurping Rosendorff’s role as lab director when a customer service rep asked &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt;, not Rosendorff, whether to approve a second draw for a failed test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ocUyy"&gt;In another email chain, a doctor wrote that a cholesterol test didn’t add up. Rosendorff wrote to Christian that something was wrong with the test. In response, Christian gave Rosendorff a paragraph of explanation to give to the doctor. Rosendorff rejected it, saying he wouldn’t defend the test. In response, Christian chastised him — and received an “attaboy!” email from his sister. “You handled this excellently,” Holmes wrote to her brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VByMxW"&gt;Thanks to this meddling, Rosendorff seemed like he was at the end of his rope: “100% honesty and transparency to the patient is essential,” he wrote to Christian. “My first duty is not to Theranos but to the patient as per my Hippocratic oath ‘premium non nocere.’” Christian forwarded this to Holmes and Sunny Balwani, Holmes’ co-defendant who is being tried separately. Rosendorff ended up sparing the patient from another Theranos fingerprick and using an FDA-approved venous draw test instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7jWut"&gt;In another set of emails, Rosendorff said he felt out of the loop on what the company was doing. He asked to be taken off the lab’s license. “I am feeling pressured to vouch for results I cannot be confident in,” he wrote to Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yweg6V"&gt;In response, she wrote, “How sad and disappointing to see this from you.” She said he hadn’t raised his concerns before — not true, as we’ve seen emails of him doing it and cc’ing her in. Rosendorff also testified Friday to meeting with Holmes about his concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="i89RKM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Are you both comfortable with this?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="llF1dU"&gt;It wasn’t just a few bad tests that needed to be kept quiet. Theranos appeared secretive to the point of fooling public health officials — with Holmes’ blessing. When auditors from the California Department of Public Health were scheduled to visit the lab, Holmes emailed Rosendorff and Balwani, among others, to find out where they’d be walking. The day of the inspection, no one was to go into or out of Normandy, the lab where the Edison machines were kept, Rosendorff testified. To his knowledge, the auditors didn’t see an Edison device that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6k0U4"&gt;Legally, labs are required to do proficiency testing, which is meant to ensure accurate results. Rosendorff “felt management was paying lip service to this issue,” he said. He testified that he received no resources or support for his proficiency testing plans. Nothing changed by the time he left, either. Rosendorff forwarded an email about this to his Gmail account, in case he might need it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlhfp0"&gt;Eventually, he found another job and gave notice, staying on for a while so they could find another lab director. During that time, in November 2014, there was another bad test result. Rosendorff was blunt, telling Holmes and Balwani that the test’s accuracy was in question. “Are you both comfortable with this?” he wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYWaD0"&gt;In response, Balwani essentially dismissed Rosendorff’s concerns. Rosendorff forwarded that response to Holmes, writing, “I find Sunny’s response offensive and disingenuous. He should apologize.” Holmes then forwarded that email to Balwani, saying that they should “cut him Monday,” which Rosendorff interpreted to mean that they should fire him rather than let him serve out his last few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KePKq5"&gt;Sure, Rosendorff talked to the feds and knew roughly what questions he’d be asked. Yes, the launch Rosendorff had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt;testified to on Friday&lt;/a&gt; was a “soft launch.” But that doesn’t speak to email after email of patient complaints, or to Rosendorff’s increasingly blunt efforts to address bad tests. It certainly doesn’t explain Christian Holmes’ involvement, or why his sister was praising him for slapping down Rosendorff, her lab director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="40my6Z"&gt;Rosendorff’s cross-examination will continue tomorrow. But so far, not much has been produced to undermine him — and the emails that have been introduced bolster him. They also raise a lot of questions about Elizabeth Holmes’ credibility, and that’s going to be hard to explain away.&lt;/p&gt;
