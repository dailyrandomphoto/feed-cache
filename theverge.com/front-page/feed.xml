    <title>Uber’s new minimum wage policy in the UK doesn’t meet the law, say case claimants</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Uber logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/77ezcyZork854gIO0WFEFjvpuwo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980295/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wtD6zB"&gt;Yaseen Aslam and James Farrar, the two lead claimants in the successful tribunal that fought Uber for employee rights in the UK, say the company is continuing to flout the law. After it lost a final appeal with the UK’s Supreme Court &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/21330906/uber-uk-supreme-court-employee-rights"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;, Uber announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334771/uber-uk-drivers-workers-benefits-employees-decision"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; it would give its 70,000 drivers minimum wage, holiday pay, and pensions. But Aslam and Farrar say the details of Uber’s new policy mean it’s still short-changing workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uglw5K"&gt;The issue is that Uber has only &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001543151/000155278121000124/e21143_ex99-1.htm"&gt;committed&lt;/a&gt; to paying drivers at least minimum wage for the time “after accepting a trip request.” This, says Aslam and Farrar, contradicts the Supreme Court ruling, which found that working time for Uber drivers included any period when individuals were logged in to the company’s app and waiting in the right area for fares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kq1Y16"&gt;&lt;q&gt;UK Uber drivers will only be paid minimum wage after accepting fares&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ygZLUI"&gt;As the justice of the Supreme Court, Lord Leggatt, stated in a &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/watch/uksc-2019-0029/judgment.html"&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; of the ruling: “The judgement also upholds the finding of the employment tribunal that for the purposes of the legislation, the claimants’ working time was not limited, as Uber had argued, to periods when they were actually driving passengers to their destinations. It also included any period when the driver was logged into the Uber app in the relevant territory and was ready and willing to accept trips.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cgkqD"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Aslam said the language in the Supreme Court ruling was clear, and Uber’s response showed it would continue to try to bend the law to its advantage. “It’s just a cheap PR trick,” he said of the decision. “If I’m working 10 hours, but only have passengers on board for three hours, I’m only getting paid for those three hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8el0R"&gt;Farrar added: “The Supreme Court was asked to decide two things: if we are workers and when we are workers. These were the decisions it had to make and Uber is in clear violation of them. We can’t accept it and we won’t accept it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQdB3t"&gt;Uber did not respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yaseen Aslam (left) and James Farrar (right) were part of a small group of Uber drivers who brought a case against the company in 2015. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iAJEjz"&gt;It’s not clear how much time Uber drivers spend on average waiting for fares, and thus how much potential income has been lost through the company’s new policy. Farrar and Aslam say that drivers will lose out on 40 to 50 percent of a possible wage increase. A &lt;a href="https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/the-uber-lyft-ballot-initiative-guarantees-only-5-64-an-hour-2/"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; by the University of California, Berkeley, found that US Uber and Lyft drivers spent roughly a third of their working day logged in to the app and waiting for fares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKlyO3"&gt;Aslam said Uber’s new policy is crafted to ensure it won’t lose a key advantage versus traditional taxi firms: creating an abundance of drivers who respond quickly to customers without paying for their downtime. “It costs Uber next to nothing to operate in cities,” says Aslam. “All the liabilities — the running costs and expenses of maintaining a vehicle — are shifted over to the driver. So the more drivers they have on the platform, the better it is for them: it doesn’t cost them anything but creates more availability for customers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYs4YH"&gt;If Uber had to pay drivers for time spent waiting for requests from passengers, it would lose this advantage. It’s for reasons such as this that &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ubers-is-based-on-regulatory-arbitrage-2017-9?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;critics of the company&lt;/a&gt; say it doesn’t offer any significant technological innovations at all. It simply extracts extra value from workers by exploiting loopholes in countries’ legal systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EeFjHn"&gt;What’s not clear is what happens next from a legal perspective. Aslam says it’s up to the UK government to enforce the Supreme Court ruling, but he also says London’s transport regulator, Transport for London (TfL), should take responsibility. “TfL has the power to protect workers but they don’t want to get involved,” he says. Farrar added: “It should have been government enforcing this all the way back to the original case, rather than expecting precarious workers to bring complicated litigation all the way to the Supreme Court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TOr745"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s regrettable that Uber hasn’t done the right thing entirely.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1KaTbB"&gt;Paul Jennings, a partner at the London law firm Bates Wells, who represented Aslam and Farrar in their original employment tribunal, said that the discrepancy between Uber’s new policies and the Supreme Court ruling was clear and that the government should act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDY3Mm"&gt;“The idea that drivers are only working when they have a passenger in the car is not consistent with the judgement,” Jennings told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s regrettable that Uber hasn’t done the right thing entirely.” He added compliance could be enforced without additional litigation, but that the latter might be necessary to “reinforce the judgement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iW0qh"&gt;Overall, Aslam and Farrar say they are pleased that Uber has been forced to change its policies but are disappointed their fight is not yet over. “We suffered financially and mentally. But we’re not delighted. What we’re getting is a bone chucked at us,” says Aslam. “It’s never going to stop, we know that. This is Uber.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omZgCE"&gt;Farrar added that despite the time and resources they’d committed already, the pair was happy to keep on fighting: “Me and Yaseen, we latch on and we don’t let go.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung says it might skip the Galaxy Note this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Note 20" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXUBlu67qThdoqzNvjiUniBOhqs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68979722/dbohn_201004_4226_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A1PW2J"&gt;Samsung has warned that it might not be able to ship a Galaxy Note phone in 2021 after all, citing difficulties in launching two flagship phones in one year, in comments at its annual shareholders meeting &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/samsung-warns-of-serious-imbalance-in-the-chips-industry"&gt;reported on by Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3IGzu"&gt;“[The] Note series is positioned as a high-end model in our business portfolio,” said mobile chief DJ Koh. “It could be a burden to unveil two flagship models in a year so it might be difficult to release [a] Note model in 2H. The timing of [the] Note model launch can be changed but we seek to release a Note model next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HcbvgQ"&gt;The comments came as Samsung sounded the alarm about a global semiconductor shortage, saying that its business will likely be affected next quarter. The potential delay or cancellation of a 2021 Galaxy Note is apparently separate, however; Koh says it’s more about streamlining the lineup, according to Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0euKFz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Note 20 review: stylus tax","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21506471/samsung-galaxy-note-20-review-price-stylus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="C0ofMo"&gt;The release of a Galaxy Note this year was already far from a sure thing. Samsung had indicated plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;bring its key stylus feature to more phones&lt;/a&gt; in the Galaxy lineup, sparking speculation that the line may come to an end. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22177972/galaxy-note-21-still-happening-yonhap"&gt;A Yonhap report&lt;/a&gt;, however, said that Samsung was still preparing to release a new Note phone in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3kweW2"&gt;Samsung declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on the existence of this device at the time, reiterating its plans to “bring some of the most beloved features of the Galaxy Note to more device categories in 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 is getting DVR support in Japan this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y0B4mZvfzrZuGjcFjI3AN9d2Qec=/0x0:2163x1442/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68978911/nasne.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HdP8Qn"&gt;Sony has announced that the PlayStation 5 will get DVR functionality in Japan by way of a new app that’ll work with its Nasne tuners. The app will be called Torne (pronounced &lt;em&gt;to-ru-ne&lt;/em&gt;) and should be available later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsEWLF"&gt;Torne was originally a TV tuner add-on for the PS3 that was released in 2010 and allowed you to save broadcast shows to your console’s hard drive and transfer them to a PSP or PS Vita. It was followed by Nasne, which added its own storage and worked more like a NAS drive, with the recordings available through a mobile app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoRqKR"&gt;Sony stopped selling Nasne in 2019, but last year Japanese peripheral manufacturer Buffalo announced that it’d take over the product and release Buffalo-branded versions, with the first models set to ship this spring. The new Nasne still looks like a PS3, just with a Buffalo logo on it; Buffalo is doubling the internal storage to 2TB, however, and tripling external storage capability to 6TB. It’ll go on sale later this month for 29,800 yen (~$270).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just gave Russia a spot on the iPhone to advertise its favorite apps to its citizens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pM2WG3NS0H7dkbe0LJ91Bm-c8cQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68978734/acastro_180130_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NkHvcU"&gt;Starting April 1st, users setting up a new iPhone in Russia will see a screen that allows them to automatically install apps that are officially sanctioned by the Russian government, in compliance with Russian law (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-ipad-mac-russia-apps-preinstall-144255015.html"&gt;via Engadget&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptFlOo"&gt;The law in question &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20977459/russian-law-pre-installed-domestic-software-tvs-smartphones-laptops"&gt;was passed back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and requires smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, and smart TVs sold in Russia to come pre-installed with specific apps made by Russian companies by April 1st, &lt;a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2021/03/15/861564-iphone-soft"&gt;according to Russian news site &lt;em&gt;Vedomosti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (The law was originally set to go into effect in July 2020, but was pushed back to April 2021). &lt;em&gt;Vedomosti&lt;/em&gt; also says that apps won’t be installed if users don’t want them. Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it will comply with the law by giving the users the option to install the apps when activating the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRBCqS"&gt;Which apps are specifically going to be offered to users remains unclear, though &lt;em&gt;Vedomosti&lt;/em&gt; cites a government services app, and apps from Russian companies including Yandex, Mail.ru, and Kaspersky Lab. The government seems to be aware that it might be problematic to favor specific apps, and is planning to expand its list over time: “The Ministry is not at all interested in seeing popular apps included in the mandatory pre-installation list take dominant positions. If alternatives emerge on the market, prove interesting to users and gain popularity quickly, they will be included in this selection and also offered for pre-installation,” a Russian official told &lt;em&gt;Vedomosti.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2DEOsL"&gt;Apple has historically kept tight control over the iPhone’s setup process, and that appears to now be changing, if only in one market. While Apple has previously made changes to stay on the side of local laws — it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20985762/apple-maps-weather-apps-crimea-russia-territory"&gt;changed maps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/31/17803638/apple-watch-pride-face-russia-block"&gt;blocked pride watch faces&lt;/a&gt; in Russia, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17587304/apple-icloud-china-user-data-state-run-telecom-privacy-security"&gt;now stores iCloud data on state-run servers in China&lt;/a&gt; — this may be one of the more dramatic changes, as it affects a screen that every user will see when they set up their iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOLofx"&gt;Apple has slowly been allowing users to change how iOS works out of the box, with the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21301478/apple-ios-14-default-apps-browser-email-changes-features-report"&gt;change some default apps in iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;, but now it’s given a small amount of control over the setup process to the Russian government, too. As the company faces &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;legal challenges from the EU&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/6/17/21292983/apple-spotify-antitrust-hey-email-congress-house-judiciary-tim-cook"&gt;US over antitrust&lt;/a&gt;, and over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263453/spotify-apple-app-store-antitrust-complaint-ec-30-percent-cut-unfair"&gt;giving its competitors a level playing field&lt;/a&gt;, we may see Apple having to give over some more control to governments if it wants to sell its phones to their citizens — though it probably won’t be compelled to ask users if they want to install Spotify at setup. Probably.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cricut promises unlimited lifetime uploads for existing crafting machines after user backlash</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ucVZNCoR9AXuDUHalhOpFmucaYk=/73x0:1113x693/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68978716/Screen_Shot_2021_03_16_at_3.22.55_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Cricut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z12izD"&gt;Cricut is changing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332212/cricut-crafting-machine-design-space-upload-limit"&gt;recently announced plan to require a subscription&lt;/a&gt; to get the full use of its crafting machines for precisely cutting paper and other materials. Following backlash from crafters and fans who rely on its machines, &lt;a href="https://inspiration.cricut.com/a-letter-to-the-cricut-community-from-ashish-arora-cricut-ceo/?fbclid=IwAR2nc73QTwCyEhdw0ihhsPdDrAMIlGlq0gMJk2SvuOeVefA6IFvQXts7a6M"&gt;Cricut CEO Ashish Arora apologized for the decision&lt;/a&gt;, and announced that the company will postpone the requirement for a subscription and give unlimited uploads to all users with a registered Cricut device purchased before December 31st, 2021 — for the lifetime of their machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwzw2c"&gt;Without an upload limit, crafters will be able to use Cricut and its required Design Space app as usual. They can create designs in the app or third-party software like Procreate, and then format it to be cut out of materials like paper, fabric, vinyl, and even wood using a Cricut machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OebFvD"&gt;Prior to this change, Cricut was planning on requiring a $9.99 per month / $95.88 per year Cricut Access Standard plan or a Premium plan for $118.88 per year to keep unlimited uploads. Owners who didn’t pay would be limited to 20 uploads per month, which many creators, who often favor starting Cricut projects in other apps and uploading them into Design Space, were worried would make the device unusable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sO9Exy"&gt;Arora says that people who buy a resold Cricut machine can also get unlimited lifetime uploads, provided the new owner creates a Cricut account and connects their machine before the end of 2021. Arora says the company is also considering options for educational or maker space settings that might burn through 20 uploads quickly, but had no specifics to share other than a general promise that nothing will change before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBOZYU"&gt;While in an ideal world a machine that can cost up to $399 wouldn’t ever need a subscription, Cricut has at least listened to the concerns of its current customers and offered them what seems like a pretty good compromise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJLwcJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PP5LUV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber drivers in the UK will now get minimum wage and paid vacation after a big court win</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1uiknL"&gt;Uber &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001543151/000155278121000124/e21143_ex99-1.htm"&gt;will classify&lt;/a&gt; around 70,000 drivers in the UK as workers and give them some benefits after losing an appeal at the Supreme Court level in February, following a years-long legal battle over their employment status. Drivers will still not be considered full-time employees, but will accrue holiday time and receive a minimum wage while driving fares, and will be enrolled in a pension plan starting on March 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPziZH"&gt;Although the U-turn by Uber is seen as a big win for drivers, there are some notable caveats. Most importantly, drivers will only earn a minimum wage &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; accepting trip requests, and will not be paid an hourly rate. This &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335554/ubers-uk-minimum-wage-decision-employee-rights-flouting-law"&gt;potentially goes against&lt;/a&gt; the February &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/press-summary/uksc-2019-0029.html"&gt;Supreme Court ruling&lt;/a&gt;, which, in a press summary, states that “time spent ... working for Uber was not limited (as Uber argued) to periods when they were actually driving passengers to their destinations, but included any period when the driver was logged into the Uber app.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eY8fvm"&gt;The UK ruling in February came just a few months after voters in California approved Prop 22, a ballot measure that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;reversed a previous decision to classify drivers as employees&lt;/a&gt;. And despite repeated claims that classifying drivers as employees would make things more expensive for customers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291580/prop-22-instacart-doordash-uber-lyft-postmates-grubhub-price-hike"&gt;all the major gig economy companies have since raised prices anyway&lt;/a&gt;. Uber, which helped bankroll the effort to pass Prop 22, is now looking &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx8y9x/uber-wants-to-export-prop-22-to-europe"&gt;at making similar moves in the European Union&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E64Tpm"&gt;The case Uber lost in February began all the way back in 2016 when two drivers argued that Uber had too much control over their actions to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be considered their employer. Uber lost but continued to appeal all the way up to the UK Supreme Court, which affirmed the lower-court decisions in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaXctd"&gt;Uber and companies like it have long argued that classifying drivers too rigidly would make it harder for them to work when they wanted, and that flexibility was just as, if not more, important than benefits and other protections afforded by more official employment status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mEFKZ"&gt;In an op-ed published Tuesday in the &lt;a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/uber-chief-executive-dara-khosrowhahi-drivers-rights-turning-page-b924529.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evening Standard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said it is “increasingly clear to us that flexibility alone is insufficient, and that it should not come at the expense of social protections.” But he added that he believes “outdated employment laws essentially force that trade-off.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bag0Tu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Wednesday March 17th, 05:22AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Story updated with additional detail about how minimum wage will be paid to UK drivers, not as an hourly rate but only after drivers have accepted fares. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei has a plan to get a bigger cut of 5G, even with its phone sales limited</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cglpkfAQTGNKIcIEEPlMzMCaB7I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68977880/acastro_190520_1777_huawei_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o1pAUQ"&gt;Huawei has a plan to compete in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;5G&lt;/a&gt; without being able to sell its 5G phones everywhere. Today, the technology company announced that &lt;a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/news/2021/3/huawei-releases-whitepaper-innovation-intellectual-property-2020"&gt;it intends to seek royalties&lt;/a&gt; from companies like Apple and Samsung in exchange for the use of its patents, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/huawei-to-start-demanding-5g-royalties-from-smartphone-giants"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Huawei believes it can strike licensing deals despite sanctions in the US, and it plans to use its earnings to invest even further into research and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVoDTZ"&gt;Huawei obtained patents on new technology during the development of the larger 5G standard — alongside companies like Qualcomm and Ericsson — that are needed for interoperability between different 5G networks, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/huawei-to-charge-royalties-to-smartphone-makers-using-its-5g-tech-.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. “Huawei has been the largest technical contributor to 5G standards,” Huawei’s head of intellectual property rights, Jason Ding, said in a statement.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The company intends to charge up to $2.50 per phone that uses its 5G patents. Huawei believes its patent business shouldn’t be impacted by ongoing sanctions, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3TXKw"&gt;The company’s patent earnings are already large. Ding estimates Huawei will earn between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion from patent licensing between 2019 and 2021. Huawei also plans to charge less than other manufacturers like Nokia and Ericsson for access to its 5G standard essential patents (SEPs), according to CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZH7mJ"&gt;Huawei is still banned from doing business in the US by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;Department of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133631/huawei-china-spying-claims-us-officials-blacklist-5g"&gt;concerns of spying&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s networking technology is also still required to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21422939/huawei-zte-us-phone-networks-fcc-congress-reimbursement-cost"&gt;removed and replaced&lt;/a&gt; in the US and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21322880/uk-bans-huawei-5g-network-infrastructure-trump-administration-pressure"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. Aggressively pursuing patent royalties seems like a way to profit off the 5G business Huawei was already building. And with no indication that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22273729/huawei-ceo-ren-zhengfei-biden-trump-us-sanctions"&gt;the Biden administration will renegotiate&lt;/a&gt; with the company or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274575/huawei-fcc-lawsuit-national-security-ban-broadband-rollout"&gt;reverse the ban&lt;/a&gt;, it might need it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Maps now shows COVID-19 vaccination locations</title>

  &lt;p id="v3Tryz"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F03%2Fapple-maps-now-displays-covid-19-vaccination-locations%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F16%2F22334609%2Fapple-maps-facebook-google-covid-19-vaccine-locations" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that Apple Maps has been updated with vaccine locations from VaccineFinder, a site run by Boston Children’s Hospital that provides information on vaccine eligibility and availability. People can search for nearby vaccination sites in Apple Maps or ask Siri, “Where can I get a COVID vaccination?” Over 20,000 locations are now listed, with more to be added in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of a phone showing Apple Maps with locations marked as COVID-19 vaccine sites." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uXmYci24ul9wSwpsQjnRm0WnxxU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22375689/apple_maps_vaccinefinder_vaccine_search_results_03162021.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vaccination sites in Apple Maps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ACXEzW"&gt;Each vaccine site listing in Apple Maps includes the operating hours and contact information for the site, with a link to the provider’s website to find vaccine availability and make an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbwVJ4"&gt;With the new feature, Apple joins a number of other tech companies offering more ways for people to check their eligibility, locate vaccination sites, and get vaccine appointments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VBOBY8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0iMqDU"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2021/03/15/covid-vaccine-appointment-facebook-instagram-coronavirus-vaccination/4680803001/"&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that it will be adding VaccineFinder information to its COVID Information Center, showing people when and where they can get vaccinated and providing links to make appointments. The COVID Information Center will also be expanding to Instagram, and the company is working on expanding government and health authority WhatsApp chatbots to help people register for vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xO8sHB"&gt;Google is also offering more ways to find information about vaccination. The company &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/googles-business-messages-helps-the-public-find-covid-19-vaccines"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that people can use Business Messages in Google Maps and Google search to contact local pharmacies owned by Albertsons Companies — including Safeway, Jewel-Osco, Vons, Albertsons, Acme, Shaw’s, and Tom Thumb — with questions about vaccine eligibility, availability, and appointment booking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoqfW9"&gt;The US federal government is set to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22326335/biden-white-house-covid-19-vaccine-federal-website"&gt;launch its own vaccine-finding website&lt;/a&gt; by May 1st and has said that all adults in the US will be eligible for a vaccine at that time.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;So far, about 28 percent of adults in the US have received their first vaccine dose, &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft reiterates ‘VR for console is not a focus for us’ following localization bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5hWvKtjbkKgvU4bbiAuwpbs6H4Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68977570/acastro_180604_1777_xbox_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s6ER77"&gt;Microsoft has once again reiterated that VR support for Xbox was not a focus for the company, following reports earlier today that hinted it was working on a VR headset compatible with the Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VbMYr"&gt;The rumor first surfaced after &lt;a href="https://it.ign.com/xbox-series-x/179732/news/microsoft-al-lavoro-su-un-headset-vr-per-xbox-gli-indizi-arrivano-dalle-nuove-cuffie-wireless"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN Italy&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that some Italian Xbox users received messages, which translated to “[a]n update for the VR headset is available” and “[u]pdate VR headset,” when connecting the recently released Xbox Wireless Headset to their Xbox Series X or Series S consoles. My colleague, Cameron Faulkner, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;reviewed the Xbox Wireless headset&lt;/a&gt; and did not encounter this pop-up message while using the headset on an Xbox Series X console in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AK4lU4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“VR for console is not a focus for us at this time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5n48S"&gt;A Microsoft representative told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “the copy in this error message is inaccurate due to a localization bug,” while again reiterating that “VR for console is not a focus for us at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BO0ywN"&gt;Microsoft has yet to explore the VR space for its Xbox consoles. In 2018, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17485852/microsoft-xbox-one-no-vr-headset-support-windows-mixed-reality-e3-2018"&gt;pulled back&lt;/a&gt; on plans to support virtual reality headsets for Xbox in 2018, explaining that it wanted to focus “primarily on experiences you would play on your TV.” In late 2019, Xbox boss &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/28/20987089/xbox-phil-spencer-microsoft-vr-project-scarlet-half-life-alyx"&gt;Phil Spencer tweeted out&lt;/a&gt; that although he played “some great VR games” such as &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx,&lt;/em&gt; console VR was not Xbox’s focus ahead of the Xbox Series X / S release. &lt;/p&gt;
