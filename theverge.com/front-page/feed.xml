    <title>What works (and doesn’t) in an NFT-backed newsletter</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Dirt logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kxDyEhLiHbe34ycS0G7zbop7YYc=/0x37:1100x770/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70385295/a362f39e_fef1_4405_b57c_15edb00cf790_7230x9000.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-introducing-dirtdao" target="_blank"&gt;Silphwave / Dirt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QPyZc1"&gt;Funding a media outlet is a tricky business, and in recent years, some journalists have looked toward the cryptocurrency world to do it. That includes &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt;, an entertainment newsletter co-founded by Kyle Chayka and Daisy Alioto in late 2020. &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/10/think-of-it-as-a-kickstarter-tote-bag-but-much-much-better-dirt-an-entertainment-newsletter-is-funding-itself-with-nfts-not-subscriptions/"&gt;raised money since launch&lt;/a&gt; by selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-introducing-dirtdao"&gt;it announced&lt;/a&gt; plans to work those NFTs into a decentralized autonomous organization or DAO — giving its audience input into where &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; spends its money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJR3iq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the first blockchain-based media outfit. In 2017, for instance, a project called Civil funded a panoply of websites using its own cryptocurrency token. But &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/02/media-startup-civil-shuts-down-team-absorbed-into-decentralized-id-efforts-at-consensys/"&gt;Civil collapsed&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/how-civil-didnt-37037075"&gt;a difficult launch&lt;/a&gt; and initial funding that quickly ran dry. Meanwhile, lots of cryptocurrency enthusiasts have created DAOs where token owners can vote like shareholders in a business, but many are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution"&gt;chaotic experiments like ConstitutionDAO&lt;/a&gt;, an attempt to buy a copy of the US Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1N5CM"&gt;Kyle Chayka readily describes DirtDAO as an experiment, but it’s got a comparatively modest goal: letting a small community vote on pitches for future &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; longform stories. On January 14th, it will conduct its first vote with people who previously bought one of its NFTs, which are minted on the Ethereum blockchain. (Ethereum is a common choice for NFT creators, but it’s currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;more environmentally damaging&lt;/a&gt; than some alternatives.) In advance of the sale, I spoke with Chayka about the promise — and the limits — of using DAOs for journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tTIcY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interview has been condensed and edited for clarity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4T7Sf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The announcement describes DirtDAO letting token holders vote on stories and shape the editorial process. I’m curious what the extent of that is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4P7Tw"&gt;How we’re dealing with the token voting is that Daisy [Alioto] is working with writers who we’ve already worked with, who we’ve already published in &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; and who we’re familiar with. And then she’s coming up with a slate of stories that we know that we would be happy to run. I’m not sure how many we’re doing right now, but maybe like five or six options. And then the token holders will be able to vote doing ranked choice on those options. So in the end, they’re all stories that we would be happy to run and writers we would be happy to work with. The input is, what do the token holders wants to prioritize? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrOx0v"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the obvious question for me is, why not run a crowdfunded, non-crypto system that lets backers vote on coverage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fH5E4"&gt;To me, the biggest benefit of blockchain stuff here is the record-keeping. So essentially, by creating a token, we have a really easy way of looking at who has supported us, like who has participated in funding &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt;, essentially. And then that record also means that the token holders can express their interest by voting really easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yra7GH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you theoretically don’t know who owns the tokens, how do you prevent some company from buying up all your tokens and using that to influence your editorial process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFq2Ph"&gt;We’re doing this experiment in order to figure out those questions. But at this point, &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; is small enough and the token holders are small enough that we essentially know who everyone is, at least by their wallet, even if they’re anonymous. I think the point is here that it’s small-scale enough that we do want to know who our token holders are at this point, and we do want to make sure that they’re committed and are acting in a moral way. So in that way, it’s not trustless — but I don’t think our experiment here is about reaching a huge scale or claiming that blockchain can do everything or run an entire company. It’s just a way for readers to express what they want for our publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFDcoU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you say you know people, does that mean you know their literal identities or know them as something like consistent user handles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78I5Qz"&gt;I’d say probably 60 or 70 percent of the people who are actually participating, we know them by name and we know their internet presences and stuff. And we have other token holders and NFT collectors who are pseudonymous or we just know their [crypto] wallet. But actually, the pseudonymous people or totally anonymous people don’t tend to participate as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUjVw4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It says in the announcement post that around 100 people have tokens at this point.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOBMV"&gt;Yeah, I think now it’s about 130. I expect a small portion of those to actually vote. I don’t think that every token holder is going to vote by any means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ScfyR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a maximum number of people that you feel like could be involved in voting? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oJijY"&gt;Someone asked us about this the other day, and I think somewhere around a thousand people — I don’t expect more than a thousand people to be actively voting because in our experience, a very, very small number of readers actually want to participate in governance. Like, governance is just not something that a lot of people want to do. They want to consume content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpcFnd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say you have a pitch with sensitive information — like in an extreme example, there’s an assault allegation that you don’t want to make public outside a small editorial process. How would you handle DAO members voting on that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zR6E8Q"&gt;There’s a few reasons that this works for us. And one of the reasons is that the DAO-voted features are not our only features — like, this is not our entire editorial process. This is one part of the editorial process, kind of like a column or recurring feature that’s sponsored by the DAO and the token holders. So we’re certainly allowing ourselves to do pieces that don’t go through this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8STgX"&gt;But also I think this DAO structure and the whole mechanism works for &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; particularly because we’re not doing investigative reporting. We’re doing criticism and commentary and aggregation about entertainment online. I would personally not want a publication driven by crypto that’s trying to do like, sexual assault investigations, as you said, or more consequential political reporting, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78qtMI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things Civil was interested in was having a censorship-proof record of journalism actually on the blockchain. How viable do you think that is?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XYMko"&gt;It’s not something that we’re dealing with or proposing at all. Our publishing is not really blockchain-connected — like, the newsletter itself just runs on Substack like any other Substack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npeeoH"&gt;I think what is interesting to me is less about how the writing is censor-proof than the kind of funding and decision-making that we’re doing will be public. So at this point, you could actually see every transaction that &lt;em&gt;Dirt &lt;/em&gt;has gotten funding from, so you could see the exact amount of money that we’ve made. You can see who holds our tokens, who holds our NFTs. And once the DAO votes start, you’ll be able to see how every vote happens, who voted for what. So those will all be more or less permanent records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjnUGV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you say “who voted for what,” you mean linked with wallets, which don’t necessarily tell you who owns the wallet or who is behind it, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBpczS"&gt;In our case, the majority of the token holders do connect their wallet to their real name, because they also are proud to participate and want to show their support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uq3yxS"&gt;To be very clear, I don’t think this use case works in every situation at all. I think it works because we engage with digital culture. We don’t do super hard-hitting journalism. And the process is about having fun determining the stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGldIi"&gt;I think there could be ways to apply this technology to other editorial processes that would work on investigative features or similar things like that. To me, the permanent record-keeping of blockchain is interesting. I don’t see that being applied in terms of censorship-proof writing that soon, personally. I do think it is interesting to see the governance votes and see the funding mechanisms. So I see it right now, more as a back-end for media production, and less about the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9880Xi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why specifically use Ethereum?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wr3jxJ"&gt;Ethereum is the furthest along in terms of utility for cryptocurrencies. Like, things like Snapshot, which helps you do governance, work on Ethereum-built currencies, and OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, most of the transactions are in Ethereum. &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; actually started on the publishing platform Mirror, which also uses Ethereum-backed stuff. So the short answer is, the tools are there for Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="davzDD"&gt;I am definitely a big fan of less environmentally impactful blockchain technologies, and I think we would love to see Ethereum go to layer two and use less energy. But I also think &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; in the near future will move to a less heavy blockchain like Solana or Tezos. My impression is that the record-keeping is kind of the same — Ethereum versus Solana versus Tezos versus whatever, they’re all public records, they’re all on a chain somewhere. And so I’m not sure that the Ethereum label itself will be as valuable in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jDGtY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re selling these DAO tokens, it’s more or less a one-time payment for each token. If you want to keep getting funding, do you just have to keep selling more tokens?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azR9W0"&gt;One ideal model that I’ve thought of is essentially like if Bored Ape Yacht Club was a media company — right now, they’re making millions of dollars a month on secondary sales royalties [for NFT transfers]. So there is a world in which &lt;em&gt;Dirt &lt;/em&gt;could run solely on secondary market royalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RKfRL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That seems like it might require having a pretty heavy turnover in the user base that’s engaged enough to want to vote on these things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0ZRY0"&gt;I think there’s an interesting comparison — like, the readers of a publication don’t stay the same over time. People are always cycling in and out. So I would expect that there would be some people who are in it for the long haul, definitely plenty of turnover, maybe someone buys some tokens and wants to vote for a few weeks and then gets bored of it and sells them. That would be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EaDV3i"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the big criticisms of NFT systems is that they just rely on constant expansion for funding. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYDsWz"&gt;We don’t want to go the way of constant expansion. I think our ideal situation would be patrons who want to keep participating in the long term and using their tokens and helping us fund ourselves in whatever way we choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saMd3l"&gt;I think the constant expansion is only necessary if you want to operate on a large scale like Bored Ape Yacht Club or something similar. I see a situation in which each editorial initiative could have its own token or own NFT, and then once that funding runs out, you do a different one. So it kind of becomes like special issues, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgXGqY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that would be separate from DAO voting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JK3frY"&gt;Right — it could be. We can experiment with different mechanisms for different projects, and that’s kind of cool. I don’t think anything with &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; is permanent. These are experiments that we’ll do, and then see how they work and then try something slightly different. And just repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter is opening up the ability to record Spaces.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lkx0h5"&gt;Twitter is now letting all Android and iOS users record Twitter Spaces, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1481710633267703808"&gt;the company announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Users will be able to choose to record a Space when they’re setting one up and the recording will be available for public playback for 30 days &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1481711244105158660"&gt;after the Space has ended&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re in a Space that’s being recorded, you’ll see an icon at the top of the Space letting you know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tizOf"&gt;You can see how it all works in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1481711244105158660"&gt;this tweet from Twitter’s support account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FtkcKB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Another update on Spaces Recording:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The option for hosts to record is now available for everyone on Android and iOS! When starting a Space, tap the “Record Space” switch to have it available for public playback for 30 days once the Space has ended. &lt;a href="https://t.co/fYzaOjQJlF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fYzaOjQJlF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1481711244105158660?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vii1Qf"&gt;Twitter first introduced recording to a limited number of hosts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750341/twitter-spaces-recording-feature-sharing-option"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;, promising the feature would be available to all hosts “within a few weeks.” The company has been steadily adding features to Spaces since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187490/twitter-spaces-test-voice-chat-rooms"&gt;they first launched&lt;/a&gt; and recently opened up the ability for everyone on Android and iOS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739249/twitter-finally-letting-everyone-create-spaces"&gt;to be able to host a Space&lt;/a&gt;. (Previously, only users with 600 followers or more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;could host one&lt;/a&gt;.) You still can’t host a Space from the web, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455799/twitter-spaces-web-browser-clubhouse-social-audio-room"&gt;but you can join them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activity data from wearables could help monitor blood sugar levels, study indicates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fitbit-Charge-2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QJkM5HBA0jDPJ5QT336DN4Gzq2Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70385193/verge-2016-09-21_14-23-23.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zzy62B"&gt;Activity data from a Fitbit can predict changes in blood sugar control for adults with prediabetes, a condition that affects around one in three adults in the United States, a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00541-1.pdf"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; shows. The findings point to a strategy that tech companies might use in their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;rumored&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/27/22850147/movano-ring-smart-ring-chronic-illnesses-ces-2022"&gt;efforts&lt;/a&gt; to build diabetes technology into wearable products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDBiTb"&gt;“It kind of makes sense intuitively — more movement, more physical activity leads to overall better health, and better health is one of the factors behind improved glycemic control,” says Jessilyn Dunn, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Duke University who wasn’t involved with this study but has also done work on wearables and glucose monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zwPRPP"&gt;People with prediabetes have elevated blood sugar levels, placing them at risk of developing diabetes. But most tools that predict whether someone with prediabetes will progress to develop diabetes look years in the future, says study author Mitesh Patel, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and vice president for Clinical Transformation at hospital group Ascension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xo1xPP"&gt;“There were no good near-term models to say, in the next six months, whose blood sugar is going to increase and get worse versus whose is going to get better,” Patel says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hY8NHK"&gt;In the new study, published in &lt;em&gt;NPJ Digital Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, Patel’s team built models that would use activity data collected from either wrist- or waist-worn Fitbits to predict both changes in average blood sugar and 5 percent improved or worsened blood sugar levels. Over the course of the six-month study, they found that they were able to make accurate predictions, and that predictions were more accurate using data collected from the wrist-worn devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdV7K2"&gt;“We know that people who are generally more active have better control of their blood sugar, and people who are less active have worse control,” Patel says. “But there are other hidden patterns in the daily information we’re getting — how many steps are fast steps versus slow steps, and other nuances — that we can get from this information.” Because the wearable can capture that additional data, it can give a more granular look at how activity drives changes in blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olYMZS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34079049/"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt; have also found that data from wearable devices can help track and predict blood glucose levels. But that despite those relationships, activity and other wearable data is still only a proxy for blood sugar levels, Dunn says. It’s still important to directly monitor blood sugar through blood testing methods until there’s more evidence to show that the links are strong enough to make treatment decisions. This new study was in under 200 people, for example, and only looked at people with prediabetes — more work would be needed to test the relationship in more people and at varying levels of health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9wFCM"&gt;Tech companies are looking toward diabetes and blood sugar management as the next set of tools to incorporate into consumer-facing products like smartwatches and smart rings. Apple has been looking into noninvasive glucose monitoring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;, Fitbit has a &lt;a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/fitbit-moves-deeper-into-healthcare-lifescan-deal-to-combine-diabetes-devices-consumer"&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; with diabetes tech company LifeScan, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/27/22850147/movano-ring-smart-ring-chronic-illnesses-ces-2022"&gt;new smart ring&lt;/a&gt; is looking to blood sugar monitoring as a future goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxR4op"&gt;These companies want to find ways to measure blood sugar without breaking the skin — their attempts have focused on &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/diabetes-glucose-monitor-5208728"&gt;sweat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mendosa.com/The%20Pursuit%20of%20Noninvsive%20Glucose,%20Fourth%20Edition.pdf"&gt;tears, breath, and the reflection of light&lt;/a&gt; off the skin. Those strategies could offer more direct measures of glucose than activity data, but most haven’t come to fruition yet, Dunn says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYuQp9"&gt;Dunn says she could imagine that, in the short term, tech companies might build in features that use activity data to give people some type of information about their blood sugar. Then, if the other, noninvasive strategies that more directly measure glucose levels prove to work well, those might be the next-gen tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiaoJ5"&gt;“And so, then the question becomes, what is the next technology?” Dunn says. “And I think that remains to be seen — but we can be sure there will be something.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From bugs to halted releases, Android 12 has seen an unusually troubled launch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There are some unique complicating factors this year, but it’s the same old Android — the good and the bad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="hLnFwe"&gt;Android 12 is one of the platform’s most ambitious updates in recent history, bringing a major design overhaul to every corner of the operating system. It has also been one of the rockiest Android OS launches in the past few years. Both Samsung and OnePlus paused the rollout of their stable Android 12-based updates amid reports of serious bugs. Google itself has addressed a laundry list of bug reports from Pixel 6 owners, just as it’s trying to convince them it’s finally figured out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"&gt;how to build a truly premium phone&lt;/a&gt;. What in the heck is going on? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTkjK4"&gt;The short answer is that there are some unique complicating factors at play this year but also that Android is inherently a little bit messy — that just comes with the territory when you’re designing a delightful public park compared to Apple’s walled garden.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Despite a refreshed look and some appealing new high-end handsets, Android is still Android — the good and the bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NFObXS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Android 12 review: it’s mostly about the looks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"},{"title":"Sundar Pichai and Rick Osterloh think the Pixel 6 is Google’s breakout phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zGyqPg"&gt;Android 12’s release started predictably enough with a formal announcement at Google I/O in May 2021. After that, the timeline looks a little different from previous years. A full stable release came a month later than usual, on October 4th, 2021. The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro launched later that month with Android 12 pre-loaded. A handful of bugs were to be expected, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832212/google-pixel-6-pro-december-update-bug-fixes-fingerprint-sensor"&gt;Google’s December Pixel update included dozens of fixes&lt;/a&gt; despite Google having that extra month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKzuTq"&gt;Even worse, the December patch itself proved problematic as some Pixel 6 owners complained about network connection problems worsened by the update. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860191/pixel-6-pro-google-december-feature-update-paused"&gt;halted the update&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/04/google-delists-december-2021-update-pixel-6-pro/"&gt;removed it from its archive&lt;/a&gt; to prevent manual downloads. When asked, the company didn’t offer an explanation for the problematic update but &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/143183382/december-2021-update-paused?hl=en"&gt;pointed to a statement&lt;/a&gt; that a fix is coming in late January that will include all of the bug fixes planned for the December patch.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixel 6 owners are still waiting for the bug fixes initially slated for the December update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PUxGBh"&gt;Google’s not alone in having trouble with its new OS. Samsung users in South Korea &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-issues-after-android-12-update"&gt;reported serious problems&lt;/a&gt; with their Galaxy Fold 3 and Flip 3 devices after installing the One UI 4.0 (Android 12) stable release, including flickering displays and bricked phones. Samsung acknowledged the problem and &lt;a href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%ED%8C%81/4%EC%B0%A8-%EB%B2%A0%ED%83%80-%EC%86%8C%ED%94%84%ED%8A%B8%EC%9B%A8%EC%96%B4-%EC%97%85%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8-%EA%B3%B5%EC%A7%80-12-13/td-p/14321413"&gt;responded initially by releasing a fourth &lt;em&gt;beta&lt;/em&gt; version&lt;/a&gt; of the software to fix bugs introduced by the stable release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EK2MKt"&gt;OnePlus’ stable release wasn’t so stable, either: its Android 12 skin was so buggy that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828553/oneplus-buggy-oxygenos-android-12-update-9-pro"&gt;the company paused its release&lt;/a&gt;, like Google, after it was widely criticized. In a brief statement, OnePlus explained that the fact this release marked the company’s attempt to integrate its OxygenOS and ColorOS codebases into the same build “led to the software experience not being smooth” and that its software team “collected the Community’s feedback and released a new build of OxygenOS 12 within a week to deliver a better user experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XpqlCV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the biggest OS update to Android since Android 5.0 Lollipop, and that was many years ago”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r5oEEP"&gt;In each case, these “stable” releases were anything but, and none of these companies offered much detail about what went wrong. To try and figure out what the heck is going on, we talked to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman"&gt;Mishaal Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, former editor-in-chief of &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;, who’s well known for digging into Android codebases and discovering Google’s secrets. Speaking to the Pixel 6 bugs in particular, Rahman guesses that it has a lot to do with the unusually large size of the update. “Many people have called it, myself included, the biggest OS update to Android since Android 5.0 Lollipop, and that was many years ago. There are just so many massive changes to the interface and to the feature set.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3kEJAy"&gt;He also suggests that Google’s commitment to issue a new Android update every year can make things worse when it’s trying to do so much, and the self-imposed one-year development cycle doesn’t leave much wiggle room in the timeline. “They started immediately after Android 11 was released to the public — and they have a hard cutoff date… After that, they just focus on fixing bugs.” Delay any longer, and they’d risk bumping into next year’s development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5arqlH"&gt;It’s also possible that the attempt to bring timely Android updates to non-Google devices wound up backfiring. Android phone owners have been asking for faster updates for a long time — outside of Google’s Pixel phones and pricey flagships, many devices face long waits for OS updates. Sure enough, the updates have come faster this year. Case in point: Samsung users are accustomed to waiting about three months after an Android stable release to get their finished One UI update with the new version of the OS, but this year, One UI 4.0 arrived just one and a half months after Android 12. But the way things have gone this year, many users would likely have opted for a slower, stable update rather than a fast one riddled with bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KpBnqN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OnePlus, by its own admission, faced unique complications as it attempted to merge Oppo’s ColorOS and OxygenOS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0oxxR5"&gt;OnePlus, by its own admission, faced unique complications as it attempted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;merge Oppo’s ColorOS and OxygenOS&lt;/a&gt; at the same time it incorporated Android 12’s changes. That’s a recipe for bugs, Rahman explains. “Devices that are upgrading from Android 11 with OxygenOS 11 to OxygenOS 12 are having a lot of settings and features being migrated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V76dpX"&gt;To illustrate the problem, he describes a bug that some Realme device owners have encountered: users who restore settings from an old Android phone when setting up a Realme device would sometimes find the &lt;a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/cant-disable-night-filter.4005543/"&gt;Night Light setting constantly enabled on their new phone&lt;/a&gt;. This happened because of a mismatch between Realme and Google’s open-source implementations of Night Light. OxygenOS 12, he suspects, suffered from similar issues. “It’s those kinds of bugs that are plaguing this update.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTYtaG"&gt;While it’s still hard to understand how &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/oxygen-os12-oneplus-9-awful/"&gt;an update as buggy&lt;/a&gt; as OnePlus’ initial OxygenOS 12 release earned a “stable” designation, it makes a little more sense when you account for the huge challenge of merging two codebases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hw5WUE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no straight line from Android 12 to the Galaxy S21 or OnePlus 9&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eSzGYc"&gt;While all of these factors likely contributed to an unusually troubled release, the underlying problem is a familiar one. By its nature, Android is a fragmented ecosystem. There’s no straight line from Android 12 to the Galaxy S21 or OnePlus 9 — every major update sees handoffs between the manufacturer, carriers, and Google, all of which result in delays. Initiatives like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/12/15632552/android-o-faster-updates-project-treble-google"&gt;Project Treble&lt;/a&gt; seem to have helped speed up some parts of the process, but unless Google takes some drastic actions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20847758/google-android-update-problem-pie-q-treble-mainline"&gt;nobody can completely fix the problem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rViwDT"&gt;While OEMs and Google push to get updates out faster, they’ve also made a push to produce more attention-grabbing, premium devices. OnePlus appears to be separating its “flagships, but cheaper” ethos into two different realms: “flagships” like the 9 Pro and separate “cheaper” phones a la the Nord series. Samsung is making a serious attempt to bring foldables into the mainstream. Google has positioned the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro as true flagships, with custom processors and a design language that’s more polished and less quirky than previous generations. This buggy OS rollout risks taking some of the shine off of the polished image these device makers are hoping to cultivate — in fact, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1481108783996751874?s=20"&gt;damage may already be done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FNT5vl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My Pixel 6 Pro has slowly gotten so buggy since launch in October that I can no longer recommend it at $900. Combined with the latest botched  update it's just been a bad experience. My SIM is back in an S21 Ultra til the next review.&lt;/p&gt;— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1481108783996751874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qBFeb9"&gt;It’s a shame because they’ve succeeded with the hardware. The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;two of the best phones Google has ever made&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus’ ambition to create a true flagship competitor has resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;a refined product that’s the genuine article&lt;/a&gt;. And this time around, Samsung seems to have succeeded at making &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;a foldable phone&lt;/a&gt; that has captured the attention of more than just tech geeks. But behind the glossy hardware, the software experience can still be uneven at times. That’s easier to forgive on a midrange or budget phone, but it’s tough to stomach from a premium device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ru4JHg"&gt;It’s unlikely, though, that this unusually troubled release will sway significant numbers of people to bail on Android; as painful as some of these bugs have been, they’re probably not enough to push users over the hurdles of jumping ship to Apple. Rahman thinks that in most cases, the ecosystem lock-in is too strong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5k5rtS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;behind the glossy hardware, the software experience can still be uneven at times&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zaz9Vh"&gt;“You’d lose out on so many apps and services that you pay for. If you have other devices that interact with your smartphone, you’d lose access to that, or that access would be diminished in some way. I don’t see it as a significant factor convincing people to turn away from a particular device.” Those barriers exist on Apple’s side as well, of course. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;Recently surfaced emails&lt;/a&gt; from Apple executives imply that iMessage remains exclusive to iPhones as a mechanism to keep Apple users with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ONg9Or"&gt;Apple has also had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20872972/apple-ios-13-review-iphone-update-dark-mode-arcade-maps-photos-siri"&gt;its share of software stumbles&lt;/a&gt;, to be sure. But it’s generally a more predictable experience — if you’re willing to live within the boundaries of that walled garden. And there’s the flipside of Android’s fragmented existence: there’s no single entity dictating the hardware and software. In Apple’s ecosystem, you get what it deems to be the right features at the right time, and that’s that. Foldables? Maybe in a few years. A rainbow of customizable system colors? Forget it. Life is a little more interesting — if, at times, unpredictable and uneven — outside of the garden walls.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop is selling PlayStation 5 bundles in-store to Pro members on January 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eN2ioVcq2QU3reuVTBM5NjfS2AE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70384866/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PS5 will be available in select GameStop stores as a part of a bundle.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4OF7ua"&gt;GameStop PowerUp Rewards Pro members still on the hunt for the ever-elusive PlayStation 5 may have another shot at nabbing the console. Once again, GameStop is selling PlayStation 5 bundles tomorrow, January 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIOH2S"&gt;The retailer has announced &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fps5-store-event.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its first special in-store PlayStation 5 sales event&lt;/a&gt; of this year will take place in select stores on Friday, January 14th. To participate, you must have &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22604013%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;murl=https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a subscription to GameStop’s Pro membership&lt;/a&gt;, which sells for $14.99 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlhtI6"&gt;The standard PlayStation 5, which offers a disc drive, typically retails for $499.99. However, as GameStop will be selling pre-built bundles, you should expect to pay more than that. An &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fps5-store-event.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;image published by GameStop&lt;/a&gt; also suggests the less expensive $399.99 PS5 Digital Edition could also be available as a part of a bundle, although this hasn’t been confirmed. For the unfamiliar, the Digital Edition is a console that shares identical specs but doesn’t have an optical drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8wssw"&gt;While we don’t know what will be inside the exact contents of the bundle yet, historically, these tend to contain PS5 games and GameStop gift cards, as well as other accessories like extra controllers or chargers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDJ0Rl"&gt;To land the console, you’ll have to visit a local GameStop store, which &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fps5-store-event.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can find using the company’s store locator tool here&lt;/a&gt;. While the event will probably start at each store’s opening time, it’s likely many will start lining up long before this, so prepare to wake up early. It’s advisable to check if your local branch is participating in the event beforehand, too, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ng6742"&gt;While this event is being hosted at several locations, GameStop has indicated that quantities will be limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XtABtw"&gt;If you don’t manage to pick up one tomorrow, keep checking back. We will continue posting updates as more restocks happen to make sure you will.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X are available right now for Walmart Plus subscribers (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hlNr08zeaUX12iagwr-22yVLtwI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70379557/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4C9oZp"&gt;In case you hadn’t noticed, it’s becoming ever-so-slightly less of a maddening exercise to get your hands on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. Granted, it’s still harder than it should be, but recent retailer restocks have taken longer to sell out than they used to. So, here’s hoping that you’re able to purchase whichever console you want &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fearlyaccess&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;during today’s restock at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is specifically for paid Walmart Plus subscribers and going on right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJbH1G"&gt;Walmart is offering the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 PS5 with a disc drive&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383%3Fathbdg%3DL1100&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 PS5 console that can only play digital titles&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X-Video-Game-Console-Black%2F443574645%3Fathbdg%3DL1100&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. These consoles are available to non-trial Walmart Plus members, meaning you actually have to opt-in to pay Walmart for the service to get access (&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Faccount%2Fplus%2Foverview&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here’s where you can sign up for Walmart Plus&lt;/a&gt;). Though, Walmart is calling these “early access” deals, perhaps suggesting that they’ll open up to non-Plus customers after a window of time. In the past, the window of exclusivity has been three hours. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new Degrassi show is coming to HBO Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O4bDX_ZkyCEN9H_jet-lSGisQdQ=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70384781/Degrassi___from_WildBrain.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;HBO&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="33Fa1l"&gt;Hot on the heels of &lt;em&gt;Euphoria&lt;/em&gt;’s season 2 premiere, HBO and partner WildBrain have just &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/warnermedia-kids-family-greenlights-new-degrassi-series-and-picks-degrassi-next"&gt;greenlit a new &lt;em&gt;Degrassi&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt; from co-showrunners Lara Azzopardi (&lt;em&gt;The Bold Type&lt;/em&gt;) and Julia Cohen (&lt;em&gt;Riverdale&lt;/em&gt;) that the network is billing as “a reprise of the original teen drama.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qXIxB7"&gt;Like the original &lt;em&gt;Degrassi&lt;/em&gt;, which explored the tumultuous lives of Canadian youths, the new show will focus on a group of high schoolers from Toronto who are all on different journeys of self-discovery. Unlike its predecessors (there have been five &lt;em&gt;Degrassi &lt;/em&gt;series to date), which all featured half-hour episodes, the newest series will see &lt;em&gt;Degrassi &lt;/em&gt;become an hour-long drama, indicating that its approach to storytelling is going to be a bit different this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eCaTf"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Degrassi &lt;/em&gt;technically kept on chugging for a few years after &lt;em&gt;The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt; came to an end in 2015, the franchise simply wasn’t the same, and in time, newer shows like &lt;em&gt;Riverdale&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Euphoria &lt;/em&gt;have come along to fill the teen drama-shaped voids in people’s souls. That being said, as much as many of the newer teen-focused shows owe to the &lt;em&gt;Degrassi &lt;/em&gt;franchise, few of them have managed to become quite as sticky and broadly popular as &lt;em&gt;The Next Generation &lt;/em&gt;was, and the network could easily have another hit on its hands if it plays its cards the right way. It will be a while before folks get a chance to compare the new show to the previous classes, but in preparation for the latest addition, all 14 seasons of &lt;em&gt;The Next Generation &lt;/em&gt;are coming to HBO Max this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFStwP"&gt;While there’s currently no word on any casting or the new show’s creative team, production on the new show is slated to begin sometime this year with a projected 2023 release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google calls for new government action to protect open-source software projects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fkFqJndLCHaPVbEwW2PRkJVf-0E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70384741/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CLP9bx"&gt;Following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/13/22881813/white-house-tech-summit-apple-google-meta-amazon-open-source-security"&gt;summit on open-source security&lt;/a&gt; hosted at the White House Thursday, Google has called for increasing government involvement in identifying and securing critical open-source software projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekdxQd"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/making-open-source-software-safer-and-more-secure"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; published shortly after the summit, Kent Walker, president for global affairs and chief legal officer at Google and Alphabet, said that collaboration between government and the private sector was needed for open-source funding and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToJ3Eo"&gt;“We need a public-private partnership to identify a list of critical open source projects — with criticality determined based on the influence and importance of a project — to help prioritize and allocate resources for the most essential security assessments and improvements,” Walker wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28MlyZ"&gt;The blog post also called for an increase in public and private investment to keep the open-source ecosystem secure, particularly when the software is used in infrastructure projects. For the most part, funding and review of such projects are conducted by the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iC1YG"&gt;The White House had not responded to a request for comment by time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8yZcG"&gt;“Open source software code is available to the public, free for anyone to use, modify, or inspect ... That’s why many aspects of critical infrastructure and national security systems incorporate it,” wrote Walker. “But there’s no official resource allocation and few formal requirements or standards for maintaining the security of that critical code. In fact, most of the work to maintain and enhance the security of open source, including fixing known vulnerabilities, is done on an ad hoc, volunteer basis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXVPJT"&gt;The shortage of funding and resources for open-source development has long been raised as a security concern and has re-emerged as a key issue after the discovery of a serious bug in the Log4j Java library, which quickly became the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828303/log4j-library-vulnerability-log4shell-zero-day-exploit"&gt;biggest cybersecurity vulnerability in recent years&lt;/a&gt;. The Log4j library was also developed and maintained largely by unpaid labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMej4x"&gt;When open-source projects do receive funding, it generally comes from private sources like individual donations or sponsorship from tech companies. Google recently contributed $1 million to the &lt;a href="https://sos.dev/"&gt;Secure Open Source&lt;/a&gt; (SOS) rewards program, a pilot scheme being run by the Linux Foundation to financially compensate developers working to improve the security of open-source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We have so many questions about Boba Fett’s new job in The Book of Boba Fett</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nygfO5iuo6_hA56a_3Ff6YC9doo=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70384665/BUC_035870_R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nicola Goode / Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hY6YW2"&gt;The long-awaited Boba Fett spinoff, &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;, is roughly halfway through its seven-episode season on Disney Plus, which follows the iconic bounty hunter as he attempts to reinvent himself as “literally anything other than a bounty hunter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAzlkD"&gt;Yes, Boba Fett has a new job in &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett.&lt;/em&gt; After killing off Jabba the Hutt’s former majordomo, Bib Fortuna (who, we’re told, stepped in to fill the Hutt-shaped space in Mos Espa’s criminal underworld), Boba is now the new “daimyo,” the lord and master of the desert planet’s seedier elements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYkoe9"&gt;As we noted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/29/22858259/the-book-of-boba-fett-episode-one-recap-star-wars-mandalorian"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s initial review&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not entirely clear &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; Boba Fett is chasing a sudden career change at this point in his life. And after a few more episodes, &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett &lt;/em&gt;has left us with more questions about Boba’s new gig than answers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbvfEe"&gt;Here are just a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLJSOS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;s&gt;&lt;strong&gt;earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Tatooine would Boba Fett actually want to be the daimyo here?&lt;/strong&gt; Why would &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; want to run Jabba’s old crime empire on a backwater planet most famous for being so hot and uncomfortable to live on that farming dew is a great job and which has been best described as “if there’s a bright center to the universe, you’re on the planet that it’s farthest from”? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atIcA6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How extensive is this criminal empire?&lt;/strong&gt; Jabba seemed to have much bigger reach — he shows up in the special edition of &lt;em&gt;A New Hope&lt;/em&gt; to intimidate Han Solo in person in Mos Eisley, but &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; can’t seem to decide whether Jabba was a planetary-wide force of mob rule or just a dude who had the city of Mos Espa under his thumb. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NRPzvdx0kx6c_LsNNbpGh5xBAcc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23166664/BUC_FF_001048.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="90Fe94"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is Boba Fett so &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bad at his job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; For a character whose sole purpose in Star Wars is to be the baddest of the badass, how is Boba so bad at this? We’ve already seen him nearly die multiple times and make plenty of questionable decisions. Is this just the Star Wars version of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle"&gt;Peter Principle&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTW9l5"&gt;Boba Fett’s introduction in the franchise is when Darth Vader hires him as one of the bounty hunters to chase down the Millennium Falcon. It’s a scene where Vader calls him out specifically that he wants Luke and friends alive. (“&lt;a href="https://www.starwars.com/video/no-disintegrations"&gt;No disintegrations&lt;/a&gt;.”) He’s a man who &lt;em&gt;Darth Vader&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxL8bVJhXCM"&gt;this guy!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qH1gey2aTw"&gt;the character that did this!&lt;/a&gt; — has to rebuke for going a little overboard sometimes. And now he’s taking shit from the mayor’s day planner, the guy who sells water in town, Jabba’s cousins, and the Star Wars equivalent of teenage ne’er-do-wells. Which raises a few more important questions…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aeivnx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does anyone respect Boba Fett in this town?&lt;/strong&gt; As previously mentioned, almost no one seems to take Boba seriously in his new role. His competitors don’t think he belongs, his constituents argue with him and question his decisions, and the city’s mayor doesn’t even want to meet with him. Things really hit a personal low point when we find Boba bartering with a bunch of obnoxious teens riding futuristic Vespas; instead of punishing them, he outright hires them. Not the most intimidating course of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCtQfF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Boba actually do as daimyo?&lt;/strong&gt; For that matter, what did Jabba do? It seems like the job is mostly sitting in a big chair, listening to people’s complaints, and trying not to be assassinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZ7tam"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many people make up this criminal empire?&lt;/strong&gt; For the first few episodes, the crew of people working for Boba seems incredibly small. There’s his number one (Fennec Shand), an ex-torture droid, and a pair of Gamorrean bodyguards. We don’t see anybody else under his command until he hires the aforementioned quartet of mechanically altered teen troublemakers. That’s pretty small for someone who is supposed to rule over a criminal empire. And how does the hiring process work? Boba seems to just hire whoever he comes across — aside from Wookie assassins — with little in the way of due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Seksyl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Boba Fett just having a midlife crisis?&lt;/strong&gt; By the chronology of Star Wars, Boba is roughly in his mid-40s at the time of the show, which would put him squarely in the “early mid-life crisis” zone. Maybe this whole “taking over a criminal enterprise of indeterminate size that you have literally zero experience or capability to run” is just Boba’s attempt to add a little spice and flair to his life, especially after the priority clarifying near-death experience of almost finding “a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years” in the Sarlacc pit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0w_3sZaJAW9Rr79WsU5yQQB5uRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23166667/BUC_FF_001896.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FF9Q2n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Boba just in this for health insurance?&lt;/strong&gt; Hear us out here. Prior to taking over Jabba’s job, Boba Fett was a bounty hunter, the Star Wars equivalent of a Taskrabbit or Uber driver, except they chase down and capture / kill / occasionally disintegrate(?) people for money. We know from &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; that there’s a literal guild of bounty hunters, with bosses who offer a selection of jobs for these heavily armed gig workers to take (like Carl Weathers’ Greef Karga), but they’re clearly independent contractors with little to no corporate benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1O1xSs"&gt;Contrast that with the Boba Fett of &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;. Suddenly, Boba can afford a fancy and expensive Bacta Tank for healing up his Sarlacc-inflicted wounds. You’re telling me that he’s getting that kind of medical treatment on Tatooine with freelancer insurance rates? The deductibles alone would be ruinous. Between the Bacta treatments and Fennec’s cybernetic reconstruction, the two are &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; on some sort of group plan within the larger post-Jabba organization, and Boba, like so many freelancers, is just looking for some stable benefits to help manage his chronic injuries as he’s getting up there in years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PaAa2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does Boba Fett even want to do this job?&lt;/strong&gt; It’s hard to get the sense that he’s genuinely enthused about actually being a crime lord. He seems to have no desire for the trappings of luxury, eschewing the apparently traditional palanquin for his trips about town and showing little interest in the lavish feasts put in front of him. “Not now, I’m busy” is Boba’s first reaction when his droid butler tries to pull him away from playing with his new rancor buddy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OeJGaB"&gt;
&lt;p id="9KKHqC"&gt;With four episodes left, &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; still has plenty of time to try and answer some of these questions. But it’s possible that maybe the galaxy’s most infamous bounty hunter is just more suited to mayhem than middle management. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood has to pay a trader around $30K for restricting trades on certain stocks  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nSH2QdTWTh1i7f680IIfo2rj3JE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70384388/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fEAMVf"&gt;Jose Batista, a retail investor, was awarded almost $30,000 from Robinhood after filing a complaint using the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s (or FINRA’s) arbitration service. His case may end up being an example for other retail traders who are still upset at the trading platform’s actions in January of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tm1fHo"&gt;On January 28th, Batista was planning on selling his stock in Koss and Express — but  Robinhood &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys"&gt;had placed trading restrictions on them&lt;/a&gt;, limiting the amount of shares its users could buy. This meant that Batista had to watch helplessly as the prices of his stock fell to nearly half of what they were the day before the restrictions were put in place, &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-27-year-old-truck-driver-just-became-robinhoods-first-big-headache-of-2022-11641856157"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Seeing it plummeting and plummeting, I felt horrible, and then I felt stuck,” &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7n78q/robinhood-trader-wins-dollar30000-in-first-of-its-kind-payout-following-gamestop-mania"&gt;Batista told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DPx4ZE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood’s decision to freeze and restrict stock trading led to dozens of lawsuits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F9wA2U"&gt;Robinhood’s restrictions were thanks to the rush of trades happening around GameStop’s stock, which were in part driven by retail investors. In January 2021, the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248775/gamestop-stock-price-rise-bloomberg-wallstreetbets-subreddit"&gt;hyped up by users of the WallStreetBets subreddit&lt;/a&gt;, and its stock rocketed up in value. This eventually lead to temporary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244900/game-stop-stock-halted-trading-volatility"&gt;market-wide trading halts&lt;/a&gt; and even seemingly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252864/wallstreetbets-stocks-memes-broker-outages-limits-amc-gamestop"&gt;caused technical difficulties at several brokerages&lt;/a&gt;. That included Robinhood, which restricted trades on not just GameStop but other stocks such as AMC, Blackberry, Koss, and Express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Es7KWy"&gt;The trading restrictions meant Robinhood users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;couldn’t buy any shares of the main meme stocks&lt;/a&gt;. It also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys"&gt;heavily limited&lt;/a&gt; the number of shares its users could buy in other companies — at one point, users could only buy shares of Express if they owned less than five already. For Koss, you were only allowed to buy a single share. The freeze attracted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22254656/robinhood-gamestop-stonks-trade-freeze-class-action-lawsuits"&gt;dozens of user lawsuits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;review bombs&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;attention from lawmakers&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the other lawsuits and investigations haven’t ended up going anywhere, though, according to &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/em&gt; and Batista’s lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKkKMH"&gt;The arbitrator &lt;a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/aao_documents/21-01206.pdf"&gt;doesn’t give a rationale&lt;/a&gt; for Batista’s win. However, Batista’s lawyer &lt;a href="https://www.iorioaltamirano.com/blog/read-more-about-iorio-altamirano-llps-historic-arbitration-award-against-robinhood-for-january-2021-trading-restrictions/"&gt;wrote a post&lt;/a&gt; theorizing about why they were successful where others had failed: because the case focused on “Robinhood’s inadequate liquidity management practices and monitoring of its counterparty risk.” The post also says that they “attacked, head-on, the notion that Robinhood’s customer agreement gives it unfettered right to restrict trading for any reason, at any time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GZ6dZL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Other spurned traders may use this case as a template&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Enwu8U"&gt;To other traders, the case could represent blood in the water. While arbitration decisions don’t set legal precedent, meaning that another arbitrator could rule a different way in an almost identical case, Batista’s lawyer calls for other Robinhood customers to contact the firm. A &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/s0z2vb/apparently_someone_successfully_sued_robinhood/"&gt;few threads&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/s0z8v3/a_27yearold_truck_driver_just_became_robinhoods/"&gt;stock-related subreddits&lt;/a&gt; have already pointed out the possibility that the case could be used as an example to try and get a payout from Robinhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HmMF5"&gt;In addition to the $29,460.77 in damages Batista will receive, Robinhood will also be on the hook for a few more grand: the arbitrator ordered it to pay almost a year’s interest on the money. Robinhood &lt;a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/aao_documents/21-01206.pdf"&gt;will also have to pay filing&lt;/a&gt; and some other fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8Q9oL"&gt;Robinhood, the parent company of the two entities named in the dispute, declined to provide an on-the-record response for this story. Those two entities are Robinhood Securities and Robinhood Financial. Both are members of FINRA, though the parent company is not — so the ruling applies to those two legal entities within Robinhood itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vwn3fS"&gt;While GameStop’s stock led to the trade restrictions, it’s not what Batista filed his complaint about. Batista &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; own GameStop shares at the time but had no plans of selling them, according to &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/em&gt;. Some Redditors have urged him to put his winnings back into GameStop, but he instead plans on investing the money into his trucking business and using it to pay for childcare, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7n78q/robinhood-trader-wins-dollar30000-in-first-of-its-kind-payout-following-gamestop-mania"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wj8TOI"&gt;For Batista, it seems like a happy end to the saga — maybe his story will be adapted as part of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22268952/gamestop-stock-stonks-reddit-wallstreetbets-movies-tv-shows-hbo-netflix"&gt;bajillion movies, documentaries, and TV shows&lt;/a&gt; that are supposedly in the works about the GameStop / WallStreetBets bonanza.&lt;/p&gt;
