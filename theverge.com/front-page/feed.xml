    <title>Tile refreshes its Mate, Pro, Slim, and Sticker trackers with better range, louder volume, and improved water resistance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6a2fPRgTz4vRiyK9GUqH3AAd_gI=/0x2:7952x5303/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69982970/Black_Pro_Sticker_Combo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The new Tile Pro, Tile Slim, and Tile Sticker trackers | Image: Tile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Xjt0K"&gt;Tile is refreshing its entire product lineup today with brand new hardware for its Tile Mate, Tile Pro, Tile Slim, and Tile Sticker Bluetooth trackers. All four trackers are getting sleeker, updated designs, with improvements to both tracking range, volume, and water resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ro8GXg"&gt;The regular $24.99 Tile Mate is getting its biggest change in years, with a more rounded shape and design and a new black color option (in addition to the standard white). Range is being increased from 200 feet to 250 feet, the volume of the ring is now louder when you’re trying to locate it, and the water resistance has been upgraded to an IP67 rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fEK0M"&gt;Battery life is also longer on the new Mate — three years, instead of the single year offered on the previous model — although it comes with the tradeoff that the battery is no longer user-replaceable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B-9TdH-pjYzc-rTlT4om4HClseY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911367/BW_Mates_Keys.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tile&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The refreshed Tile Mate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ItET26hB6vN1R3FBf9WSxCDTUe4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911375/Slim_Wallet.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tile&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The refreshed Tile Slim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XM1qaA"&gt;The $34.99 wallet-sized Tile Slim is also getting similar upgrades to the Mate: a new design that fits in with the other new Tiles, a boosted 250-foot range (from 200 feet), a louder ring, and IP67 water resistance (although, unlike the old Mate, the old Slim was already waterproof, so that’s not as big a change). It also maintains its built-in battery, which, like the Mate, lasts approximately three years before needing replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIxTGW"&gt;The $34.99 Tile Pro is also getting a new design, which should help better distinguish it from the regular Tile Mate. The new model has a more rectangular appearance that fits better on a keyring than the old square shape. And like the regular Mate, the updated Pro is also more water-resistant, with a new IP67 rating (compared to the IP55 rating on the old Pro, which only protected against “&lt;a href="https://tileteam.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009916693-Tile-Pro-2020"&gt;splashes or a quick drop in water&lt;/a&gt;”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bikEOe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Improvements all around&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PTU2Nb"&gt;Some parts of the Pro are the same as the previous model: it still has the longest range of any Tile tracker (400 feet), and it’s keeping the replaceable battery (which lasts about a year before you’ll have to swap it out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gv4sXu"&gt;Lastly, there’s the $29.99 Tile Sticker, which is getting its first update since it was first released. The new model has dramatically better range (250 feet, compared to 150 feet on the old model), better battery life (three years off the non-replaceable battery, up from two years before), and a louder ring. And like the other new models, the new Sticker also has IP67 water resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Myr-zWOnGy_yIkpH7-0LnQKjok0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911379/Black_Pro_Backpack.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tile&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The refreshed Tile Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ueLa4wlTc4zjTVoyNZd-0LbumIA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911385/Sticker_Remote.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The refreshed Tile Sticker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KH4ShE"&gt;Tile is also rolling out a new Lost and Found feature on the Mate, Pro, and Slim trackers: the new models now feature a QR code on the back, which can be scanned by anyone who finds a Tile tracker out in the world but isn’t already a Tile user. When the lost tracker is found, scanning it will pop up your contact information so that you can coordinate getting your stuff back. (The feature isn’t available on the Sticker due to size constraints in printing the QR code.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkMHQU"&gt;It’s not quite on the same level as Apple’s AirTags or Samsung’s SmartTags, both of which can leverage Apple and Samsung devices that belong to users who don’t actually own trackers as part of the companies’ Bluetooth networks, but Lost and Found should help expand Tile’s usefulness even when found by a non-Tile customer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-gaPNca4-NbBlXUGn1BvqdCKfY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911360/tile.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tile&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Tile’s new QR-code powered Lost and Found feature&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ASH5sV"&gt;Additionally, Tile also announced a new safety feature, called “Scan and Secure,” that it’ll be rolling out in early 2022. Once it’s available, Scan and Secure will allow anyone to download the Tile app and use it to scan and detect nearby devices and notify you if there are any unknown Tiles nearby. The goal is to make it harder for someone to use Tiles for malicious tracking purposes (Apple and Samsung both offer similar safety features with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22516178/apple-airtags-tracking-devices-update-play-sound-privacy-android-app"&gt;AirTags&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22392924/samsung-smartags-tracker-bixby-privacy-smartthings"&gt;SmartTags&lt;/a&gt;), and Tile is working with the National Network to End Domestic Violence on development and design of the feature. Users who install the Tile app to scan for devices won’t be part of Tile’s finding network, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuuM7i"&gt;Noticeably missing from Tile’s announcement is the addition of ultra-wideband radio technology for more accurate localized tracking, something that its AirTag and SmartTag Plus competitors both have offered for months. But Tile has an answer for that, too, in the form of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22480911"&gt;newly announced Tile Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, which will bring UWB-powered AR tracking to the lineup in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqDB1y"&gt;The four new Tile trackers are available starting today from Tile’s website and a variety of retailers, including Amazon, Costco, Best Buy, and Target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="riFIo8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Tile Ultra takes on AirTags with UWB-powered AR tracking, coming early 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SKvpG8MLiuG_48l5V52C10xDf40=/162x0:1761x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69982973/Screen_Shot_2021_09_20_at_12.19.29_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J32oab"&gt;Tile has officially announced its first ultra-wideband (UWB) tracking tag, the Tile Ultra, coming in 2022 and which Tile claims is the first tracking tag from any company to offer UWB support on both Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bd495K"&gt;Tile isn’t giving any information on price or a release date beyond “early 2022,” but it did provide an early preview of what the Ultra will look like and how it’ll work. From the outside, the Ultra looks similar to the newly updated Tile Pro, with a rounded, rectangular shape and a built-in key ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLzy7N"&gt;But on the inside, in addition to using Bluetooth radios to leverage Tile’s network of devices to discover the rough location of an object, the Tile Ultra (similar to Apple’s AirTag and Samsung’s SmartTag Plus) can then use its UWB radio to offer more accurate location abilities, even if your tag is behind a shelf or under a couch. The Ultra will also offer an augmented-reality mode to easily directly you straight to your missing tracker. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rrOd58r4A6vJgMLZiSzAzKVfcrY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911325/UWB_AR.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gyTfgW"&gt;The new Ultra tag comes as Tile is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22480909"&gt;announcing refreshed versions&lt;/a&gt; of the rest of its tracking tag lineup (the Mate, Pro, Slim, and Sticker), which have been updated with sleeker designs, louder volume, and improved water resistance. Those four new models, unlike the Ultra, are available today. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft transforms the Windows Subsystem for Linux into a Windows 11 app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o58ybIDIzGAnz7f6c-Ugiz6yXQ8=/0x20:1219x833/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69982908/windowslinux.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BfN9KY"&gt;Microsoft has transformed the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) into an app that you can simply download and install from the Microsoft Store on Windows 11. A preview version of the app is &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/wslstorepage"&gt;available right now&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Windows 11 users to install Windows Subsystem for Linux without having to head into add / remove programs and selecting WSL as an optional inbox component for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wsACm"&gt;This separate app will now be serviced through the store, which means Microsoft can update WSL independently from Windows, allowing WSL users to “get the latest WSL updates and features faster, and without needing to modify your Windows version.” While there are no new changes with this Store app version just yet, it does mean that future updates can appear without needing to wait for a bigger Windows release or update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WHqlCs"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nVxYFMa1ltM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t7OkmM"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396018/microsoft-windows-10-linux-gui-apps-task-manager-app-throttling-features"&gt;enabled Linux GUI apps on Windows 10&lt;/a&gt; for developers last year, and features like this will be available immediately in the Microsoft Store in the future. It appears that this Microsoft Store app for WSL will only work on Windows 11, though. Microsoft doesn’t mention Windows 10 &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/a-preview-of-wsl-in-the-microsoft-store-is-now-available/"&gt;in its blog post&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that you’ll need to update to benefit from the Microsoft Store app. It’s good news for Windows 11 users though, especially those in enterprise environments where it often takes slightly longer to get the latest Windows versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUE5Lp"&gt;Microsoft will still support the inbox version of WSL so you can run them side by side, and aims to move Windows 11 users over to the Microsoft Store version eventually. “Our goals are to make WSL in the Microsoft Store the best way to install and use WSL, as you’ll be able to get the latest updates fastest through that route, and in the long term we’d like to move WSL users to use the store version,” &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/a-preview-of-wsl-in-the-microsoft-store-is-now-available/"&gt;explains Craig Loewen&lt;/a&gt;, a program manager for the Windows developer platform.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first USB-C iPhone is here thanks to a mod</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_KjgyEsT7H_83UmuQxkRKm6XWnw=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69982903/usbciphone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A USB-C port on an iPhone X.&lt;/em&gt; | Ken Pillonel (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAekbJf4Gsw" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VfmGgU"&gt;Apple hasn’t created a USB-C iPhone despite years of rumors, but that hasn’t stopped a robotics engineering student from creating one. Ken Pillonel has placed a working USB-C port inside an iPhone X, allowing the phone to charge and transfer data over USB-C instead of Lightning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTV91e"&gt;Pillonel has spent months on the project in his spare time, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/11/iphone-gets-usb-c-thanks-to-creative-robotics-engineer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and opened up plenty of USB-C and Lightning cables to get to his final goal of a USB-C iPhone. Pillonel originally created &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCEzdj_8YwU"&gt;a simple prototype&lt;/a&gt; in May that allowed an iPhone battery to be charged over the USB-C port. The proof of concept was rather large and didn’t fit inside an iPhone, so the next stage was to remove all the wires and squeeze it inside. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZW5bEZwG-y8Mu1A5XrwHbW8zQec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22920198/usbciphone.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Ken Pillonel (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAekbJf4Gsw" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C port on an iPhone X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2IOb6v"&gt;Pillonel reverse-engineered Apple’s custom C94 connector, creating his own flexible PCB design that fits inside an iPhone. Pillonel revealed the flexible cable in a final teaser video this week, demonstrating how the iPhone X with USB-C charges and transfers data. A full video is currently being edited, which will detail exactly how Pillonel managed to reverse-engineer the C94 connector and fit his custom PCB inside the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAzNxU"&gt;The USB-C iPhone comes just weeks after the European Commission announced plans to force smartphone and other electronics manufacturers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"&gt;fit a common USB-C charging port&lt;/a&gt; on their devices. Apple could be forced to create an iPhone with USB-C in the next couple of years, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689432/eu-iphone-usb-c-switch-portless-design"&gt;launch a portless iPhone&lt;/a&gt; that relies on wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BiVcz"&gt;It’s not clear whether Pillonel plans to release details of his custom flexible PCB so others can attempt the modification. He’s currently studying for a master’s degree in robotics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, EPFL. He has previously used his talents to &lt;a href="https://kenp.io/galaxy_fold_car/"&gt;modify a car mount for Samsung’s Galaxy Fold&lt;/a&gt;, releasing a 3D printed mod to allow a Xiaomi Mi Wireless Car Charger to work with the Galaxy Fold.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram’s outages were so bad the app will now alert users when the service goes down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pwUNZGtBSobjIj16K5ay5LLbjhw=/0x27:1250x860/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69982875/instagram_problems.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instagram is testing a feature that will announce serious outages in users’ Activity Feed. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s4sUuH"&gt;Instagram is &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-outages-and-account-status/"&gt;testing a new feature&lt;/a&gt; that will alert users when the service is having major technical difficulties. The alert will appear as a notification in users’ Activity Feed when “people are confused and looking for answers,” says Instagram. In other words: when the app’s systems take a serious and prolonged nose-dive, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;as they did last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FoK4B8"&gt;It’s a sensible feature from Instagram’s parent company Facebook, given the chaos that’s caused when its services go down. When Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram fail, people often wonder if there’s something wrong with &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; connection, &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; internet, or &lt;em&gt;their &lt;/em&gt;account. A little notification telling users, “Don’t worry, it’s not you, it’s us” will probably save a lot of confusion in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9GDYqwnXXGXWqp8lvuoQgnZ4pxk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22920192/242807439_1269220323513986_4605225184627564004_n.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It seems users will also be notified when the outages are fixed. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KIHGlh"&gt;Instagram says it’s testing the feature in the US for the “next few months,” and may roll it out more widely if it’s helpful. It’s easy to imagine similar features being introduced for Facebook’s most essential service, WhatsApp; a messaging app that, for many, constitutes their primary mode of digital communication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGDxyw"&gt;In the same announcement today, Instagram also said it was introducing a new tool named “Account Status” which will notify users if their content is reported as inappropriate. “We’ll start by making it easier for people to know whether their account is at risk of being disabled,” said the company in a &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-outages-and-account-status/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “In the coming months, we plan to add more information to this tool, giving people a better sense of how their content is being distributed and recommended across different parts of Instagram.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="USGxSy"&gt;When it comes to true wireless earbuds, there are a ton of brands and products to choose from. Whether you enjoy the unconventional design of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live or prefer Jabra’s compact Elite 75t, there’s a pair of wireless earbuds for just about everyone. Fortunately, many of the best wireless earbuds go on sale on a regular occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsWVXq"&gt;Regardless of which brand you prefer, we have compiled some of the best deals on wireless earbuds available right now. Of course, if you want to do more research before making a buying decision, we also encourage you to read our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you determine which pair of earbuds are best for you. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;Apple AirPods deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the Pro variant offer better sound quality and feature active noise cancellation, not to mention seamless integration with iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;Apple’s flagship Pro wireless earbuds tend to go on sale frequently, and we often see them drop as low as $200. Right now, for instance, you can get a new pair for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$180 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPY6Vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;second-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, which include either a wired or wireless charging case. Although they normally retail for $160, you can get the version with the wired charging case for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/994132/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$110 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DcXNMK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;If you prefer a little more convenience, you can also get a new pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods with a wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt; for a few dollars more. At their regular price of $200, they aren’t as good of a value, but you’ll rarely find yourself paying the usual price. At the moment, you can get them for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$160 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1066108/9383?subId1=VergeDeals&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and some of the best sound quality of any Samsung earbuds to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;Right now Amazon is offering the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08MWZHHKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro for $44 off&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $156 in select colorways. It’s not the lowest price we’ve seen — the popular Samsung earbuds have retailed for just shy of $150 in the past — but it’s not far off, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WZ42v1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x23GrZ"&gt;Samsung only released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; — a good-sounding pair of earbuds with active noise cancellation — in late August, but we’re already starting to see some discounts at retailers like Woot and Amazon. Right now, for instance, you can get a discounted Galaxy SmartTag tracker with the purchase of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Wireless-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Lightweight/dp/B09FHKBCZN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The bundle typically sells for $180, however, Amazon is currently selling it in select colors for $174.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Eo52gY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aZthMF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; were our top pick last year for the best wireless earbuds overall. A successor to the original Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in an assortment of colors. Right now, you can buy the Galaxy Buds Plus for $100 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest price we’ve seen in the last several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c8pRgb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mPBmzD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; are some of the more unconventional wireless earbuds on the market right now, but don’t let their bean-shaped design fool you. The Buds Live is a good option if you want earbuds that produce powerful sound and showcase marathon battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52C6bu"&gt;Right now, you can purchase a pair of the Galaxy Buds Live in a multitude of colors for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B658NP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$130 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/GjV3V2"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, a roughly $40 discount. The red model is an additional &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08J3Y4W5J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$13 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the earbuds down to a cool $117.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xJfsfQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="i2Ah0B"&gt;Sony WF-1000XM3 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HggHzb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; are the true wireless headphones to beat, but they haven’t been discounted yet given how recently they launched. Their predecessor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features"&gt;WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt;, however, remain an excellent pair of earbuds that do routinely go on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haWqZJ"&gt;Like the most recent model, the WF-1000XM3 feature phenomenal sound quality and considerable battery life, a small feat for a pair of true wireless earbuds. They also manage to deliver noise cancellation in a sleek, copper-adorned package, one that’s both attractive and professional. Right now, Sony’s last-gen WF-1000XM3 are selling at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM3-Industry-Canceling-Wireless/dp/B07T81554H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747336499962657708#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for around $128, easily their best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8F3h1H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563643"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="9wJvFX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 39,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="1TXXf4"&gt;Other true wireless earbuds deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;Last year, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s lineup. They have more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t, however, they also feature less bass and an inferior fit. You can buy the Jabra Elite 85t for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$180 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDfB2WVItB#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LacpUE"&gt;If the price on the Elite 85t is intimidating but you want a pair of Jabra earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt; are also a good option. We consider the Jabra 75t — which are currently selling for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDfEmv2ecW#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$130 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-75t-Earbuds-Comfortable/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/WDNvBA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; — the best true wireless earbuds for multitaskers, and they remain a solid alternative if you don’t want to buy AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IE8ocy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Jabra overhauls true wireless earbuds lineup with three new models","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649800/jabra-elite-7-pro-active-3-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="OvElfP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqq7gj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt; may be the latest fitness earbuds from Apple, but if you’re currently in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you also can’t go wrong with their predecessor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place while exercising; they’re also IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;Currently, there are a few different discounts available for the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest we see right now is at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B088KTR418/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/2rKXO0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which are selling the earphones in most colorways for just under $180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0RcdxX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11vDvx"&gt;Much like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937559/amazon-echo-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-features-bose-noise-reduction-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; represents a tremendous value. Amazon’s latest true wireless earbuds offer improved comfort and better noise cancellation, along with a terrific passthrough mode that ensures you can always hear what’s going on around you. The $120 earbuds also feature hands-free Alexa support and sound that’s remarkably satisfying, with more bass than the AirPods Pro and an appropriate amount of restraint when it comes to the high end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cb3iGA"&gt;Although the second-gen Amazon Echo Buds were on sale for $90 during Amazon’s Labor Day sale, they’re currently not discounted anywhere. However, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Buds/dp/B085WV7635?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get a 25 percent discount from Amazon&lt;/a&gt; if you trade in select devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PgPi8b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Samsung tries to prove its foldable phones are tough in a new test video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UarNK6vTmdy6i9vxmbC12o2a_ys=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69981970/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_22.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mE5U41"&gt;Samsung is sharing new details about how it tests the durability of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3. However, it’s unclear exactly why Samsung is releasing this information now, especially given that both phones launched in August; that makes us think it could be an attempt to assuage fears sparked by recent reports of cracks on Galaxy Z Flip 3 screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9pkuS"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpWHBvxmDV0"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; posted on &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/how-samsung-galaxy-z-fold3-flip3-5g-test-behind-the-scenes/?utm_source=pr_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung shows four separate tests. One has the phones in an environmental chamber, where Samsung tests the phones under different climates to make sure they still work. Another test engulfs the phones in water. One uses a robot arm to test the performance of the S Pen on the Z Fold 3. A fourth test folds both phones over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mcZ5Vm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung has shown off its stress tests in the past&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uj2fHy"&gt;Samsung has shown off its stress tests in the past — one video &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-11-26-samsung-smartphones-stress-test.html"&gt;from 2012&lt;/a&gt; showed a robot butt sitting on phones, for example. And it’s not just Samsung; Apple described its phone antenna testing in detail &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9eXYOA8TCk&amp;amp;t=701s"&gt;in response&lt;/a&gt; to the iPhone 4’s “Antennagate” scandal and showed off its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/25/6845611/inside-apples-iphone-6-torture-building"&gt;iPhone testing lab&lt;/a&gt; after the iPhone 6 was found to be prone to bending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZjJur"&gt;Samsung’s tests shown on Monday don’t specifically address the issue of why Z Flip 3 screens seem to be cracking, though. There are increasing numbers of reports of cracks appearing in the middle of the screen right about where the phone’s hinge is. &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; had &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/07/galaxy-z-flip-3-glass-durability-diary/"&gt;a particularly worrying story&lt;/a&gt; on October 7th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="sdT2jI"&gt;Recently, I picked up my Galaxy Z Flip 3 review unit after a few days of no use, and I was shocked to see that the ultra-thin glass had broken. I hadn’t dropped the phone in recent days (only once in my usage, &lt;em&gt;weeks &lt;/em&gt;beforehand), I hadn’t exposed it to extreme heat or cold, I hadn’t even really touched it over the course of at least a few days, so the shattered glass came as a genuine shock to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="26l9NY"&gt;A user on Reddit posted about a similar issue after &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxyzflip/comments/q2sz16/got_the_thing_less_than_three_days_ago_treated_it/"&gt;less than three days of owning the phone&lt;/a&gt;. Another said their phone’s screen cracked &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxyzflip/comments/p9a646/galaxy_z_flip_3_screen_fails_withing_24hrs_of/"&gt;within 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;. And the problem doesn’t seem to be exclusive to the Z Flip 3; as pointed out by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Fisher (aka MrMobile) said he saw tiny cracks &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XnHJhBNpWb4?t=562"&gt;on the hinge on his Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TiRMl7"&gt;One of the biggest questions about Samsung’s foldables has always been their durability, especially after the first Fold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18511170/samsung-galaxy-fold-delay-indefinitely-statement-screen-display-broken-issues"&gt;was delayed&lt;/a&gt; because screens were breaking on review units. The reported issues with cracks show that there might still be some problems for Samsung to solve to ensure that their foldable phones don’t break over the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_0jG4qDGtvO2-VxvVC5PUlh1ldA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/akrales_181101_3056_0132.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2018 Kindle Paperwhite might not be the newest model, but it’s available for $35 off.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZCNr8"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, having helped pioneer the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of three unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products. In those instances, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know what a good Kindle deal looks like when you see one. Note that Amazon also offers a 20 percent off all of its Kindles when you trade in select devices, so there are still other ways to save money if when none of the models are available on discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hittMf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s older Kindles will start to lose their internet access in December","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598747/kindle-3g-network-shutdown-e-readers-no-internet"},{"title":"You can now preorder the new Kindle Paperwhite","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685873/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="r36wrm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;Kindle (10th-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $90. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy a 10th-gen Kindle with lockscreen ads for $90 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VT322X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxG6j9qO2d#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its full retail price. If you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$110 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy either Kindle model at Amazon, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $120 ($15 off its usual price) at Amazon; it includes one of three printed covers and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $110 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids Plus service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost. We’ve seen the Kindle Kids Edition drop to as low as $70 during Amazon Prime Day, however, right now it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746224890339507137" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $110.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="iYO8oT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (2018)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="deHMlR"&gt;Amazon’s latest Kindle Paperwhite is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685873/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;forthcoming 11th-gen model&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with USB-C support, adjustable color temperature, longer battery life, and a larger, 6.8-inch display. Given the new e-reader hasn’t even launched — it’s set to arrive on October 27th starting at $140 — we have yet to see any discounts. Thankfully, you can still pick up the last-gen model, which is frequently available for far less than the standard retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkwzBt"&gt;The 2018 Kindle Paperwhite starts at $130 and comes in four different configurations: an 8GB Wi-Fi model, a 32GB Wi-Fi model, and a configuration of each that drops the ads from the lock screen. The Paperwhite features a 6-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get the Paperwhite over the base Kindle. The 2018 model also added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;As far as deals go, you can currently pick up the 8GB Kindle Paperwhite with ad support for $95 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxHjGSDlV6#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTCW9G7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free edition at Amazon for $115&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PP49ZDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxHnfba6HB#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are also selling the 32GB Paperwhite with ads for $110. Just like the base Kindle, Amazon is running a promotion where you can grab the e-reader plus three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. We also expect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;If you don’t mind paying for a leather case and a power adapter, Amazon has discounted its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HL49FCK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader bundle for $170&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKT4M5K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB reader with ads for $200&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a fan of Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy, Amazon also offers a bundle that includes a Kindle Paperwhite, a power adapter, and a Mockingjay-emblazoned cover. It’s currently available in two ad-supported configurations and colors: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB version for $160&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $190&lt;/a&gt;, both of which save you $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, 7-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. Unlike previous models, however, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the 32GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $200, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $250 at Amazon and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $250 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $270&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $280 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 without&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal list price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RNPKRKW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported configuration for $290&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RW2K1MD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $310&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hPPu8s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552599"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="4mZNi9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Magic Leap somehow raised $500 million to make another AR headset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w05BvxMDffSE4MUmEDUXm8wv32U=/457x0:984x351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69981458/ML_Teaser_Desktop.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.magicleap.com/en-us/news/op-ed/my-first-year-at-magic-leap-and-the-opportunity-ahead" target="_blank"&gt;Magic Leap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yqv66W"&gt;Magic Leap has raised $500 million in funding and is preparing to release a new AR headset, the Magic Leap 2, next year, the company &lt;a href="https://www.magicleap.com/en-us/news/news/magic-leap-raises-usd500-million-in-funding"&gt;announced Monday.&lt;/a&gt; The headset will be generally available next year, the company said, and “select customers” are using it as part of an early access program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1Bp1W"&gt;CEO Peggy Johnson said in a statement that with the new funding “Magic Leap will have greater financial flexibility and the resources needed to continue our growth trajectory as we expand on our industry-leading AR technology.” She revealed the new device in an Monday appearance on CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dhRQES"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeggyJ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@peggyj&lt;/a&gt; just revealed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MagicLeap2?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MagicLeap2&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CNBC&lt;/a&gt; - the industry’s smallest and lightest device. Built for enterprise, it is more immersive and comfortable, with the largest FOV, and dimming – a first-to-market innovation enabling use in brightly lit settings. &lt;a href="https://t.co/jSPUGd4P9N"&gt;https://t.co/jSPUGd4P9N&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/LVpUX6YfcW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LVpUX6YfcW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Magic Leap (@magicleap) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/magicleap/status/1447645627547017218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rq6x9j"&gt;Magic Leap, of course, is the company that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/21/7026889/magic-leap-google-leads-542-million-investment-in-augmented-reality-startup"&gt;began its existence as a mysterious AR startup&lt;/a&gt;, received almost &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/8/17662040/magic-leap-one-creator-edition-preview-mixed-reality-glasses-launch"&gt;$3 billion to fund its consumer-friendly AR headset,&lt;/a&gt; before changing its headset’s name from Magic Leap 1 to The Magic Leap One Creator Edition in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21003361/magic-leap-1-ar-headset-update-professional-business-customer-pivot"&gt;attempt to attract professional customers.&lt;/a&gt; The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21231236/magic-leap-ar-headset-layoffs-coronavirus-enterprise-business-shift"&gt;laid off 1,000 employees&lt;/a&gt; — roughly half its workforce — in 2020, and was reportedly abandoning its consumer business. Cofounder and CEO Rony Abovitz left the company in July 2020, and was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315864/magic-leap-new-ceo-microsoft-business-vp-rony-abovitz-step-down"&gt;replaced by Johnson. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCiRAB"&gt;In April, Johnson said limited quantities of Magic Leap’s second-gen headset, 20 percent lighter and with a doubled field of view, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395867/magic-leap-2-release-date-ceo-peggy-johnson-2021"&gt;would ship later this year&lt;/a&gt;. According to its statement Monday, the Magic Leap 2 will be the industry’s smallest and lightest device built for enterprise, “designed to increase business adoption of AR.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1WXLP"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.magicleap.com/en-us/news/op-ed/my-first-year-at-magic-leap-and-the-opportunity-ahead"&gt;separate post &lt;/a&gt;Monday, Johnson reflected on her first year as Magic Leap’s CEO. She cited a “growing demand for AR” across industries, and cited research from International Data Corp. (IDC) that showed the AR/VR market is expected to grow to $140 billion by the end of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4hm3w1"&gt;She listed the company’s enterprise customers, including Ericsson, and Farmers Insurance, the latter of which used the company’s tech to train new employees remotely during the pandemic. Johnson said Magic Leap has added strategic partnerships with Google Cloud, PTC, NVDIA, and VMWare&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qUoOF"&gt;Johnson said Magic Leap’s core business is focused on enterprise solutions, but added “there continues to be intense interest in the application of Magic Leap’s technology in the consumer space. In fact, we have received several requests to license our technology and will actively pursue these opportunities if they enhance our position and ability to innovate in the enterprise market.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC’s new Vive Flow headset reportedly launches this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O6OvdJ"&gt;HTC is planning to release a new VR headset this week and is also working on its own metaverse-like virtual world, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/htc-flow-hue-viveport-verse"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9m6ye1"&gt;Let’s start first with that new headset. It’s reportedly a standalone VR headset called the Vive Flow and is intended to be a media consumption device “with access to some casual gaming,” &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; says. However, it won’t ship with controllers and will be less powerful than the Oculus Quest 2, &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; reports. The Vive Flow will reportedly be announced at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vive.com%2Fus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F11%2F22721337%2Fhtc-vive-flow-vr-headset-vivport-verse-metaverse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HTC’s October 14th event&lt;/a&gt;, which would make sense, as HTC is &lt;a href="https://engagevr.io/go-with-the-flow/"&gt;promoting the event&lt;/a&gt; with the “Go with the Flow” tagline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kClC6m"&gt;The new metaverse space is apparently called Viveport Verse. According to a &lt;a href="https://metaverse-prod-1-app.viveportverse.com/"&gt;site about the service&lt;/a&gt; (which was live as of publishing this article), you’ll be able to make your own 3D avatar and explore “a variety of events,” but the space will also have an “NFT Showroom” and user-generated content “available soon.” You seemingly won’t need a VR device to visit Vivepoint Verse, though; the website says it will be compatible with desktop devices, laptops, mobile devices, tablets, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; VR headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlOROl"&gt;We’ve collected screenshots of the Viveport Verse website in the gallery below, in the event that HTC closes access to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="orWVah"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10802077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MX29SV"&gt;It’s unclear how this new Viveport Verse space would differ &lt;a href="https://sync.vive.com/"&gt;from the enterprise-focused Vive Sync&lt;/a&gt; experience. It seems like Viveport Verse could be more of a series of virtual worlds of many kinds, perhaps similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714876/facebook-horizon-worlds-creators-fund-social-vr-platform-metaverse"&gt;Facebook’s Horizon Worlds&lt;/a&gt;, as opposed to Sync’s virtual meeting spaces intended for work. &lt;/p&gt;
