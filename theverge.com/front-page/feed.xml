    <title>Johnson &amp; Johnson’s CEO joins Apple’s board</title>

  &lt;p id="TAypCN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/alex-gorsky-joins-apples-board-of-directors/"&gt;Apple has announced&lt;/a&gt; that Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s current CEO, Alex Gorsky, will join its board of directors. Gorsky’s move to Apple’s leadership team (he’ll &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/latest-news/johnson-johnsons-2021-third-quarter-earnings-report-what-you-need-to-know"&gt;step down from his role at J&amp;amp;J in January&lt;/a&gt;) comes at a time when the company is focusing even more on health and how it can make data more accessible to users and their doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5XdhP"&gt;In the press release announcing Gorsky’s role at Apple, Tim Cook calls him “a visionary in healthcare” who has a “passion for technology.” Apple hasn’t kept its ambitions in health a secret — the Apple Watch is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733073/smartwatch-wearable-health-impact-doctors"&gt;largely seen as a fitness device&lt;/a&gt;, and its users can &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/research-app/"&gt;contribute data to various studies&lt;/a&gt;. Recent updates to iOS and watchOS have brought new health features that make it easier to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22672388/health-app-apple-data-records-allscripts-cerner"&gt;share medical records with doctors&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527707/apple-health-data-eldery-falls-walking-privacy"&gt;family members&lt;/a&gt;. With Gorsky on the board, Apple could tap him for new feature ideas (such as what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;new sensors it could add to the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;) or use his expertise to add more integrations with the medical establishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="vQcTuz"&gt;Apple’s health efforts haven’t been without controversy, though. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22594178/apple-watch-data-research-heart-rate-reliability"&gt;Some medical researchers have said&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s lack of transparency into its algorithms to measure things like heart rate makes it difficult to use data from Apple Watches in research. There have also been reports from inside Apple that the health division &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710901/apple-health-clinic-data-misleading-culture"&gt;uses potentially misleading data to make product decisions&lt;/a&gt;, and employees also raised concerns about Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536623/apple-primary-care-project-data-watch-app"&gt;plans for a trial where it would act as a primary healthcare provider&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBdlcU"&gt;It’s possible that having someone with experience could help Apple navigate these potential hurdles and make the Apple Watch an even more powerful health tool (though Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551723/johnson-stop-selling-opioids-settlement-new-york-lawsuit"&gt;faced&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/"&gt;fair share of controversies&lt;/a&gt; since Gorsky &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/leadership/alex-gorsky"&gt;became CEO in 2012&lt;/a&gt;). It’s also possible that it’s more of a symbolic move to emphasize Apple’s focus on health — we’ll only be able to tell by seeing what Apple does with health in the future or if Grosky appears on stage at WWDC to talk about a collaboration between J&amp;amp;J and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Will these top Steam games support Steam Deck? We ask their developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ig2Syrva7PjGa4-kJJqpG7spCK8=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69953418/steam_deck.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5YP9VQ"&gt;Valve’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;$400 Steam Deck gaming handheld&lt;/a&gt; runs Linux, but it can play Windows games too. Many of them, anyhow! Some of the biggest games on Steam use anti-cheat software that doesn’t play nice with &lt;a href="https://www.protondb.com/"&gt;the Proton compatibility layer&lt;/a&gt; which lets Windows games work. That’s changing this year, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690670/epic-eac-anti-cheat-linux-valve-steam-deck-support-games"&gt;both Epic’s Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) and BattlEye&lt;/a&gt; confirming to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that support is on the way, and Epic says it takes “just a few clicks.” Valve says BattlEye support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22737127/valve-steam-deck-battleye-anti-cheat-pubg-dayz-r6-siege"&gt;is as easy as an email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6tiI3"&gt;But will game developers let their games take advantage? Not necessarily! We reached out to every developer of every top EAC and BattlEye game on Steam. Initially, only four of them gave us a definite yes, but it seems we’ve got at least one more on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxLTdw"&gt;Here’s the current status of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FsYmJH"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;7 Days to Die&lt;/em&gt; — No comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="24vKam"&gt;“We have no comment on it at this time. Our game is still in development. As we are still in Alpha, we are not ready to give a definitive yes or no at this time,” a spokesperson for developer The Fun Pimps tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sMkd7Y"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; — No answer yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2yC3Dk"&gt;“We’re checking with the Respawn team on this and will get back to you as soon as we have an update,” a rep told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on September 28th. We haven’t heard back since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nQA54a"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ark: Survival Evolved&lt;/em&gt; — Complete, November 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CZztMr"&gt;“Yes, we plan to update ARK settings to enable Battleye’s anti-cheat tweak for Steam Deck,” a Studio Wildcard rep told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. In November, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22737127/valve-steam-deck-battleye-anti-cheat-pubg-dayz-r6-siege"&gt;Valve revealed&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Ark &lt;/em&gt;had already gained support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W5cOel"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Black Desert&lt;/em&gt; — No answer yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VMR55I"&gt;“I’m checking with our devs right now and will get back to you with an answer asap,” a Pearl Abyss rep told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on October 3rd. We haven’t heard back since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rr8tEx"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;DayZ&lt;/em&gt; — Tentatively yes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rYBtGd"&gt;DayZ was originally a maybe, but the answer is now basically a yes. “If it’s all working as intended, we do mean to enable Battleye anti-cheat support for Proton/Linux,” a Bohemia Interactive rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying that the team wants to test and make sure the change won’t cause issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnzmnn"&gt;The original reply was less promising: “At this stage it’s a ‘maybe’ for us – we are still evaluating Proton as a whole and cannot yet commit to anything,” a rep told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OrdEIb"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dead by Daylight &lt;/em&gt;— Yes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GlnkzH"&gt;“I can confirm that we plan on updating our EAC to support the Steam Deck in the future, but we can’t confirm a release date at this time,” a Behaviour Interactive rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="b2aVjT"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; — No answer yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AnhvTI"&gt;“We’ve been trying to run this down. We don’t have anything to share right now, today, but we’ll keep at it,” a Bungie rep told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on October 3rd. We haven’t heard back since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="p0NUZv"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys &lt;/em&gt;— No comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uypZxD"&gt;Even though it’s owned by Epic Games, the company saying EAC support should take “just a few clicks,” Mediatonic would not commit to an update for &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AX1C6"&gt;“Thanks for reaching out but at this time we won’t be making a comment,” a Mediatonic rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jNGoyZ"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection &lt;/em&gt;— No comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i9zNhH"&gt;“I won’t have anything to share here, I’m afraid,” a rep for Microsoft tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TrLWit"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hunt: Showdown&lt;/em&gt; — No reply whatsoever&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wciYkG"&gt;Crytek didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="s8Ck0U"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Paladins&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Smite&lt;/em&gt; — Maybe, but not this year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jRnoR8"&gt;“We don’t currently have a timeline available but hope to provide such support in the near future,” a Hi-Rez Studios rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, adding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NhbGgd"&gt;While we have been actively doing some research on the topic, it is unlikely this support would happen by the Steamdeck launch in December. Even though our games do share some similarities, each one of them requires its own implementation that is significantly more delicate than changing some settings in the SDK. Hi-Rez is proud to have its games available on multiple platforms and consoles, so we hope to be able to provide such support in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="64yre1"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; — No comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HBEUje"&gt;“The team does not have a comment for this,” a rep for Krafton tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. We got no reply after reaching out again in November. &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; uses BattlEye, and Valve claims enabling it for Proton is as easy as sending an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jOGwGO"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Rainbow Six: Siege &lt;/em&gt;— No comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="N2bOky"&gt;“We don’t have anything to share at this time,” a Ubisoft rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. We got no reply after reaching out again in November. &lt;em&gt;R6 Siege&lt;/em&gt; uses BattlEye, and Valve claims enabling it for Proton is as easy as sending an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qWKf3u"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Rust&lt;/em&gt; — Yes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zttq2h"&gt;“Yeah we’re working on it. Hoping to be done by the time the Deck comes out, if not it’ll be really soon after,” Facepunch Studios founder Garry Newman tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qxevgr"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;War Thunder&lt;/em&gt; — Yes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4YOIKk"&gt;“Yes, we’re planning to do everything we can to make sure that War Thunder works on Steam Deck,” Gaijin Entertainment co-founder Anton Yudinsev tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUKY0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ll update this story as more top games offer a yes or no on support for anti-cheat on Linux/Proton generally, and the Steam Deck specifically. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9Nxze"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, November 9th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upgraded DayZ to a tentative yes, and pointed out the lack of reply from other developers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA delays ambitious human lunar landing to 2025</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KBFSpS6_6JKE4NQcpW4I8GS8bPQ=/375x0:4425x2700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70119095/for_press_release.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of SpaceX’s Starship lunar lander, developed in partnership with NASA, on the surface of the Moon&lt;/em&gt; | Image: SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tybViu"&gt;NASA is pushing back its target date for returning humans to the Moon, now eyeing a crewed lunar landing in 2025 instead of 2024 as originally planned. NASA blames the delay on recent lawsuits over contracts for the agency’s lunar lander, as well as changes to the scope of some of NASA’s programs and the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQKiyx"&gt;The space agency is eyeing a human lunar return with its flagship program, called Artemis. As part of the initiative, NASA hopes to land the first woman and the first person of color on the Moon this decade while working to figure out sustainable ways to live and work on the lunar surface. Artemis relies on a complicated suite of vehicles, including the Space Launch System, or SLS, a massive new rocket NASA has been developing for the past decade that’s designed to send people into deep space and near the Moon inside a new crew capsule called Orion. In April, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;NASA also granted a $2.9 billion contract to SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; to develop the company’s Starship vehicle to land people gently on the Moon’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pNjWJ"&gt;The 2024 landing date is a relic of the Trump administration, which also redirected NASA to return humans to the Moon and came up with the name for the Artemis program. In 2019, then Vice President Mike Pence &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282598/nasa-mike-pence-vice-president-space-policy-lunar-landings-2024-gateway-sls-orion"&gt;challenged NASA to speed up its timeline for Artemis&lt;/a&gt; and to land the first humans on the Moon for the program in 2024. Such an early target received intense scrutiny, with many critics &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/science/trump-moon-nasa.html"&gt;doubtful that NASA could make the date happen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dTfX3v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 2024 landing date is a relic of the Trump administration&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LTtgpD"&gt;For one, the SLS rocket has been continuously delayed throughout its lifetime. Originally slated to launch in 2017, the rocket’s debut flight is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740741/nasa-space-launch-system-february-2022-launch-orion-artemis-i"&gt;currently scheduled for February of 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, there is still plenty of technology that NASA needs to create to make a Moon landing happen, notably new space suits that the astronauts will wear on the lunar surface. Despite these issues, NASA leadership did not immediately do away with the landing date when the Biden administration took over. “It’s a stretch, it’s a challenge, but the schedule is 2024,” NASA administrator &lt;a href="https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2021/05/31/its-a-stretch-its-a-challenge-will-nasa-land-on-the-moon-in-2024/"&gt;Bill Nelson said in June&lt;/a&gt;. But Nelson promised to give an update on the Artemis timeline before the end of the year, and NASA finally admitted today that the 2024 goal wasn’t going to be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLZXdvHNxMmiXgdvUkWkbddc-Mg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23000224/Artemis_1B_Crew_InFLight_orig.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of NASA’s SLS rocket with an Orion crew capsule on top&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SgSQWO"&gt;Drama surrounding the lunar lander that is critical for taking people down to the Moon’s surface has exacerbated the problem further. NASA originally hoped to award contracts to two companies to build human lunar landers, to promote competition, and have more than one option. The agency even narrowed down the selection to three finalists: SpaceX, Dynetics, and the Jeff Bezos-run Blue Origin. But after receiving less funding than expected from Congress, NASA only awarded one contract to SpaceX, prompting Blue Origin to both protest and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763384/blue-origin-lawsuit-nasa-spacex-lost-human-lunar-lander-artemis"&gt;then file a lawsuit over the decision in federal court&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sR2mvB"&gt;That litigation played a significant role in the delay to 2025, NASA says, because it prevented the space agency and SpaceX from working together on the lunar lander project. “We’ve lost nearly seven months in litigation, and that rightly has pushed the first human landing, likely to no earlier than 2025,” NASA administration Bill Nelson said today during a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ULo8HN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;litigation played a significant role in the delay to 2025, NASA says&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B7skXu"&gt;Now, NASA has shifted the dates for its biggest launches under the Artemis program. The first launch is Artemis I, which NASA recently said would fly early next year. That flight will mark the debut of the SLS, which will carry an uncrewed Orion capsule around the Moon on a multi-week trip. It’s a major demonstration to show that the vehicles are safe and capable of carrying people. The next major flight is Artemis II, which will be similar but with people on board. NASA announced today that Artemis II wouldn’t launch until May 2024 at the earliest. Originally, NASA had hoped to fly it in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UlXCE4"&gt;Then, presumably, the lunar landing will happen sometime in 2025 at the earliest. NASA also announced today that there could be an uncrewed landing of Starship ahead of one with people on board. However, the agency did not offer details about how that would work, citing the lack of communication between SpaceX and NASA during the litigation. In the meantime, SpaceX has been hard at work building and developing Starship prototypes at its launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, as the company urgently works toward the first orbital test flight of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oKK66"&gt;Along with adjusting timelines, NASA also said it would be updating the costs for some of the Artemis programs, notably the Orion crew capsule. The original baseline development cost for the spacecraft was supposed to be $6.7 billion, but now NASA is adjusting that to $9.3 billion through its first crewed launch in May of 2024. NASA also said that the development cost for SLS will be $11 billion through its first launch on Artemis I, &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2020/08/26/eyes-forward-as-artemis-missions-set-to-begin-next-year/"&gt;up from an estimated $9.1 billion cited last year&lt;/a&gt;. The agency says it hopes to streamline SLS operations moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxdFgt"&gt;NASA blamed other factors for the delays and rising costs. In addition to the Blue Origin litigation halting the relationship between SpaceX and NASA, Nelson argued that the scope of the Orion project has increased over time and that COVID caused disruptions in the supply chain that have had an effect on production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bb5qXj"&gt;A lack of funding from Congress has also contributed to the delays. Last year, NASA had asked for $3.2 billion to jumpstart production of the human lunar lander in 2021 but only received a quarter of that request. And in addition to the funding, Nelson argued that “the Trump administration target of 2024 human landing was not grounded in technical feasibility.” It’s unclear how the 2025 landing is more grounded, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuBOWo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Unity to pay $1.6 billion for The Lord of the Rings VFX maker Weta Digital</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Legendary Pictures Preview And Panel - Comic-Con International 2014" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QMI0BingefSMaap0mRp9ctymoVA=/3x0:3947x2629/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70119089/452735254.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Albert L. Ortega/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zs8jqk"&gt;Unity, which makes the popular Unity game development engine, announced an intent to acquire the tools, pipeline, technology, and some engineering staff from Weta Digital, which is perhaps best known for its work on the &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; movies. Weta Digital was co-founded by &lt;em&gt;LOTR&lt;/em&gt; director Peter Jackson and has worked on huge entertainment franchises like &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Planet of the Apes&lt;/em&gt;, and many Marvel movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcZWMt"&gt;The deal is a major bid by Unity to bring powerful new tools to visual effects (VFX) teams, game developers, and other industries that rely on computer graphics. It’s also a big move to compete with Epic Games’ Unreal Engine, which has been used by Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145671/mandalorian-sets-stagecraft-epic-games-ilm-fortnite-baby-yoda-digital"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and by &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot Games for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21529317/league-of-legends-world-championship-high-tech-stage-riot-mandalorian"&gt;mixed reality esports stages&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Laml4t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;275 Weta Digital engineers will move to Unity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="62r8ut"&gt;Unity intends to purchase Weta Digital for $1.625 billion in cash and stock, and the deal is expected to close during Unity’s fourth quarter (which we are currently in), according to a &lt;a href="https://investors.unity.com/news/news-details/2021/Unity-Announces-Intent-to-Acquire-Weta-Digital/default.aspx"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. Two hundred seventy-five of Weta Digital’s engineers will move over to Unity, as will “dozens” of the company’s tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIwyhV"&gt;The VFX teams at Weta Digital aren’t included in the deal; instead, they will be part of a standalone entity called WetaFX that will still be majority owned by Jackson. Weta Digital is also entirely separate from &lt;a href="https://www.wetaworkshop.com/"&gt;Weta Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, which makes physical props and costumes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyuu6Z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ecobee’s new home security service has a professional monitoring option</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Ecobee SmartCamera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Gz1B8cxDi6wcYM9eB5u3WkJZJs=/360x0:2520x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118947/ecobee_SmartCamera_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ecobee&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iv0epS"&gt;Ecobee now gives you the option to pair its smart home monitoring devices with a professional security service. With the company’s new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-security%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F9%2F22772336%2Fecobee-smart-security-professionally-monitored-security-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Smart Security&lt;/a&gt; service, which replaces the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221291/ecobee-smartcamera-haven-security-platorm-smart-home-price-specs-features"&gt;Haven service it formerly offered&lt;/a&gt;, you can enable 24/7 professional monitoring (which is still in beta) for an additional $10 / month as a part of the Complete subscription plan. This price is half of what Ring now charges for its Pro plan that comes with a &lt;a href="https://ring.com/protect-plan-2"&gt;professional live monitoring service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNFbOi"&gt;Ecobee’s Smart Security service uses the &lt;a href="https://rapidsos.com/"&gt;RapidSOS&lt;/a&gt; emergency response platform to send crucial data to emergency responders. It relays your home’s entry and exit data to first responders, as well as any video and audio snippets captured by Ecobee devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MeEZVa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ecobee is offering a $5 / month Standard plan and a $10 / month Complete plan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YHJHGR"&gt;To get started with the Smart Security service, you’ll need Ecobee’s smart sensors for doors and windows, which you can purchase as a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Faccessories%2Fsmart-door-window-sensor%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F9%2F22772336%2Fecobee-smart-security-professionally-monitored-security-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bundle for $79.99&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221291/ecobee-smartcamera-haven-security-platorm-smart-home-price-specs-features"&gt;$99.99 SmartCamera&lt;/a&gt; also integrates with the service, as its optional video verification feature can send footage to monitoring centers whenever the camera detects the sound of a smoke alarm — if an emergency is confirmed, dispatchers may be able to send responders faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Fxc6c"&gt;If you don’t need live monitoring, Ecobee offers a $5 / month Standard subscription that comes with several other handy features (that are also included with the Complete plan). Aside from live monitoring, the Smart Security service can remind you to arm or disarm your house by using Wi-Fi and geofencing data to determine when you’re home. It will also send a notification to your phone when a door opens unexpectedly — Ecobee says that its system can tell the difference between your family members and an intruder, so you shouldn’t expect unnecessary notifications. You can check out the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-security%2F%23Compare-plans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F9%2F22772336%2Fecobee-smart-security-professionally-monitored-security-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full list of Smart Security features on Ecobee’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1gQDj"&gt;As far as privacy goes, Ecobee says that it “will never sell or misuse your data” and that it uses “extra security layers like two-factor authentication so your account is secure.” Ecobee also notes that its SmartCamera switches off when it detects that you and your family are home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uefuav"&gt;It’s important to keep in mind that some features only work with certain devices. The entire Smart Security suite makes use of Ecobee’s lineup of gadgets, all of which it sells — sans SmartCamera — in an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Fsolutions-exclusives%2Fefficiency-and-security-solution%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F9%2F22772336%2Fecobee-smart-security-professionally-monitored-security-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Efficiency and Security Solution bundle for $279.99&lt;/a&gt;. In case you want to add the SmartCamera with that bundle, expect to pay a total of $379.98.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpXAl4"&gt;If you don’t want to commit to $10 / month just yet, Ecobee is offering a free two-month trial.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FuboTV crosses 1 million subscribers six years after launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zmPmMdKC0ijJsp8R6F9esJ369Xk=/0x15:1844x1244/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118913/Screen_Shot_2021_11_09_at_5.00.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: FuboTV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mmt4Ek"&gt;Sports-focused streaming TV service FuboTV has surpassed 1 million subscribers, the company announced today. The news came as part of FuboTV’s &lt;a href="https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Reaches-One-Million-Subscribers/default.aspx"&gt;third-quarter financial earnings report&lt;/a&gt;: it ended Q3 with 944,605 subscribers but crossed the million figure after the quarter closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXveNr"&gt;“FuboTV’s achievement of hitting the 1 million subscriber mark since the third quarter ended is an extraordinary milestone by any measure but particularly remarkable given the momentum of our business over six short years,” said co-founder and CEO David Gandler. FuboTV is also highlighting its growth in revenue, advertising earnings, and viewing hours. The latter reached 284 million hours of streamed content during the quarter, up 113 percent year over year. In his letter to shareholders, Gandler said, “1 million subscribers means increased relevance, leverage and influence with content partners and leagues, and the opportunity to go upstream on tentpole sports properties.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4cfKV"&gt;“To put this in perspective, as of the end of the second quarter 2020, we had approximately 286,000 subscribers,” Gandler added. “And, even at the one million subscriber mark, we believe we are still just scratching the surface of the massive opportunity ahead of us with 72.6 million subscribers still active on traditional pay television.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyIbnl"&gt;Still, that FuboTV is just now hitting the all-important 1 million milestone shows how hard it can be to compete with streaming heavyweights and larger TV-centric services, like YouTube TV, Sling TV, and Hulu with Live TV. Rich Greenfield of &lt;a href="https://lightshedtmt.com/2021/09/27/is-comcasts-nbcu-fighting-a-losing-battle-with-googles-youtube-tv-the-industrys-largest-vmpvd/"&gt;LightShed Partners&lt;/a&gt; recently estimated that YouTube TV has around 4 million subscribers, making it the largest internet TV provider in the United States, followed closely by Hulu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ci9w4A"&gt;FuboTV’s channel bundles &lt;a href="https://www.fubo.tv/welcome?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fubo.tv%2Fwelcome%3Futm_source%3Dcommercial%26utm_keyword%3DTV%26utm_medium%3Ddirect%26utm_campaign%3DTV%26ftv_campaign%3DTV&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;start at $64.99 per month&lt;/a&gt;, which includes 116 channels, 250 hours of cloud DVR storage, and three concurrent streams. The top-tier Elite package increases that to 162 channels, 1,000 hours of DVR space, and 10 simultaneous streams. That starting price is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;the same as YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt; after the Google-owned service sharply raised its subscription rate in June of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toVz68"&gt;FuboTV also announced that it’s acquiring Molotov SAS, described as “France’s number one live TV streaming company,” and Edisn.ai, an AI company that specializes in video recognition. FuboTV says its tech will be used for “interactive experiences, personalization and platform stability.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workhorse’s new CEO admits the startup’s electric van is no workhorse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rK9kAKpWsUB8IDcekXAF_wHBbxk=/0x67:1600x1134/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118518/E3nZHe_XMAED9jF.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Workhorse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hyh33T"&gt;The new CEO of struggling EV startup Workhorse admitted Tuesday that he’s not sure the company’s C-1000 electric van can stand up to the kind of punishing work required by delivery companies. In other words, Workhorse’s EV isn’t a workhorse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYsdV8"&gt;“As I’ve talked to the big customers at UPS, FedEx, others, they expect to have these trucks last 15 to 20 years and go 15 to 20,000 miles a year and carry up to seven or 8,000 pounds of payload,” CEO Rick Dauch said during a revealing conference call about the company’s &lt;a href="https://ir.workhorse.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/185/workhorse-group-reports-third-quarter-2021-results"&gt;third-quarter financial results&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m pretty darn sure the C-1000 can’t meet those kind of stringent requirements. Okay? That’s the bad news.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oLd2L"&gt;More bad news? Not only does Workhorse have to redesign its flagship C-1000 delivery vehicle, but Dauch also said it might not be possible to salvage the van as a mass-production product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpKHWE"&gt;The good news, Dauch said, is that prospective customers have told him they will take “every C-1000 [Workhorse] can build in 2022 so they can start demonstrating to their teams and their customers in the field how an EV vehicle works versus an [internal combustion] vehicle.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NLZAb4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m pretty darn sure the C-1000 can’t meet those kind of stringent requirements.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iKirqW"&gt;Dauch believes there’s a lot of room for large electric commercial vehicles like the ones Workhorse has been developing — and, in fact, he said Tuesday that he’s been working with his new executive team to draft a refreshed product roadmap — but its best bet in the near term may be to sell demonstration vehicles to these apparently eager buyers. He said Workhorse has enough supplies on hand to build “somewhere north of 500 vehicles” in 2022 before it would need to bring in any new raw material. But even that’s only if Workhorse is able to fix the C-1000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9f26m"&gt;“If we can look each other in the eyes, and we can pass every single test, and we can make the modifications on the vehicles we’ve already built, and we can make those design changes on the next vehicles we build, then yes, we could probably do that, but we haven’t made that decision yet,” Dauch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgZ645"&gt;Still, he said, “we are a real company and not a PowerPoint EV company,” as he guided investors through the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDpV9v"&gt;Dauch took over as CEO of Workhorse in July, at a time when the EV startup was in disarray. It was racing to ship electric delivery vehicles that we now know &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688037/workhorse-suspends-delivery-recall-c-1000-electric-van"&gt;weren’t compliant with federal safety standards&lt;/a&gt;. It was building those vehicles with parts bought through online auctions and flown in from Asia, cementing their money-losing status. Even the factory in Union City, Indiana was surrounded by debris and unpaved roads, Dauch said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJWrHu"&gt;But now Dauch, who came from automotive supplier Delphi, has detailed a corporate exorcism he believes can save the struggling startup. He cleaned house at the leadership level. He recalled the unprofitable, non-compliant vehicles. He scuttled the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675630/workhorse-usps-mail-truck-bid-protest-dropped-oshkosh"&gt;costly legal fight over the lost bid to build the next-generation mail truck for the US Postal Service&lt;/a&gt;. He even paved the roads at the Union City plant. And now he wants Workhorse to “pioneer the transition to zero emission commercial vehicles.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="yZofCI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The startup faces twin investigations by the SEC and DOJ&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CgSUKM"&gt;“We’re taking the sometimes painful but necessary early steps to reshape our company to become a more focused and capable industry leader in the EV space,” Dauch said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvLeU5"&gt;Surviving, let alone leading, will be a challenge. Workhorse confirmed this week that it’s under investigation from both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765287/doj-investigation-ev-workhorse-accounting-fraud-short-seller-fuzzy-panda"&gt;regarding allegations of fraud&lt;/a&gt;. (The company says it’s cooperating with the probes.) Workhorse has to navigate all of this while massive players like General Motors and Ford and well-funded startups like Arrival and Rivian push into the commercial EV space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LiOmOr"&gt;One “painful” step Dauch described Tuesday was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688037/workhorse-suspends-delivery-recall-c-1000-electric-van"&gt;recalling all 41 of the C-1000s that Workhorse had delivered this year&lt;/a&gt; — a decision that cost the company at least $1.1 million in the short term, leaving it with &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; $576,000 in revenue for the quarter. (Workhorse posted an $81 million loss overall and has $230 million in the bank.) “Our current C-1000 vehicle design is not robust, nor is it profitable,” Dauch said on the call.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2IQcY"&gt;But the decision was necessary for two reasons, he explained. Most importantly, the C-1000s that went out to customers this year were not compliant with multiple Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). Certain parts of the electronics were not up to snuff. Neither were the windshield wipers and defogging system nor the lamps and reflective safety devices.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CMArn"&gt;“As a new startup company, we just weren’t experienced enough [around] some of the regulations and standards that we need to hold ourselves accountable to under FMVSS,” he said. While he expects Workhorse to be done putting the C-1000 through new testing by the end of the year, Dauch said he won’t put the van back on the road if it’s not safe. “I’m not going to jeopardize anybody’s life or any family’s lives on the road.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PxYtWr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dauch said the previous leadership team’s spending was “almost ludicrous”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRjCAv"&gt;Another “painful” step Dauch described Tuesday was cleaning shop at the executive and vice president level. That, too, was costly for the startup. Workhorse’s general and administrative expenses for the quarter were $4.6 million higher than compared to last year, in part because of severance packages for the people who got Workhorse into its current mess, including the former CEO, CFO, and vice president of finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rChZRS"&gt;Dispatching that team opened up room for Dauch to hire his own staff. He touted seven of them on the call, all men, most of whom have deep backgrounds in the automotive or related industries. And he said it would be up to them (and him) to rebuild Workhorse’s supply chain, retain customers while courting new ones, and chart a new course for the company’s products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xi7vj6"&gt;Dauch has made at least one decision since taking over that didn’t sound painful: abandoning the company’s lawsuit against the government, which it filed after it lost the contest to build the Postal Service’s next-generation mail truck. Workhorse was spending “a hell of a lot of money” on outside consultants, legal firms, and lobbying groups, Dauch said. In fact, he said Workhorse’s previous leadership team had been paying “five times more” for consultants than it would have been paying in-house employees for similar roles. “That’s just, like, almost ludicrous.” &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xz5fmuNae3GQgh_edef6Fhdj9Z4=/78x0:923x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118458/cover6.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s882xA"&gt;After an image of a Discord survey inquiring about users’ attitudes on NFTs went viral, social media erupted as people speculated if Discord would be the newest participant in the NFT scam race / gold rush. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKG1AK"&gt;It’s not... yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cX7IAR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Oh No &lt;a href="https://t.co/YEfVt8Xrwe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YEfVt8Xrwe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Scott (@textfiles) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1457751651465449475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UmaCsj"&gt;The image is from a &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210819000600/https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6469752/Discord-Web3-Survey"&gt;now-expired survey&lt;/a&gt; that was distributed in August of this year. Among questions about the participant’s knowledge of NFTs and whatever the hell Web3 means,  the survey asks open-ended questions about their favorite crypto Discord communities and what, if any, crypto-related problems Discord could potentially solve. According to a Discord spokesperson, the survey was only a fact-finding endeavor targeted specifically toward users active in cryptocurrency communities on Discord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfahrW"&gt;“We’re always exploring and hacking away at things we think will improve Discord for all the communities we serve,” a Discord spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This includes research that helps us learn about what people want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1z8KQ"&gt;So no, there will be no wumpus-themed NFTs hitting a Discord server near you anytime soon. Still, even the notion that Discord might be dipping its toes into the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22334527/nft-scams-artists-opensea-rarible-marble-cards-fraud-art"&gt;fetid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;NFT waters&lt;/a&gt; was enough to inspire backlash with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ironicsoap/status/1457929601385000961"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FiberFLIM/status/1457892473892577288?s=20"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/the_stinja/status/1457995396043575297?s=20"&gt;screenshots&lt;/a&gt; of their canceled Nitro subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4vMe3"&gt;Even if Discord isn’t making its own NFT yet, there does seem to be the possibility it might be planning or at least thinking about other blockchain integrations. In response to a &lt;a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/discord-imagine-a-place"&gt;Substack blog post&lt;/a&gt; discussing Discord’s potential as an NFT / Web3 powerhouse, Discord CEO Jason Citron posted a tweet featuring an image of what looks like some kind of Discord / crypto wallet integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yqbuAt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;probably nothing &lt;a href="https://t.co/p4P6MoNGgd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/p4P6MoNGgd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Citron (@jasoncitron) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1457841222995693570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hwaWbZ"&gt;The image is from an internal hackfest project and not necessarily indicative of a product currently under development, but Discord wouldn’t be the first gaming or gaming-adjacent company to participate in the byzantine blockchain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ellfgW"&gt;Blockchain video games are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725083/axie-infinity-sky-mavis-blockchain-economy-game-pokemon"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22655077/loot-social-network-open-source-nft"&gt;a thing&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems like every day there’s a new big gaming company — like &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ea-calls-nft-and-blockchain-games-the-future-of-our-industry/"&gt;EA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/11/01/ubisoft-reveals-plans-to-develop-blockchain-games-and-nfts"&gt;Ubisoft&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/square-enix-sounds-keen-on-nfts-and-blockchain-games-1848014388"&gt;Square Enix&lt;/a&gt; — announcing its involvement or teasing its interest in the cryptosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrFqjy"&gt;If your finger was hovering over the “cancel Nitro” button based on the perception that a Discord NFT / blockchain integration was in the works, you can ease up, but only a little bit. Discord did not respond to questions about whether it would offer cryto-based products in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is taking sign-ups for Relate, a voice assistant that recognizes impaired speech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google launched a new app called Relate, a voice assistant that recognizes impaired speech." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Is9kWCq8AkLMhhOofAQEnztcuoM=/0x0:3499x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118298/PROEJCT_RELATE_PRESS_IMAGE_005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google launched a new app called Relate, a voice assistant that recognizes impaired speech. | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ecMxCS"&gt;Google launched a beta app today that people with speech impairments can use as a voice assistant while contributing to a multiyear research effort to improve Google’s speech recognition. The goal is to make Google Assistant, as well as other features that use speech to text and speech to speech, more inclusive of users with neurological conditions that affect their speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHZtSS"&gt;The new app is called Project Relate, and volunteers can sign up at &lt;a href="http://g.co/ProjectRelate"&gt;g.co/ProjectRelate&lt;/a&gt;. To be eligible to participate, volunteers need to be 18 or older and “&lt;a href="https://ctspeechhearing.org/news/579626/Project-Relate-Beta-Looking-for-Early-Testers-.htm"&gt;have difficulty being understood by others.&lt;/a&gt;” They’ll also need a Google account and an Android phone using OS 8 or later. For now, it’s only available to English speakers in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. They’ll be tasked with recording 500 phrases, which should take between 30 to 90 minutes to record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vQkECw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Volunteers will get access to three new features on the Relate App&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y0FG7r"&gt;After sharing their voice samples, volunteers will get access to three new features on the Relate App. It can transcribe their speech in real time. It also has a feature called “Repeat” that will restate what the user said in “a clear, synthesized voice.” That can help people with speech impairments when having conversations or when using voice commands for home assistant devices. The Relate App also connects to Google Assistant to help users turn on the lights or play a song with their voices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gBjv5Z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EU2oCVlzEZk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L6tCPl"&gt;Without enough training data, other Google apps like Translate and Assistant haven’t been very accessible for people with conditions like ALS, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or Parkinson’s disease. In 2019, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535674/google-project-euphonia-live-relay-speech-recognition-disabilities-impairments-io-2019"&gt;started Project Euphonia&lt;/a&gt;, a broad effort to improve its AI algorithms by collecting data from people with impaired speech. Google is also training its algorithms to recognize sounds and gestures so that it can better help people who cannot speak. That work is still ongoing; Google and its partners &lt;a href="https://blog.lsvtglobal.com/project-euphonia/"&gt;still appear to be collecting patients’ voices separately&lt;/a&gt; for Project Euphonia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCUkn7"&gt;“I’m used to the look on people’s faces when they can’t understand what I’ve said,” Aubrie Lee, a brand manager at Google whose speech is affected by muscular dystrophy, said &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/project-relate/"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; today. “Project Relate can make the difference between a look of confusion and a friendly laugh of recognition.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWasuc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="FVW6gK"&gt;Earbuds have been the listening choice of many for ages, and sales of wireless earbuds took off when Apple removed the headphone jack of the iPhone 7 and released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, seemingly every brand under the sun, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22745711/palm-buds-pro-announced-pricing-features"&gt;some resurrected from the depths&lt;/a&gt;, have released true wireless earbuds. Some are small and cheap. Some are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation"&gt;big and expensive&lt;/a&gt;. Some have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;one-size-fits-most hard plastic designs&lt;/a&gt;. Some have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222930/apple-airpods-tip-replacements-for-sale-online"&gt;user-replaceable rubber tips&lt;/a&gt; that accommodate different size ears. But one thing that unites all earbuds is that, eventually, they get disgustingly gross, with a buildup of earwax and debris that can hinder sound quality and reduce overall volume output. As a result, you should take the time to clean them once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xh3C6Z"&gt;Here we go over some of the various ways you can clean your earbuds — encompassing hard plastic and soft rubber-tipped earbuds —  using basic tools and methods that anyone can feel comfortable using. Our goal is to get your earbuds nice and clean with minimal risk of damage. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QFrt_LR7-Dhc4RRo3N5r3XllRHY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22999013/adibenedetto_211108_4868_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different types of earbuds may require slightly different approaches and tools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="meQLJC"&gt;A small word of caution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PiLx2k"&gt;It’s important to keep in mind that most manufacturers advise cleaning earbuds with only a clean microfiber cloth or dry cotton swab. Instructions from major manufacturers like &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00086123/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208729"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; advise refraining from using rubbing alcohol or other liquids. A simple alcohol wipe might be fine for some surfaces if kept away from any speaker grills, mic holes, or charging ports — but it does present some dangers. If you try using any wet processes or cleaners, you do so at your own risk. And it may sound obvious, but it bears emphasizing: &lt;em&gt;never &lt;/em&gt;submerge earbuds or charging cases in any type of liquid to clean them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TciEXa"&gt;Starting with the basics &lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simple tools get the job done. Pictured: a bulb blower, brush, toothpick, putty, microfiber cloth, cotton swab, and spudger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h4buPC"&gt;A “less is more” approach is always the way to go when cleaning electronics. So let’s begin by going over the simplest and least risky ways of cleaning the buildup from most earbuds. Begin with the most basic cleaning tools and work your way up until the earbuds are adequately clean. There’s no need to get invasive with a toothpick if a puff of air takes care of it, right? Always start small before jumping to extremes, and use only what the job calls for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRyQyq"&gt;Many of the tools mentioned here are common household items. You can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cleaning-Accessories-Sanitize-Maintain-Earphones/dp/B08LDSDMW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cleaning kits for earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that have a lot of similar tools, but you may already have what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qf4fKf"&gt;Forced air&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="fJ9EmM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10855018"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JrBflp"&gt;While blowing air from your mouth into your earbuds might knock away some dust or flakey earwax, it will most likely be inadequate, and you could inadvertently deposit tiny bits of saliva onto something that goes in your ears — not exactly sanitary. Try the following tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XplzfI"&gt;A bulb / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Giottos-AA1900-Rocket-Blaster-Large/dp/B00017LSPI?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rocket blower&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="W6pO25"&gt;Canned air&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="oYcyez"&gt;For hard plastic earbuds, point the dirty speaker grills away from you and toward the floor. Try pointing the blower up and into the earbud speaker grills, away from your face. You want to prevent any debris from potentially flying towards your eyes (it doesn’t hurt to wear glasses or basic protective eyewear — nobody is going to judge you), and you also want gravity on your side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzdhm6"&gt;For earbuds with removable soft rubber tips, carefully slip them off and hold the tip toward the floor. Blow air into and through the opening in the earbud tip, pointing downward and away from you. Then flip them around and blow air through the other side before moving to the earbud itself and blowing out any debris that made it to the speaker grills. Once the rubber tips are removed, they become the only part of earbuds that you can safely clean with liquids. If you choose to clean the detached tips with water, let them dry overnight to ensure there is no remaining moisture before you put them back on the earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZb4AW"&gt;If this basic process is enough to blow away the debris and leave your earbuds looking clean enough, take a clean and dry microfiber cloth to all surfaces and polish away any remaining dirt. If the buildup is hardened and not budging, then keep your canned air or blower nearby while we get more invasive to try and break up the gunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLk0AO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t forget the charging case: &lt;/strong&gt;Forced air and a microfiber cloth will often be enough to clean out any dirt that gets transferred from wireless earbuds to its charging case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6AALuH"&gt;Toothpicks, cotton swabs, and more scraping and brushing tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="xa9qft"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10855050"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZYTVm"&gt;A puff of air is rarely enough for stuck buildup, especially if you have overly waxy ears (I’m here for you; and lordy, do I commiserate). The next stage is to use a small tool to break up the earwax or buildup of debris without risking damage. You are about to take a pick or probe to a piece of electronics, so practice some care and caution. Consider the following tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="v2tyYG"&gt;Cotton swab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UHIckM"&gt;Basic wood or plastic toothpick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3bz9Q1"&gt;Plastic spudger tool (akin to the ones &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FStore%2FTools%2FSpudger%2FIF145-002%3Fo%3D4&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759139%2Fearbuds-wireless-airpods-clean-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit includes with many DIY repair kits&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RMcULD"&gt;Wood skewer (typically used for food / cooking)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Hs12yw"&gt;Dry brush (toothbrushes are good, but never take any chances using them for dental care after this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BxAiFe"&gt;Pipe cleaner (the arts and crafts kind) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="eo1LKO"&gt;Note that we are choosing tools here that are soft (cotton, brushes) or firm but not too hard (wood, plastic), as metal might cause scratches or damage to the speaker grills or plastic shell of an earbud. As usual, we want to start with the least invasive and work our way up if it’s needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pw4q4X"&gt;For hard plastic earbuds, start with the cotton swab and try to break up and wipe away debris or wax in the speaker grills. Angle them downward to let gravity help your cause. If the swab is not strong enough, step up to a toothpick, spudger, or wood skewer and carefully break up the buildup embedded at the corners and edges of the speaker’s cavity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gApM0m"&gt;For soft rubber tips, the toothpick might be one of the best tools — it can fit through the hole of a detached earbud tip and scrape the inner wall. Be sure to also clean the exposed speaker with the cotton swab, brush, or toothpick if wax has been deposited on it. If your earbuds have a rubberized fin or comb to help secure their fit in your ear, these might be best cleaned with the toothbrush. A pipe cleaner can be very helpful for these soft rubber bits as well, but due to its metal rod core, it should not be used on much else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GWJl4"&gt;Once you break up the stubborn buildup, blow more air from a can or blower and see if that finally removes the debris. Take a polishing cloth to all the surfaces, and hopefully, you now have some adequately clean earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uF6U5V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Keep a water-dampened paper towel or sponge handy, and you can neatly wipe away all the gross stuff as it collects on your toothpick while minimizing the mess. Be prepared to clean your workspace after you’re all done, as you might be surprised how much debris comes out when doing a deep clean on long-neglected earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="03CKdm"&gt;The final tools for some hard-to-reach cleaning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="0mk6XH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10855127"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rDlk1G"&gt;If you broke up some of the dirt, but getting it out with forced air or a brush is proving tricky, there are a couple more tools to try. The following can be used in tandem with all the previously mentioned tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QxUXsT"&gt;Masking tape or painter’s tape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="koKEK0"&gt;Mounting putty or cleaning gel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HQMm8c"&gt;Vacuum with a small nozzle attachment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="3RUn4q"&gt;Using tape or putty to help pull out debris from deeper crevices can hopefully be all that you need to fully clean all the nooks and crannies of your earbuds. The adhesive of masking or painter’s tape is sticky enough to pick up dirt but light enough to not leave any residue on the surface like stronger tapes might. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMV9J3"&gt;If dirt is really deep in an earbud tip and hard to reach, the tape may not get to it. That’s where putty (the kind used in arts and crafts for safely mounting things to the wall) or a cleaning gel can come in. Warm up the putty by kneading a small amount of it in your hands, and roll it over the affected area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q4H5K8"&gt;At this point, the combination of all these tools should clean away most earbud gunk. Some especially dirty buds might require repeated and alternating use from a combination of air, scraper, and putty. The key is to work at it, little by little, until the earbuds are clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UyTxoT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10855183"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rJePg0"&gt;The more frequently you clean your earbuds, the less dirt and buildup there is and the fewer tools and elbow grease you need. If you prevent earbuds from getting too dirty, you ensure that they will last longer and hopefully be less prone to reduced sound quality or breakage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PunU3J"&gt;As often the case, a little preventative care can help save you from costly repairs or replacements down the road. So be sure to store your wireless earbuds in their charging case when not in use, shielding them from further buildup like pocket lint, and don’t forget to give them the occasional check and clean.&lt;/p&gt;
