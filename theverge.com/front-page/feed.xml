    <title>Windows 11 is free, but your CPU might not be supported</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QQpUpnDWQSbt55aIiPQFj1vLxQE=/116x0:1370x836/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69502861/Windows_11_Generic_Laptop_Device_Render.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L7vsFq"&gt;Windows 11 is arriving later this year as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546801/microsoft-windows-11-free-upgrade-details"&gt;free upgrade for Windows 10 users&lt;/a&gt;, but many are discovering that their hardware isn’t compatible. Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/22544171/microsoft-windows-11-system-requirements-hardware"&gt;altered its minimum hardware requirements&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s the CPU changes that are most surprising here. Windows 11 will only officially support 8th Gen and newer Intel Core processors, alongside Apollo Lake and newer Pentium and Celeron processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrt9yX"&gt;That potentially rules out millions of existing Windows 10 devices from upgrading to Windows 11 with full support, and even devices like Microsoft’s own Surface Studio 2 which the company is still &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-studio-2%2F8sbjxm0m58t4%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling right now&lt;/a&gt; for $3,499. Older devices that aren’t officially supported will be met with a warning during the Windows 11 install that the upgrade is not recommended, but the OS should still install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="am4rid"&gt;Windows 11 will also only officially support AMD Ryzen 2000 and newer processors, and 2nd Gen or newer EPYC chips. You can find the full list of &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/windows-processor-requirements"&gt;supported processors on Microsoft’s site&lt;/a&gt;, but here’s the basic breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UzWDlE"&gt;Windows 11 support for Intel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Xswych"&gt;Intel 8th Gen (Coffee Lake)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="opHkUr"&gt;Intel 9th Gen (Coffee Lake Refresh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="knGvT7"&gt;Intel 10th Gen (Comet Lake)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vI3HJk"&gt;Intel 10th Gen (Ice Lake)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vG0LFl"&gt;Intel 11th Gen (Rocket Lake)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OfQ4Fm"&gt;Intel 11th Gen (Tiger Lake)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lzPrMP"&gt;Intel Xeon Skylake-SP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="talq2h"&gt;Intel Xeon Cascade Lake-SP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="D06Cb1"&gt;Intel Xeon Cooper Lake-SP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="S5dmkj"&gt;Intel Xeon Ice Lake-SP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="epWTML"&gt;Windows 11 support for AMD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="27UF7s"&gt;AMD Ryzen 2000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TqZrrf"&gt;AMD Ryzen 3000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lDpGXg"&gt;AMD Ryzen 4000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2z1iPP"&gt;AMD Ryzen 5000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iJ1imG"&gt;AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="22SYjJ"&gt;AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YQqXDR"&gt;AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 3000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I4M2fP"&gt;AMD EPYC 2nd Gen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0RpWyu"&gt;AMD EPYC 3rd Gen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="bYqUqj"&gt;Microsoft notes that CPU generation requirements are a “soft floor” limit for the Windows 11 installer. That should allow some older CPUs to be able to install Windows 11 with a warning, but it’s not clear how these devices will be supported long term. We’ve reached out to Microsoft to clarify its CPU requirements and support, and we’ll update you accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTntjN"&gt;Many Windows 10 users have been downloading Microsoft’s PC Health App (&lt;a href="https://aka.ms/GetPCHealthCheckApp"&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;) to see whether Windows 11 works on their systems, only to find it fails the check. As Microsoft now requires a TPM (Trusted Platform Module), this has led to some additional confusion around hardware support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nA3Wgz"&gt;Windows 11 will require a TPM capable of at least 1.2 support, and UEFI Secure Boot. Both of these technologies are designed to improve the security of Windows, and prevent malware and ransomware from tampering with encryption keys and other secure elements of the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DnoyWS"&gt;While Microsoft has required TPM support for OEM hardware certification since Windows 10, it hasn’t actively required Windows to have this fully enabled. That’s changing in Windows 11, and it means if your laptop or PC shipped without these BIOS options enabled then you’re going to have to go searching for a setting to switch on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XVKmd_BfJNkhh3tJ7MMJwqAtbR0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680920/Windows_11_PC_Devices.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 has new hardware requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jHuvrO"&gt;“Almost every CPU in the last 5-7 years has a TPM,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dwizzzleMSFT/status/1408133909896777729"&gt;explains David Weston&lt;/a&gt;, director of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft. Weston is recommending that Windows 10 users failing Microsoft’s Windows 11 upgrade checker requirements should ensure BIOS options for “PTT” on Intel systems are enabled, or “PSP fTPM” on AMD devices. As every BIOS has different settings, you might need to refer to your laptop’s manual if you’re struggling to find the option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yKQ4H"&gt;If you’ve enabled TPM support but you’re still not passing the Windows 11 upgrade checker, it’s likely because your CPU isn’t on the fully supported list. Intel has confirmed Microsoft’s Windows 11 CPU requirements. “A broad range of Intel-based platforms are expected to support Windows 11: 8th Gen and newer Intel Core processors, as well as Intel Pentium processors and Intel Celeron processors from the ‘Apollo Lake’ generation and newer,” says an Intel spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jjo7XD"&gt;This is the first significant shift in Windows hardware requirements since the release of Windows 8 back in 2012, and the CPU changes are understandably catching people by surprise. Microsoft is also requiring a front-facing camera for all Windows 11 devices except desktop PCs from January 2023 onwards. It’s another change that will shape the hardware that Windows 11 will run on in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUFWRK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 5:45AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added details about Microsoft’s soft limit for the Windows 11 installer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Fi’s built-in VPN starts iPhone rollout</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t4NRncSpGNqJSxNtaMxhbkvtSZw=/0x0:843x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69502825/E4q9ctiWUAYxnIy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s announcement about Fi’s VPN coming to iPhone.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iov6xf"&gt;Google Fi’s VPN service has started rolling out to subscribers on iPhone, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/googlefi/status/1408146615140032512"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The feature, which routes your phone’s internet traffic through an encrypted connection to protect your privacy, has been available on Android since launching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18089834/project-fi-enhanced-network-vpn-privacy-google-announcement"&gt;in beta in November 2018&lt;/a&gt;. The launch comes a little later than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274588/google-fi-vpn-beta-android-launches-iphone-spring"&gt;Google’s previously announced&lt;/a&gt; “spring” release date, but it’s close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uregmP"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/googlefi/status/1408179070509142016"&gt;followup tweet&lt;/a&gt; Google says not all iPhone users will have access to the feature straight away, but that it will be widely available “over the coming weeks.” To turn the feature on, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/24/google-fi-vpn-iphone/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that you should make sure your Fi companion app is updated to the latest version, and then head to “Phone Settings” in the main Account tab. From there go to “Privacy &amp;amp; security,” where there’ll eventually be a “Protect your online activity” option to enable. The VPN is included with all Google Fi plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YV6zv7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting today, we're expanding our built-in VPN to iPhone®.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the Fi VPN, you get a private online connection and more protection from hackers included on all plans. Learn more → &lt;a href="https://t.co/TABM9FSYFB"&gt;https://t.co/TABM9FSYFB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/WVfTlcpTRO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WVfTlcpTRO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google Fi (@googlefi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/googlefi/status/1408146615140032512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CdS5rZ"&gt;The arrival of Google Fi’s VPN on iOS comes as Apple is gearing up to launch a similar privacy-protecting feature as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;iCloud Plus subscription service&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s version, which it’s calling Private Relay, routes your web traffic through a pair of relay servers to protect your sensitive information. It’s designed in such a way so that not even Apple itself has a complete picture of your browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is testing a desktop posting feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f88aHUW3kIp5vsonrnILMN3WRco=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69502691/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UXKMyW"&gt;Instagram is testing the ability to create posts using the web browser on a desktop computer. The feature was spotted by social media consultant Matt Navarra, who captured some &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1408068647025664025"&gt;screenshots&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating the functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57ldfT"&gt;Facebook confirmed the test in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-24/instagram-tests-letting-users-post-to-feeds-from-desktop"&gt;to Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. “We know that many people access Instagram from their computer,” spokesperson Christine Pai said. “To improve that experience, we’re now testing the ability to create a Feed post on Instagram with their desktop browser.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wBlAXL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NEW! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Instagram&lt;/a&gt; lets you create + publish posts via desktop! &lt;a href="https://t.co/JWzwKg1kyO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JWzwKg1kyO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1408068647025664025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q8nQgF"&gt;Navarra’s screenshots show that you’re able to select aspect ratios, apply built-in filters, and use basic editing parameters within the browser. The feature isn’t appearing for everyone yet, but it’s highlighted in the top right of the screen with a message saying “Now you can create and share posts directly from your computer,” suggesting Instagram is serious about a broader rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIhhlk"&gt;Instagram has been historically slow to implement features on its web app, particularly on desktops. Direct messaging only became available &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21215449/instagram-dm-web-browser-update-direct-message"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, for example. But social media professionals who use Instagram as part of their daily workflow have had to resort to third-party tools to create posts on desktops, showing that some use cases don’t necessarily benefit from a mobile-only approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="q4XrlE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Instagram on desktop is better than mobile, change my mind","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/23/17157618/instagram-desktop-browser-mobile-app"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>This Google Contacts redesign is starting to look a bit like Google Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vT5XgtI5h61KlY_CK4rJazEC7Dc=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69502435/gcontacts_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XEH98m"&gt;While Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates"&gt;previews its next OS&lt;/a&gt;, Google is &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/06/update-google-contacts-experience.html"&gt;displaying a new look for Contacts&lt;/a&gt;. According to the company this Circles-style extra information is “a new experience for Google Contacts which will help Google Workspace users learn more about their colleagues.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxpwF9"&gt;In practice, it displays your organizational chart as a part of the Contacts UI as well as your history with a particular person, including both emails and meetings. Keeping things cleanly organized in order to “easily learn more about your colleagues and stakeholders” sounds good. The only problem is that something makes it feel one step away from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/06/28/google-launches-social-layer-google"&gt;bad old days of the early 2010s&lt;/a&gt;, when Google forced Google Plus sorting and feeds onto everyone. Events spam and “Email from Google Plus” were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17952604/google-plus-user-profiles-forced-youtube-gmail-search"&gt;just some of the lowlights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SoAOTn"&gt;There’s no indication that this model is coming to personal accounts, just to Workspace users and G Suite accounts of various levels over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="789TEh"&gt;As for the actual Google Plus, that ended in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/10/18134541/google-plus-privacy-api-data-leak-developers"&gt;privacy breaches&lt;/a&gt; and Congressional investigations before the entire thing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21281409/google-plus-currents-gsuite-july"&gt;rebranded as Currents&lt;/a&gt;, a product that some people still find useful.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Unplug your WD My Book Live, or you might find your drive’s data wiped</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Picture of the NAS with the text “Put your life on it”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e_bs_kf2smwyBe1e90DkPu98lW8=/0x85:1024x768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501942/WD.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://products.wdc.com/library/AAG/ENG/4178-705202.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;WD product overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4tdizQ"&gt;If you own a WD My Book Live NAS, you should immediately disconnect it from your network — users have discovered that their data has seemingly been deleted off the device, with no action on their part (&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/mass-data-wipe-in-my-book-devices-prompts-warning-from-western-digital/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href="https://community.wd.com/t/action-required-on-my-book-live-and-my-book-live-duo/268147"&gt;a post on its community forum&lt;/a&gt;, WD says that the data loss appears to be the result of “malicious software,” and advises any My Book Live or My Book Live Duo owners to disconnect their devices from the internet to protect their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxKiEm"&gt;Some users &lt;a href="https://community.wd.com/t/help-all-data-in-mybook-live-gone-and-owner-password-unknown/268111/19"&gt;on WD’s forum&lt;/a&gt; report that their devices appear to have been factory reset, while others report seeing &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wd-my-book-nas-devices-are-being-remotely-wiped-clean-worldwide/"&gt;a page requesting a password they don’t know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cw6GnB"&gt;In most cases, those who have been affected say that all of the data on the device appears to be gone, with their file structure either remaining intact, but with empty folders, or no folders at all except the ones that come by default on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0lkbJ"&gt;We’ve reached out to WD to ask for comment, and we’ve explicitly asked whether the company will offer data recovery services to affected users, but we haven’t yet gotten a response. The company sent statements to both &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wd-my-book-nas-devices-are-being-remotely-wiped-clean-worldwide/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BleepingComputer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/mass-data-wipe-in-my-book-devices-prompts-warning-from-western-digital/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which largely mirrored &lt;a href="https://community.wd.com/t/action-required-on-my-book-live-and-my-book-live-duo/268147"&gt;its community post&lt;/a&gt;, saying that WD is investigating the incident, and doesn’t believe its servers were compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZaDnTb"&gt;Microsoft can add &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/24/microsoft-closes-above-2-trillion-for-first-time"&gt;ending the day as a $2 trillion company&lt;/a&gt; to the list of things it’s accomplished today, alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates"&gt;announcing Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. That makes it the second American publicly traded company ever to have a market capitalization of over $2 trillion (the other member of the club being Apple, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;which achieved it in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/22/tech/microsoft-2-trillion-market-cap/index.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;CNN Business&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkPpPq"&gt;It’s easy to see how 2020 contributed to Microsoft’s success: the PC market &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;grew by over 10 percent in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, according to estimates from IDC and Canalys, and seems &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380920/pc-market-q1-growth-year-over-year-chip-shortage-covid-demand"&gt;to have kept some of that momentum&lt;/a&gt; this year. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334725/microsoft-q4-2020-earnings-azure-surface-xbox-gains-growth-profits-sales"&gt;also saw success&lt;/a&gt; with with its Surface devices, Xbox content, and cloud services — the company says its Intelligent Cloud segment &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2FInvestor%2Fearnings%2FFY-2020-Q4%2Fsegment-revenues" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;brought in $48 billion alone&lt;/a&gt; in its 2020 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQifFL"&gt;There’s also, of course, the aforementioned announcement of Windows 11, which could drive upgrades for people whose computers don’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/22544171/microsoft-windows-11-system-requirements-hardware"&gt;meet the minimum requirements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krLdwQ"&gt;The company’s market cap briefly rose above $2 trillion &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/22/tech/microsoft-2-trillion-market-cap/index.html"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, but it had fallen ever so slightly below the mark by the time markets closed. Today, Microsoft was able to make it to market closing with a cap of $2.009 trillion, &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit recovers from major outage </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQ2APLAogSFb5qS1A8E_IMBtVnM=/81x67:1151x780/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501469/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_3.20.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit’s error page.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Reddit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y7awr5"&gt;Reddit was down for many on Thursday, but the company has implemented a fix and the site seems to be working normally. While the outage was going on, Reddit would regularly take a while to try to load a page before showing an error screen with error code 503. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ic34n1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.redditstatus.com/"&gt;On its status page&lt;/a&gt;, Reddit first reported an “elevated level of API errors” at 5:04PM ET Thursday, but &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/reddit/"&gt;Downdetector showed&lt;/a&gt; a huge spike of user reports of problems shortly after. (At their peak, reports surpassed 40,000.) At 6:51PM ET, Reddit said a fix was being implemented, and at 7:18PM ET, &lt;a href="https://www.redditstatus.com/incidents/3710db57k6n8"&gt;Reddit said the fix was in place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wsB15vpWmM5q38QVVMsRqxBOWAo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680198/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What you might see when you try to load Reddit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="305erl"&gt;During the outage, the company also took to Twitter to assure users that its “team of Technical People” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Reddit/status/1408196051241029635"&gt;was working on the issues&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1BTTbp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sounds like some of you are experiencing issues accessing Reddit — fear not, our team of Technical People is working on it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pls don't shoot the messenger,&lt;br&gt;social media manager&lt;/p&gt;— Reddit (@Reddit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Reddit/status/1408196051241029635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PyBz3n"&gt;Reddit didn’t reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRiMky"&gt;This isn’t Reddit’s first recent outage — the site went down for almost an hour &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419545/reddit-partial-outage-down"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;. And Reddit was also taken down by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523953/twitch-reddit-down-fastly-outage-issues"&gt;huge global web outage in June&lt;/a&gt; that also affected sites like Amazon, Twitch, and even us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;That outage was caused by issues with the Fastly content delivery network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vt47U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 24th, 7:41PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Reddit says the outage has been fixed, so we have updated this article accordingly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is supporting AMD’s answer to DLSS on Xbox consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KrgnTG4QrlAonCramQjA-0lTbuI=/142x0:1650x1005/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501671/xboxamdfsr.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fpJH50"&gt;Microsoft is enabling Xbox developers to utilize AMD’s answer to Nvidia’s DLSS on console games. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545441/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-tests-benchmarks"&gt;FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) appeared recently&lt;/a&gt; on Windows PCs with the aim of boosting frame rates and maintaining image quality. It’s AMD’s answer to Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and early tests have shown it’s a promising technology that will work across multiple games and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9HLxp"&gt;FSR is now making its way to Xbox games, too. Microsoft has started previewing support for FSR in its Game Development Kit for both Windows and Xbox today. “It’s supported on Windows, Xbox Series X and S, and Xbox One consoles,” says Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s director of Xbox program management. “FSR was designed to enable developers to achieve higher frame rates and resolutions with minimal work for developers across both console and PC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bScrVg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Excited to continue our close partnership with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AMD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AMD&lt;/a&gt; and see what game developers can do with FidelityFX Super Resolution, available to preview in our GDK today for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Windows?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Windows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Xbox&lt;/a&gt; Series X|S and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxOne?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#XboxOne&lt;/a&gt; consoles. &lt;a href="https://t.co/A446cNRUug"&gt;pic.twitter.com/A446cNRUug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Ronald (@jronald) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jronald/status/1408156048179879936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DYb95m"&gt;The preview means it will be a while until Xbox games can take advantage of higher frame rates with FSR, but we’d expect to see it appear once Xbox games can be fully certified with FSR support. That’s likely to be some months away yet, so realistically we won’t see FSR appear in Xbox games until later this year or even early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="daAmA7"&gt;Still, it’s encouraging to see Xbox support FSR early on. We reached out to AMD to clarify when this will be coming to PS5, but AMD isn’t commenting on that yet. Given the wide support across both AMD and Nvidia GPUs on PC, we’re fully expecting to see FSR appear on PS5 at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDdkNR"&gt;Sony’s PS5 is currently lacking VRR or 1440p support on the PS5, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;long-awaited M.2 SSD slot&lt;/a&gt; still hasn’t been enabled, so FSR support could be on Sony’s list of things to do. Sony has opened up a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538335/sony-ps5-beta-software-system-features-sign-up"&gt;PS5 beta program&lt;/a&gt; ahead of its next major system update, so fingers crossed we hear more about FSR support or the other missing PS5 features soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Thermapen One promises to make the best meat thermometer even better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NBID9YftBCio6HIqabguTCZFVOY=/208x0:2197x1326/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501379/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_5.19.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZdZfdl"&gt;The ThermoWorks Thermapen is legendary among chefs as the gold standard in kitchen thermometers, affording the fastest and most reliable temperature readings around. And today, the company has revealed its latest model: &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thermoworks.com%2Fthermapen-one%3Fquantity%3D1%26color%3D16&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F24%2F22548839%2Fthermoworks-one-meat-thermometer-faster-grilling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $105 Thermapen One&lt;/a&gt;, which promises to achieve even faster temperature readings: less than a second (hence the name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTafjq"&gt;ThermoWorks says the new thermometer is the only sub-second instant-read thermometer that can take a “full temperature reading” — technically five full readings in order to reduce uncertainty — without using estimations or predictive algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bd8HEP"&gt;The company says it spent more than five years developing the new thermometer, which features an improved thermocouple system developed in conjunction with Electronic Temperature Instruments to balance the faster speed with the delicate electronics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k6UbSc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wjyNBPPDN1s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YvVVBz"&gt;In addition to the faster sensor, the Thermapen One also adds a few quality-of-life features, including a brighter backlight that’s better at adapting to ambient light and a redesigned battery door that’s easier to open (which does still require a screwdriver to maintain its IP67 water resistance, something that’s important given that it’s meant to be used in kitchens). It also has a longer five-year warranty, which is good to see given its relatively expensive price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3Tqh0"&gt;Admittedly, the Thermapen One is probably overkill for most home chefs; ThermoWorks offers a cheaper $35 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thermoworks.com%2FThermoPop%3Futm_source%3Dgoogle_shopping%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjw2tCGBhCLARIsABJGmZ71CgKqvS0azm5AfBNQsrAmG9sIXHsOFXJU8hnOCchkydwJ9gxPYCMaApq4EALw_wcB&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F24%2F22548839%2Fthermoworks-one-meat-thermometer-faster-grilling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Thermopop thermometer&lt;/a&gt; that can achieve readings in a comparatively glacial three to four seconds. But if you’re the kind of chef who really needs to-the-second or absolutely accurate temperature readings, the new Thermapen One seems like a great option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIvUnP"&gt;The Thermapen One renders the old Thermapen Mk4 obsolete, and it will be sold at a slightly higher $105 price point. If you’re a chef on a budget who can tolerate ever-so-slightly longer speeds, the company is selling out the rest of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thermoworks.com%2FThermapen-Mk4%3Fquantity%3D1%26color%3D16%26utm_source%3Dgoogle_shopping%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjw2tCGBhCLARIsABJGmZ5y7bUdnnkyOayQ47wUPobhwDz2Pk5OOoS8E_4uGXldqiqlSjWD4dsaAr3hEALw_wcB&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F24%2F22548839%2Fthermoworks-one-meat-thermometer-faster-grilling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mk4 models at a discounted $69 price&lt;/a&gt;. Preorders for the Thermapen One start today, with shipping starting in mid-July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5dSRQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new battery door does still require a Philips-head screwdriver to replace the AAA battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Baltimore spy plane program was invasion of citizens’ privacy, court rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fh6MOCVnn-PokR65GjPMsxxey1s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501249/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fN6L0i"&gt;The city of Baltimore’s spy plane program was unconstitutional, violating the Fourth Amendment protection against illegal search, and law enforcement in the city cannot use any of the data it gathered, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680040/fourth_circuit_decision_baltimore_june_24_2021.pdf"&gt;a court ruled Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The Aerial Investigation Research (or AIR) program, which used airplanes and high-resolution cameras to record what was happening in a 32-square-mile part of the city, was &lt;a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-plane-canceled-20210203-ha3ixtgiyfg4rpgmfftrsd6uwu-story.html"&gt;canceled by the city &lt;/a&gt;in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKTCqd"&gt;Local Black activist groups, with support from the ACLU, sued to prevent Baltimore law enforcement from using any of the data it had collected in the time the program was up and running. The city tried to argue the case was moot since the program had been canceled. That didn’t sit well with civil liberties activists. “Government agencies have a history of secretly using similar technology for other purposes — including to surveil Black Lives Matter protests in Baltimore in recent years,” the ACLU said in a &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/federal-appeals-court-rules-baltimore-aerial-surveillance-program-unconstitutional"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j58UDW"&gt;In an en banc ruling, the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit found that “because the AIR program enables police to deduce from the whole of individuals’ movements, we hold that accessing its data is a search and its warrantless operation violates the Fourth Amendment.” Chief Judge Roger Gregory wrote that the AIR program “is like a 21st century general search, enabling the police to collect all movements,” and that “allowing the police to wield this power unchecked is anathema to the values enshrined in our Fourth Amendment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="er7D1l"&gt;The AIR program was run by a company called Persistent Surveillance Systems &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9a3nyp/baltimore-police-cant-explain-why-their-all-seeing-spy-planes-were-kept-secret"&gt;with funding from two Texas billionaires&lt;/a&gt;. The city police department admitted to using planes to surveil Baltimore residents in 2016 but approved a six-month pilot program in 2020, which was active until October 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMTJPu"&gt;City authorities said the AIR program was meant to help stem violent crime, and a district court had ruled that the program was capable only of short-term tracking and that people weren’t necessarily identifiable in the images collected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nonpf4"&gt;But the Fourth Circuit majority said that assessment wasn’t accurate and said since the AIR program “opens ‘an intimate window’ into a person’s associations and activities, it violates the reasonable expectation of privacy individuals have in the whole of their movements.” The court added that the AIR program surveillance “transcends mere augmentation of ordinary police capabilities. People understand that they may be filmed by security cameras on city streets, or a police officer could stake out their house and tail them for a time.... But capturing everyone’s movements outside during the daytime for 45 days goes beyond that ordinary capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5uBLX"&gt;Plaintiff Dayvon Love, director of public policy for Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, said in a statement Thursday that his organization had maintained that aerial surveillance isn’t a legitimate or effective means for making Baltimore’s communities safer. “We have always sought to challenge the racial imbued ideology of police-ism: the belief that all urban problems must be addressed primarily or exclusively through the lens of policing,” Love said. “And we are gratified that Chief Judge Gregory saw the importance of that challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;
