    <title>Maker of expensive Japanese toaster gets into smartphone business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Balmuda, the $230 Toaster From Japan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NeCaoMZFTxhN_weahLHvEaIx1uQ=/0x46:4000x2713/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69285400/544949442.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZjDnaN"&gt;Balmuda, a Japanese design company known for its stylish appliances, has &lt;a href="https://www.balmuda.com/jp/news/997"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; plans to make a smartphone. There aren’t many details on the device itself yet, but it’ll be a 5G handset that’s expected to be released in November. SoftBank will sell it as a carrier model, while Balmuda will also offer an unlocked version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFJ85s"&gt;In its announcement, Balmuda notes that since the smartphone business is getting increasingly commoditized, the company wants to provide an experience that only it can. However, the actual manufacturing is out of Balmuda’s wheelhouse, so it’s partnering with Kyocera on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AVbR7V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Balmuda’s toaster sells for about $235 in Japan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X1ePyZ"&gt;Balmuda has a fairly limited product line for the home including air purifiers, humidifiers, lights, speakers, rice cookers, and so on. Its best known product is a toaster called “Balmuda The Toaster,” which sells for 25,850 yen (about $235, though it’s &lt;a href="https://store.moma.org/for-the-home/kitchen-dining/cookware-kitchen-tools/balmuda-the-toaster/13327.html"&gt;available in the US for $329 through the MoMa Design Store&lt;/a&gt;) and uses steam to ensure your &lt;em&gt;shokupan&lt;/em&gt;, among other things, is perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-03/meet-balmuda-the-230-toaster-from-japan"&gt;Bloomberg reported five years ago&lt;/a&gt; that it had become a cult hit in Japan with a three-month waiting time to buy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUPHwg"&gt;I have the toaster, and while I’m not sure I would necessarily recommend anyone spend $235 or $329 on a toaster, it is a pretty great toaster. The neat design touches everywhere, from the tiny little mug you use to pour in water for the steam to the cute noises it makes when you turn the timer dial, do make me somewhat curious as to what Balmuda could bring to a phone. We’ll let you know when we find out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: You can probably try Gmail’s new integrated Chat now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P14BxuI2sK11K_SuXYbnHxKOrRo=/0x18:1458x990/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69284576/Mobile_Nav_3x.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sK6iP2"&gt;Google is rolling out the ability to access Chat messages right from Gmail to more iOS and Android users, after introducing it as a feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325966/google-gmail-g-suite-chat-rooms-meet-integration-redesign"&gt;for Google Workspace users last July&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/12/new-gmail-chat-turn-on/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9To5Mac-MacAllDay+%289+to+5+Mac+-+Apple+Intelligence%29"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It’s still a test feature, so getting access to it can take a bit of work, and it may not be available to your depending on your account settings (my colleagues and I were able to enable it on personal accounts, but not our work accounts). If you can get it working, though, you’ll be rewarded with a new tab at the bottom of the Gmail app, giving you access to your IMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cRr2O"&gt;To enable the feature on iOS or Android, open the side menu and scroll down to Settings. If you have multiple accounts, select the one you want, then look for “Chat (early access)” under General. Flipping the toggle will turn it on (after you restart the app). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/myInyqSBw0RxOXNDRES_MLjFxHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513368/IMG_1485.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning on the Chat toggle will give you access to personal and group chats in Gmail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JpGmJb"&gt;If you don’t see the Chat option, you may need enable it in the desktop version of gmail first, by going to &lt;a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/chat"&gt;https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/chat&lt;/a&gt;, then selecting Google Chat in the Chat menu. After restarting the Gmail app on your phone, the toggle should appear.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ElNNixbkurFdVf-bOG5Ktl0KJHM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513366/Screen_Shot_2021_05_13_at_5.02.35_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You may have to enable Chat on desktop before you can get it on your phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nwNraD"&gt;Chat is Google’s replacement for Hangouts, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517929/google-hangouts-chat-messaging-free"&gt;has slowly been moving users away from&lt;/a&gt;. Chat’s also available as a separate app, but if you’re the type of person who doesn’t like having a ton of messaging apps on your phone, having it just exist as a tab in Gmail could be your kind of thing (especially if you live in email all day).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OEtg8em2_F0JhkX-qEMlmNU-O78=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513384/IMG_1484.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pretty much just like having the chat app, but in Gmail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Epic fights Apple in court by playing Candy Crush</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u8aRSHJWu3EzAMytScMEO_0QAso=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69284564/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Expert testimony continues&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ITuW5D"&gt;Sometimes I reflect on my life and wonder where I went wrong, such that I am sitting on a wooden pew in federal court, watching a Google search for &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush Saga&lt;/em&gt; on the display monitor. This is a huge trial with major stakes for tech companies. It is also a crashing bore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMGhIJ"&gt;On the stand is Lorin Hitt, professor of operations, information, and decisions at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton, looking uncomfortable behind his face shield. During his direct examination in the ongoing &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;trial, Hitt testified that he didn’t think having to access an app like &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; through a browser instead of the app counted as “friction” for the user — and that it certainly was less friction than “real-world” alternatives, such as leaving a convenience store and then crossing the street to go to another convenience store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vFugkD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s what is called a ‘fake game.’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LKjeSv"&gt;The point of Hitt’s earlier testimony was that game developers “multi-home” games to PC and mobile. He’s Apple’s expert witness, and he is here to convince the judge that being blocked from the App Store isn’t a huge barrier to developers. Epic — whose game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is in fact blocked from the store — has taken Apple to court to show otherwise. And the picture Hitt painted on his direct examination was largely dismissive of Epic’s concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01wGSx"&gt;Epic attorney Yonatan Even, also in a face shield, is now doing his best to blow a hole in Hitt’s testimony. I am doing &lt;em&gt;my b&lt;/em&gt;est to follow a confusing spreadsheet that includes games that Hitt has promised are on both PC and mobile phones. Even begins by pointing out some of these games are not, in fact, available for PC. One game, &lt;em&gt;Words Story&lt;/em&gt;, is listed as available on PC on the document, but does not say this on the developer’s website. In the Microsoft store, a “&lt;em&gt;Words Story&lt;/em&gt;” with the same art exists, but it’s not the same developer. “Sir, this is not the same developer and not the same game, is it?” Even says. “It’s what is called a ‘fake game.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQKGdE"&gt;We go through this tiresome process for several games: &lt;em&gt;Helix Game&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crowd City&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BitLife&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Happy Glass&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Paper.io 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Mr. Bullet&lt;/em&gt;. I have never heard of any of these small-potatoes games, which makes them sort of a weird point of comparison for the most popular game in the world. The app developer pages suggest they are not available on PC, despite Hitt’s document to the contrary. Things are getting contentious, and Hitt is beginning to have a hang-dog “Rick Moranis in &lt;em&gt;Honey I Shrunk the Kids&lt;/em&gt;” vibe. Did Hitt double-check the data to make sure it was the same developer across stores? Can he tell the court under oath that a certain app is from the same developer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sZNdr"&gt; “Can you give the court sworn testimony that you have seen with your own eyes that this game is also available on PC?” Even asks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgUssh"&gt;Hitt can’t guarantee all the games listed in the unintelligible spreadsheet are from the same developer across all platforms, it turns out. He says his team of researchers did the analysis, and he trusts his team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6QSD7l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s part of the frictionless process you have envisioned?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="afk38L"&gt;Hitt said earlier that he’d identified eight games that let people buy things on the iOS web browser, and then use them in iOS apps; these are identified in the spreadsheet. Epic has complained that this process isn’t good enough — and certainly isn’t ubiquitous. Now, Even raises the “frictionless” process that Hitt had blithely testified to earlier in the day. &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush Saga&lt;/em&gt; is the example Even chooses. We go to the website, and press “install,” where we are promptly sent to the App Store. We tab back to the website. The only possible way to play on the web is on desktop. The Facebook option for &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;, too, is desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2OY4i"&gt;“That’s part of the frictionless process you have envisioned?” Even asks, somewhat sarcastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKfHr8"&gt;We try another game, &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt;, developed by Supercell. We go to Supercell’s FAQ, where it emerges that payment processes are only through Apple’s App Store or Google play. Supercell itself doesn’t keep payment information “And yet you believe that your team managed to go into a website and buy legitimate &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt; money and go back to the app? That’s your testimony?” Even asks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYZyTk"&gt;Then he twists the knife: The typical user of &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have a research team, Even observes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rekc5I"&gt;I am terrified we are going to go through all eight apps, but thankfully Even spares us the exhaustion. According to Even, there are three apps that support buying something on the web, then using it in an app: &lt;em&gt; PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; and… &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. (&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, however, is now banned from iOS.) Does Hitt have any basis to dispute this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="wAWadw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even’s point stands: most of us do not have research teams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v5Yz0z"&gt;Hitt says he trusts his team. I am feeling very bad for the team, which has largely been thrown under the bus by Hitt here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLM9Fb"&gt;On redirect, Apple’s Cynthia Richman tries to stop the bleeding. Sometimes developers license games to other developers — which might explain some of the cases where the developers don’t match. Hitt also tells us that Even’s rather brutal examples aren’t typical. Hitt has &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt; purchased V-bucks on a mobile browser, he tells us proudly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMqFMx"&gt;“It looked pretty difficult given the examples you provided,” says Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. What’s the explanation for why we couldn’t do these things during the cross-examination? Well, Hitt says, there were other links in the spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="zh3aNi"&gt;That may very well be true. But Even’s point stands: most of us do not have research teams. I wish I did — I could send them to the trial in my stead and blame them if the work was subpar. Instead, I am personally sitting through excruciating expert testimony. Why am I focusing on this, specifically? It’s the most interesting thing that happened all day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix will try to make Ultraman a global name with a new CG movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1OKTx786usO9gwN_wH40NG-hdHw=/608x0:3488x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69284392/NetflixUltraman.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qG32Ib"&gt;Netflix announced that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1392951363223441410?s=20"&gt;it’s partnering with Tsuburaya Productions&lt;/a&gt; to create &lt;a href="https://en.tsuburaya-prod.co.jp/news/2629"&gt;a new CG &lt;em&gt;Ultraman &lt;/em&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt;, in the hopes of bringing the popular Japanese character to an even larger global audience. Ultraman’s never been a household name outside of Japan despite leaving a huge impression &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NG7fAhvUcc"&gt;on popular culture&lt;/a&gt; — the original &lt;em&gt;Ultraman&lt;/em&gt; series popularized the “giant man in a suit fights people dressed up as monsters in a model city” genre — but Netflix is hoping to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwjEx1"&gt;The new CG &lt;em&gt;Ultraman &lt;/em&gt;film, besides leaving the franchise’s original live action format, will feature a different version of the character and what sounds like a slightly unusual setup for the plot — Ultraman has undergone “dadification”. Per Tsuburaya Productions’ synopsis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aP22fa"&gt;Baseball superstar Ken Sato returns to his home country of Japan to pick up the mantle of Earth-defending superhero &lt;em&gt;Ultraman&lt;/em&gt;, but quickly finds more than he bargained for when he’s forced to raise the offspring of his greatest foe, a newborn Kaiju. Struggling to balance the roles of teammate and new father, Ken must confront his own ego, his estranged father, and the conniving Kaiju Defense Force to rise up and discover what it truly means to be &lt;em&gt;Ultraman&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5lPdKG"&gt;The film will be directed by Shannon Tindle, and co-directed by John Aoshima, who previously worked on Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Gravity Falls. &lt;/em&gt; Tindle’s background in animation is diverse, having worked in traditional 2D animation as a character designer on &lt;em&gt;Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends, &lt;/em&gt;and stop-motion animation &lt;a href="https://shannontindle-blog.tumblr.com/post/146715944924/kubo-it-all-starts-with-an-idea-and-then-gets"&gt;as the creator&lt;/a&gt; of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Laika’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/12/12450744/kubo-and-the-two-strings-movie-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kubo and the Two Strings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a character designer/animator on &lt;em&gt;Coraline&lt;/em&gt;. Tindle is also currently the showrunner on the Netflix animated series &lt;em&gt;Lost Ollie.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5XTP91"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My guy stopped by to celebrate the announcement. &lt;a href="https://t.co/N3SDXKL1qq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/N3SDXKL1qq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Shannon Tindle (@ShannonTindle_1) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ShannonTindle_1/status/1392964593035608068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W79d1J"&gt;Tsuburuaya Productions CEO Takayuki Tsukagoshi describes the new film project as “the first full-scale endeavor to reach the global market for Tsuburaya Productions,” and with Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238877/netflix-200-million-subscribers-q4-earnings-bridgerton-emily-paris-cobra-kai-queens-gambit"&gt;over 200 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a good chance somebody is going to learn they’re a huge Ultraman fan after watching this film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cons2y"&gt;That’s great for Netflix, because it already has &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80231373"&gt;an &lt;em&gt;Ultraman&lt;/em&gt; anime series&lt;/a&gt; it can point people at, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1138494971110019072?s=20"&gt;with a second season in the works&lt;/a&gt;. Which is all part of the streaming service’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/27/22353848/netflix-launch-anime-ragnarok-zeus-resident-evil-streaming"&gt;larger push into the anime space&lt;/a&gt;, right as the competition &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166585/sony-buy-anime-streaming-service-crunchyroll-at-t-funimation"&gt;is really heating up&lt;/a&gt;. Dropping a new &lt;em&gt;Ultraman&lt;/em&gt; movie could be great for the character, but ultimately it’s even better for Netflix’s ongoing goal to be your only source of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>World’s largest crypto exchange Binance is reportedly under investigation </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZvW6i424_wriuq-x8un7ZMD3XFA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69284134/acastro_170726_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Pu3CZ"&gt;Cryptocurrency exchange Binance is being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/binance-probed-by-u-s-as-money-laundering-tax-sleuths-bore-in?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, with officials who handle money laundering and tax offenses in particular taking a interest in Binance’s business.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5ZvEL"&gt;Founded in 2017, Binance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. It’s incorporated in the Cayman Islands and has an office in Singapore. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has been &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-12/crypto-exchange-binance-investigated-by-u-s-over-who-s-trading?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;investigating whether Binance&lt;/a&gt; allowed Americans to make illegal trades on its platform, by letting them buy derivatives linked to digital tokens. US residents can only purchase these kinds of products from firms registered with the CFTC. Binance has said in the past it does block Americans from conducting illegal transactions on its website, warning that violators would have their accounts frozen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeIOLb"&gt;Cryptocurrency analytics firm Chainalysis reported that in 2019, some $756 million of $2.8 billion worth of &lt;a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/money-laundering-cryptocurrency-2019"&gt;criminal transactions involving the bitcoin cryptocurrency &lt;/a&gt;went through Binance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNZXKC"&gt;A Binance spokesperson said the company doesn’t “comment on specific matters or inquiries,” but said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company takes its “legal obligations very seriously. “ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OU9zez"&gt;“We have worked hard to build a robust compliance program that incorporates anti-money laundering principles and tools used by financial institutions to detect and address suspicious activity,” the spokesperson said. “We have a strong track record of assisting law enforcement agencies around the world, including in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KtChCz"&gt;The scope of the federal investigation into Binance wasn’t clear as of Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phone to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12, Galaxy S21 Ultra, Galaxy S21 Plus, iPhone 12 Mini, Galaxy Z Fold 2, and Pixel 4A 5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xXWN-t57Q2UyqQv662Bj9KonMk=/158x0:1883x1150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490961/Best_Phone_Grid_2021_2.7.png" /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OauOjO"&gt;In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason: even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800. It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLLWfM"&gt;Luckily, if you’re looking for a no-compromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJpqAH"&gt;A great smartphone will last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. Believe it or not, all of those things are easier than ever to find in a phone — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple iPhone 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DK8L4P"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WnjecW"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wW82H0"&gt;Apple has released four different variations of the iPhone 12, more than it ever has at one time. Despite all of those choices, the traditional, regular model is still a good pick. The regular iPhone 12, which starts at around $830 for a 64GB model, is the best smartphone for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycfOO"&gt;The 12 has the same overall design, the same processor, the same wireless charging, the same Face ID system, the same 5G support, the same front camera, and the same main and wide-angle rear cameras as the pricier 12 Pro but for hundreds of dollars less. On top of all that, it comes in five colors, one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wUSPTz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 12 balances a big screen with manageable size well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vgfddW"&gt;Compared to the iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12 has a noticeably roomier display and a bigger battery — two things that are important to many people. At 6.1 inches, it’s big enough to make watching video and reading text comfortable and engaging, but it isn’t so big that it’s terribly hard to use in one hand or fit in your pocket. Battery life is also very good; you can reliably expect this phone to last all day without needing to charge up before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CpBRz"&gt;The 12 gives up the telephoto camera that’s available on the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, but that’s something not everyone will miss. The iPhone 12’s camera system is the best you can get in this price range and is excellent at most anything you’d use it for. It also has the ability to shoot Dolby Vision HDR for brighter and more dynamic video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaJMCS"&gt;Since the 12 has Apple’s latest smartphone processor, the A14 Bionic, it has extremely fast performance and fluid animations. It also has a sleeker, more modern design than the previous iPhone 11 or iPhone XR, which feel frumpy in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4Yr6F"&gt;The base iPhone 12 comes with 64GB of storage, but as usual with an iPhone, it’s not expandable, so we recommend buying the 128GB model for only $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;In all, the iPhone 12 is an easy choice for most people: it offers top-level performance, design, and camera features, while providing reliable battery life for less money than other options on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2t2EER"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GxgXJO"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KXRoWF"&gt;If neither size nor price is a concern, the best Android phone you can buy right now is the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. With a big 6.8-inch screen and the best cameras you can get on an Android phone, it’s the no-compromise pick. In some cases, its cameras can even best the iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc0tSW"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with the latest and best specs you can get on Android. It has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is the fastest you can get on Android. It features support for S Pen styluses if you prefer to use a pen with your phone, although it’s sold separately. The screen has a high refresh rate, which makes scrolling much smoother. It also has a huge battery that will last two days without much effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNdn1U"&gt;Samsung updated the design of the S21 Ultra, with a metal rail that curves naturally into the camera bump on the back. It is the best-looking big phone you can get right now. However, we can’t say we like Samsung’s software as much, which at the moment is a bit cluttered and features ads in places like the weather app. For a sleeker experience the OnePlus 9 Pro would be a good choice; the Ultra beats it on screen and camera quality, but it’s a good device all-around and offers a more grown-up take on Android OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOuzp6"&gt;That camera bump houses four cameras: a regular wide-angle with a 108-megapixel sensor, an ultrawide, and two different telephoto lenses. This makes it an incredibly versatile camera system that also has a ton of advanced video features like Pro modes and 8K recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;Starting at $1,199.99, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a very expensive phone. Thankfully, Samsung phones are discounted early and often. If you are in the market for one, it’s worth looking around for a deal before buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="IyREhz"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wFbUhR"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 / S21 Plus&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kVG4SO"&gt;Best Android phone to find a deal for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bwT4eg"&gt;Although the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus don’t post the big numbers the S21 Ultra does, they are still our picks right now for best Android phones under a thousand bucks. The regular Galaxy S21 with a 6.2-inch screen starts at $800 while the Plus version with a 6.7-inch screen starts at $1,000. However, both are frequently discounted with either price drops or bundles, so these are great candidates for hunting down sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7grLVJ"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus are essentially identical phones with three differences: screen size, battery size, and materials. We’ve reviewed the regular Galaxy S21 and found it to be a very competent phone even though you could argue it’s a minor refresh over last year’s Galaxy S20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EbSGE"&gt;However, Samsung refreshed the important part: the processor is the same Snapdragon 888 as the Ultra. That means the Galaxy S21 is super fast and should last more than a couple of years without slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;There are likely more great Android phones coming soon but right now, the Android phone that strikes the best balance of features and price is the S21.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is huge, but it has the best camera system on a smartphone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QzSdip"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FUQpEY"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G0d3Pt"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best camera system you can currently get on a smartphone. Its three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, even in poor lighting. If camera quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 12 Pro Max is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCe5L2"&gt;The big difference between the 12 Pro Max and the other iPhone 12 models is found in its main camera sensor. The 12 Pro Max has a physically larger camera sensor that allows it to gather more light and produce better-quality images when in dark or challenging lighting conditions. In addition, the 12 Pro Max has an improved image stabilization system that helps keep your images sharp as light levels drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;But unless camera quality is all you care about, the 12 Pro Max isn’t the best iPhone for most people. It’s enormous, and the squared sides make it feel even bigger than its spec sheet implies. Most people will be happier with the smaller but still large-screened iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini is small enough to be used in one hand by almost anybody.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hvSkHC"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IZTX1K"&gt;Best small smartphone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n8BP66"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 12 mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 12 mini is one of very few small phones on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNVbxg"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em0efZ"&gt;Otherwise, the mini is the same phone as the iPhone 12: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KsgWM"&gt;If you prefer Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;Asus Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt; is a good alternative. It’s a little bigger than the 12 mini with a 5.9-inch screen, and it doesn’t work on Verizon, but it’s otherwise a very similar proposition: great build quality, top-notch processor, and high-end features like a 120Hz screen all tucked into a pocket-friendly device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MPtDpR"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="efDFTK"&gt;If you’re looking for the best phone to go from morning to night with heavy use and last through it all, Samsung’s top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the one to get. It has a massive 4,500mAh battery that keeps its enormous 6.9-inch screen going as long as you need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3wWez"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is also a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant screen supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions; its triple rear camera system is one of the most advanced you can get; and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM allow it to perform without a hiccup. In addition, it supports Samsung’s S Pen for stylus input, allowing you to write or doodle on the screen with a pen instead of your finger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Although you can now use a stylus with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, it isn’t built into the phone as it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. Depending on Samsung’s plans, this may be the last “Ultra” version of the Note, too — though rumors have been conflicting on that front. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 is a step down from the 9 Pro, but it only gives up a few features at a significantly lower price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ofDQRV"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZJWuDD"&gt;If you want an excellent ultrawide camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uUgURs"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is the step-down model from the OnePlus 9 Pro, which is itself an excellent phone. But you don’t give up too much by opting for the 9, and you save a ton of money. Like the 9 Pro, it offers great performance with a Snapdragon 888 processor, fast 65W wired charging, and something that will appeal especially to the landscape photographers out there: a great ultrawide camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qa2S7w"&gt;The sensor behind the OnePlus 9’s ultrawide camera is physically larger than most and offers a healthy 50-megapixel resolution. A unique lens design corrects distortion without introducing the funhouse mirror-type stretching you’ll often see in the corners of ultrawide images. And if super-wide photography isn’t your thing, know that the main camera turns in solid image quality, too. Images are well-exposed, and colors look pleasantly vibrant. OnePlus makes a big deal of the Hasselblad color science at work here, which does a fine job but isn’t as mind-blowingly good as the company suggests.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O804KE"&gt;Unfortunately, you do miss out on a couple of good camera features opting for the 9 rather than the 9 Pro. The main camera on the 9 Pro offers optical image stabilization, which isn’t included on the 9, and is useful for its ability to keep subjects looking sharp in lower light conditions. There’s also no telephoto lens — just digital zoom, which isn’t as good as the 9 Pro’s optical zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxzBBh"&gt;The OnePlus 9 also doesn’t work on AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network. (It works on both T-Mobile and Verizon’s 5G networks, however.) That’s no great loss right now (honestly, it might be for the better), but in a couple of years, this will probably become a downside. Bearing this in mind and a couple of camera feature omissions, the OnePlus 9 is an excellent device. It offers a flagship feel and performance for a bit less than the highest-end Android options and a seriously good ultrawide camera for wide-angle photo fans.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A52 5G offers a large 6.5-inch screen with 120Hz refresh rate, a feature that’s not too common yet in the midrange class.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="z3SklF"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7spKRS"&gt;Best cheap phone with high-end features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gfmz0Z"&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G is our current pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;best Android phone under $500&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s also worth highlighting here for its combination of features usually reserved for premium devices and a reasonable price. You won’t get all the bells and whistles of the S21 series phones, of course, but the A52 5G includes a 6.5-inch screen with fast 120Hz refresh rate, an IP67 water resistance rating, and (for now, at least) access to monthly bug fixes and security updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rl0lbP"&gt;The A52 5G delivers on the basics too. Its Snapdragon 750G processor isn’t the fastest in the game but it keeps up well with day-to-day tasks. Its 4,500mAh battery delivers well over a day of moderate to heavy use. And the phone supports sub-6GHz 5G, which will allow it to take advantage of improving 5G networks in the US over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5qamU"&gt;Then there’s the typically Samsung-y stuff, including a UI that’s currently trending toward over-cluttered with the occasional unwelcome ad. The phone’s camera hardware is good, though photos tend to look a little oversaturated, which may or may not suit your taste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcPo00"&gt;One of the phone’s best features is Samsung’s commitment to providing four years of security updates. Overall, it’s a relatively affordable device with a solid feature set that should keep up for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixel 4A is the best Android phone under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yteQuG"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WMeIkj"&gt;Best Android phone under $400&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cBeDqy"&gt;If you’re on a budget and prefer Android, then the Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZEqw2"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZsgOa"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftzlw6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sUP4Y7"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $400. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 is expensive, extravagant, and the easiest way to fit a tablet-sized screen into your pocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mre8Bq"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4x700N"&gt;Best folding phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JDL8H8"&gt;Folding phones have been around for less than two years and have already seen their share of controversies. But if you are interested in buying one and are willing to pay the hefty price required, there’s really only one model worth considering: Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Mbw2f"&gt;The Fold 2 is Samsung’s second-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a normal smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 2 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, and its outside screen is much smaller than what you’re probably used to. It is also delicate; there’s no rated dust or water resistance, and its inner screen is more likely to get damaged if you poke it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rta9KS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3cHb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: the Fold 2 is roughly twice as expensive as other high-end phones. Since it debuted for $2,000, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364162/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-5g-price-cut-announced-1800"&gt;permanently marked down by $200&lt;/a&gt;, but you’re still paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xA969T"&gt;If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 2 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iahfYJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKGbug"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Actor says TikTok used her voice without permission for viral text-to-speech feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vB1U-TKC2t7e8izTrWgG-998d-U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69284099/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T8Evsm"&gt;TikTok is being sued by a voice actor who claims to be behind its viral text-to-speech feature, but says she never authorized TikTok — or just about anyone, really — to use her voice this way. The lawsuit, filed last week, says Bev Standing’s voice has been used to repeat “foul and offensive language” and that TikTok’s use will cause her “irreparable harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHFPmi"&gt;It’s unclear how Standing’s voice could have come to be used by TikTok, at least by the lawsuit’s telling. Standing says that she did voice recordings for a text-to-speech feature “several years ago” for a group called the Institute of Acoustics (IOA). Those recordings were meant to be used for translations of Chinese texts as part of a contract with an unnamed Chinese company, the lawsuit says. Standing says she did not authorize the IOA to transfer her voice data to other parties for later use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQgsh8"&gt;(It is unclear which IOA the lawsuit is referring to: a Google search reveals two groups with the same name — one based in England and another based in China. The lawsuit says it is based in “Edenborough Scotland;” the capital of Scotland is Edinburgh.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RYJuPE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Text-to-speech has been hugely popular on TikTok&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wfzUuD"&gt;Fast forward to the end of 2020, and Standing discovers that her voice seemed to have become a viral sensation online. A new feature gave creators the ability to have text written on their videos read aloud by a digital voice. If you’ve used TikTok for even a few minutes since the feature was released, you’ve likely come across a video with a calm, vaguely robotic woman’s voice narrating some text. (Standing says she discovered her voice was being used in November 2020, although TikTok does not appear to have publicly announced the feature until December 2020.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOIZSU"&gt;While the feature has made Standing’s voice far more recognizable, that could also be a drawback for her as an actor who does work for commercials, radio, and other client videos. “No matter what I do, I believe this is going to affect my business,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Ftechnology%2F2021%2F05%2F09%2Fvoice-tiktok-sues-company-emotional-distress%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F13%2F22435058%2Ftiktok-voice-sues-unauthorized-usage-text-to-speech" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;she told &lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCVsEE"&gt;TikTok hasn’t commented on the lawsuit. A representative told &lt;em&gt;The Telegraph &lt;/em&gt;it does not comment on ongoing litigation. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reached out to TikTok and both IOAs for comment. The lawsuit seeks to stop TikTok from using her voice and to pay her for its existing usage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get an unlocked Google Pixel 3 for $160 at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hFj59s7JBVL0bYJjCB6kT3SYJbI=/0x0:1720x1147/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69283574/Google_Pixel_3_Front_Image.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fv8hjQ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;Google Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt; was one of the best Android phones of 2018, and though it might not be the showstopper it once was, it’s a standout if you can find it for the right price. Thankfully, if you’re looking to upgrade or take the plunge into the Android ecosystem, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=UnlockedGooglePixel3Woot051321&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgoogle-pixel-3-64gb-unlocked%3Fref%3Dw_ngh_dd_el" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot is currently offering&lt;/a&gt; a 64GB, unlocked version of the Pixel 3 for $160 — a discount of $240.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FvEh6q"&gt;Despite its age, the Pixel 3 remains more than capable with its Snapdragon 845 processor. The phone lacks a headphone jack and its bezels aren’t exactly small, but it packs a 5.5-inch OLED display and a terrific 12-megapixel rear camera, one capable of capturing vibrant shots and decent low-light photos. The Pixel 3’s dual front-facing cameras even churn out wide-angle selfies, while its support for wireless charging makes it one of the cheapest phones outside of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22425011/zte-blade-11-prime-review-price-specs-screen"&gt;ZTE Blade 11 Prime&lt;/a&gt; to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N2Vpz4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498496"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cu6NGw"&gt;Right now, Woot is selling the pink Verizon model, however, it’s compatible with most other US carriers, including AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;despite Google discontinuing the Pixel 3 in March&lt;/a&gt;, the phone will continue to receive software updates — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; — through October 2021. If you’re looking for a budget phone and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"&gt;Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt; is still outside your price range, it’s hard to go wrong with the Google Pixel 3.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney’s return to theaters will include a shorter 45-day theatrical window</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wa5t3Xw0gnJmL5AFr6m1smH-l2g=/192x0:833x427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69283539/Screenshot_1160_1024x427.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Eh12Rv"&gt;Disney has confirmed that its upcoming releases &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; will be the company’s first two films to debut exclusively in theaters (on August 13th and September 3rd, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ev4ZCj"&gt;But when they do hit theaters, it’ll be for a far shorter amount of time, with just 45 days of theatrical exclusivity, instead of the traditional 90 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vr9c6x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Shorter windows are the new standard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5KosEC"&gt;The studio is by no means the only one: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346613/warner-bros-theatrical-releases-2022-hbo-max"&gt;Warner Bros. has already announced&lt;/a&gt; that its return to theaters in 2022 will feature a 45-day window; Paramount has said that upcoming blockbuster films like &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 7 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299995/mission-impossible-7-quiet-place-2-paramount-plus-45-days-after-theaters"&gt;will get 45-day windows&lt;/a&gt;, while smaller movies will have &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficepro.com/paramount-cuts-down-theatrical-exclusivity-for-major-titles-to-30-45-day-window/"&gt;an even shorter 30-day window&lt;/a&gt;. And Universal has signed deals with both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345713/amc-universal-movies-theaters-digital-rentals-pvod-streaming-agreement"&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wall-street-is-reacting-to-cinemark-universal-theatrical-window-deal"&gt;Cinemark&lt;/a&gt;: smaller movies (with openings less than $50 million domestically) can hit paid video services after a 17-day window, while bigger films (that open to bigger numbers) can hit paid video services after 31 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6YxoM"&gt;It’s a move that makes a lot of sense for all of these companies: even the biggest movies in the world tend to make the bulk of their money theatrically in the first few weekends, and the longer that films are kept exclusive to theaters, the longer companies like Disney and WarnerMedia have to wait before they can get them through the usual paid video windows and onto streaming services like Disney Plus and HBO Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iv18MT"&gt;And that’s really the name of the game now: release big blockbusters theatrically, cash in on those massive opening weekends, and then rush them to streaming where they can be used to help bolster a service’s library, attracting new subscribers and giving existing ones more reasons to stay subscribed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7xIHP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will make it easier to search your DMs, finally adds DM search to Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3OvFtCaTXrjYMHffJRuCCEXk1c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69283494/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1TcgMK"&gt;Can you imagine being able to actually &lt;em&gt;search&lt;/em&gt; Twitter to find a conversation, instead of just scrolling through endlessly to hopefully find what you’re looking for? That could be a reality for Twitter DMs in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HamauA"&gt;First off, the company’s finally &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1392924451705024512"&gt;bringing a DM search bar to Android today&lt;/a&gt;, nearly two years after it first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893603/twitter-dm-search-launch-apple-iphone-ios-text"&gt;appeared on iOS&lt;/a&gt;. More importantly, it’s going to drastically expand how helpful that bar is by surfacing older conversations and even actual words you’ve typed in those conversations sometime “later this year.” (Currently, you can only search for the names of the people you’ve spoken to.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mQs4u5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’ve brought the DM search bar to Android and are rolling out an improved version that lets you search for all of your old convos, not just the most recent ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Waiting for the option to search your DMs for message content? We’re working on releasing that later this year! &lt;a href="https://t.co/wAQxSokJt6"&gt;https://t.co/wAQxSokJt6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1392924451705024512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="vS5M2K"&gt;Frankly, I’ve rarely ever bothered to try Twitter search on mobile, since I’ve largely been an Android guy — and because Twitter’s mobile search doesn’t give you anywhere near the power of Tweetdeck or Twitter’s advanced search on desktop web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqFdTU"&gt;Speaking of which, here’s an easy way to find your own tweets: drop https://twitter.com/search?q=&lt;strong&gt;YOURSEARCHQUERY&lt;/strong&gt;%20(from%3A&lt;strong&gt;YOURTWITTERNAME&lt;/strong&gt;)&amp;amp;src=typed_query in your web browser, and see what you get. That’d be a nice feature on mobile, too.&lt;/p&gt;
