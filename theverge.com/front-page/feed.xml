    <title>FDA clears Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for kids ages 12 to 15</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UER19F"&gt;The Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine can now be administered to 12- to 15-year-olds, the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use"&gt;Food and Drug Administration announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, the shot was authorized for people 16 years of age and older. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBKN8c"&gt;The companies asked the FDA to expand the authorization to include the new ages in early April, just after they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359883/covid-vaccine-pfizer-adolescents-effective"&gt;released data&lt;/a&gt; showing that their vaccine was highly effective for that group. All of the 12- to 15-year-olds given the two-dose vaccine in a small study generated strong antibody response with no serious side effects, and none developed COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nH89KN"&gt;Later this week, a committee from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/agenda-archive/agenda-2021-05-12-508.pdf"&gt;will meet to make recommendations&lt;/a&gt; on how the vaccine should be rolled out to this age group.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9CxxH"&gt;The United States will likely need to vaccinate kids and teenagers to reach herd immunity and end the pandemic — the expanded authorization is another step toward &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/29/opinion/covid-vaccines-kids.html"&gt;that goal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sNrEp8"&gt;“Having a vaccine authorized for a younger population is a critical step in continuing to lessen the immense public health burden caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8Vmw4"&gt;Although kids are less likely to get seriously sick from COVID-19 than adults, they can still catch the virus and suffer &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/health/covid-children-inflammatory-syndrome.html"&gt;long-term symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. If they’re infected with the virus, they can also pass it along to others, so vaccinating kids is a way to stop them from getting family members or others sick. Approximately 1.5 million people in the US between the ages of 11 and 17 have gotten COVID-19 since March 2020.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkSzpp"&gt;Pfizer and BioNTech also have studies in progress testing their COVID-19 vaccine in younger age groups, starting with infants six months old. Moderna, which has a COVID-19 vaccine authorized for people 18 years and older, is testing its shot in children and adolescents aged six months through 17 years old. Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson has plans for similar studies, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQJs17"&gt;&lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;152,819,904 people&lt;/a&gt; in the US have received at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IVwbUt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The cybersecurity ‘pandemic’ that led to the Colonial Pipeline disaster</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cyberattack Forces Shutdown Of Major U.S. Fuel Pipeline" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_H8k-NJH70ZUZn3tnpDN5ru-6Lo=/0x0:5808x3872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69265848/1317302232.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;WOODBRIDGE, NEW JERSEY - MAY 10: Fuel holding tanks are seen at Colonial Pipeline’s Linden Junction Tank Farm on May 10, 2021 in Woodbridge, New Jersey. Alpharetta, Georgia-based Colonial Pipeline, which has the largest fuel pipeline, was forced to shut down its oil and gas pipeline system on Friday after a ransomware attack that has slowed down the transportation of oil in the eastern U.S. | Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hmwO8w"&gt;The cyberattack that forced the Colonial Pipeline offline is just one failure to address existing weaknesses and an escalating “ransomware pandemic,” experts tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That leaves the nation’s energy infrastructure especially vulnerable, even though there are basic steps that could have been taken to prevent the crisis that’s unfolding now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ar8FDS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Yet another example of what is really a ransomware pandemic”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cz4dIz"&gt;“Honestly, I think for anyone who’s been tracking ransomware closely, this really shouldn’t be a surprise,” says Philip Reiner, CEO of the nonprofit Institute for Security and Technology. “This is yet another example of what is really a ransomware pandemic that needs to be addressed at the highest level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tri4o6"&gt;An escalating threat from bad actors, like the criminal group &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/08/cyber-attack-colonial-pipeline/"&gt;DarkSide&lt;/a&gt; that’s believed to be behind the attack on Colonial Pipeline, is coinciding with more potential weak points in the energy sector’s cyber infrastructure. Reiner says ransomware poses growing risks to critical infrastructure beyond energy, including health care and financial systems. Hackers have targeted tech, too. A subcontractor for Apple was hit with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396283/apple-schematics-leak-ransomware-quanta-supplier-leak"&gt;$50 million ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt; just last month. But the energy sector seems particularly vulnerable to all kinds of cyber threats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grXK4D"&gt;“This is the kind of thing that keeps folks like us awake at night,” says Tucker Bailey, a partner and cybersecurity expert at consultancy McKinsey &amp;amp; Company. “We’ve known that the [vulnerabilities] have been there for a while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMyxVF"&gt;Almost half of all the East Coast’s fuel typically travels through the Colonial Pipeline, which has been shuttered since May 7th. The pipeline company’s IT system fell victim to ransomware, a type of cyber attack in which hackers demand payment to bring systems back online. DarkSide also stole data from the company and threatened to publish it online, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-09/colonial-hackers-stole-data-thursday-ahead-of-pipeline-shutdown?sref=ylv224K8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1u6zK"&gt;The frequency and severity of attacks against utility systems is on the rise, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.naruc.org/about-naruc/press-releases/new-nrri-cyber-paper-helps-regulators-better-understand-threats-and-cybersecurity-technologies/"&gt;National Regulatory Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;. Fifty-six percent of utility professionals surveyed by &lt;a href="https://assets.new.siemens.com/siemens/assets/api/uuid:35089d45-e1c2-4b8b-b4e9-7ce8cae81eaa/version:1600101948/siemens-cybersecurity.pdf"&gt;Siemens&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 said they had experienced at least one attack over the previous year that led to an outage or a loss of private information. More than a third of the &lt;a href="https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&amp;amp;did=819640"&gt;796 “cyber incidents”&lt;/a&gt; reported to the Department of Homeland Security between 2013 and 2015 took place in the energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XEzA4"&gt;A collision of a couple key factors could drive those numbers up. First, there are more state actors, cybercriminals, and hacktivists targeting critical infrastructure, according to experts. Second, an increasingly digital power sector opens up more opportunities for hackers to attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQCBu9"&gt;“As everything is becoming more computerized, the controls for our critical infrastructure are also more computerized and steps need to be taken to ensure that they are protected from cyber attacks,” says Leslie Gordon, acting director for homeland security and justice at the watchdog Government Accountability Office (GAO). She says what happened to Colonial Pipeline is “an example of a failure to protect critical infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oc2kIG"&gt;Companies are regularly failing to practice even basic security hygiene, which leaves critical infrastructure open to attack. Good security hygiene can include relatively simple things like requiring multi-factor authentication, having response plans ready, and keeping backup systems in place. With Colonial Pipeline, failing to keep its network segmented — so that bad actors can’t easily hop from one piece of the system to the next — was a big problem that shows a lack of cyber hygiene, according to Reiner. Colonial’s IT system was attacked, but that was connected to the company’s operating system, so it shut that down, too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="JfHwb1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“One of the greatest causes of cyber crime”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BQeZ1Q"&gt;“One of the things we see here is another example of basic steps not being taken in order to secure your systems,” Reiner says. “Cyber hygiene, or the lack thereof, is really one of the greatest causes of cyber crime. It’s not so much that these guys are so good. It’s just people leave very basic things undone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcTzA1"&gt;President Joe Biden is expected to announce an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/09/us/politics/biden-cyberattack-response.html"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; that could require contractors the federal government works with to take those kinds of safety measures, and last month, the administration launched a 100-day &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-administration-takes-bold-action-protect-electricity-operations-increasing-cyber-0"&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; to tackle “increasing cyber threats” to the US electric system. It includes working with utilities to build up their capacity to stop, detect, and respond to attacks. The Department of Energy also &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-cybersecurity-programs-enhancing-safety-and-resilience-us-energy-sector"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; new research programs in March to make the energy sector more resilient to hazards, both physical and cyber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hifmI"&gt;But a workforce shortage is another lingering problem for the energy sector that could jeopardize those plans. There’s an estimated shortage of 498,480 cybersecurity workers in the US, a 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/cybersecurity-workforce-shortage-continues-to-grow/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; found. The Transportation Security Administration, which oversees pipeline security, is short on inspectors and lacks a strategic workforce development plan to help it “carry out its pipeline security responsibilities,” a 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-19-48.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the GAO found. Three years after the agency recommended that the TSA fill that gap, the GAO says that has yet to happen (although the TSA reports that it’s in the middle of completing a workforce plan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f99psy"&gt;Until these basic problems are solved, the threat of cyberattacks will loom large over the energy system and other critical infrastructure. And while the attacks are virtual, the consequences can be quickly felt on the ground. The longer the Colonial Pipeline stays out of commission, the bigger the risk of gas stations, jet fuel, and even home heating oil running dry. The pipeline company did not respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by time of publication but said in a &lt;a href="https://www.colpipe.com/news/press-releases/media-statement-colonial-pipeline-system-disruption"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that it’s bringing parts of its pipeline online in stages — with hopes that most operations will be restored by the end of the week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon-first gadget brands Aukey and Mpow are suddenly, suspiciously disappearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EfzpTdFApYVC4jxkhCNKulrci98=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69265836/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yaDZ0m"&gt;Many Amazon listings for two major electronics sellers have mysteriously disappeared as of Monday afternoon, and it’s unclear exactly what might be going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjqAct"&gt;Here are a few screenshots from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/AUKEY/AUKEY/page/B4F70606-6B67-46A0-BD18-938B37E59982"&gt;Aukey’s Amazon page&lt;/a&gt;, taken shortly after 12PM ET on Monday. Aukey is a major seller of chargers, portable batteries, and more, but its Amazon page has a whole lot of blank product boxes and products listed as “currently unavailable.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/czfHWNcZoohsOdyHJDl8MvFFZ9c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504162/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.09.15_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A section of Aukey’s largely empty Amazon page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9qrCJIc1ZyxTG34prrBjCXVxUwg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504190/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.17.42_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only two Aukey cables listed here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AuCTV57vSyxvixZNzugxD-kt07Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504192/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.17.57_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many Aukey products are “currently unavailable.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="clTRut"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=aukey&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss"&gt;And if I search “Aukey” on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, the top results are for two massage guns, a home oven, and a keyboard — not chargers or cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTd3c0"&gt;Mpow, another big seller known for headphones, car mounts, and more, similarly has an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Mpow/page/77AF42AF-B598-48DD-AA53-3386F4E24647?ref_=ast_bln"&gt;Amazon page filled with “currently unavailable” listings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IL1qkKShAAfIFy5_AsuAiWW5t-k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504283/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.46.45_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A section of Mpow’s Amazon page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F11zcr"&gt;It’s not clear why Aukey’s and Mpow’s listings have disappeared. Their disappearance is particularly weird when I can see that listings from other big sellers in the accessories space, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/D24FDA17-DECF-46BB-AF47-AF4647D2B1F8?ingress=0&amp;amp;visitId=302e230f-dd66-4bf8-911f-8f7c1c2e1df8"&gt;Anker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Belkin/Belkin/page/2995B430-5393-4D60-8CDE-EE1F10036867"&gt;Belkin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/RAVPower/RAVPower/page/15E5B6FA-77BA-4AAD-953D-891C2FD80553"&gt;RAVPower&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Satechi/Satechi/page/4B138353-DD30-49D8-9A92-659E1326A9E8"&gt;Satechi&lt;/a&gt;, appear to be working as normal as of Monday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1VG9v"&gt;Aukey and Mpow have not responded to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDWPeI"&gt;Amazon would not confirm or deny whether it had removed these items — but it did provide a statement in response to our question that at least suggests these companies may have had some funny business going on: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xTs3w8"&gt;We work hard to build a great experience for our customers and sellers and take action to protect them from those that threaten their experience in our store. We have systems and processes to detect suspicious behavior and we have teams that investigate and take action quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ewkn0w"&gt;We have long-standing policies to protect the integrity of our store, including product authenticity, genuine reviews, and products meeting the expectations of our customers. We take swift action against those that violate them, including suspending or removing selling privileges. We take this responsibility seriously, monitor our decision accuracy and maintain a high bar. We have an appeals process where sellers can explain how they will prevent the violation from happening in the future or let us know if they believe they were compliant. Our teams are based in our Seattle headquarters and around the globe in order to provide sellers with 24/7 support via email, phone, and chat in more than 15 languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="W8MVMQ"&gt;Amazon is rife with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21423429/amazon-top-reviewers-uk-fraud"&gt;scams&lt;/a&gt;, and the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302114/amazon-counterfeit-crimes-unit-knockoffs-store-online-investigators"&gt;puts a lot of resources&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317617/amazon-counterfeit-products-marketplace-sellers-names-addresses-transparency"&gt;into fighting them&lt;/a&gt; — Amazon &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-publishes-comprehensive-brand-protection-report"&gt;just today&lt;/a&gt; revealed that it blocked more than 10 billion suspected bad listings before they were ever published in 2020, for example. Aukey and Mpow aren’t exactly small third-party sellers, though, which make their disappearing listings even more mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeRVaz"&gt;Last week, an unconfirmed report from &lt;a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/blog/amazon-reviews-leak-report/"&gt;antivirus review website &lt;em&gt;SafetyDetectives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; apparently revealed how some Amazon vendors figured out a quiet way to solicit and pay for fake five-star reviews — something that’s obviously against Amazon’s rules. While it’s not clear if the missing listings are connected in any way to the report — which does not name vendors who may be participating in the practice — we found &lt;a href="https://medium.com/the-shadow/my-experience-with-amazons-manipulated-review-farm-30ddd74263a8"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.winchestersun.com/2020/07/10/koutoulas-amazons-fake-user-review-problem/"&gt;accounts&lt;/a&gt; describing how Mpow used review-soliciting tactics similar what was uncovered in &lt;em&gt;SafetyDetectives&lt;/em&gt;’ article, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/corbindavenport/status/1391838929360457743"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; journalist Corbin Davenport said&lt;/a&gt; that an Aukey standing desk he’s reviewing included a message offering $100 in exchange for an “honest review.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6Xoxg5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I'm currently reviewing a standing desk from Aukey, and it came with this note offering $100 for an "honest review," which is against Amazon's seller rules. No wonder Amazon is laying down the hammer. &lt;a href="https://t.co/qkfpvbDyln"&gt;https://t.co/qkfpvbDyln&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/rW3VRcVr3x"&gt;pic.twitter.com/rW3VRcVr3x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Corbin Davenport (@corbindavenport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/corbindavenport/status/1391838929360457743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M4oOQ0"&gt;Walmart appears to be getting into the streaming devices with the Onn Android TV UHD Streaming Device, according to &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fonn-Android-TV-UHD-Streaming-Device%2F636597403%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_U8Ox5dwMNxyORY7wUx0Mo3chUkBxOaQdw0f2240%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_1914133%26clickid%3DU8Ox5dwMNxyORY7wUx0Mo3chUkBxOaQdw0f2240%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D566719%26campaign_id%3D9383%26irgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_3IU3SsT35xyLUbdwUx0Mo36dUkBx-x3ZR3zQQg0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_2091438%26clickid%3D3IU3SsT35xyLUbdwUx0Mo36dUkBx-x3ZR3zQQg0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new listing&lt;/a&gt; on its website (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/06/walmart-android-tv-streamer-listing-4k/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company’s new streaming box (in this case, really more of a flattened cube) is currently listed for $29.88 but is also “out of stock” — which could be due to the fact it hasn’t been officially announced yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uupTuB"&gt;According to Walmart’s page, the Onn Android TV UHD Streaming Device can, unsurprisingly, stream in 4K and play “Dolby audio” — although there are no other specifics shared. The small device runs Android TV, connects to a TV over HDMI, and comes with what looks like a Google Assistant-enabled remote with dedicated buttons for YouTube, Netflix, Disney Plus, and HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart’s streaming device is a fairly unassuming black square.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vh4pDu"&gt;Design-wise, as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes, Walmart’s streaming device shares a lot of similarities with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004376/google-adt-3-android-tv-10-update-set-top-hdmi-2-1"&gt;Google’s developer device, the ADT-3&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with Walmart’s electronics brand, “onn,” slapped on top. The remote that accompanies the Onn also seems to be using a new Google design &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/25/google-tv-remotes-2021-gallery/"&gt;that’s been rumored&lt;/a&gt; to come with a host of new Google TV products in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3yKVupwfzrCZ3FS5w5Ecq6FeZic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505101/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_12.44.08_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Walmart&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Onn Android TV UHD Streaming Device has more dedicated streaming service buttons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cRkUt4"&gt;Walmart has been in a multiyear &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/3/17630604/amazon-walmart-competition-tech-partnerships-grocery-delivery"&gt;competition with Amazon&lt;/a&gt; over basically all forms of shopping online and off, so muscling into the streaming device market with what’s essentially a Fire Stick competitor shouldn’t be surprising. For Walmart, the streaming space has standardized and streamlined enough that it’s probably comparatively easy to come out with a cheap streaming cube, stock it in thousands of stores, and let customers do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lppr8r"&gt;It’s hard to not put Walmart’s device in the context of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22425753/tivo-stream-4k-dongle-android-tv-no-more-jon-kirchner"&gt;TiVo’s apparent exit&lt;/a&gt; from the streaming device space. Streaming sticks and boxes are increasingly becoming a game for big companies who can reach the scale and low costs that smaller companies can’t keep up with. They also tend to have a better handle on software — for Xperi, the TiVo brand’s current owner, Google integrating universal search aped the big feature that differentiated it from the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a312Z2"&gt;The TiVo Stream 4K launched for $70, only to later drop to $39 in what seems like a bid to compete with the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;$50 Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16587340/roku-streaming-stick-plus-2017-4k-hdr-review-price-relase"&gt;$40 Roku Streaming Stick Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review"&gt;$50 Fire Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;. Assuming $30 is the Onn Android TV UHD Streaming Device’s actual price and it’s actually worth using, Walmart may be poised to start yet another race to the bottom. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony now lets you use the DualSense pad to play PS5 on your nearby Mac, iPhone, iPad, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xn7yKyzSC-ZnTSHtZKmvKXzkscw=/0x212:2200x1679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69265140/20210510_Sean_Hollister_Verge_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TtiSeS"&gt;It’s a little-known fact that you can sling a PS5 or PS4 to another room of your house, streaming your games to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/1/11138016/playstation-4-remote-play-pc-mac-feature"&gt;Mac or Windows PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20902406/sony-ps4-firmware-update-remote-play-android"&gt;iOS or Android device&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556803/sony-ps5-remote-play-ps4-app-streaming-games"&gt;or even an old PS4&lt;/a&gt; with Sony’s PS Remote Play app. But until recently, you could only remotely control your shiny new PlayStation 5 with the old DualShock 4 gamepad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dloisn"&gt;That’s now changing, as Sony has just announced the PS5’s new DualShock controller is supported &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pair-dualsense-controller-bluetooth/"&gt;across every Apple platform running the latest operating system&lt;/a&gt;, including iPhones, iPads, iPod touches, and Apple TVs running 14.5 and Macs running macOS Big Sur 11.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZlGGmR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Remote Play is now available using the DualSense wireless controller to play compatible games on a range of Apple devices. Full details: &lt;a href="https://t.co/4fpa77oFqx"&gt;https://t.co/4fpa77oFqx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Z2BlehDLjO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Z2BlehDLjO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1391822847924973579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RGsa9D"&gt;I just gave it a quick try myself with an iPhone 12 mini and a recent iPad Pro, and I have some thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUleMM"&gt;The good news: if the only controller you own is a DualSense controller, it totally works — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21547303/sony-ps5-dualsense-adaptive-triggers-haptics-teardown-featuresver"&gt;your awesome adaptive triggers&lt;/a&gt; come along for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEuqyp"&gt;Here is some bad news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0ogOnp"&gt;There’s no haptic feedback. Absolutely zero. It feels extremely weird.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="izZOmp"&gt;Each time you want to switch devices (to your iPhone or back to your PS5), you’ll have to manually pair your DualSense again. That was true of previous pads as well, but I was hoping they’d fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QMN2GW"&gt;The built-in microphone, headphone jack, and speaker don’t work. The speaker is a serious loss — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;games like&lt;em&gt; Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;use it in combination with haptic feedback to add some serious immersion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HV1yCY"&gt;The streaming quality, as always, will depend heavily on your home wireless network. Give it a try, though; it’s free! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="o5EbHy"&gt;You’ll have to decide whether these things defeat the purpose of pairing a DualSense with an Apple device. As far as I’m concerned, I’ll keep my DualSense hooked up to the PS5 where it can actually help me sense things, and use a DualShock 4 (or third-party pad) when I want to stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sM77R2"&gt;It’s also more ammunition for the argument that we should be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352382/sony-ps5-playstation-4-controllers-new-ps4-support-games"&gt;play PS5 games on our PS5 with a PS4 pad&lt;/a&gt;. This is the second time Sony has shown that limitation is totally arbitrary: first when it allowed us to &lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/you-can-play-ps5-games-with-a-dualshock-4-if-you-use-remote-play/'"&gt;control PS5 games with the PS4 controller over Remote Play&lt;/a&gt; to start, and now again with this signal that the DualSense’s sensing abilities are optional when streaming games over a network.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A special thanks to the person who combined the Apple TV remote and an AirTag</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5koe4"&gt;Here are a few unrelated facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aQ7mJV"&gt;Up until few weeks ago, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22394083/siri-remote-apple-tv-goodbye"&gt;Apple was selling the Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;, one of the least popular (and most easily lost) remote controls ever made, with a slick glass and metal chassis that’s practically designed to slip behind a couch cushion. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="urzuRn"&gt;Apple also recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;released its AirTag trackers&lt;/a&gt;, which use a Bluetooth network of Apple devices and local ultra-wideband tracking to help locate missing items, whether they’re across town or a few feet away in the room with you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="G827Fn"&gt;The AirTag tracker has a small speaker, so you can find it buried in a couch or under a pile of throw pillows. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PLzRgk"&gt;Apple just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/18277449/apple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date"&gt;redesigned the Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;, which it announced at the same event as the AirTags trackers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IT482B"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394335/apple-u1-uwb-locator-missing-ipad-pro-apple-tv-siri-remote"&gt;did not include&lt;/a&gt; a UWB chip in the new Siri Remote to allow users with recent iPhone devices to track said remote if they manage to lose it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u0lcDd"&gt;Apple is a company that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fall%2Fcases-protection&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22429238%2Fapple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;produces cases&lt;/a&gt; for almost all of its products (including the iPhone, iPad, and AirTag tracker) — but not either iteration of the Siri Remote. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y0qE35"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208492"&gt;Apple’s official support document&lt;/a&gt; for “If you lost the remote for your Apple TV,” advocates that users either use the Apple TV remote function integrated into iOS devices or just buy a new one. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eKO9Wj"&gt;My Apple TV remote is &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; in my living room, and no, I don’t have any idea where it is. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="NGU6xw"&gt;With all that said, it’s no surprise that enterprising creators are already making 3D-printed templates for a case for the original Siri Remote that allows you to slot in both the remote and an AirTag tracker so that you can actually find it the next time you lose it in a couch. There are already &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=airtag+remote&amp;amp;type=things&amp;amp;sort=relevant"&gt;several available from Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F1015765067%2Fairtag-case-for-apple-tv-siri-remote%3Fgpla%3D1%26gao%3D1%26%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3Dshopping_us_e-electronics_and_accessories-electronics_cases-phone_cases%26utm_custom1%3D_k_Cj0KCQjws-OEBhCkARIsAPhOkIYcE9TPgLwISANYDJRm3pZGfmPwoOQTatroAzaz6kVfOLIPDoYLQNcaAjs9EALw_wcB_k_%26utm_content%3Dgo_1843970791_69629621997_346364498394_pla-352374535867_c__1015765067_12768591%26utm_custom2%3D1843970791%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjws-OEBhCkARIsAPhOkIYcE9TPgLwISANYDJRm3pZGfmPwoOQTatroAzaz6kVfOLIPDoYLQNcaAjs9EALw_wcB&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22429238%2Fapple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Etsy store selling files&lt;/a&gt;, and even an enterprising &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F224454921320%3Fchn%3Dps%26var%3D523239022404%26norover%3D1%26mkevt%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-117182-37290-0%26mkcid%3D2%26itemid%3D523239022404_224454921320%26targetid%3D882300791467%26device%3Dc%26mktype%3Dpla%26googleloc%3D9003653%26poi%3D%26campaignid%3D1669934603%26mkgroupid%3D65058347419%26rlsatarget%3Dpla-882300791467%26abcId%3D1123856%26merchantid%3D6296724%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjws-OEBhCkARIsAPhOkIaUm-mnPxWXR9m6x20Zn9U11qEZG6mxRRI2zzO51zF1CKHnRApJT8MaAuBzEALw_wcB&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22429238%2Fapple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay seller&lt;/a&gt; that’ll print and ship you one if you don’t have a 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ6vMH"&gt;To be clear, this is the lamest workaround for the fact that Apple didn’t just put a UWB chip and a tiny speaker in its $60 remote. It can’t be a cost thing: AirTags have one and they only cost $30. Roku has been putting tiny speakers in its remotes to make them easier to find for years. There was &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/29/siris-find-my-support-apple-tv-remote/"&gt;even a strange message&lt;/a&gt; in Siri that seemed to hint at the possibility of finding a lost Siri Remote using the virtual assistant — but Apple removed the message a few hours later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nuqmlO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I really &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; find my Apple TV’s remote&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ao5LvK"&gt;As such, I cannot explain why Apple has refused to embark down this mind-bogglingly obvious path. But I am puzzled why Apple isn’t making a nicer version of this exact 3D printed concept (ideally out of nicer, more durable materials that actually match the rest of the hardware and would be more enjoyable to use on a daily basis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbH7UO"&gt;Apple loves selling unnecessary hardware accessories (like its various AirTag keychain cases, which cost more than the AirTags and solve the self-inflicted issue of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;not having a loop built right into the device&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTzobV"&gt;For Apple, it’s a no-brainer to make a case (that adds functionality that Apple should have included right out of the box) that would almost certainly exceed the cost of the remote &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; require the additional purchase of a different Apple product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAWPhg"&gt;And yet, for all my mockery here, I really &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; find my Apple TV’s remote. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GEb8xZ"&gt;The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released a &lt;a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/HWY21FH007-preliminary-report.pdf"&gt;two-page preliminary report&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;deadly crash of a Tesla Model S in Texas last month&lt;/a&gt; in which local authorities said there was no one in the driver’s seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dm77OV"&gt;There are several relevant disclosures in the NTSB report. The first is that security camera footage from the owner’s home captured the owner entering the driver’s side door, while his companion got in on the passenger side. The car leaves the house, travels 550 feet before departing the road on a curve, hitting a drainage culvert, a raised manhole, and a tree. The car then burst into flames, killing the two occupants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5yJH4t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There has been much speculation from Tesla’s many interested online observers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f8iOon"&gt;The second relevant finding is that NTSB crash investigators tested whether Tesla’s advanced driver assist system Autopilot would work on the part of the road where the crash took place. There has been much speculation from Tesla’s many interested online observers as to whether Autopilot would even function on the road near the crash site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZexsXz"&gt;Using Autopilot requires both the Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (Tesla’s brand name for its adaptive cruise control function) and Autosteer (which assists in lane departure and centering) to work. According to NTSB, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control could be engaged but not Autosteer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54d817"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404677/tesla-texas-crash-driver-seat-earnings-musk"&gt;Tesla claims&lt;/a&gt; that its own data suggests local officials were mistaken when they reported that the car crashed without someone in the driver’s seat. The company’s executives have stated that the steering wheel was “deformed” and the seatbelts were buckled, leading them to conclude that someone was behind the wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIMl4E"&gt;There was some limited data recovered from the crash. NTSB said the fire destroyed the onboard storage device located in the vehicle’s infotainment console. The restraint control module, which records data associated with vehicle speed, belt status, acceleration, and airbag deployment, was recovered but was also damaged by the fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="76Vaf4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The board likely will not issue its final report on the crash this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bt85Nc"&gt;The board likely will not issue its final report on the crash this year. By comparison, the NTSB’s investigation into a California man’s death while using Autopilot in his Tesla Model X took two years to complete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85ILAL"&gt;The crash took place on Saturday, April 17th, in Spring, Texas. &lt;a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/tesla-spring-crash-fire/285-c28a4993-5b5f-43f4-a924-e39638390647"&gt;According to KHOU&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, investigators at the scene were “100 percent certain” that no one was in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash. Minutes before the crash, the wives of the men were said to overhear them talking about the Autopilot feature of the vehicle, which was a 2019 Tesla Model S. The two victims were identified as Everette Talbot, 69, and William Varner, 59, a prominent local anesthesiologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTr9oR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8CApHo89l_6-U02FA26oLjLlBo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187117/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AV4O6"&gt;Privacy is on everyone’s mind these days, and in iOS 14.5, which is starting to roll out to the public today, there are new privacy features that may make you feel happier but are not endearing Apple to some other companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;specifically Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqII1"&gt;The new feature is aptly called App Tracking Transparency. Many apps don’t just track your movements inside the app, but they track your movements outside of the app — in other words, where you go after you’ve left the app. This is why you see ads in Facebook and other apps for products you were just looking at on Amazon or other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJui93"&gt;Before 14.5, you could turn tracking off for all of your apps by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking and turning off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” The new version of iOS allows you to be more specific. To begin, when you install a new app, you won’t have to do anything; you’ll be automatically asked whether you want the new app to track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_sNA9207Ij6MSzf2Kv2v5aQKVoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470537/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you or not." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFVoiRqzCT28pCAurjfCEcl0yRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470540/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6sRHd"&gt;If you want to see which apps have asked for permission to track, and possibly change their tracking settings, you can just go to that same Tracking page. There, you will be able to give or revoke that permission. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="amnEHD"&gt;Go to your iPhone’s settings and select Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FMi304"&gt;Beneath “Allow Apps to Request to Track,” you’ll now see a list of specific apps that have asked for that permission. You can permit or revoke that permission for each specific app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6w_zBXKYJsJ68-QaTDaA_HPCgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470579/Image_from_iOS__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sqNFgl"&gt;And you can still use “Allow Apps to Request to Track” to turn off permission for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your current (and future) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ne1PGZ"&gt;(Note: At first, the App Tracking Transparency feature seemed to be misbehaving for some people; it either didn’t respond or &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/26/ios-14-5-app-tracking-transparency-toggle-mysteriously-toggle-grayed-out-for-some-users/"&gt;the toggle in Tracking was grayed out&lt;/a&gt;. On May 3rd, Apple issued update 14.5.1, which was supposed to fix the problem. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/03/ios-14-5-1-release-changes/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the fix hasn’t worked for some people; however, at least one staffer at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported that his toggle was no longer grayed out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qdw2bJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 27th, 9:20AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to add a note about problems with the new feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4nwEG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 10th, 2:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The note about issues with the new feature has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3q8mGj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hA5RTE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple suppliers linked to Uyghur forced labor in new report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XoKq-dY5VONuf34LH0rcbAS_z6k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264431/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v9l0IJ"&gt;Several Apple suppliers may have used forced labor in China, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Fseven-apple-suppliers-accused-of-using-forced-labor-from-xinjiang&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22428899%2Fapple-suppliers-china-uyghur-forced-labor-report" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Working with two human rights groups, the publication identified seven companies that supplied products or services to Apple and supported forced labor programs, according to statements made by the Chinese government. The programs target the country’s Muslim minority population, particularly Uyghurs living in Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWjTPW"&gt;Six of the seven suppliers were said to participate in work programs operated by the Chinese government, &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports, which human rights groups describe as frequently offering cover for forced labor. Workers can be jailed for refusing to join the work programs, the report says, and those enrolled in the programs are often moved far from their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wl0OY3"&gt;One of the suppliers operated in Xinjiang, the region of China predominantly populated by Uyghurs and where the most egregious human rights violations &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/inside-xinjiang-detention-camp"&gt;have reportedly taken place&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wL5Jyw"&gt;The companies supplied Apple with antennas, cables, and coatings, among other products and services, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glfQLl"&gt;Apple “found no evidence of forced labor anywhere we operate,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. Apple said it looks for forced labor as part of “every assessment” it conducts. “We will continue doing all we can to protect workers and ensure they are treated with dignity and respect,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgJ34z"&gt;The problem is not Apple’s alone. The tech industry at large relies on suppliers in China, and &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports that these companies have also worked with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook, among others. (Amazon and Facebook told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; they wouldn’t work with suppliers using forced labor; Google and Microsoft didn’t respond.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeynMT"&gt;China’s forced work programs have been &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/xinjiang-forced-labor-uyghurs-a3b58b6e-c98f-4ce4-ae52-7b4a37fa61f5.html"&gt;getting more attention&lt;/a&gt; over the past year, with new reports speaking to the growing scope of China’s oppressive practices in Xinjiang. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/xinjiang-forced-labor-uyghurs-a3b58b6e-c98f-4ce4-ae52-7b4a37fa61f5.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; finding more than 100 detention facilities located beside factories.  In January, &lt;a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/determination-of-the-secretary-of-state-on-atrocities-in-xinjiang/index.html"&gt;the Trump administration said&lt;/a&gt; China was “committed genocide against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcbbAE"&gt;Apple’s supply chain has previously been linked to forced labor in China. The Tech Transparency Project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22204920/lens-technology-uighur-forced-labor-xinjiang-amazon-apple-tesla"&gt;said a glass supplier&lt;/a&gt; was using forced labor in December; Apple said it had seen no evidence of forced labor. In March, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/shares-of-china-s-ofilm-drop-after-firm-loses-foreign-customer"&gt;cut ties with another supplier&lt;/a&gt; over allegations it was connected to coercive government labor programs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook wants to make sure you’ve read the article you’re about to share</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/68e7momSmK79BvJ29oJAdkeC9SU=/136x0:1756x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264427/E1C5TYUWEAo0YiK.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: FaceBook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="80hZFr"&gt;Facebook has announced on Twitter that it will start testing a pop-up that asks users if they’re sure they want to share an article that they haven’t opened. The pop-up will prompt users to read the article, but they can also choose to continue sharing it if they want. A Facebook spokesperson said the test would be rolled out to 6 percent of Android users worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pG3uXD"&gt;The pop-up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455635/twitter-read-before-you-tweet-article-prompt-rolling-out-globally-soon"&gt;is similar to Twitter’s&lt;/a&gt;, which it started testing in June 2020. Twitter’s implementation of the feature can be annoying to users (myself included) who have read the article elsewhere and decide to share it when they see it pop up on their feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjXWWf"&gt;Facebook says the pop-up is meant to help people be more informed about the articles they share, likely as an attempt to combat the spread of misinformation the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551906/facebook-election-results-misinformation-violence-incitement-trends"&gt;has struggled with in the past&lt;/a&gt;. As the message warns, not opening the article can lead to “missing key facts,” with headlines often not telling the whole story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FRAjeo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting today, we’re testing a way to promote more informed sharing of news articles. If you go to share a news article link you haven’t opened, we’ll show a prompt encouraging you to open it and read it, before sharing it with others. &lt;a href="https://t.co/brlMnlg6Qg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/brlMnlg6Qg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Facebook Newsroom (@fbnewsroom) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1391816265891778560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nqWiLf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 10th 3:05PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added a statement from Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
