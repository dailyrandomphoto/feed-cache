    <title>Students of color are getting flagged to their teachers because testing software can’t see them</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zrXZwN"&gt;Proctorio, a piece of exam surveillance software designed to keep students from cheating while taking tests, relies on open-source software that has a history of racial bias issues, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gxg3/proctorio-is-using-racist-algorithms-to-detect-faces"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The issue was discovered by a student who figured out how the software did facial detection, and discovered that it fails to recognize black faces over half the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1X4dJ"&gt;Proctorio, and other programs like it, is designed to keep an eye on students while they’re taking tests. However, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cham_omot/status/1364376131516854275"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; students of color &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/allseeingKHAI/status/1304421435385851904?s=20"&gt;have reported&lt;/a&gt; that they &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kikyo1506/status/1304441930772656128?s=20"&gt;have issues getting the software&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BigLou_42/status/1308943917950398466?s=20"&gt;see their faces&lt;/a&gt; — sometimes having to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JaniceWyattRoss/status/1364032597484056577"&gt;resort to extreme measures&lt;/a&gt; to get the software to recognize them. This could potentially cause the students problems: Proctorio will flag &lt;a href="https://blog.proctorio.com/why-proctorio-does-not-use-facial-recognition/"&gt;them to instructors&lt;/a&gt; if it doesn't detect their face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iDk74f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The software failed to recognize black faces more than half the time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OCBHT8"&gt;After anecdotally hearing about these issues, Akash Satheesan decided to look into the facial detection methods that the software was using. &lt;a href="https://proctor.ninja/the-duality-of-obfuscation-feat"&gt;He discovered that it looked and performed identically to OpenCV&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source computer vision program that can be used to recognize faces (which has &lt;a href="https://algorithmia.com/blog/racial-bias-in-facial-recognition-software"&gt;had issues with racial bias in the past&lt;/a&gt;). After learning this, he ran tests using OpenCV and a data set designed to validate how well machine vision algorithms deal with diverse faces. &lt;a href="https://proctor.ninja/proctorios-facial-recognition-is-racist"&gt;According to his second blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the results were not good. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LPy23_bKbLHttQtw6J1_i9V5Plk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430728/sjuwg8t.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Graph: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://proctor.ninja/proctorios-facial-recognition-is-racist" target="_blank"&gt;Akash Satheesan, ProctorNinja&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The results testing the software Proctorio relies on were not good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wSbt5L"&gt;Not only did the software fail to recognize black faces more than half the time, it wasn’t particularly good at recognizing faces of any ethnicity — the highest hit rate was under 75 percent. In its report, &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; contacted a security researcher, who was able to validate both Satheesan’s results and analysis. Proctorio itself also confirms that it uses OpenCV &lt;a href="https://proctorio.com/licenses"&gt;on its licenses page&lt;/a&gt;, though it doesn't go into detail about how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pHGuGe"&gt;In a statement to Motherboard, a Proctorio spokesperson said that Satheesan’s tests prove that the software only looks to detect faces, not &lt;a href="https://blog.proctorio.com/why-proctorio-does-not-use-facial-recognition/"&gt;recognize the identities associated with them&lt;/a&gt;. Well that may be a (small) comfort for students &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7wxvd/students-are-rebelling-against-eye-tracking-exam-surveillance-tools"&gt;who may rightly be worried about privacy issues&lt;/a&gt; related to proctoring software, it doesn't address the accusations of racial bias at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R51cYl"&gt;This isn’t the first time Proctorio has been called out for failing to recognize diverse faces: the issues that it caused students of color were &lt;a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2021/02/01/u-illinois-says-goodbye-proctorio"&gt;cited by one university&lt;/a&gt; as a reason why it  would not renew its contract with the company. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) even &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/senator-more-transparency-is-needed-by-exam-proctoring-tech-firms/"&gt;called out the company&lt;/a&gt; when talking about bias in proctoring software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laDlFp"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7v8mx/coded-bias-netflix-documentary-ai-ethics-surveil"&gt;racial bias in code is nothing new&lt;/a&gt;, it’s especially distressing to see it affecting students who are just trying to do their school work, especially in a year where remote learning is the only option available to some. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another 500 million accounts have leaked online, and LinkedIn’s in the hot seat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Multinational Companies Based In Dublin" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_bCNDv2blJTC-LlWn845rVL5Els=/0x0:5991x3994/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098647/1230866122.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BGeGCY"&gt;You might still be reeling from the news that personal information from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366822/facebook-personal-data-533-million-leaks-online-email-phone-numbers"&gt;533 million Facebook accounts&lt;/a&gt; has been made freely available online. But now there’s &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; huge batch of people’s data floating around the web — including data from LinkedIn, the Microsoft-owned social network confirmed. And the potential scope of the leak is huge: an individual selling the data on a hacker forum claims it was scraped from&lt;em&gt; 500 million&lt;/em&gt; LinkedIn profiles, &lt;a href="https://cybernews.com/news/stolen-data-of-500-million-linkedin-users-being-sold-online-2-million-leaked-as-proof-2/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;CyberNews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6uidu"&gt;In a purported sample of two million of the profiles for sale, LinkedIn members’ full names, email addresses, phone numbers, genders, and more were visible, &lt;em&gt;CyberNews&lt;/em&gt; found. LinkedIn, however, says the data includes information from many places and wasn’t all scraped from the professional-focused social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9GLmhG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No private member account data from LinkedIn was included”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7q3K79"&gt;“We have investigated an alleged set of LinkedIn data that has been posted for sale and have determined that it is actually an aggregation of data from a number of websites and companies,” reads &lt;a href="https://news.linkedin.com/2021/april/an-update-from-linkedin"&gt;LinkedIn’s statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2aKnH"&gt;The company also contends that “no private member account data from LinkedIn was included” — which perhaps means the scraped data only includes information you’d be able to see on someone’s public page. LinkedIn insists that this was “not a LinkedIn data breach,” which would be technically true if the data was scraped rather than collected by a hacker penetrating LinkedIn’s systems, but doesn’t do much for users whose data is now being sold on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2oQHcg"&gt;LinkedIn has yet to tell us if it will notify users whose data was in the dataset. (Facebook, if you were wondering, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372707/facebook-responds-533-million-data-leak-notify-users"&gt;doesn’t plan to inform users if they are one of the people whose data leaked.&lt;/a&gt;) If you want to check whether your email or phone number was part of the Facebook data leak, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22367727/facebook-data-breach-haveibeenpwned"&gt;we have instructions here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wfxknv"&gt;Italy’s privacy watchdog has started an investigation into LinkedIn, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/linkedin-faces-italian-probe-after-users-data-is-hacked?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;it confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nD0NXW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Personal data of 533 million Facebook users leaks online ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366822/facebook-personal-data-533-million-leaks-online-email-phone-numbers"},{"title":"Facebook isn’t planning to tell you if you’re one of the 533 million people whose data leaked","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372707/facebook-responds-533-million-data-leak-notify-users"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>This webcam dares to ask: what if the panopticon had flesh?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A hunk of synthetic flesh with an eyeball and eyebrow, plopped on top of a screen where a webcam would go. The eye is looking to the left." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X7HevQQW77JOwYuh08Jho02o4Eo=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098537/sidelook.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh boy.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Marc Teyssier&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kZczeC"&gt;Many digital eyes and ears are on us as we move about our daily lives. Surveillance cameras watch us on the street and smart devices listen for us in our homes. What if some of that watching happened through an expressive simulacrum of a human eye?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3PCO6"&gt;Researcher Marc Teyssier took it upon himself to craft such a device, giving a webcam synthetic flesh and a moving eyeball, complete with brow and lashes. Observe: the Eyecam. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A person’s hand tenderly holding a chunk of synthetic flesh with an eyeball in it glancing to the right. There’s a cord coming from the back of it. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8aoPK0OIUIj-_Ws2XHqk5i7IsI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430730/hold2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marc Teyssier&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EtwaJR"&gt;You can see it in action – blinking, glancing, emoting – in the video below, which also commands us to use our imaginations: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6NyqA8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine Eyecam waking up on its own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrfmUS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine Eyecam observing every one of your steps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGIhjI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine Eyecam always being there ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nfL3o"&gt;&lt;em&gt;... even when you don’t want it to be there!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="6ZtU2e"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JMxr8Nq-w_w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GRAqLq"&gt;If you can get past the uncanny valley creepiness, it is a neat device. Watching the people in the video carry it around in their palms makes it look almost cute. And the project, part of research at the Saarland University &lt;a href="https://hci.cs.uni-saarland.de/"&gt;Human-Computer Interaction Lab&lt;/a&gt;, does explore interesting questions. How would we interact with our devices if they were more human? How would our behaviors change if the surveillance around us felt that much more tangible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXCKLJ"&gt;If you’d like to make a watchful companion of your own, the Eyecam’s design and software are &lt;a href="https://marcteys.github.io/eyecam/"&gt;available on Github&lt;/a&gt;, and Teyssier promises a full step-by-step build video is in the works. More details are available at &lt;a href="https://marcteyssier.com/projects/eyecam/"&gt;Teyssier’s website&lt;/a&gt;, along with a plethora of images at each stage of the build process. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pieces of hardware and circuitry assembled in a square, at the bottom is what looks like plastic eyelids on hinges. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MS8yCUoanETSB3KDhHi0YUtCTEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430789/hardware1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marc Teyssier&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eyecam’s innards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Two hands, one braced at the bottom of a container, and the other pulling out a chunk of synthetic flesh with eyelids. The eyeball has not been inserted yet.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And its fleshy exterior. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4kwLnR"&gt;If you’re in the mood to fall into a rabbit hole of eerie gadgets, there’s also Teyssier’s &lt;a href="https://marcteyssier.com/projects/mobilimb/"&gt;phone with a moving finger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://marcteyssier.com/projects/skin-on/"&gt;flesh-covered phone case&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Avengers Campus is finally opening at Disneyland on June 4th, complete with aerial Spider-Man robot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/knTDzCrd1f05Oa45L8q7Yo5BVT0=/183x0:1659x984/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098528/disney_avengers.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An artist’s rendering of the new Avengers headquarters at Disney California Adventure | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/entertainment/disney-california-adventure/avengers-headquarters/" target="_blank"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RpnPJr"&gt;After being delayed for almost a year because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Avengers Campus will finally open at Disneyland, specifically at the Disney’s California Adventure park in Anaheim, California on June 4th, &lt;a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/04/avengers-campus-at-disneyland-resort-set-to-open-and-recruit-super-heroes-june-4/"&gt;according to the company&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/08/avengers-campus-will-open-at-disneyland-on-june-4th.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQRfJW"&gt;The new area will bring Marvel Cinematic Universe characters into the physical space. CNBC reported the Avengers Campus will include character meet-and-greets with Thor, Black Panther, Black Widow, and other MCU heroes (and villains). It’ll feature &lt;a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/attractions/disney-california-adventure/web-slingers-spider-man-adventure/?CMP=ILC-DPFY21Q3wo0408210414210003C"&gt;a new Spider-Man ride&lt;/a&gt; as well as the existing &lt;a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/attractions/disney-california-adventure/guardians-galaxy-mission-breakout/?CMP=ILC-DPFY21Q3wo0408210414210004C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; rescue mission&lt;/a&gt; — plus the debut of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21120300/marvel-spider-man-disneyland-california-avengers-campus"&gt;flying Spider-Man stunt double robot &lt;/a&gt;the company has been teasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/30/17517512/disney-robot-stunt-double-animatronic-superhero"&gt;for years.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wIx77G"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jycw3iiQN2w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="61Kkvn"&gt;Here’s the company’s extremely brief video tour:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GdOG7V"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8t28WOEZNA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FpCnNY"&gt;“We’ve got the ultimate playground for Marvel,” Disney Parks chairman Josh D’Amaro told &lt;em&gt;CNBC.&lt;/em&gt; “As quickly as Kevin [Feige] and that Marvel team can create characters and create stories, we can integrate them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndyJwM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336234/disneyland-reopen-date-california-residents-only"&gt;Disney’s parks in Anaheim will reopen April 30th&lt;/a&gt; to California residents only. The lengthy park closures have hit Disney’s financials hard; the company &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disneyland-to-furlough-more-employees-including-executives"&gt;laid off thousands&lt;/a&gt; of park employees, and in its most recent fiscal quarter, revenue for Disney’s parks division revenue was down 53 percent, to $3.6 billion, the &lt;a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2021/02/q1-fy21-earnings.pdf"&gt;company reported&lt;/a&gt;. The company told investors during a February call that it estimated “the total net adverse impact of COVID-19 on segment operating income in the quarter was approximately $2.6 billion.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nike and MSCHF settle Satan Shoe lawsuit, say any ‘confused’ buyers can get a refund</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MSCHF / Lil Nas X “Satan Shoes”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nmWBkGg5Y1gJSxAQ4Vs75rcXtiY=/64x0:1984x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098340/Exbfpl2WgAAQkl8_resized.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: MSCHF&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cPs4wV"&gt;Nike and the internet collective MSCHF have settled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357225/nike-sues-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-mschf"&gt;their trademark dispute&lt;/a&gt; over a run of unofficially modified Satan-themed Nike sneakers. Neither company disclosed the terms of the deal. But it apparently includes an offer to let customers return their $1,018 “Satan Shoes” — or a pair of MSCHF’s earlier “Jesus Shoes” — for a full refund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PseK3I"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, MSCHF’s attorneys said they were “pleased” with the settlement over the shoes, which were designed in collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X. “With these Satan Shoes — which sold out in less than a minute — MSCHF intended to comment on the absurdity of the collaboration culture practiced by some brands, and about the perniciousness of intolerance,” the attorneys said. They said that the artistic message was also “powerfully” communicated by Lil Nas X’s song “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” and “dramatically amplified” by Nike’s lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iLFQM"&gt;“Having already achieved its artistic purpose, MSCHF recognized that settlement was the best way to allow it to put this lawsuit behind it so that it could dedicate its time to new artistic and expressive projects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fpm0hP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;MSCHF says it’s ‘achieved its artistic purpose’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FuYn1c"&gt;Nike confirmed the settlement in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “MSCHF altered these shoes without Nike’s authorization,” the company said. “As part of the settlement, Nike has asked MSCHF, and MSCHF has agreed, to initiate a voluntary recall to buy back any Satan Shoes and Jesus Shoes for their original retail prices, in order to remove them from circulation. If any purchasers were confused, or if they otherwise want to return their shoes, they may do so for a full refund. Purchasers who choose not to return their shoes and later encounter a product issue, defect, or health concern should contact MSCHF, not Nike.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="touzcf"&gt;It’s unclear how many — if any — buyers will return a pair of limited edition shoes whose value has likely been increased by a major publicity campaign around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EavPzk"&gt;Nike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357225/nike-sues-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-mschf"&gt;sued MSCHF over the Satan Shoes&lt;/a&gt; last week, saying the sneakers — which MSCHF embellished with ink, custom stitching, a pentagram charm, and (allegedly) a drop of blood — had tricked buyers and the public into believing Nike was “endorsing satanism.” MSCHF &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22361961/mschf-nike-unauthorized-satan-shoe-lawsuit-response-restraining-order"&gt;countered by calling&lt;/a&gt; the shoes a protected artistic commentary on “extreme collab culture,” and it said all but one of the 666 Satan Shoe pairs had already been shipped, with the final slated for a giveaway to Lil Nas X fans. However, Nike won the first round of a court battle, with a judge granting a temporary restraining order against MSCHF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wNfsb"&gt;The Satan Shoes case could have set a precedent for how courts treat “upcycled” and heavily modified designer products. But a quiet resolution makes sense for Nike, which was apparently motivated by adverse publicity and potential damage to its reputation. (It did not file a similar suit when the Jesus Shoes were released in 2019, although it said last week that they also infringed its trademark.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkDYxQ"&gt;Meanwhile, MSCHF will apparently retain ownership of that final pair. “I can say that MSCHF intends to keep the last of the 666 shoes; regrettably, it will not be able to have Lil Nas X give that shoe away, as he was planning to do,” MSCHF’s attorneys said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook and Instagram appear to have recovered after brief outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u5acFm9jik_a0ihaectU1pSRf0Q=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098150/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wz0tme"&gt;Facebook and Instagram were down on Thursday afternoon. The outage appeared to start around 5:30PM ET, with several thousand people &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/instagram/"&gt;reporting outages&lt;/a&gt; on DownDetector. The outage is the second one in less than a month from the social media giant; an outage on March 19th took its sites &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340405/instagram-whatsapp-facebook-messenger-down-outage"&gt;offline for several hours&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook returned a “sorry something went wrong” error message:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CTq9ijhz8IEIlwKkaVsxK-QcP1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430835/image__5_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dySLEl"&gt;The company didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on the cause of the outage; it’s unclear at this time when service will be fully restored. The outage appeared to affect Facebook’s internal websites as well, first noted in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1380274375757242368"&gt;tweet from develope&lt;/a&gt;r Jane Wong. Even Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://developers.facebook.com/status/dashboard/"&gt;outage dashboard&lt;/a&gt; appeared to be having problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdjHJs"&gt;Shortly after 6PM ET, Facebook and Instagram appeared to be coming back for most users, but Facebook’s status page never changed to reflect the outage while it was occurring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifxQcS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE April 8th 6:15PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds that Facebook and Instagram have appeared to recover from the outage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTuber records himself trespassing at SpaceX’s Starship facilities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man standing in front of a large silver rocket" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b8n23QGGLXjhirjnZoKVdUiE9f0=/143x0:2624x1654/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098076/Screen_Shot_2021_04_08_at_3.26.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A still from the video originally uploaded to the YouTube channel Loco VlogS.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Loco VlogS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bdr6ac"&gt;A YouTuber recorded himself entering SpaceX’s Starship rocket facilities in south Texas last month, freely sauntering on site. No security stopped him from wandering around the underside of SN11, the 16-story-tall rocket prototype that would launch and explode just a few days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tV3xxY"&gt;The video was posted to a small YouTube channel called Loco VlogS, which is run by “Caesar.” Caesar did not respond to multiple emails and DMs asking for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXLcrC"&gt;For space enthusiasts, SpaceX’s sprawling rocket campus in Texas just a few miles north of the Rio Grande is a tantalizing museum of rocketry just laying out in the open, housing millions of dollars worth of tech — some of which SpaceX has pitched to the Air Force and NASA. It doesn’t have the towering walls or advanced security one might expect a company to have for safeguarding sensitive (and potentially dangerous) rocket hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cd3Uwy"&gt;Development of Starship, the centerpiece of Elon Musk’s goal to ferry humans and cargo to the Moon and Mars, is aided in part by a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242837/nasa-spacex-blue-origin-dynetics-human-lunar-landers"&gt;$135 million NASA contract&lt;/a&gt; to help mature its design under the agency’s Human Lunar Landing system program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imwjhq"&gt;“NASA takes safety and security very seriously,” said Monica Witt, spokeswoman for the agency. “The Human Landing System contracts include requirements for the contractors to appropriately safeguard information, software, and hardware. SpaceX notified NASA that they investigated this incident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zD4X3E"&gt;Caesar entered the rocket site and seemingly moved around SpaceX hardware and equipment with ease, recording closeups of Starship SN11’s Raptor engines. The video garnered 5 likes and at least 100 dislikes, as well as a barrage of comments from pissed-off SpaceX fans, before he deleted it, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-QKLgcN0ig"&gt;different YouTube account&lt;/a&gt; that archived the video. In a classic YouTube move, Caesar posted an apology video a few days later on April 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yU2nP9"&gt;“Yes it was wrong, yes it was illegal,” he said &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKOldPkX9MY"&gt;in the apology video&lt;/a&gt;. “But in my eyes, in that time of moment, I didn’t really think about that... What went through my mind was, ‘Okay, I’m never gonna get this opportunity again.’ So I went for it. And, well, this happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcnmSt"&gt;The Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates launches and launch infrastructure for the sake of public safety, said it was aware of the video and brought it to SpaceX’s attention&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;“Maintaining the physical security of a launch facility is an important aspect of ensuring public safety,” a spokesman said. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W65wM2"&gt;The site has had similar security issues before. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-fan-jailed-cameron-county-texas-boca-chica-launch-site-2019-10"&gt;a SpaceX fan was arrested&lt;/a&gt; after posting pictures of himself near another Starship prototype to social media.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is getting a 4K HDR remaster on June 8th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UOd67LbMoTWJDQSGudCFiuz7tHc=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69097953/mibynf2blvdbb3jl13d1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YwabFK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&lt;/em&gt; — the 2005 CGI spinoff film that dared to ask “What if the already incredible, intricate story of&lt;em&gt; Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; was made even more confusing?” — &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091NQGL8X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is getting a 4K HDR remaster&lt;/a&gt; this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLwbMF"&gt;The newly updated version of the film is due to arrive on June 8th, setting up a week of narrative whiplash for &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; fans who will also get to enjoy the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;PS5 upgrade of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Intergrade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on June 10th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYBxOS"&gt;One might think &lt;em&gt;Advent Children&lt;/em&gt; would be a good next step for fans who have only played the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4"&gt;modern &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a way of preparing for future remade installments. That instinct, I can assure you, would be wrong. The film is actually a pseudo-sequel to the &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; game’s epic and occasionally bewildering story, and it relies heavily on an intimate knowledge of its twists and turns. &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;, by contrast, gives you a mere fraction of the saga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGfwGG"&gt;For example, here’s apparently a wholly accurate description of the film’s key plot point from my colleague Nick Statt, and definitely not a series of random words that he typed into Slack: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="w9u1x0"&gt;The Sephiroth clone cloning himself into Sephiroth using Jenova, from which he is also a clone (?) makes perfect sense. Ok, like technically Sephiroth is not a clone except for he was merged with Jenova cells in the womb so you could make the argument that he’s a clone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DUhMCO"&gt;Despite the somewhat obtuse sci-fi storytelling, &lt;em&gt;Advent Children&lt;/em&gt; was a notable jump forward for fully CGI-animated movies when it was first released in 2005. It offered fans the best look yet (at the time) at favorite characters like Cloud and Tifa in full 3D form, with designs and fight scenes that the blocky graphics and CGI of the PS1 original had only hinted at. And while the film itself has since been eclipsed by the even better-looking (and playable) &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;, that reimagining owes plenty to the foundation that &lt;em&gt;Advent Children&lt;/em&gt; laid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtPdpX"&gt;The upcoming re-release is part of an ongoing renaissance for the sometimes unappreciated movie. &lt;em&gt;Advent Children &lt;/em&gt;also recently got a call-out in &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;: when Cloud’s longtime nemesis Sephiroth was added as a DLC character, &lt;em&gt;Smash Bros. &lt;/em&gt;also updated Cloud’s Omnislash attack to match his multi-sword version from the movie whenever you equip him with his film-inspired outfit as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzbZyY"&gt;Additionally, Square Enix is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301961/final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis-android-ios-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a single-player mobile RPG that aims to span the entirety of the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII &lt;/em&gt;storyline — including &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Advent Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Before Crisis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crisis Core&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Dirge of Cerberus&lt;/em&gt; — into a single, cohesive title. That will either help clear up the confusion surrounding &lt;em&gt;FF7&lt;/em&gt;... or just make it worse. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Please, I need the Robinhood S-1, my family is starving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_6Pjhx8fmlJFma7BmNZTohRmsyA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69097947/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RaeDzE"&gt;I love it when companies go public. I am never more excited than when I get to read a mandatory S-1 filing for the first time. Anything could be in there! Maybe the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;wildly &lt;/em&gt;more people using its products&lt;/a&gt; than I would have guessed. Maybe the company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300835/coinbase-s1-bitcoin-going-public-profit-revenue-invest-crypto"&gt;surprisingly profitable&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20806366/we-company-wework-ipo-adam-neumann"&gt;is WeWork&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLvjtT"&gt;Anyway, there is a new Robinhood regulatory oopsie in the news, and it’s made me even more eager to find out what’s lurking in that document. If I do not get the Robinhood S-1 soon, I will &lt;em&gt;die.&lt;/em&gt; The company has &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/3/23/robinhood-markets-inc-confidentially-submits-draft-registration-statement"&gt;confidentially filed to go public&lt;/a&gt;, but what fun is &lt;em&gt;confidentiality? &lt;/em&gt;There might be some juicy shit in there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jrQZ8E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Start-up sloppiness&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YsIZtI"&gt;Here’s the shape of the new thing: Robinhood allows customers to trade fractions of a share — something that makes it easier for ordinary investors to get into high-priced stocks. The problem, however, is that Robinhood didn’t report these trades to a public data feed, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-robinhood-regulation-tradereporting-e/exclusive-robinhood-failed-to-disclose-certain-trade-executions-to-public-feed-idUSKBN2BV0FZ"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. According to Robinhood, the “vast majority” of these purchases went through wholesale brokers, who reported the trades. (Robinhood executes very few fractional orders itself, a spokeswoman told &lt;em&gt;Reuters.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsWMR0"&gt;This reporting is required by both the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;the Securities and Exchange Commission. Though Robinhood users could buy fractional shares starting in December 2019, the company only began making public reports in January 2021, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJyMS2"&gt;Other brokerages have been fined for this in the past because the missing information makes it harder to price stocks. It’s not the biggest violation — an expert &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; spoke to suggested that Robinhood deserved “a parking ticket” for it — but it suggests something the other Robinhood screw-ups also hint at: start-up sloppiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2lzbB"&gt;Robinhood is where the “move fast and break things” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287381/robinhood-citadel-financial-services-house-day-traders"&gt;tech ethos runs straight into&lt;/a&gt; the “I will kill and eat you, but in a highly regulated way” Wall Street ethos. The most obvious example is the service outages. Remember in January, when Robinhood pissed off the entire internet by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22254656/robinhood-gamestop-stonks-trade-freeze-class-action-lawsuits"&gt;limiting trades on GameStop&lt;/a&gt;? The company hadn’t planned for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;an event of the GameStop scale&lt;/a&gt; and coming up short for clearinghouse requirements. There were also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market"&gt;three huge outages&lt;/a&gt; in March 2020, which Robinhood has said were due to “&lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2020/3/3/an-update-from-robinhoods-founders"&gt;stress on our infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;”; then, as with GameStop, it simply hadn’t planned for an outlier event. Some real fail whale stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MH6cbL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new regulatory thing is small potatoes, but nonetheless illustrative&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A92Cmn"&gt;But the other interesting bit is the &lt;em&gt;regulated&lt;/em&gt; part of Wall Street. Robinhood has run into trouble there, too. For instance, the company &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/robinhood-sec-fine-65-million/"&gt;was fined $65 million&lt;/a&gt; by the SEC for deceiving its customers about “payment for order flow” (PFOF), a practice that lets market makers bundle trades. (It is controversial because, theoretically, it could let banks &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-05/robinhood-gamestop-saga-pressures-payment-for-order-flow"&gt;illegally&lt;/a&gt; front-run trades; in practice, it doesn’t seem like this would be a very good idea because the price on PFOF trades is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than what’s available on the market.) Also, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-settles-claims-it-didnt-ensure-best-prices-for-customer-trades-11576776167?mod=article_inline"&gt;there’s the $1.25 million settlement&lt;/a&gt; on claims that Robinhood didn’t work hard enough to get the best price for its users. This is to say nothing of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-15/robinhood-estimates-hackers-infiltrated-almost-2-000-accounts"&gt;2,000 hacked accounts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xrv8gc"&gt;The new regulatory thing is small potatoes by these standards, but nonetheless illustrative. It’s easier to get away with being sloppy if you’re, like, a social network and there’s no specific government or industry watchdog that’s tasked with keeping you in line. Sure, you might get bad press and a congressional scolding, but that’s about the end of it. This is part of what makes fintech so interesting: if you’re focused on making a pretty app and to hell with the rest of it, you are &lt;em&gt;in trouble.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TC2lS"&gt;The S-1 is the moment of truth. Right now, it’s hard to tell where Robinhood stands. The flush of press earlier this year led to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/why-investors-were-willing-to-write-robinhood-a-3-billion-check-during-the-gamestop-chaos-.html"&gt;a bunch of new users&lt;/a&gt;. Payment for order flow means Robinhood gets paid on every trade, whether the market is going up or down. On the other hand, this company has a habit of falling afoul of regulators. (There is still an &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/massachusetts-regulators-to-file-complaint-against-robinhood-11608120003"&gt;outstanding complaint from Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ6kJI"&gt;Anyway, if you have that S-1 filing, do me a favor and send it my way. I need it. My family is starving, and we need gossip to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycz3vw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 8, 6:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds comments from Robinhood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon is recalling 2.5 million hotspots that could overheat and cause burn or fire damage</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9uhdqQ"&gt;Verizon said Thursday it is working with the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Verizon-Recalls-2-5-Million-Ellipsis-Jetpack-Mobile-Hotspots-Imported-by-Franklin-Wireless-Due-to-Fire-and-Burn-Hazards"&gt;recall 2.5 million hotspot devices&lt;/a&gt; after an investigation found the devices’ lithium-ion batteries could overheat and pose fire and burn hazards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLDBPL"&gt;The Ellipsis Jetpack mobile hotspot models MHS900L, MHS900LS, and MHS900LPP were imported by Franklin Wireless Corp. and sold between April 2017 and March of this year, according to the CPSC. The model numbers are all for the same device but vary depending on how the customer purchased the device — through a consumer prepaid or postpaid plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5FsfJ"&gt;“The safety of our customers is our highest priority,” Verizon &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/statement-regarding-us-consumer-product-safety-commission-recall" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We are taking the situation very seriously, and we are working diligently to determine the cause of the issues with the supplier and to provide replacement devices for all of our customers, free of charge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbhcha"&gt;The CPSC bulletin indicated Verizon had received 15 reports of the devices overheating; six of the reports involved fire damage to bedding or flooring. Two incidents included minor burn injuries, the CPSC said. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Verizon-Recalls-2-5-Million-Ellipsis-Jetpack-Mobile-Hotspots-Imported-by-Franklin-Wireless-Due-to-Fire-and-Burn-Hazards" target="_blank"&gt;CPSC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recalled Ellipsis hotspot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="251h8v"&gt;A Verizon spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that about 1.3 million of the hotspot devices are currently in use by customers. The recall is focused on the entire device, not just the batteries, and customers should not try to remove the batteries themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fVmIa"&gt;Demand for hotspots &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/hotspots-wifi-students-coronavirus-1a08db65-236b-43e8-a5e0-17429a07942a.html"&gt;increased over the past year&lt;/a&gt; during the coronavirus pandemic, with schools and libraries seeking the devices for students who didn’t have internet access at home so they could complete their schoolwork remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtbQCf"&gt;Verizon has sent a software update to the affected hotspots that are powered on that should help reduce the risk of the devices overheating, as it prevents the hotspot from charging up while it’s on. The company also recommends turning off the hotspots while they’re not in use and keeping them on flat surfaces without anything covering them. It’s also not a good idea to expose the hotspot devices to extreme temperatures for long periods, Verizon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaur3T"&gt;To request a replacement hotspot or get more information, customers can go to ellipsisjetpackrecall.expertinquiry.com or call 855-205-2627.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQRx1M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eneqrw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQ9csU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfQqrO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
