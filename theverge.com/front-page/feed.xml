    <title>Trump supporters breach Capitol in worst display of ‘petro-masculinity’ yet</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AXz9eJ"&gt;The concept of “petro-masculinity” was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jburroughsa/status/1346874918454104064"&gt;on full display Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; as Trump supporters and extremists like the Proud Boys haphazardly parked vehicles on the National Mall before breaking into the Capitol, causing an evacuation. The astounding images depict a collective act that is simultaneously wholly un-American and yet completely in line with the psychology of this country as it relates to car ownership, personal freedom, and tendencies toward authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIPvIT"&gt;Petro-masculinity has lingered as a concept for years (&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/05/business/energy-environment/rolling-coal-in-diesel-trucks-to-rebel-and-provoke.html"&gt;think of the discourse around the “rolling coal”&lt;/a&gt; phenomenon), but it was codified in a 2018 paper by political scientist Cara Daggett called “&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0305829818775817"&gt;Petro-masculinity: Fossil Fuels and Authoritarian Desire&lt;/a&gt;.” In it, Daggett explains how “[a]ppreciating the historic relationship between fossil fuels and white patriarchal rule is helpful in terms of understanding the authoritarian desires and anxieties aroused by the Anthropocene.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="thMx4n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;⁦&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NationalMallNPS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NationalMallNPS&lt;/a&gt; ⁦&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PoPville?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@PoPville&lt;/a&gt;⁩ this is a disgrace &lt;a href="https://t.co/MQ8S6FwBQx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/MQ8S6FwBQx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— John Anthony (@jburroughsa) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jburroughsa/status/1346874918454104064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y9J94v"&gt;“Petro-masculinity draws upon aspects of a traditionally hegemonic masculinity, but at the same time, its appearance in the American far-right today is better understood as a kind of hypermasculinity, which is a more ‘reactionary stance,’” Daggett writes. “It arises when agents of hegemonic masculinity feel threatened or undermined, thereby needing to inflate, exaggerate, or otherwise distort their traditional masculinity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfjxtB"&gt;Daggett’s paper is hard to shake when viewing the images taken Wednesday of the Jeeps, Broncos, Hummers, oversized SUVs, and other vehicles that were abandoned on the National Mall lawn by Trump supporters looking to disrupt the confirmation of Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory. Petro-masculinity has manifested many ways during the Trump presidency, like when his supporters participated in “&lt;a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-petro-masculinity-of-this-weekends-trump-highway-ra-1845550339"&gt;highway rallies&lt;/a&gt;” and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/05/us/Texas-boat-parade-trump.html"&gt;boat parades&lt;/a&gt;. But it has also often turned violent, like when &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/31/biden-harris-bus-texas-trump-supporters-highway"&gt;Trump supporters tried to run a Biden campaign bus off the road&lt;/a&gt;, or how people keep &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/01/heather-heyers-mother-on-hate-in-the-us-were-not-going-to-hug-it-out-but-we-can-listen-to-each-other"&gt;driving vehicles into crowds of protesters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESKP0w"&gt;Wednesday’s display, however, feels like petro-masculinity taken to an entirely different level since the end goal of those who trampled the mall with their vehicles was to subvert democracy. Their behavior was so brazen that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1346898825491968000"&gt;even Donald Trump Jr. spoke out in protest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sbp3g"&gt;The scariest part about what happened on Wednesday is that more than one lawmaker is trying to further bolster the ability of Americans to wield their vehicles however they see fit. Proposals have been raised &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/gop-lawmakers-missouri-propose-bills-making-it-legal-hit-protesters-cars-1554280"&gt;in both Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/florida/os-ne-desantis-protest-bill-opposition-20200923-ihsipkhwdncorouj4whycypss4-story.html"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; to make it legal to drive into protesters, in what could be seen as a celebration of sorts of petro-masculinity over the fundamental American rights of free speech and assembly.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Facebook, Twitch, and YouTube are handling live streams of the Capitol mob attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Trump Supporters Hold “Stop The Steal” Rally In DC Amid Ratification Of Presidential Election" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zbYAVQ6xBSGXBsLzVgckDnrWwFM=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68629570/1230454306.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Samuel Corum / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="udDCN2"&gt;A mob of President Donald Trump supporters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;stormed the US Capitol building&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon, and the event was live-streamed. On YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, and more, you could get a view of protesters gathered outside — and eventually &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; — of the US Capitol. In some cases, the streams were monetized through tipping features. In others, streamers encouraged viewers to donate to accounts on Patreon or GoFundMe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHONTI"&gt;The event presented a sudden and serious moderation challenge for YouTube and other platforms, particularly ones that allowed live streams. YouTube, Facebook, and other social media networks prepared for the 2020 elections in November by setting up policies around labeling and banning misinformation and calls for violence. As protests started this afternoon in Washington, DC, however, the platforms were once again asked to assess whether comments on and coverage of the protests were violating their policies in real time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IRpI8s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Commenters posted things like “coup time” and “time to take it back, USA”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N8fG8M"&gt;On YouTube, live streams of the mob illegally occupying the Capitol could be found by searching &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF2OTDQHxu0"&gt;“Stop the Steal”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8EZow4d1Ys"&gt;“Patriot Capitol’.’&lt;/a&gt; While the platform surfaced authoritative feeds from various news sources, including ABC and &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, it wasn’t difficult to find pro-coup channels that were carrying feeds from a variety of other platforms, including Facebook and Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNkfV0"&gt;Within those more radical YouTube feeds, chat rooms reacted live to what they were seeing. Commenters posted things like “coup time” and “time to take it back, USA.” Others expressed bewilderment over the images playing out in the Capitol as people climbed walls, pushed their way through the police presence, and tried to break down doors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSRt5O"&gt;Some streams asked for donations — which were made outside of YouTube, on platforms like PayPal. Monetization features like super chat and super stickers were seen on a couple of live streams viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and a reporter saw ads playing on an RT live stream.  YouTube’s rules say that videos and live streams must adhere to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/community-guidelines/#community-guidelines"&gt;site’s community guidelines&lt;/a&gt; in order to be monetized, and they state that videos inciting or encouraging violence and showing violent imagery are not allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuyVCfPBilG6UMlD1FeBxRst0-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22218237/Screen_Shot_2021_01_06_at_3.43.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the “Super Chat” tips sent into a live stream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Jdxh3W"&gt;Teams at YouTube are “working to quickly remove livestreams and other content that violates our policies, including those against incitement to violence or regarding footage of graphic violence,” according to a spokesperson. Since the attack began, the site’s moderators have removed multiple streams that actively incite or encourage violence or show people carrying firearms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAg8S8"&gt;YouTube does allow certain videos to remain up if they have proper news context, but that’s often judged on a case-by-case basis. On a number of videos that contain terms like “Stop the Steal” or “Patriots Capitol” in the title, YouTube has also included an information box that states “the electoral college has confirmed Joe Biden as president-elect.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rsa6rX"&gt;“We will remain vigilant in the coming hours,” the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVqPZ2"&gt;Outside of live streams, YouTube seemed to surface content from authoritative sources, like &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;and NBC. However, searching YouTube for “Stop the Steal” streams using Google Chrome’s Incognito mode highlighted videos from RT and channels with names like “Agentsix1,” “The Truth,” and “Real News Live.” YouTube has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20992018/youtube-borderline-content-recommendation-algorithm-news-authoritative-sources"&gt;changed its search algorithm&lt;/a&gt; to try to prevent this kind of borderline content — videos that aren’t prohibited, but contain disturbing or harmful subject matter — from surfacing as top results on the platform. It is unclear how effective that measure is in practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRlS3k"&gt;Coverage of the event was harder to find on Twitch. Though the site is built around live video, its search features make it somewhat difficult to find live coverage of political events, so users largely have to browse through the site’s categories to find relevant live broadcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZCygnh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitch commenters responded in astonishment at what they were seeing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eTdnRP"&gt;Most streams on Twitch were from people commenting from afar. Hundreds of people tuned in to watch the streamer HayliNic talk about what she was seeing on CNN’s broadcast of the event at the Capitol, and thousands were tuned into a stream from Hutch, who was chatting over live footage from C-SPAN. The popular political streamer HasanAbi had around 100,000 people watching him talk about the event while flipping between news coverage and aggregated views of various streamers from the protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxpQw5"&gt;Direct streams from DC were less popular. DylanBurnsTV had just under 1,000 people watching his stream while he was standing away from the protests; elsewhere, close to 900 people watched TouringNews’ coverage from within a crowd. Commenters on these streams tended to express their astonishment at what they were seeing, shocked at the protesters’ attempt to stop the certification of the presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8wPCM"&gt;Twitch didn’t appear to have any political labels or warning messages on these streams pointing viewers to verified information, unlike platforms like YouTube and Twitter. Twitch has largely evaded the pressure faced by YouTube and other platforms in recent years, in part because its lengthy broadcasts can be harder to review and in part because the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20915580/twitch-moderation-communities-ceo-emmett-shear-twitchcon"&gt;seems to take a more aggressive stance on moderating speech&lt;/a&gt;, rather than attempting to be a platform for anything and everything. Even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307145/twitch-donald-trump-ban-campaign-account"&gt;President Trump was briefly banned&lt;/a&gt; in June for broadcasting “hateful” language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W98vLr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The tone was decidedly different on pro-Trump social platforms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zSYA4k"&gt;On Facebook, it was easy to find footage from the protests. A stream from NewsNationNow, which was being carried by a number of local news stations, appeared to have more than 20,000 viewers across a number of channels it was being broadcast on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqzMiA"&gt;As the mob stormed the Capitol, Facebook and Instagram continued to allow searches for #StopTheSteal, and the posts were presented without warning labels. It was hard to find live videos through the hashtag on Facebook, which mostly surfaced older information. On Instagram, the hashtag was filled with screenshots of tweets presented alongside photos and videos of people rushing into the Capitol. One video appeared to show police officers pushing back protesters who tried to rush by them further into the building. Instagram told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it is reviewing the hashtag and would take action if it is found to violate the platform’s policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGQXQX"&gt;The tone was decidedly different on Parler — a right-wing Twitter clone — where users mostly posted in support of the protest. “They pushed patriots too far,” one wrote. “1776 HAS COMMENCED AGAIN!!!” wrote another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKDPT8"&gt;On TheDonald.win, a successor to the banned subreddit r/The_Donald, a forum thread was posted as a central location to watch and chat as “PATRIOTS STORM THE CAPITOL.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US Capitol evacuated as pro-Trump mob storms building</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K7QipC"&gt;Pro-Trump protesters have stormed the US Capitol building, effectively halting a vote to certify the results of the 2020 election. The Capitol is currently on lockdown, and lawmakers from both chambers have been evacuated as the mob has breached both congressional chambers and voting floors. Tear gas has reportedly been deployed in the rotunda in an effort to secure the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAUElK"&gt;At least one person has been shot (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TaylerUSA/status/1346913549898149888"&gt;warning: graphic video&lt;/a&gt;) and a number of capitol police have been injured. Several improvised explosive devices have also been recovered and appear to be connected with the mob attack. One was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Phil_Lewis_/status/1346924188930600964"&gt;discovered on the Capitol grounds&lt;/a&gt; while another was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/us/electoral-vote/an-explosive-device-is-found-at-the-rnc-and-the-dnc-is-evacuated"&gt;safely detonated at Republican National Committee headquarters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUCHjY"&gt;One of the protestors who breached the Senate floor has been identified as a prominent promoter of the QAnon conspiracy &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/willsommer/status/1346913949468471302?s=20"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt; reporter Will Sommer&lt;/a&gt;, who covers the group closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="03ffi8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They’re in the chamber. One is up on the dais yelling “Trump won that election!” This is insane &lt;a href="https://t.co/p6CXhBDSFT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/p6CXhBDSFT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Igor Bobic (@igorbobic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/igorbobic/status/1346906369232920576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rac8Bb"&gt;More law enforcement officers are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LeftwithTruth/status/1346913756882870277"&gt;reportedly en route to the building&lt;/a&gt; in an apparent attempt to secure it and the district’s national guard has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanLamothe/status/1346917938843029504"&gt;reportedly been activated&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/byaaroncdavis/status/1346908166030766080"&gt;earlier reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Department of Defense had blocked requests for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eS3ZdL"&gt;Protesters first gathered this week for an extended rally protesting efforts to certify the Electoral College tally for the 2020 presidential election. President Donald Trump spoke at the rally earlier today, encouraging attendees to resist congressional proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0w1LD"&gt;“All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical left Democrats which is what they are doing,” Trump told the crowd. “That’s what they’ve done and what they’re doing. We will never give up, we will never concede.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBXx2w"&gt;After protesters stormed the Capitol, Trump tweeted out a more conciliatory message: “Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yWyYy"&gt;Aside from its political implications, the incident represents a catastrophic and unprecedented breach in congressional security. Typically, visitors to the US Capitol are extensively screened by Capitol Police for weapons and other potentially dangerous materials. The breakdown in security means none of the protesters have been through such screening, and it’s unclear whether any are armed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEkuNT"&gt;DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has declared a citywide curfew from 6PM tonight until 6AM Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GN0PO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mint is getting new features for tracking subscriptions and managing transactions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oJ4lKhZMzXPymvupwGQylxgDOFg=/71x0:599x352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68629189/INT21_Mint_Mercury_Launch_Blog_Social.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Mint&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MvO0SY"&gt;Mint, the free personal finance app from Intuit, is &lt;a href="https://mint.intuit.com/blog/updates/the-latest-mint-features-are-here-to-help-you-gain-financial-empowerment/"&gt;receiving an update today&lt;/a&gt;, adding more automated features like subscription tracking and new “insights” to keep you informed where your money is spent, &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90591464/intuit-mint-new-version-and-alternatives?partner=rss&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&amp;amp;utm_content=rss"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast Company &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Mint’s new features may bring it more in line with the competition from banks and companies like Google that have been nipping at its heels with built-in budget tracking features and other services over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzOSko"&gt;Mint’s main function is tracking spending by automatically sorting transactions based on type. By connecting a checking or savings account, Mint can start combing through purchases to see how much is spent in categories like groceries, electronics, or gas. From there, you can create a budget by setting a limit for each category, and Mint can see when you go over or how much you have left to spend for the month. Mint’s automatic categorization isn’t perfect, but it does save time in comparison to manually labeling each transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/67PFmGNWlsZ2KgfbtHbXb0S490Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217810/i_1_intuit_mint_new_version_and_alternatives.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated Mint app for iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bwHmw6"&gt;The new features in today’s update (arriving first for the iOS app) bring elements of the web version of Mint over to mobile. In the updated Mint app, users will be able to batch edit labels for transactions and view monthly spending in comparison to the previous year. Mint is also gaining the ability to automatically track subscriptions and inform users when prices go up. Intuit is also starting to integrate TurboTax with Mint, beginning with tracking this year’s tax refund. Intuit hopes to allow Mint information to transfer back to TurboTax at some point in the future to make using the software to do taxes a bit easier, according to &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrPIme"&gt;These changes can seem minor, but keeping up with the features of other personal finance apps like Digit, online banks like Simple, and offerings from larger institutions like Chase or Wells Fargo is a big part of keeping Mint relevant. Competition has started coming from outside the worlds of finance and banking as well. Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21571806/google-pay-relaunch-money-payments-finances-deals-offers-banking-plex"&gt;recently revamped version of Google Pay&lt;/a&gt; combines the peer-to-peer payments and card wallet the app originally offered with a bunch of Mint-like features for tracking spending. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20756048/apple-card-availability-sign-up-cancel-apr-iphone-goldman-sachs"&gt;Apple offers tracking for spending&lt;/a&gt; for Apple Card owners in the Apple Wallet app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzIuaQ"&gt;The Mint update should hit iPhones today, with an Android release to come in “about a month.” If you’re curious about some other solid apps for budgeting, you can check out some of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s favorite picks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538137/budget-apps-mint-buxfer-ynab-google-sheets"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new app allows teachers to use their iPhone or iPad as an overhead camera on Zoom</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the app that shows it acting as an overhead camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4PLvwcOTk0J0iTFrJEFy5eVDh-Y=/0x1733:1600x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68629107/iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABkAAAArwCAYAAAD8ZvemAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAJ8WlUWHRYTUw6Y29tLmFkb2Jl_2_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gD8eq4"&gt;Teachers who have found themselves holding class over Zoom have probably already figured out clever hacks to show their students documents, but there’s now an app designed specifically for that purpose (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/06/iphone-document-camera-overviewer-zoom"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Overviewer was made by developer Charlie Chapman, and it allows teachers (or anyone, really) to easily use their phone’s camera as a replacement for an overhead document viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyB2Z3"&gt;If it’s been a minute since you were a student, or if your school didn’t have these overhead devices, they’re basically webcams pointing straight down that allow teachers to show students a printed document, book, hand drawing, or other piece of writing or image. It’s a useful ability to have, but many teachers are working from home because of COVID and may not have access to one like they would in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Top-down view of a printed book, shown in a Zoom call" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lOMkD7BgbF4qsARgKTu2WSOXNC0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217793/Screen_Shot_2021_01_06_at_9.24.06_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Participants in the Zoom call only see what your phone’s camera sees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wdoQAj"&gt;Overviewer works as a replacement by taking advantage of Zoom’s built-in screen sharing feature that &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201379235-Sharing-your-screen-iOS-with-the-Zoom-Desktop-Client"&gt;works with the iPhone when its connected to a computer&lt;/a&gt; with a Lightning cable, or wirelessly through AirPlay (at the moment, it doesn’t seem like Zoom offers this feature for Android users). It shows a feed from your phone’s camera on the screen, with nothing else getting in the way. The feature also offers the ability to turn your phone’s flashlight on if your lighting situation isn’t ideal, as well as the option to change which camera is being displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLQyQW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://charliemchapman.com/posts/2021/6/overviewer/"&gt;In a heartwarming blog post&lt;/a&gt; about how he developed the app for his wife, who works as a kindergarten teacher, Chapman explains how he saw his wife using iOS’s built-in camera app to do the same thing, and how she was frustrated by the lack of landscape support and all the buttons overlaid on-screen: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yr4Ppv"&gt;So being the dorky husband that I am, I quickly built an app that does nothing other than show what the phone camera sees with zero chrome, and properly rotates the whole app so that you can share it in landscape on zoom. This did the trick and she actually used it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y6IyY"&gt;It’s pretty tailor made for exactly my wife’s use case but I would think that would be a pretty common one for teachers to be in right now in our current virtual teaching world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3EdVoS"&gt;If you’re a teacher, or are thinking of some other use for the app, it’s &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1528900395"&gt;available for free on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth noting that if you’re using a Mac, Zoom will ask for permission to record your screen and have to be restarted in order to share your phone’s screen (this is because Zoom is just displaying your phone’s screen on your computer, and then capturing that window).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52K48v"&gt;For more information on how the app works, the developer has made a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fadOMMpQErg&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;how-to video&lt;/a&gt;, which you can watch below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IBH0TN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fadOMMpQErg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Get two years of PlayStation Plus for only $58 today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DVSQpAjx8f2Q4yAofLfOJirplqY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628804/vpavic_4261_20201023_0104.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kL1fDL"&gt;If you were gifted a PS5 over the holidays or still own a PS4 and need to renew your PlayStation Plus membership, you can snag two &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year PlayStation Plus subscriptions at Eneba&lt;/a&gt; for $58 when you enter the discount code &lt;strong&gt;2021PLUS&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout (while supplies last). Usually, one year of PlayStation Plus would set you back $60, so getting two one-year subscriptions for less than the normal retail price is a real bargain, and this promotion will likely sell out quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQj3JL"&gt;Ideally, this is great for a PS4 or PS5 user looking to stack up on PlayStation Plus subscriptions for the next two years, or if you want to gift one PlayStation Plus membership to a friend and keep the other one for yourself. If you don’t need more than one PlayStation Plus membership, Eneba has another promotion allowing you to buy &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one year for just $30&lt;/a&gt; with code &lt;strong&gt;JANDEALS. &lt;/strong&gt;Otherwise, it’s $31 without the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MQwTru"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WuHKu4"&gt;When testing out the deal, I found that the &lt;strong&gt;2021PLUS &lt;/strong&gt;discount code will only work if you have two PlayStation Plus one-year subscriptions in your cart. The codes are also region-locked, so you will need a US PlayStation Network account to redeem the membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCXwka"&gt;PlayStation Plus is a paid online subscription service that comes with a ton of perks for members, including occasional discounts during PlayStation Store sales and free games that usually switch up on a monthly cadence, among other things. A PlayStation Plus subscription is compatible with both the PS4 and PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yJ1Yx"&gt;Additionally, PS5 owners receive an additional incentive for having an active PlayStation Plus subscription: access to the PlayStation Plus Collection, a digital library of “generation-defining” first- and third-party games that were released on the PS4, such as &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; God of War&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 10’s taskbar is getting a big update with new weather and news widget</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h_s6sLof4IpuTYrkn6EdvdUBGIg=/0x0:5280x3520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628671/windows10newtaskbar.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Windows 10 taskbar feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VsJ8oy"&gt;Microsoft is making a big change to its Windows 10 taskbar soon, with the addition of a news and weather widget. The new feature is available to testers today, and it will allow Windows 10 users to access a feed of news, stocks, and weather information straight from the taskbar. You’ll be able to quickly glance at the weather without having to open the Start menu, install a third-party app, or check online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMEstS"&gt;The taskbar feature will pop out into a mini feed of content that can be personalized with the latest sports news, headlines, and weather information. Microsoft is using its Microsoft News network to surface news and content from more than 4,500 sources. The company has been curating this through artificial intelligence in recent months, and this particular feature will also learn what news is relevant to you when you dismiss or like stories in the feed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xgJePA2zr0NxBXfhmVoFAsNbjLY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217675/News_and_interests_video.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new taskbar widget includes weather and news information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Nxy2lI"&gt;Microsoft is starting to test this new feature with its Windows Insiders on the dev channel of Windows 10 today, and it will likely be available to all users later this year. It will only be initially available to testers in the US, Canada, UK, Australia, and India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y3sm4K"&gt;This new taskbar feature will also require Microsoft’s Chromium-based Edge to be installed on a PC. That means any link you click within the feature will force you into Edge to read it, and Microsoft is presenting content in the reading view by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYMt6N"&gt;You can of course disable this new taskbar feature, and Microsoft says it will be an ad-free experience. It does appear to be more useful than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/28/15474608/microsoft-windows-10-my-people-integration-feature"&gt;People Bar that Microsoft built into Windows 10&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago. The People Bar acts as a quick way to access contacts, but it only supports apps like Mail and Skype and not big third-party messaging services.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo once laughed Xbox execs out of the room over a Microsoft acquisition offer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AkzBtoTAO7WkHgb-ZaadulKbpq8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628599/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BESlMO"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox consoles are considered a pillar of the industry, part of a trifecta that makes up modern gaming. The first Xbox launched in 2001; the Xbox Series X and S arrived just last year. Today, Xbox is a powerhouse, yet it wasn’t always so. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-06/xbox-the-oral-history-of-an-american-video-game-empire?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s Dina Bass published an oral history on the creation of Microsoft’s Xbox that recounts the console’s conception, from an executive retreat through release day — with snags like a failed bid at Nintendo detailed along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ncx0EK"&gt;The original Xbox was known as Midway — or Coffin Box to some, according to Xbox technology officer Seamus Blackley, “because they worried that it would fail and end their career at Microsoft.” As part of an effort to lock in exclusive games, Microsoft tried to acquire companies like Electronic Arts, Midway Games, and Square. Kevin Bachus, director of third-party relations, says that president and later Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer also made the team meet with Nintendo. Their pitch revolved around the technical powers of the Xbox. It did not go as planned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uew2dv"&gt;“They just laughed their asses off,” Bachus told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “Like, imagine an hour of somebody just laughing at you. That was kind of how that meeting went.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0GnST"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-06/xbox-the-oral-history-of-an-american-video-game-empire?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s story&lt;/a&gt; goes on to explore the console’s actual achievements, including its successful bid for &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;creator Bungie. The full piece is well worth a read, especially for the anecdote about an unnamed Konami executive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lu9xQk"&gt;As for Nintendo, chairman of Nintendo America Howard Lincoln told the publication that  the company “does not talk about confidential discussions with other companies. In any event, nothing came of these discussions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NniyCM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1PzsS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix on the Wii U and 3DS will shut down on June 30th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nintendo Wii U GamePad (555px)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GKGlru1_IBtpqOHJSJb8MEPsnZY=/2x0:554x368/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628525/DSC_2612-555px.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0D2EL1"&gt;Nintendo is winding down support for the Netflix app on the Wii U and 3DS. The app will be shut down for existing users on June 30th, and if you’ve never downloaded it, it isn’t available anymore. You can redownload the app if you’ve downloaded it in the past, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgGTD1"&gt;“Starting Dec 31st, 2020, the Netflix app will no longer be available for new users to download from Nintendo eShop on the Wii U console or Nintendo 3DS family of systems,” Nintendo said in a statement on the listings for the &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/netflix-wii-u/"&gt;Wii U&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/netflix-3ds/"&gt;3DS&lt;/a&gt; Netflix app. “During that time, it will be possible for existing users to re-download these applications. Service for existing users will continue until June 30th, 2021. Thank you to everyone who enjoyed Netflix on these platforms over the years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfGfzo"&gt;Nintendo discontinued the 3DS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21441096/nintendo-3ds-production-discontinued-total-sales"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; and quickly moved on from the Wii U in favor of the Nintendo Switch, so it’s not all that surprising that the company is shutting down the Netflix app on the older platforms. But Netflix still isn’t on the Switch, despite former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé saying days after the Switch’s launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/8/14852624/nintendo-switch-netflix-hulu-amazon-support"&gt;in March 2017&lt;/a&gt; that the company was talking with companies like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon about bringing their services to the console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eI69ww"&gt;Hulu launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/11/16633818/nintendo-switch-hulu-app-perfectly-good-streaming-gadget"&gt;in November 2017&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s still no Netflix app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump administration finalizes rule that could define gig workers as contractors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AdYcyX1SsRN16FZ3CGKudTSIosM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628412/akrales_180614_1777_0235.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MM2xjF"&gt;The US Department of Labor has finalized a decision that could make it easier for “gig economy” companies to classify their workers as independent contractors, rather than employees that can claim legal benefits. The Trump administration released its &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20210106"&gt;final version&lt;/a&gt; of the rule today, and it’s set to take effect on March 8th, although this could change after President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFJatD"&gt;The DOL proposed a &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/dol-debuts-rule-to-ease-employers-use-of-independent-contractors"&gt;new framework&lt;/a&gt; last year for classifying employees and contractors. It &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa/2021-independent-contractor"&gt;focuses on&lt;/a&gt; two “core factors” for distinguishing the two: the “nature and degree of control over the work” and the “opportunity for profit or loss” based on initiative and investment. It also lists additional “guideposts” that include “the amount of skill required” for the job, the “degree of permanence” of the working relationship, and whether the work is part of an “integrated unit of production.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7YxND"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/business/economy/labor-gig-workers.html"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; noted&lt;/a&gt; last year, the rule is interpreting existing regulations rather than establishing new ones, and it only covers federal laws enforced by the DOL. States can still establish their own definitions — like California’s Prop 22, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174600/uber-lyft-new-benefits-california-drivers-prop-22-gig-economy"&gt;which specifies&lt;/a&gt; that Lyft and Uber drivers aren’t employees. However, it could still broadly influence how companies define their workers. The nonprofit labor rights group National Employment Law Project called it a “narrowing” of the standards rather than a meaningful clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
