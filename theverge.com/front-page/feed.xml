    <title>GTA Online is getting an underground nightclub featuring real-world resident DJs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RE4qKAWWBjBLfcifoL147Ba2MLM=/0x126:1080x846/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68471157/GTA_Online___12_7_2020___The_Music_Locker___Moodymann.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rockstar Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="heSwTZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online &lt;/em&gt;is soon getting its own concert venue with the planned opening of The Music Locker, an underground nightclub that will feature real-world DJs in residence. The &lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/61822/the-music-locker-the-underground-club-for-everyone"&gt;announcement on Monday&lt;/a&gt; means developer Rockstar Games is taking cues from other savvy multiplayer games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Roblox. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfF7MM"&gt;Those games and many others in the online social scene have begun transforming their virtual spaces into entertainment destinations that, amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, have become vital ways to fill the gap left by the lack of live music and other real-world events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ifVqfp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rockstar is following ‘Fortnite’ and ‘Roblox’ in turning its online virtual world into a live music space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hQcYgQ"&gt;Epic’s approach with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;has been to book big-name acts in electronic music and hip-hop, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21244874/fortnite-diplo-concert-jordan-fisher-party-royale"&gt;Diplo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt;, to perform surreal sets on its virtual island, all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike"&gt;as part of its new Party Royale mode&lt;/a&gt;. But Rockstar is aiming for a more realistic approach grounded in the real-world underground electronic music scene. The developer is designing The Music Locker like a venue you might actually attend in real life, located beneath The Diamond in-game casino and resort in its fictionalized version of Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9INE8C"&gt;The Music Locker has also secured iconic names in DJing like Detroit-based producer Moodymann and Berlin collective Keinemusik to be its first artists in residence, each seemingly getting their own custom &lt;em&gt;GTA Online &lt;/em&gt;avatars. Rockstar will even let you enjoy high-roller status with VIP perks you can only obtain if you’ve purchased a penthouse suite at The Diamond. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M8o_1mE6i1fMnfCGfWd-pRJk-Tw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150859/GTA_Online___12_7_2020___The_Music_Locker___Club.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Rockstar Games&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gchfbm"&gt;This isn’t a big departure for the &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; franchise. The open-world crime series has always secured high-profile artists for its in-game radio stations. One of its most prominent additions to 2013’s &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V &lt;/em&gt;was producer Flying Lotus, who was given his own radio station (FlyLo FM) and the liberty to curate his own track list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhoNfe"&gt;But given the current environment around events and entertainment, it makes sense Rockstar would want to find ways to give fans of &lt;em&gt;GTA Online &lt;/em&gt;a way to experience at least some of the sensations of live music. And it’s also doing so in a way that gives artists a chance to perform again, specifically DJs and producers (and not just huge mainstream ones) who have been hit hard by the complete evaporation of real-world nightlife during the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia expands to eight more European countries, just in time for Cyberpunk 2077</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jIHETxhrkNvJg4dLYcQAgt-TsWU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68471005/akrales_191113_3779_0284.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="10NpM3"&gt;Google Stadia is expanding internationally, adding eight more countries in Europe today. The new markets include Austria, Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Switzerland, bringing the total number of countries the cloud gaming service supports from 14 to 22. The service should be available in the newly added locations within the next 24 hours, and Google says you just need a Gmail address to sign up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWoouB"&gt;Stadia just celebrated its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575100/google-stadia-one-year-anniversary-cloud-gaming-cyberpunk-2077-launch-test"&gt;anniversary last month&lt;/a&gt; with a slew of new announcements, including the addition of its first two free-to-play games (&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Bomberman R Online&lt;/em&gt;) and its plans to introduce an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21571908/google-stadia-apple-ios-iphone-web-app-testing-safari-cloud-gaming"&gt;iOS version of Stadia delivered via mobile Safari&lt;/a&gt; in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxzCHJ"&gt;Google is now gearing up for its biggest game launch ever: CD Projekt Red’s &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; arriving on consoles, PC, and Stadia simultaneously on December 10th. The company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/19/21572301/cyberpunk-2077-google-stadia-free-premiere-kit-preorder-deal"&gt;running a limited promotion&lt;/a&gt; that gives users who preorder the game (or buy it within its first week) a free Stadia Premiere Edition, which includes a Google Chromecast Ultra and Stadia controller. With new next-gen consoles out from Microsoft and Sony, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; will be a big test for Stadia’s viability as a PlayStation and Xbox alternative. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 is huge, ambitious, and safe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XUg4z5s3vSjetd3ufvvoDb7MV5Y=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68471032/Cyberpunk2077_No_Future_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A Night City too big to get weird&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GbykyP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Night City was like a deranged experiment in social Darwinism, designed by a bored researcher who kept one thumb permanently on the fast-forward button.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F82W5"&gt;That line, from William Gibson’s 1984 novel &lt;em&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/em&gt;, helped define the genre now known as cyberpunk. The book conjures a world where today’s cutting-edge trends are tomorrow’s embarrassing cliches and where desperate hustlers can rise overnight and fade without a trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5iNjDR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, the long-awaited game by &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; studio CD Projekt Red, is about a place called Night City. But in its version, the past is never far away. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/6/12/3080660/cyberpunk-2020-getting-not-just-a-video-game-but-a-new-tabletop-game"&gt;announced in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s based on a tabletop series that launched in 1988. After years of work and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/21575914/cyberpunk-2077-release-crunch-labor-delays-cd-projekt-red"&gt;reportedly months&lt;/a&gt; of brutal crunch time, CD Projekt Red has delivered on an incredibly ambitious vision: a vast virtual city with a complex narrative and roleplaying system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Z7NqF"&gt;It’s done that by playing all those elements extremely safe and straight. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is a frequently satisfying and sometimes impressive game, but despite its setting in the fast-moving future, it’s almost never a surprising one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="C5B4sn"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BO8lX3hDU30?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="10GwJi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;takes place in the eponymous year 2077 and the aforementioned Night City, a California megalopolis where interlocking freeways thread between skyscrapers and street markets. (Imagine Los Angeles with mile-high holo-billboards and pedestrian-friendly urban planning.) Following a de facto breakup of America, this failed urban utopia has become an autonomous zone dominated by gangs and multinational corporations. Every street-level surface has been plastered with sexed-up ads and nihilistic graffiti, while the ultra-rich have retreated into cavernous hotels and apartments with a literally gilded servant class. Most citizens are disposable, and all bodies are malleable, ripe for dramatic cybernetic modding that blends flesh with chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mu0RZr"&gt;Your protagonist is a mercenary named V, hailing from one of three possible backgrounds: 2077’s small corporate overclass, Night City’s teeming slums, or the nomadic groups outside the city. My V was a neon-haired corporate raider, for instance, and got a short origin-story mission about being dragged into a bloody interdepartmental conflict. After this introduction, V becomes one of countless freelancers drifting through Night City’s demimonde. Then they join a heist arranged by a flinty femme fatale, and naturally, the job falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6450Ae"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sexed-up billboards, nihilistic graffiti, and a literally gilded service class&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mwffiN"&gt;V witnesses a cold-blooded crime by one of Night City’s biggest power players. In the ensuing chaos and coverup, they end up with a piece of dangerous experimental technology. They also resurrect the digital ghost of a Night City legend: metal-armed punk rocker terrorist Johnny Silverhand, voiced by Keanu Reeves. While suffering Johnny’s cynical quips and frustrated outbursts, they have to figure out who built the tech and how to stop its deadly effects, appealing to criminals and corporate loyalists who will all but inevitably stab them in the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fEjPQ"&gt;This is just one thread in a narrative that’s big even by the standard of most open-world games. I finished &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; in 40 hours, which covered most of the major side missions and a fair amount of cruising around Night City, but left a lot of smaller tasks undone. Every neighborhood is packed with jobs to discover, conversations to overhear, and random crimes to stop. As you get more powerful, local fixers and crime bosses start reaching out for help. (They also keep trying to sell you secondhand cars, which, frankly, seems like something a decent capo should delegate.) Beyond the divergent opening missions, you’ll find a couple of major endgame story branches, depending on where you place your loyalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Night City overhead view in Cyberpunk 2077" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YrjuV8r1c7AYh_6FrfObA7rMvm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150423/Cyberpunk2077_Above_it_all_RGB.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QooZmf"&gt;Looking at &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; map is an overwhelming experience, with waypoint icons packed so tight that selecting any given item requires zooming in. But the game does a great job of spinning extended side arcs from a few core missions. After its calamitous first act, you’re given multiple leads that can advance the main goal. Tracking them down requires cutting deals with new characters and contacting the heist’s other participants. These partners ask for help with their own problems, which might continue a subplot from the main story or open the door to a fresh Night City subculture. You’ll find a lot of quick one-off gigs, but also several optional sections that feel key to V and Johnny’s saga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eNzHwm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Modern cyberpunk is both a broad vibe and a specific retro-future setting&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yuu92A"&gt;Unfortunately, much of this saga feels extremely rote. In the way that &lt;em&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;/em&gt; codified Tolkienesque fantasy, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; distills the most recognizable elements from influential fiction like &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/em&gt;. The loosely defined cyberpunk genre began as a grounded alternative to space operas and post-apocalyptic wastelands, heavily influenced by hardboiled fiction. In the decades since, it’s so thoroughly permeated science fiction that its innovations have become cliches. Today, “cyberpunk” has two contradictory meanings: tech-heavy futuristic media that feels organically grown from present-day social conditions, and a specific set of 1980s and ‘90s-influenced retro-future noir conventions. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is a version of the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPzcAr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; sits in an alternate timeline where the Soviet Union still exists, Japan is a cultural and economic superpower, and big cities are chaotic warzones. The game is set several decades after the original tabletop release, and CD Projekt Red tones down its retro aesthetic enough to avoid ostentatious anachronism. But there are periodic flashbacks to an earlier era, creating a strangely hilarious setup where 2077 looks sort of like real-world 2020, and the fictional 2020s were actually the sci-fi 1980s, right down to vinyl records and eye-mounted camcorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JSVpk"&gt;Modern fantasy stories, including CD Projekt Red’s &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; games and the novels on which they’re based, have distinguished themselves by subverting older genre tropes. That’s often meant producing grittier stories with more realistic social dynamics. But ice-cold, swaggering grittiness was cyberpunk’s stereotypical starting point, and &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; almost never deconstructs, examines, or builds on its basics. Corporate executives are masters of cold-blooded power games. Fixers do business from smoke-filled bars. Cybernetic escorts haunt the streets. Artists are comfortable sellouts or sociopathic geniuses, including one played by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21019945/cyberpunk-2077-soundtrack-grimes-run-the-jewels-cd-projekt-red-game-awards-trailer"&gt;soundtrack contributor Grimes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3xx2Si"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Parts of Night City’s future are eternally relevant&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PML4t2"&gt;Despite being well-worn, plenty of cyberpunk tropes have survived because they ring true. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; depicts a hyper-stratified society that rewards cruelty, exploits vulnerability, and commercializes absolutely everything, something that resonates as much today as it might have decades ago. The game’s conventions sometimes seem to help it avoid facile current-event references while still feeling contemporary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzKhDu"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; also falls into irritating caricature. V’s partner, Jackie, is a well-developed blend of streetwise cynicism and deeply buried hopefulness, except that his dialogue is overladen with &lt;a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/7363-i-m-all-in-on-cyberpunk-2077-but-one-element-of-the-e3-demo-disappointed-me"&gt;random and awkward Spanish asides&lt;/a&gt;. The game straightforwardly reproduces ‘80s cyberpunk’s &lt;a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/features/fear-of-a-yellow-planet-why-we-need-to-actually-understand-cyberpunk/"&gt;surface-level fascination&lt;/a&gt; with Japan and China, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/bringing-a-katana-to-a-gunfight-1845257825"&gt;arming Japanese gangsters with katanas&lt;/a&gt; and building Japanese characters around archetypes like the honor-bound samurai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCVHqC"&gt;Like the USSR hanging together, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; race and gender worldbuilding can feel like an alt-history relic instead of a wild new future. It matter-of-factly lets you customize V’s voice, body shape, and genitalia separately, but nonbinary people apparently don’t inhabit what’s supposedly a weird gender-bending society, so characters will just read your voice as male or female and respond to you accordingly. And despite extreme body modding being totally ubiquitous, transgender women are seemingly still an &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2019/6/12/18662443/cyberpunk-2077-trans-advertisement-cd-projekt-red-e3-2019"&gt;exotic oddity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Jackie, your partner in Cyberpunk 2077, in front of a table dancer at a nightclub." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jO04j0kPbeInarM70TADaoeBmY8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150438/Cyberpunk2077_Ladies_And_Gentleman_The_US_Cracks_RGB.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dnMbFu"&gt;All of these details were noted before &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; release, and they’ve granted the game &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/22058784/cyberpunk-2077-marketing-cd-projekt-red-transphobia"&gt;a culture war hotbed status&lt;/a&gt; that it deeply does not merit. As &lt;a href="https://www.vg247.com/2020/06/24/cyberpunk-mike-pondsmith-games-politics/"&gt;tabletop series author Mike Pondsmith&lt;/a&gt; has stated, building the rules of a detailed fictional society is inherently political. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk &lt;/em&gt;imports social conflicts for dramatic effect, like a long subplot about sex workers — a &lt;a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-a-game-i-dont-trust-has-thoughts-on-protecting-sex-workers/"&gt;vulnerable class of real people&lt;/a&gt; — trying to overthrow their bosses. But these conflicts don’t feel like successful &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; failed social commentary, just stock neo-noir conceits that happen to involve oppression. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is a particular brand of exploitation: a piece of fiction that doesn’t add much to the stories and ideas it’s borrowing, but uses them effectively to deliver crowd-pleasing fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdGlT3"&gt;And seriously — &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is fun. CD Projekt Red has created a sprawling yet densely populated world where even meandering freeways, outlying deserts, and rows of factory-farm greenhouses feel beautifully crafted. It turns the already eerie and dystopian California road network into a veritable maze, with cross-borough trips sending you through a tangle of cement overpasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KBFsjz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I can destroy you with my brain four different ways&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O2vWIh"&gt;On top of that, the game includes open-ended roleplaying and some elements reminiscent of immersive sims like &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex&lt;/em&gt;. Scavenged or purchased clothes and weapons are supplemented by a complicated upgrade tree for the game’s key stats, which include strength, dexterity, and “cool” (which roughly corresponds to sneakiness). You can also visit back alley technicians called ripperdocs, who install bionic weapons and swappable upgrades with specific perks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5Tz31"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, you can approach many areas by slipping past enemies undetected, or you can shoot everyone in sight. There’s a fairly clever hacking minigame that provides blanket benefits, making enemies more vulnerable or glitching out security cameras. There are also instant “quickhacks” for specific actions. On the stealth side, that includes deactivating turrets or making vending machines chirp to distract enemies. In combat, you can literally fry enemies’ brains by making their implants malfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEIoQp"&gt;All of these systems help carry &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk’s&lt;/em&gt; considerable length. Instead of rewarding hyper-specialization, the game encourages versatility, mixing up firefights with sneaky sections. Quickhacks add a touch of much-appreciated absurdity to combat. It’s remarkably satisfying to infiltrate a criminal hideout, incapacitate a cluster of mooks by uploading some kind of contagious poison brain virus, wait for their buddies to notice, start a shootout with your futuristic-looking “tech pistol,” then knock the final gangster out with mind powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BfDpff"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Cyberpunk 2077’ is a powerful machine with a million slick toggles, but a lot of them feel disconnected&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yXwqv0"&gt;Like the setting, though, most of these features feel borrowed from other, more thoughtfully constructed games. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; areas have shortcut doors that high-tech or high-strength players can unlock, but not the clever puzzle-box design you’d find in &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Dishonored&lt;/em&gt;. You can choose to kill enemies or incapacitate them, but beyond a thread of missions where you have to bring targets in alive, this option barely affected my gameplay style or character interactions. (My chosen weapon was a normal pistol fitted with a special non-lethality chip from a gun vendor, and I’m still puzzling over how that’s supposed to work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VewJi"&gt;Similarly, your stats and background in &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; produce occasional extra dialogue choices, but they rarely changed how my conversations unfolded. Many games’ roleplaying choices are obviously crude binaries or illusions. Even so, those illusions — like Telltale’s infamous warning that &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/7/6/8900975/telltale-games-parenting"&gt;&lt;em&gt;someone will remember that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — help draw players into a story. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful machine with a million slick toggles, but a lot of them feel conspicuously disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1sCo2"&gt;This had a silver lining for me as a reviewer, granted, because &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; pre-release PC build was full of unpredictable bugs. One mercenary would repeatedly reappear behind me when I knocked him unconscious, forcing me to simply shoot him. Some unconscious enemies clipped through floors and exploded when I tried to move their bodies. I reloaded one intense boss fight after all participants were mysteriously rendered immortal. Oversensitive collision physics made perfect stealth almost unviable since walls and boxes would occasionally decide I was invading their personal space and push me into an enemy’s sights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bO98BO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Forgiving gameplay made weird bugs less frustrating&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JJOa8R"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; were a game for perfectionists, I’d consider these serious problems. And I obviously hope CD Projekt Red will fix them quickly; it’s already rolled out one round of pre-release bug patches. But in a huge sandbox with a generous autosave system, they weren’t actually dealbreakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdNVDI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; has been hyped as a triumph of next-generation gaming, and its sheer size certainly takes advantage of modern computer and console specs. (My PC was&lt;em&gt; barely &lt;/em&gt;powerful enough for the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/20/21581393/cyberpunk-2077-pc-system-requirements-specs-ray-tracing-gpu-rtx"&gt;vaunted ray-tracing options&lt;/a&gt;, and I mostly left them deactivated. My colleagues will be delving into its graphics after release.) I’ve been cautiously excited about &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; for years, and it’s almost exactly the game I expected: not terribly memorable, but campy and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="566hy4"&gt;Given just how much crunch and controversy &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;has generated, though, I can’t deny being a little disappointed — especially when the game delivers fragments of something more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnNz55"&gt;Reeves’ character Johnny Silverhand, for instance, is almost purely a leather-clad 20th century counterculture sketch. But there’s lots of potential in any belligerent idealist getting to see his legacy and mostly hating what he finds. In my favorite minor side mission, Johnny’s hologram stops to listen to a busker, prompting you to hunt down a bootleg from his old band Samurai. You get the record by finding a street vendor who’s a Samurai superfan, then reciting some trivia to prove you’re worthy of the goods. Johnny watches the whole nostalgia-drenched conversation with obvious embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxpLkD"&gt;This encounter never really goes anywhere, although Samurai plays a significant role in the story. But it’s an oddly self-aware moment for a game built on capturing a bygone era’s cool factor. Instead of trying to drop players in an archetypal cyberpunk setting, CD Projekt Red could have pushed the idea further, imagining how an alternative retro-future might evolve — and it might have turned out more interesting than &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; chain-smoking gangsters and console cowboys. But maybe this Night City was too big to get truly weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Qba36P"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;will be released December 10th on PC, Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S, and Xbox Series X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reminder: your Neopets are dying</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GDJ7i8dhyar05j8rlLIDuZI0QgI=/185x0:1015x553/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68470891/Neopets_Merch.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Neopets&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ETofBz"&gt;You know good and well what you did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXEl3g"&gt;Back in 2003 or whatever, you took young, innocent Neopets under your wing. A Gelert, a Jetsam, a Scorchio, or whatever the hell the penguin one was called. You promised that under your tutelage, they would thrive. You promised you would feed them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73vZOK"&gt;And yet you didn’t feed them, did you? Your Neopoints piled up and you spent them on plushies, faerie quests, paintbrushes, and you watched your pets deteriorate right before your eyes. Their pictures saddened; tears appeared in their eyes. Their hunger status changed over time — “very hungry” to “famished” to “starving” to “dying.” Every time you logged onto that cursed site, even if just to hammer out a few levels of &lt;em&gt;Typing Terror&lt;/em&gt;, you were emphatically reminded that your beloved pets were on the brink of death.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cjx7VMAXyAW_5ev5RRfWeA_VKDs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150640/Screen_Shot_2020_12_07_at_10.48.26_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hot Topic&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SWChBk"&gt;This practice, of course, begs a number of philosophical questions. Does it give Neopets users a purpose in life, something to strive for in the Neo-world? Probably. Does it help prepare kids for adulthood, where they’ll someday have to face their own mortality? It’s possible. Does it warn people not to put themselves in charge of living things that they can’t care for? Undoubtedly. Is it &lt;em&gt;ethical &lt;/em&gt;to plague children with guilt over the wellbeing of an entity that is — to be clear — entirely not real, fictional, and made-up? Well, who’s to say? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBEEiH"&gt;Hot Topic is, apparently. The store is selling a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hottopic.com%2Fproduct%2Fneopets-sad-shoyru-t-shirt%2F14953163.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22158653%2Fneopets-hot-topic-shirt-price#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new T-shirt&lt;/a&gt; that’s clearly meant to remind us all just how careless we’ve been. It’s one of a number of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hottopic.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dneopets%26cm_mmc%3DSOC-_-EXT-_-ORG-_-DMY-_-POD-_-NEOPETS&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22158653%2Fneopets-hot-topic-shirt-price#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Neopets-themed shirts&lt;/a&gt; that the store is selling. This one is emblazoned with the slogan “Your Neopets are dying,” as well as a picture of the most depressed-looking Neopet I’ve ever seen. The shirt costs between $22.90 and $26.90 depending on your size, but there’s a 30 percent off sale if you order one today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L64I6R"&gt;I don’t know about you, but I’m going to go ahead and order this, and wear it in every public place I can find. We early-20s denizens have screwed the pooch when it comes to our own Neopets — but maybe we can redeem ourselves if we ensure that future generations never make our mistakes. Leisure time? Recreation? No such thing in the capitalist productivity machine that is &lt;a href="http://Neopets.com"&gt;Neopets.com&lt;/a&gt;. Your Neopets are dying, children. Feed them. &lt;em&gt;Feed them!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy’s video game sale is an easy way to build your new PS5 or Xbox Series X library</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DrFL9NGZY7SzZhAGXag23aYrBGA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68470830/vpavic_4261_20201026_0181.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PdUZe2"&gt;Gaming is an expensive hobby, especially if you recently purchased a new console. If you are looking to buy some new games but don’t want to burn a major hole in your pocket, Best Buy’s current promotion focuses on next-gen games: if you &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725883399713243224" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy two eligible next-gen titles, you get a third title free of charge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zoaz7R"&gt;This is an ideal way to add three new games to your collection. The games’ pricing varies anywhere between $10 to $100. Many of these games are last-gen titles and include free next-gen upgrades, so they can work with both older consoles and the new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nd0J2e"&gt;Some highlights in this deal include &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725881560814179116" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control: Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725881612897257275" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725881683012320033" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the latter being released on December 10th. If you own a Nintendo Switch, the retailer is also offering a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725883737997928539" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy one, get a second title for 50 percent off&lt;/a&gt; deal on select titles available on Nintendo’s hybrid console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uPFmtM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10197689"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TvoPhB"&gt;With the holiday season just around the corner, this is not a bad option if you already have in mind which titles you want to play on your PS5 or Xbox Series X. Both consoles are quite difficult to purchase right now, but if you already own one, Best Buy’s promotion is a great way to start building your library. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Timnit Gebru’s team at Google is going public with their side of the story</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco 2018 - Day 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G41JM5rdJtnisERN9tPc9Ld4GRY=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68470766/1028811898.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kimberly White / Getty Images for TechCrunch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xjBLMY"&gt;Google employees who worked with Timnit Gebru are coming out publicly to dispute claims against the star AI ethics researcher. On Monday, the team &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/"&gt;published a letter on the Google Walkout Medium account&lt;/a&gt; firmly stating that Gebru was fired and did not resign &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0/edit"&gt;as Google’s head of artificial intelligence, Jeff Dean, said&lt;/a&gt;. They also said the publication review policy that Gebru was supposed to follow was applied “unevenly and discriminatorily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlZ0wx"&gt;“Dr. Gebru’s dismissal has been framed as a resignation, but in Dr. Gebru’s own words, she did not resign,” the letter says. It notes that Gebru asked for certain conditions to be met in order for her to stay at Google, including transparency around who wanted her paper retracted. Ultimately, the leaders of the ethical AI team said they could not meet these conditions and preemptively accepted her resignation. &lt;a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3469738016467233&amp;amp;id=100002932057665&amp;amp;comment_id=3470470943060607&amp;amp;notif_t=mentions_comment&amp;amp;notif_id=1607192244022022&amp;amp;ref=m_notif"&gt;Her own manager said he was “stunned.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFmTPq"&gt;The paper that got Gebru fired detailed potential risks associated with large language processing models, including over-relying on data from wealthy countries that have more internet access. “The result is that AI-generated language will be homogenized, reflecting the practices of the richest countries and communities,” &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/"&gt;wrote &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQn78I"&gt;This research could have been problematic for Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931657/google-bert-search-context-algorithm-change-10-percent-langauge"&gt;which created a large language model called BERT in 2018, which has changed how it queries search results&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mq7EpR"&gt;Gebru was planning to present the paper at a computer science conference in March. On October 7th, she submitted it for review internally at Google. Shortly after midnight on October 8th, it was approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNCbG1"&gt;In his statement, Dean said the research team requires two weeks for review. “Unfortunately, this particular paper was only shared with a day’s notice before its deadline,” &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0/edit"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4ZoL7"&gt;But Gebru’s team is pushing back on that assessment, saying the review policy is meant to be flexible, and most people do not follow the structure Dean laid out. The team collected data showing the vast majority of approvals happen right before the deadline, and 41 percent happen &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the deadline. “There is no hard requirement for papers to actually go through this review with two weeks notice,” they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYNvHP"&gt;Google managers asked Gebru to retract the paper or take her name off it, a request she said felt like censorship &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/prominent-ai-ethics-researcher-says-google-fired-her/"&gt;in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “You’re not going to have papers that make the company happy all the time and don’t point out problems,” she said. “That’s antithetical to what it means to be that kind of researcher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjNbB7"&gt;Gebru &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical"&gt;sent an email to the Brain Women and Allies listserv at Google&lt;/a&gt; detailing the pushback she’d gotten on the paper. She also voiced exasperation with the company’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. “The DEI [objectives and key results] that we don’t know where they come from (and are never met anyways), the random discussions, the ‘we need more mentorship’ rather than ‘we need to stop the toxic environments that hinder us from progressing’ the constant fighting and education at your cost, they don’t matter,” she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3AdqH"&gt;This frustration was shared by members of her team who felt the company’s goals to create a more diverse and equitable workplace were weak. “They’re really paltry demands,” says Alex Hanna, a senior researcher who worked under Gebru. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3b2AgW"&gt;More than 1,500 employees have signed &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382"&gt;a Google Walkout petition protesting Gebru’s dismissal&lt;/a&gt;. “Instead of being embraced by Google as an exceptionally talented and prolific contributor, Dr. Gebru has faced defensiveness, racism, gaslighting, research censorship, and now a retaliatory firing,” the petition says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNwVn4"&gt;But it’s members of her team who feel the loss most acutely. “We’re pretty deflated,” Hanna says. “When someone who is the heart and soul of your team gets fired ostensibly for doing ethics research, what can you do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXqHLK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this article stated the letter was signed by more than 1,500 Google employees. That was the Google Walkout petition. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb launches nonprofit to provide stays for essential workers and refugees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Airbnb Illustration In Athens" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iw0KG2uT_UHU1x7x5Ec0fyh7c3g=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68470695/1229089428.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qcfAXt"&gt;Airbnb is launching a nonprofit to allow the hosts who rent out their properties on its platform to provide free and discounted stays to refugees, people affected by natural disasters, and frontline workers in the coronavirus pandemic. The new organization, called &lt;a href="https://www.airbnb.org/"&gt;Airbnb.org&lt;/a&gt;, is the evolution of Airbnb’s Open Homes and Frontline stays programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g47jJM"&gt;Open Homes started in 2012, inspired by a host who opened her home to people affected by Hurricane Sandy. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195307/airbnb-free-first-responders-hosts-coronavirus-rentals"&gt;introduced the Frontline stays program&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, as a way to provide first responders a place to stay — either to be closer to work or to quarantine away from their families while treating COVID-19 patients. The company says more than 100,000 hosts worldwide have provided accommodations under the programs. Now, both programs will be called Airbnb.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6YpGj"&gt;The company says Airbnb hosts who offer free stays or make recurring donations to Airbnb.org will get a special badge on their profiles “to recognize their generosity and commitment to communities in need.” Asked whether Airbnb would reimburse hosts for participating in the program, a company spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “hosts can choose whether they can provide a free or discounted stay and those are considered in-kind donations” to Airbnb.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjOGcG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/07/tech/airbnb-hosts-coronavirus/index.html"&gt;Airbnb hosts have struggled&lt;/a&gt; to book properties during the pandemic, and the company announced in March it would &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/coronavirus-airbnb-hosts-angry-at-refunds.html"&gt;offer refunds to guests&lt;/a&gt; who canceled reservations. The company didn’t offer reimbursement to hosts under that new policy and is now &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/airbnb-hit-with-proposed-class-action-lawsuit-from-host-missing-payments.html"&gt;facing a proposed class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, brought by a Texas host who says the refund policy violated Airbnb’s contract with hosts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mPJ9J"&gt;The new nonprofit will partner with relief organizations like the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Community Organized Relief Effort (CORE). Airbnb also says it will commit $1 million over the next two years to help cover stays for IFRC volunteers and staff “fighting the spread of COVID-19” and $1 million to CORE to support essential workers at COVID-19 testing sites and at future vaccine distribution centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4IWlz"&gt;The company has committed 400,000 shares of Airbnb stock to support the new nonprofit, and company co-founders Joe Gebbia, Brian Chesky, and Nathan Blecharczyk will donate an additional $6 million, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpJeZN"&gt;Airbnb is expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq exchange this week under the ticker ABNB. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-boosts-ipo-price-range-to-between-56-and-60-a-share-11607302117"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; Monday that the company plans to price shares between $56 and $60 per share on a valuation of as much as $42 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOTVht"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLjrAM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkHgj0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pbv6Q1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google adds Apple Music support to Assistant smart speakers and displays</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vP0C9F"&gt;Google has announced that Apple Music is now available on smart speakers and displays that use the Google Assistant, including Google’s own line of Nest products, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;new Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt;. Owners of Assistant smart speakers or displays will be able to set Apple Music as the default service on the speakers and use their voice to play songs, albums, or playlists from it, much like they can do with Spotify, Pandora, or YouTube Premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2e5mu"&gt;This addition broadens the appeal of Assistant smart speakers and displays to a wider market, and it catches Google’s smart speaker line up to Amazon’s, which has supported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/14/18141112/apple-music-support-amazon-echo-speakers"&gt;Apple Music through Alexa on Echo smart speakers since 2018&lt;/a&gt;. As with the other services available on Google smart speakers, you can play Apple Music on multiple speakers at the same time for whole home audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEExNB"&gt;With Apple Music on board, the only major services left that aren’t full supported on Google’s smart speakers are Amazon Music and Tidal, both of which are compatible with Echo speakers (which don’t support Google’s YouTube Music service). Apple’s HomePod smart speakers are in a distant last place here, with support for just Apple Music and Pandora at the time of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im2JMI"&gt;Google says that Apple Music support will begin rolling out today, December 7th, 2020, in the US, UK, France, Germany, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The great Black Friday discounts on Eero’s mesh Wi-Fi routers are back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4IJOIDMmKWcymyGTRQTioq6_UAg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68470305/dseifert_191008_3720_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KCCqzO"&gt;I expected to see some once-expired Black Friday deals make their return before the holidays, and &lt;em&gt;ta-da&lt;/em&gt;, that’s what’s happening today. We’re just seeing a few comeback deals today from Best Buy and Amazon, but they’re some of the best discounts from Black Friday. The shortlist includes Eero’s multi-pack mesh Wi-Fi routers and Apple Watch models varying in price, size, and capabilities. Oh, and a little game called &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; releases this Thursday, and there are deals on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oObPBr"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="R6n3JL"&gt;Give your Wi-Fi a boost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Rw53b8"&gt;Eero’s mesh Wi-Fi routers are a good gift, either to yourself or someone you know who has a bungled Wi-Fi situation. Both the new Eero 6 routers with Wi-Fi 6 and the last-gen model that’s cheaper are discounted, giving you options based on your budget and need for internet speed. The Eero Pro 6 lineup isn’t discounted, for now at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PiLpCg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603441"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="9sWWEY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536532"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="QtdwMH"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7UhZ1n"&gt;Grab an Apple Watch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wM8w3g"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725880721750085691" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 3 up to the latest Series 6 and SE models are discounted at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. My favorite of the bunch is actually the Series 5, which has been tough to come by since the newer model succeeded it. You can get a 40mm Series 5 watch with GPS for $300, putting it just $40 above the $259 SE. For that price difference, you’re getting mostly the same design and hardware but with an always-on display and support for taking EKGs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7pbtyu"&gt;Something else worth mentioning about Best Buy’s sale today is that if you purchase either a Series 6 or SE, you’ll get a free surf blue-colored sport band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZRYQWg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10210144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8sPrRs"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EfEoZx"&gt;Save on &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; in myriad ways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="W9EkoT"&gt;CD Projekt Red’s &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is releasing Thursday, December 10th. And if you haven’t yet preordered the game, there are ways to save some money ahead of its release. First off, if you have a PS4 or PS5, you can snag the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DJWBYKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation version of the game for $50 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $10 off. Secondly, Best Buy is hosting a “&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725881273732011577" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy two, get one free&lt;/a&gt;” deal on several games that give gamers complimentary next-gen upgrades. That promo loops in both the PS4 and Xbox One versions of many titles, including &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yCNlGa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10210167"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>LG developing sliding doors made of transparent OLED displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tE1GhJTj8NmyG1p97xcZN_8bRLs=/0x107:2560x1814/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68469663/Transparent_OLED_Automatic_Door_03_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll be able to see through the screens on the doors.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NcbQEO"&gt;LG has partnered with Swedish manufacturer Assa Abloy Entrance Systems to develop automatic sliding doors with built-in transparent OLED displays, the &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2020/12/lg-and-assa-abloy-to-develop-transparent-oled-automatic-door/"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The doors will be aimed at businesses, and LG says they’ll be able to greet customers, communicate with employees, or show ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtVzzM"&gt;LG has been showing off its transparent displays for a little while now, and it unveiled a range of transparent signage &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Owze8dBuZw"&gt;early last year&lt;/a&gt;. Now, we’re seeing the panels used in the real world. In August, &lt;a href="https://www.koreatechtoday.com/lg-display-supplies-transparent-oled-screen-to-chinas-subway/#:~:text=LG%20Display%20announced%20on%20Friday,line%20No.10%20in%20Shenzhen"&gt;LG announced&lt;/a&gt; that its displays were being used in the windows of subway carriages in Beijing and Shenzhen in China, and &lt;em&gt;OLED-Info &lt;/em&gt;reports that both &lt;a href="https://www.oled-info.com/panasonic-launches-its-first-commercial-oled-tv"&gt;Panasonic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.oled-info.com/xiaomi-launches-transparent-oled-tv-consumer-market"&gt;Xiaomi’s&lt;/a&gt; transparent OLED TVs use LG panels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DdBoZoAjq2q3oGmwkvzDmArSygU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150274/Transparent_OLED_Automatic_Door_01_scaled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One photo shows how the doors could be used to show ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pqEf4X"&gt;South Korea’s other major display manufacturer, Samsung, has also experimented with transparent OLED displays in the past, but &lt;a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160826000325"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Korea Herald&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 that it had ceased production of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHM6Tw"&gt;LG’s announcement doesn’t give much of an indication of when these high-end doors might become available for businesses. But considering the transparent OLED technology has started being deployed, they can’t be too far away from decorating the world’s most decadent shopping centers.&lt;/p&gt;
