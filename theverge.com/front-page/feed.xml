    <title>Facebook is making it easier to turn off algorithmic ranking in your News Feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r2yl7Brc29bOXiK3f7etCwbDPgQ=/0x0:624x416/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69052954/image002.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WKPmx8"&gt;Facebook is introducing a handful of new features that will give users greater control over their News Feed, including an easier way to turn off the feed’s algorithmic ranking and display content in the order it was posted instead.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omj2Gn"&gt;The changes build on previous tweaks to News Feed functionality. Last October, Facebook introduced a “&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1634545223376778"&gt;Favorites&lt;/a&gt;” tool that allows users to select up to thirty friends and pages, prioritizing their content or displaying it in a separate feed. The company also offers users the option to sort their feeds by “&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/218728138156311"&gt;most recent&lt;/a&gt;,” but buries these options in obscure menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEnExx"&gt;Facebook is now making these “Favorites” and “Recent” filters much more prominent, putting them right at the top of the News Feed as separate tabs that users can switch between. You can see what that looks like in the screenshots below: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0_cMebgRygLoasdRdPThfvRZWHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410181/image002.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The News Feed filter bar will let users swap between algorithmic, chronological, and “favorites” filters. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6kHq7B"&gt;This filter bar is launching globally on Facebook’s Android app today and coming to iOS “in the coming weeks.” It’s not clear if it will be available on the web version of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bB52j2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The filter bar will disappear if you don’t regularly use it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nDIav9"&gt;But there’s a big caveat: the filter bar isn’t a &lt;em&gt;permanent&lt;/em&gt; addition to Facebook’s user interface. The company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the feature will disappear if users don’t access the Favorites tool for seven days. They will then have to find their favorites through the preferences menu for the News Feed and the filter bar will return. Similarly, the “most recent” tab will also disappear if not regularly accessed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pt7Hao"&gt;In addition to the filter bar, Facebook is introducing a new tool that lets users limit who can comment on their posts (this can be restricted to friends or just to tagged people and pages) and expanding the information available in its “Why am I seeing this?” feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndM2vF"&gt;This latter tool was introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/1/18290195/facebooks-news-feed-why-am-i-seeing-this-post-ad-context-interaction"&gt;last April&lt;/a&gt; and lets users click on posts suggested by Facebook’s algorithms to see why it was recommended to them. These explanations will now include information about how posts’ related topics, interactions, and even location led to them being suggested to the user. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wJEh3Qs8h8Scl6bd7wiYIp0SkPg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410185/image003.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Why am I seeing this?” will offer more information about why posts were suggested to users. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lHedTH"&gt;These changes are relatively minor, but overall give people more control over Facebook’s often opaque algorithms. The changes suggest that the world’s largest social network is keen to deflect criticism over choices made by its algorithmic systems. This is not surprising considering that the company has repeatedly come under fire over studies that show these automated systems amplify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313013/far-right-news-misinformation-facebook-us-2020-election-nyu-study-engagement"&gt;misinformation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270659/facebook-division-news-feed-algorithms"&gt;extremist&lt;/a&gt; content in an apparent bid to drive up user engagement — a metric that rules Facebook’s design choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWqu2x"&gt;Such criticisms have been levied against the site for years, but have become increasingly sharp in recent months as legislators and the company’s own Oversight Board mull &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22335801/algorithms-artificial-intelligence-facebook-instagram-recommendations"&gt;more intrusive regulation&lt;/a&gt; of Facebook’s algorithms. With this in mind, it’s makes sense for the company to give its users the ability to opt-out of algorithmic sorting altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8XaJN"&gt;But as is often the case with Facebook, the company seems hesitant to commit to changes that might undermine its own engagement stats. If the filter bar disappears after seven days of inactivity, it invites an obvious question: is Facebook really serious about letting users choose what they see on the site, or does it just want to give the appearance of control?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nick Clegg doesn’t think Facebook is polarizing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dES1k9KREYm4qDNx2O3BVp7FZWw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69052930/VRG_ILLO_4499_Decoder_Nick_Clegg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Facebook’s VP of global affairs on the platform’s new changes, with Casey Newton&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="gx9QYV"&gt;There is no shortage of criticisms that get leveled at Facebook: it’s spreading misinformation and hate speech, it’s too polarizing, it’s responsible for fraying the very fabric of society. The list goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uk70yQ"&gt;This morning, Facebook’s VP of global affairs, Nick Clegg, published a lengthy Medium post addressing some of these criticisms and unveiled some changes the company is making to give users more control over their experience. Specifically, the company is going to allow Facebook users to customize their feeds and how the algorithm presents content from other Facebook users to them. “People should be able to better understand how the ranking algorithms work and why they make particular decisions, and they should have more control over the content that is shown to them,” Clegg writes. “You should be able to talk back to the algorithm and consciously adjust or ignore the predictions it makes—to alter your personal algorithm in the cold light of day, through breathing spaces built into the design of the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DVGIZ"&gt;There’s a lot to discuss there. And to help us unpack the post, Clegg sat down with &lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt; editor and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; contributing editor Casey Newton yesterday for a special episode of &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4l4WA"&gt;In particular, Clegg does not think Facebook is designed to reward provocative content, which is a new rebuttal to the company’s critics (and likely a surprise to anyone who’s paid attention to their Facebook feeds). “The reality is, it’s not in Facebook’s interest – financially or reputationally – to continually turn up the temperature and push users towards ever more extreme content,” Clegg writes in his post. “Bear in mind, the vast majority of Facebook’s revenue is from advertising. Advertisers don’t want their brands and products displayed next to extreme or hateful content – a point that many made explicitly last summer during a high-profile boycott by a number of household-name brands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSCXME"&gt;Fundamentally, Clegg’s argument is that the Facebook backlash isn’t rooted in fact or science, and that if it gets carried away, we’re never going to get to the better version of the internet that a lot of us want, and he’s trying to reset the debates on Facebook’s terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXUcbY"&gt;We’ll leave it to you to decide how successful he is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wE84XT"&gt;Okay, Casey Newton with Nick Clegg, VP of global affairs at Facebook. Here we go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZVjTT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WmpMAV"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP8460342416" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rft3T2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is a lightly edited excerpt from their conversation. This post will be updated with a full transcript of the interview on Friday, April 2nd. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Xme6t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most of us, we’re not math majors or computer science majors. And so there is some sort of fear and uncertainty about what’s going on in the background. One of the things that Facebook is now doing is giving us some new ways to change up what we see in the News Feed. So what are some of these new controls?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKXTey"&gt;So some of the controls are old. We’ve had them for a while, but we’re just going to make them a lot more prominent. So for instance, you could always switch to a chronological feed. But candidly, it wasn’t easy for people to find. So we’re now going to have a feed filter bar. When you scroll to the top of your feed, it’ll be there. It’ll always be there, and you can toggle between the feed as it currently exists, to have it chronologically ordered, or crucially, and this is new, so that you can create your own new feed of favorites — of favorite groups, friends, posts, and so on. And you’ll be able to curate that, if you like, for yourself and toggle between those three — the feed as it is, the chronological feed, and your new favorites feed — in a much, much more effortless way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGTy9Y"&gt;It’ll be much more visible. It’ll be visible there when you scroll to the top of your feed. There are other new controls as well, which I’m announcing this week. You’ll be able to curate with much greater granularity than before who can comment on your posts. And that is something which wasn’t available before. And we’re also going to extend something which has existed for ads, for instance, and for connected content. Namely, why am I seeing this? So you can go to the three dots and you can see, “Why am I seeing this ad?” We’re now going to extend that to suggested content. So when something’s suggested to you, that cooking video, you can go on the three dots, and you can see why you’re seeing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="beeDGx"&gt;So I think, collectively, it’s a start. I’m not going to pretend that those changes in and of themselves will lift all the questions that people have about how social media operates and how they interact with Facebook. But I do feel that they are significant steps in a better direction, putting users more in charge, being more open and transparent about things, and we will follow up with a number of additional steps, greater transparency, greater controls in the months to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgiHlK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that also a suggestion that maybe this is the beginning of this feed filter bar that you’re introducing, that that might have more filters that come to it over time? Is the idea that users will have more and more control over how the stuff they see is ranked?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfJNQH"&gt;Yeah. Look, in an ideal world, you just want to push ever more forcefully in the direction where people can personalize their feeds. And if people want to see more or see less of particular forms of content, from particular pages or groups, there is also, conceptually, at least the possibility of exploring whether people can or can’t, if you like, turn the dial up or down on particular classes of content. That’s exactly the kind of work that we want to do. Now, exactly how granular, exactly which dials apply to which kinds of content, all of that still needs to be filled in. But that is very much the direction we’re going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNafGV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the conventional wisdom about how the feed works now, I think for a lot of folks, and certainly of the folks who are most critical of Facebook, is that it rewards the most polarizing and outrageous content. And this is something that you really take on in this piece and push back against. I suspect if there’s one sentence in your piece that most people will take issue with, it’s when you write, “Facebook’s systems are not designed to reward provocative content.” At the same time, when we look at lists of pages that get the most engagement, it does tend to be pages that seem to be pushing really polarizing content. So how do you reconcile this at Facebook?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsTRXs"&gt;Well, firstly, I of course accept that we need to just provide more and more data and more evidence about what is the specific content that is popular on News Feed. And then of course, although Facebook’s critics often talk about sensational content dominating News Feed, of course we want to show, as I think we can, that many of the most popular posts on News Feed are lighthearted. They’re feel-good stories. We want to show people that the overwhelming majority of the posts people see on News Feed are about pets, babies, vacations, and similar. Not incendiary topics. In fact, I think on Monday, one most popular posts in the US was a mother bear with three or four baby cubs crossing a road. I saw it myself. It’s lovely. I strongly recommend that you look at it. And I think we can, and we will, do more to substantiate that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruSS5s"&gt;But beyond that, I do think, and I do try to grapple with this as thoroughly, as is possible in a 5,000-word piece. Firstly, the signals that are used in the ranking process are far more complex, are far more sophisticated, and have far more checks and balances in it than are implied by this cardboard cutout caricature that somehow we’re just spoon-feeding people incendiary, sensational stuff. And I’m happy to go into the details if you like, but thousands of signals are used, literally from the device that you use to the groups that you’re members of and so on. We survey evidence. We’re using more and more survey evidence. We’ll be doing more of that in the future as well to ask people what they find most meaningful. There’s been a big shift in recent years anyway to reward content that is more meaningful, your connections with your families and friends, rather than stuff that is just crudely engaging — pages from politicians and personalities and celebrities and sports pages and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yg3fc6"&gt;So that shift has already been underway. But in terms of incentives, this is the bit that  maybe we have not been articulate enough about. Firstly, the people who pay our lunch don’t like the content next to incendiary, unpleasant material. And if you needed any further proof of that, this last summer, a number of major advertisers boycotted Facebook because they felt we weren’t doing enough on hate speech. We were getting much better at reducing the prevalence of hate speech. The prevalence of hate speech is now down to, what? 0.07, 0.08 percent of content on Facebook. So every 10,000 pieces of content you see, seven or eight might be bad. I wish it was down to zero. I don’t think we’ll ever get it down to zero. So we have a massive incentive to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1bmkx"&gt;But also if you think about it, if you’re building a product which you want to survive for the long term, where your people in 10 years, in 15 years, in 20 years to still be using these products, there’s really no incentive for the company to give people the kind of sugar rush of artificially polarizing content, which might keep them on board for 10 or 20 minutes extra. Now, we want to solve for 10 or 20 years, not for 10 or 20 extra minutes. And so I don’t think our incentives are pointed in the direction that many people assume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="1g57Ir"&gt;That all being said, it is of course true... any sub editor of a newspaper will tell you. It’s why tabloids have unused striking imagery and cage--rattling language on their front pages since time immemorial. Of course there are emotions of fear, of anger, of jealousy, of rage, which of course provoke emotional responses. They’ve done so in all media, in all time. And so of course emotive content provokes an emotive reaction amongst people. We can’t reprogram human nature, and we don’t want to deny that, which is why our CrowdTangle tool actually elaborates on that and shows how things have been engaged. But as you know, there is a world of difference between that which is most engaged with — in other words, where comments and shares are most common — and actually the content that most people see. And that’s quite, quite different. Actually, if you look at what most human beings, if you look at eyeballs, rather than comments and shares, you get a quite different picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IJG3E"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQLwqE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GFaDx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofVkcN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden plans to connect every American to broadband in new infrastructure package</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks On COVID-19 Response And State Of Vaccinations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZHfYvrL6_QTWaDdNBiVnzaspBSE=/0x0:6102x4068/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69052849/1232006796.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jWegYF"&gt;President Biden plans to announce a sweeping infrastructure plan Wednesday that includes $100 billion to connect every American to high-speed broadband internet over the next eight years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBZ5Uy"&gt;Biden is scheduled &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/30/biden-infrastructure-plan-478627"&gt;to unveil his $2 trillion&lt;/a&gt; “American Jobs Plan” in Pittsburgh later on Wednesday. The long-awaited infrastructure and jobs package contains funding for broadband expansion, semiconductor manufacturing, and slew of other interests like public transportation and helping consumers purchase electric vehicles. On a call with reporters Tuesday, an administration official said that the package would be paid for by changes to the corporate tax rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hQwY2S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Biden’s $100 billion figure for broadband expansion trumps most other efforts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hqMIV7"&gt;Biden’s $100 billion figure for broadband expansion trumps most other efforts to finish connecting every household in the US to the internet. Earlier this month, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-SC) &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=C3C8F0E4-61D4-46FE-A28A-F81A09620A5D"&gt;announced their own bill&lt;/a&gt; that would invest $94 billion to close the digital divide. In previous years, the Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21117306/iowa-caucus-rural-broadband-access-election-campaign-sanders-warren"&gt;has put together more than&lt;/a&gt; $20 billion to reward cooperatives, satellite operators, and other telecoms who launch broadband projects in unserved areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7z9He4"&gt;Biden’s package also calls for 100 percent broadband coverage by the end of the decade and prioritizes networks affiliated with local governments, nonprofits and cooperatives and promises funding for projects on tribal lands. Biden’s broadband plan also seeks to encourage adoption by reducing the cost of internet service long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJjxlt"&gt;“While the President recognizes that individual subsidies to cover internet costs may be needed in the short term, he believes continually providing subsidies to cover the cost of overpriced internet service is not the right long-term solution for consumers or taxpayers,” a fact sheet for the package reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uWiE4"&gt;The package also provides tax incentives and rebates to encourage consumers to purchase electric vehicles along with a plan to electrify the federal fleet, including United States Postal Service trucks. Over $50 billion is set aside for investment in domestic semiconductor manufacturing, a particularly vital issue in light of recent shortages. In February, Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298376/biden-sign-semiconductor-shortage-executive-order-apple-amd-playstation"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; calling for government reviews into the semiconductor supply chain following a massive chip shortage created by the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zpsE8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWrGeI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet’s free ‘unlimited’ calls will continue until June</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Meet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p9TSLm"&gt;Google will not introduce a 60 minute call limit on free Google Meet users at the end of March, the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleWorkspace/status/1376957338733674499"&gt;announced in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it will now be begin on June 30th. Until then, anyone using the service’s free version will be able to host calls up to 24 hours in length, which Google refers to as “unlimited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVZlQj"&gt;This is the second time Google has pushed back the introduction of call limits since opening up the service to free users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21240509/google-meet-video-conferencing-free-gmail"&gt;last April&lt;/a&gt;. A 60 minute limit had originally been due to come into effect at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/26/21457293/google-meet-limit-meeting-free-plans-september-zoom"&gt;end of September&lt;/a&gt;, but that deadline was later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494189/google-meet-limit-calls-minutes-march-2021"&gt;pushed back to March&lt;/a&gt; when it became clear that many of us wouldn’t be able to celebrate the holidays in person with our loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Even LinkedIn is making a Clubhouse clone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Linkedin Launches 24 Hours Stories" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B6Sjz_CFn2qTvGQNzKO9mVPHZik=/3x0:2912x1939/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051839/1229184687.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zLdmBl"&gt;It feels like just about every big tech company is working on a Clubhouse-like social audio feature — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323767/twitter-spaces-april-release-date-plan"&gt;Twitter’s Spaces feature is rolling out now&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;Facebook is reportedly building one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify is making one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315866/mark-cuban-fireside-app-podcast-platform-clubhouse"&gt;Mark Cuban has one&lt;/a&gt;, even &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/"&gt;Slack is getting in the game&lt;/a&gt;. But now, the idea of the shared audio space, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21325678/venture-capitalists-vc-media-silicon-valley-clubhouse-tech-journalists"&gt;started on Clubhouse largely as an exclusive club&lt;/a&gt; for tech venture capitalists and elites, has come full circle. Professional social network LinkedIn is working on an audio networking feature of its own, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/"&gt;the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oL61Uk"&gt;“We’re doing some early tests to create a unique audio experience connected to your professional identity,” LinkedIn said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. “And, we’re looking at how we can bring audio to other parts of LinkedIn such as events and groups, to give our members even more ways to connect to their community.” LinkedIn shared the same statement with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; after we first published this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEi6hf"&gt;LinkedIn said the feature will begin beta testing soon. Below is a mockup of what the feature might look like, which LinkedIn shared with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch. &lt;/em&gt;Like Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, it features a stage of speakers front and center and a list of people in the audience lower down the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WLlCnL"&gt;LinkedIn has already been working to make itself a destination for creators with tools like a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/linkedin-adds-creator-mode-to-help-more-of-its-users-turn-influencers-11617129192"&gt;new Creator mode&lt;/a&gt; that denote you as a LinkedIn content creator on your profile. A Clubhouse-like feature actually seems like a natural fit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple supplier Foxconn warns that component shortages will last until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A woman wearing a face mask seen working on her computer on..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3iY0SHa8z7gXjmOsROawNkE0A9M=/0x0:3250x2167/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051722/1230428833.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WM8czH"&gt;The ongoing global shortage for electronic components continues, and Foxconn — which handles manufacturing for Apple, among other major tech heavyweights — has announced that it’s starting to see the impact of shortages. According to Young Liu, Foxconn’s CEO, the company won’t be able to fulfill some of its orders due to those shortages, which he expects will last until &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; the second quarter of next year, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-supplier-Foxconn-says-chip-shortage-will-curb-shipments"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8UU8a"&gt;“The [supply in the] first two months of this quarter was still ok, as our clients are all very big, but we started to see changes happening this month,” Liu reportedly told investors during the company’s latest earnings call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sbl2tS"&gt;The impact of the shortages isn’t expected to be large, at least for now: Liu expects that the company will only miss around 10 percent of its orders due to part shortages, citing the large order volumes of its customers. But it’s still a notable miss for Foxconn — and by extension, its customers like Apple — who may be forced to contend with delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Zz4z8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;10 percent &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NA0e8c"&gt;Foxconn also saw slowdowns in manufacturing last spring at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, following mandatory government shutdowns and quarantined factory workers. Those delays trickled down across the supply chain, leading to a later-than-usual November launch for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238081/apple-iphone-12-mass-production-delay-rumors-coronavirus-impact#:~:text=Apple%20is%20reportedly%20delaying%20mass,iPhone%2012%20mass%20production%20plans."&gt;Apple’s iPhone 12 lineup&lt;/a&gt;. The current slowdown, by comparison, seems less drastic, but if parts continue to be hard to get, delays could mount later in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yg2Ybt"&gt;Foxconn is the latest company to call out the ongoing chip and component shortage that has slowing down production of everything from next-generation consoles to cars. Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;Samsung warned its investors&lt;/a&gt; of a “serious imbalance” in the semiconductor industry as it prepares to deal with the ongoing global chip shortage. Car companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-china-production/chip-shortages-could-slow-automotive-production-vw-and-suppliers-say-idUSKBN28E1IN"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2021/02/03/nissan-truck-production-reduced-canton-plant-due-chip-shortage/4369759001/"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-09/toyota-says-chip-shortage-impacting-output-of-texas-made-trucks"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; have have had to slow truck and car production due to a surfeit of silicon. Both Sony and Microsoft have both cited part shortages as major factors in the near-impossible-to-buy status of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297039/playstation-ceo-ps5-supply-2021-stock-consoles-jim-ryan"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. And the aftermarket value of PC graphics cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;has doubled, even tripled&lt;/a&gt;, due to a combination of unprecedented shortages and demand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat’s Spectacles might become true AR glasses this time — and there’s a drone  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="snap spectacles" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IV9E0rbmQyDYoOE4UbPjyILFxQc=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051718/Specs4.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first generation Snap Spectacles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wn1zJP"&gt;Snap, the company behind Snapchat, is planning to continue its push into hardware devices with a new pair of augmented-reality glasses and a drone, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/snap-plans-hardware-push-with-ar-spectacles-drone"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The Spectacles will reportedly include displays so the wearer can see the AR effects without having to use their phone — a feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20951783/snap-spectacles-3-review-snapchat-glasses-price-specs-features"&gt;was notably missing&lt;/a&gt; from the all the Spectacles that came before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F88tko"&gt;One of &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s sources says that the new Spectacles will be meant for developers and creators, rather than consumers — though you could probably argue that, at $380, the Spectacles 3 are already mostly limited to that market as well. As the article points out, though, the intention is likely to have the developers make lenses and experiences that consumers will use at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sEhL8X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Snap may not be backing down from its hardware dreams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5R0XN"&gt;If the new Spectacles act as an AR headset, it could be the culmination of what the company has been working towards with the first three versions of the product. Currently, the Spectacles are mainly capture devices, acting as head-mounted cameras with the bulk of the processing being done on the user’s phone. This hasn’t necessarily been a recipe for success: the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/7/16620718/snapchat-spectacles-40-million-lost-failure-unsold-inventory"&gt;lost $40 million&lt;/a&gt; when it was stuck with unsold inventory of the original pair, and the company’s hardware head &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17607834/head-snapchat-spectactles-augmented-reality-mark-randall"&gt;left shortly after the second-generation glasses came out&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5w28Bk"&gt;If the reports about the new Spectacles are true, it could indicate that Snap isn’t backing down from its hardware dreams — &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-future-of-snapchat-looks-a-lot-like-magic-leap/"&gt;the company’s CEO has said&lt;/a&gt; that AR hardware will be part of what defines Snap by the end of this decade. If it wants to continue pushing its AR glasses, it seems like it will have to contend with competition from the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/announcing-project-aria-a-research-project-on-the-future-of-wearable-ar/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;— both companies seem to be developing their own face-mounted wearables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSqVIC"&gt;As for the drone, there’s precious little information about it. There have been rumors about Snap working on a drone &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/technology/snapchat-drone.html"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;, and back in 2017 it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/27/15704906/snap-ctrl-me-robotics-acquired-drone-cameras"&gt;acquired a drone company&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Snap invested $20 million into a Chinese drone company as well. There’s no information on when the drone will ship, but the report’s sources say that it’s recently been made the priority of Snap Lab, a hardware group at Snap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2r3c9"&gt;In other AR headset news,&lt;em&gt; The Information&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ti-reality-check-a-tease-of-ars-future-and-a-look-at-vrs-past"&gt;also reported today&lt;/a&gt; that the headset &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/niantic-ar-headset-teaser-225310953.html"&gt;teased by Pokémon Go creator Niantic&lt;/a&gt; is actually a reference design made by Qualcomm — the two companies announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997493/niantic-qualcomm-xr2-ar-glasses"&gt;that they were partnering back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Niantic is also reportedly looking to go the developer-first route as well. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gocycle’s folding G4 e-bikes promise more power and less noise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nst8va1QLqnXjGkNBjiC_Uszqa8=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051524/Gocycle_Generation_Four_Location___7_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gocycle e-bikes are small but still great for long commutes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Gocycle&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hMzws9"&gt;Gocycle, the maker of some of the most eye-catching and adaptable electric bikes on the planet, is back with its fourth-generation e-bike. The G4 series brings a new motor, better tires, lighter carbon-fiber components, and more to improve upon what’s already one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21211827/gocycle-gxi-review-price-foldable-electric-bike"&gt;favorite e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. But before you get too excited, know that the G4 range &lt;em&gt;starts&lt;/em&gt; at a suggested retail price of $3,999. The G4, G4i, and G4i Plus models are all available for &lt;a href="https://gocycle.com"&gt;preorder now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyyKZu"&gt;For the money, Gocycle makes a very premium e-bike that we’ve found to be equally suited to long commutes and multimodal travel due to its compact quick-fold design with wide high-volume tires. That tradition continues with the G4 models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v39RJk"&gt;The new motor is probably my favorite change and the feature I’m most excited to test. To start, the custom-built G4drive is now billed as “quiet,” bringing it in line with most modern e-bike motors above, say, $1,300. It’s also tuned to power starts from a standstill. Previously, Gocycle relied on thigh power to get you off the line in order to keep the front-hub motor and removable battery as small and lightweight as possible. The G4drive promises more torque and power from what Gocycle still calls a “class-leading compact package.” We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SOjX1pmU9ikSYI-XkrdeQkNVdgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407497/Carbon_Fibre_Mid_Frame.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gocycle&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New carbon fiber mid-frame and other improvements help lower the weight on all models by 1kg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rtXKMDm1r-n2SGYBwP0HCrhEazw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407499/Fully_Integrated_Single_Sided_Front_Fork_Houses_New_G4drive_Electric_Motor.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gocycle&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New G4drive front-hub motor is quiet, torquier, and able to provide power from a standstill, while the tires have improved grip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MAZdAs"&gt;Even with that stronger motor, other changes like a switch to carbon fiber for the mid-frame and single-sided fork help reduce the weight by 1kg across the series, while treaded tires with an infused silica compound promise better grip. The generation four e-bikes also improve connectivity with an integrated 1 amp USB charging port on the handlebar and Bluetooth LE as well as improved folding and stopping power, according to Gocycle. Three and a half-hour fast charging is now standard across the entire range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFLGa7"&gt;“G4 has been in development for many years and represents the most significant product update for Gocycle since our G1 to G2 engineering programme,” said Gocycle designer and founder Richard Thorpe in a press release. “Our generation four models have been developed through a combination of listening to our customers and our continued mission to develop the best urban electric bikes on the planet. G4 will not only set a new standard for Gocycle, but a new standard for performance for all of our competitors in the portable electric bike segment.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YbehSVZdiaKXYqu3N-t_nNQCnrg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407505/Gocycle_G4i__gloss_black_01.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The top-of-the-line G4i Plus in gloss black with carbon wheels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PTeKj4"&gt;The G4 (£3,399 / €3,699 / $3,999) is the entry-level model with mechanical twist-shift gears and range up to 40 miles (65 km). The G4i (£3,999 / €4,499 / $4,999) steps things up with predictive electronic shifting, integrated daytime running lights, a more detailed LED dash display, and improved range to 50 miles (80 km). The top-of-the-line G4i Plus (£4,999 / €5,499 / $5,999) model improves things further with lightweight carbon wheels. It will be available in limited numbers in either a bespoke red or gloss black. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube has removed Steven Crowder from its Partner Program indefinitely</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Steven Crowder’s YouTube channel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2G4rWQ"&gt;Two weeks ago, after YouTube revealed its definition of hate speech was so narrow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22339030/youtube-racist-steven-crowder-video-does-not-violate-hate-speech-policies"&gt;that it couldn’t remove a wildly racist tirade&lt;/a&gt; for being wildly racist, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22339030/youtube-racist-steven-crowder-video-does-not-violate-hate-speech-policies"&gt;we wondered out loud&lt;/a&gt; what it would take for YouTube to stop promoting conservative commentator Steven Crowder as an official YouTube Partner and allowing him to profit from those tirades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pfv9P"&gt;Today, we have a partial answer: YouTube has officially suspended Steven Crowder’s main channel from the YouTube Partner Program indefinitely, which includes removing his ability to run ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1p4gpN"&gt;It’s also banning him from uploading videos for a full week after his latest infraction: a now-removed video that reportedly challenged the legitimacy of the vote in Nevada. YouTube has a policy against false claims that the election was stolen. Crowder &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/steven-crowder/after-being-suspended-youtube-steven-crowder-announces-his-plan-evade-it-his-other"&gt;has already announced his intent&lt;/a&gt; to upload videos to his other Crowder Bits channel, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzpvzm"&gt;Here’s YouTube’s statement (including links):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bac7lX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order to monetize on YouTube, channels must comply with the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392?hl=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube Partner Program policies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, which include our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/about/policies/#community-guidelines"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Community Guidelines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182?ctx=checklist"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google AdSense program policies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advertiser-Friendly Guidelines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Channels that repeatedly violate our policies are suspended from the partner program. In addition, we removed a video from Steven Crowder’s channel for violating our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801973?hl=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;presidential election integrity policy &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;and applied a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032?hl=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;strike&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, meaning uploads are suspended for one week. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oBnnom"&gt;While YouTube isn’t telling us which straw broke the camel’s back when it comes to the YouTube Partner Program (and his ability to run ads), the company did point us towards two specific guidelines around &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9153642#Controversial_sensitive"&gt;controversial issues and sensitive events&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9153642#Harmful_dangerous"&gt;harmful and dangerous acts&lt;/a&gt;. I would have guessed that awful, racist tirades would have already broken the YouTube Partner Program’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9153642#Hateful"&gt;hateful and derogatory content&lt;/a&gt; policy, but I guess I shouldn’t read too much into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzc9ck"&gt;It’s not the first time Crowder’s been removed from the YouTube Partner Program. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18654196/steven-crowder-demonetized-carlos-maza-youtube-homophobic-language-ads"&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt;,  it took him &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365601/youtube-steven-crowder-monetization-reinstated-harassment-carlos-maza"&gt;just over a year to come back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is experimenting with hiding dislikes to protect creators’ well-being</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7s4RirOX9iMkRcEc-0mNwnWO-Hc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051226/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CyXNup"&gt;YouTube &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/1376942486594150405?s=20"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; it’s experimenting with hiding dislikes to discourage “dislike mobs” from deliberately downvoting videos from creators and channels. The experiment is a different implementation than the solutions the company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18207189/youtube-dislike-attack-mob-review-bomb-creator-insider"&gt;previously discussed&lt;/a&gt;, but it is similar to other attempts platforms like Instagram have taken to nip targeted attacks in the bud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuDtVC"&gt;In the current setup, stats for both likes and dislikes are viewable in a creator’s individual &lt;a href="http://studio.youtube.com"&gt;YouTube Studio&lt;/a&gt; page, but only likes will be displayed publicly on a video. In &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/104325801?hl=en"&gt;a support article&lt;/a&gt; explaining the test, YouTube says that dislikes can negatively impact a creator’s well-being and “may motivate a targeted campaign of dislikes on a creator’s video.” Basically, the idea is that seeing a dislike number and watching it go up could be enough motivation to join in and make the number larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ngXt4J"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;   In response to creator feedback around well-being and targeted dislike campaigns, we're testing a few new designs that don't show the public dislike count. If you're part of this small experiment, you might spot one of these designs in the coming weeks (example below!). &lt;a href="https://t.co/aemrIcnrbx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aemrIcnrbx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— YouTube (@YouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/1376942486594150405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="shLUNG"&gt;Creators rely on likes and dislikes as a form of feedback to guide their creative output, but much like purposefully giving a game a bad review on Steam, it’s easy to turn what could be a useful feature into another surface for abuse. When YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEdlaJo5YV8"&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; it was looking into addressing problems with dislikes, it was considering three ideas: hiding the numbers for both likes and dislikes, adding more friction to disliking something through requiring extra interaction, or removing likes and dislikes entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUsbYC"&gt;This test does half of what the first option promised, and it makes a certain amount of sense. If dislike numbers are the problem, why not just hide them and see what happens? Instagram experimented with a similar kind of test when it decided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20956091/instagram-testing-hiding-likes-us-bullying-mosseri"&gt;to hide likes on posts&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, likes are inherently positive, but chasing a high like count can have its own negative impact on creators whose livelihoods depend on closely monitoring interactions with their posts and appearing well-liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmd8t8"&gt;YouTube isn’t testing hiding dislikes on all creators’ videos, but if you notice them on your page or you have an opinion as a viewer, &lt;a href="http://yt.be/help/feedback"&gt;YouTube is collecting feedback&lt;/a&gt; on its site.&lt;/p&gt;
