    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from. With so many Echo devices currently available, there is a device for every occasion. Maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Echo Dot with LED display&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKAXTh"&gt;Currently, the 3rd-gen Echo Dot gets frequent price drops, and right now, you can get it for $25 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot/dp/B07FZ8S74R/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1760a049c05833dc1017f6d4057815bf&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725321348360875873" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-54148143&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. That deal is still available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B084J4MZK8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=9&amp;amp;imprToken=02bb7b89-6329-50a3-a29&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21988756%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fauthors%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1bb3f1fd7fd46e44af2bcb7b4e69ac37&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598862588130784" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the fourth-gen Echo Dot at Amazon, the retailer is currently running a promotion that allows you to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B084J4MZK8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=6&amp;amp;imprToken=02bb7b89-6329-50a3-a29&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=a703bc6b8141b27e290f322ffa1dd1f6&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21988756%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy two for $50&lt;/a&gt; (before tax) when you enter the code &lt;strong&gt;DOT2PACK&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;Right now, you can get this device for $40 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=3b2eb028219e410a9d64a5272c5f5c00&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo also includes a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;There are no active deals right now for a single Amazon Echo smart speaker, but you can get it right now for its usual price of $100 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085HK4KL6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=2dfe20818827f68bbc17c1bb24f2a7a8&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598980020491868" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770247%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the Echo from Amazon, you also get six months of Amazon Music Unlimited for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HtqAa"&gt;If you are looking for two Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $180&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $20 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oiVOWB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is one of two smart displays to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90, but right now, you can buy the device at its best-ever price of $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=d1731cf9b61b13aa734867a184283f9a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Show 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device, this includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;Normally, this device costs $130, but it has seen some good price reductions in the past. We have seen the device go down as low as $65. But if you are looking to buy the device now, you can get it for just $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=9dd29d118d711aac9ce70db04cc48e45&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TQX4oe"&gt;In 2019, Amazon released its first pair of true wireless earbuds: the Echo Buds. The Echo Buds offer superb sound quality, a comfy fit, and Bose’s noise reduction features. And, of course, they also include Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="itnaQP"&gt;Right now, there’s no active deals on the Echo Buds, but you can get them for its usual price of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Buds/dp/B07F6VM1S3/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=3619c9cbf19d90024732c6f012617549&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$130 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product you may want to purchase. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-965" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D433%26%26adid%3D22222222227281354149%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D339987579106%26wl4%3Dpla-667825192756%26wl5%3D9008008%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D111830562%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D604342441%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA61H2BRTbBBeDsoekxoiD1iyavhCvjOe-rc1VRE8KROBAR83M_YmAIBoC31kQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6-IseMU-VKzo5xzTTBT8BVk65z1R7t_lZHR-ApDuYug7wocNVuNr-RoCuiUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160, which is what this pair of wireless earbuds are currently going for at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6z1zgThWDp2tf3j60kOubPIybm5uNl4EBzedCsO2Rm4cjFVJV1QJbxoCUaAQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt; Compared to the options above, Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality, noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower.

    <title>Weird flex: TCL shows off two more of its rollable, extendable display concepts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oeWa9_KXQymfy3aK1zxsAvSBxnk=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68655003/LYS_9352_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;One of TCL’s many display concept prototypes.  | Photo: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fch6Kl"&gt;TCL has never been shy about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/3/5/21165069/tcl-foldable-trifold-phone-hands-on-rollable-concept-prototype-display-tablet"&gt;showcasing its display concepts&lt;/a&gt; at trade shows, and this year is no different; the company is (virtually) showing off a couple of these prototypes at CES 2021. Bearing in mind that there’s absolutely no guarantee these concepts will ever reach market, they’re still a fun glimpse at a possible future of display tech. First up is a mobile device with an AMOLED “rollable” screen which can extend a 6.7-inch display up to 7.8 inches. TCL says the device is less than 10mm thick with a 3mm bend radius.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LntOdWD6vCfAIeIVbVpxY4NZj8s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228685/Jan_11_2021_13_26_56.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL calls this a rollable display, though there’s no outwardly obvious rolling action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wWKRU8"&gt;A similar concept appears in one of the more unintentionally funny promotional videos we’ve seen at CES so far this year. It’s an extendable display concept that unrolls on two sides, like a scroll, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266637/folding-phones-bendable-screens-names-illustrated-guide"&gt;an “I’m Gonna Steal the Declaration of Independence,”&lt;/a&gt; which is a technical term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="We7Szl"&gt;TCL says the screen itself is also thinner at just 0.18mm thick. The company tries to drive home the space-saving advantages of this concept with a video of a hiker pulling it out of a bag on the trail. Unfortunately, it looks about as authentic as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18088620/samsung-foldable-phone-science-fiction-movies-television-westworld-star-trek"&gt;our favorite folding gadgets of sci-fi&lt;/a&gt; do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj-GLDzQZQ14TfLMnotVvSzoN00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228752/Jan_11_2021_13_52_13.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="58LyxA"&gt;TCL does appear to have a working prototype version of this technology, though it’s smaller and not quite as robust-looking as the hiker video would suggest. And while the company says it will bring a foldable / flexible product to market this year, we’d put our money on a regular ol’ folding phone — it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21049747/tcl-10-pro-10l-5g-phones-brand-folding-prototype-ces-2020"&gt;working on one for a while now&lt;/a&gt; — rather than one of these concepts. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0pra4FxhFzrVjAbfrN33rR2cDj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228808/Jan_11_2021_14_12_26.gif"&gt;

    <title>GM unveils electric delivery van with 250 miles of range as part of new spinoff business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BuoCpLkdi15nQ6ZXU9O-5l83kQ4=/0x0:7800x5200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68654956/BrightDrop_EV600_image_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7BoBE9"&gt;General Motors announced Tuesday it will be spinning out a new delivery and logistics business called BrightDrop, the first products of which will be an electrified pallet and delivery van. Both vehicles, which will be powered by GM’s Ultium battery platform, are slated for release this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyNSa3"&gt;The announcement of the new logistics business comes as GM is undergoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575153/gm-electric-ev-investment-deadline-cadillac-chevy-hummer"&gt;a massive, $27 billion pivot&lt;/a&gt; to the business of designing and manufacturing electric vehicles. For example, the company, which is the largest automaker in North America, just unveiled a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220574/gm-new-logo-electric-vehicle-brand-ces-2021"&gt;new logo as part of an overall brand redesign&lt;/a&gt;. GM has been nipping at the heels of Tesla and other EV makers as it attempts to convince its investors that it has a firm grasp on the future of electric-powered transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vqHG6b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM has been nipping at the heels of Tesla&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="totfZF"&gt;BrightDrop will be a key piece of that pivot, in which hundreds of thousands of electric delivery vehicles are expected to hit the road in the years to come. GM envisions the new company “creating a one-stop shop, a complete ecosystem” for electric-powered delivery, including vehicles, software, and other services, said Pamela Fletcher, VP of GM’s global EV program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTKfNL"&gt;	&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X4jbiOMG2oVreRkRO2xxBmzf9YQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22229883/BrightDrop_EP1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qFQ9l1"&gt;The first vehicle to roll out with the BrightDrop branding will be a delivery pallet called EP1. The pallet, which can be used to transport packages from a delivery vehicle to a customer’s front door, will have an Ultium-powered electric propulsion that will allow a top speed of 3 mph. Packages can be secured within the EP1 pallet, which comes with adjustable shelving and lockable cabinet-style doors. In addition, EP1 can carry up to 23 cubic feet of cargo and will have a payload capacity of 200 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VuPGz4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a top speed of 3 mph&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BmY2nf"&gt;Fletcher says that the EP1 is meant to address the problem seen with package delivery today, in which “packages are often strewn on city sidewalks,” haphazardly and unsecured. “We saw this as a solution to create a completely different environment for delivery,” Fletcher continued, “really to help package touch points, reduce errors, reduce physical strain on those delivering the goods, help optimize curb time, and help reduce overall operational costs for businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKQHEq"&gt;GM partnered with FedEx Express on a pilot last year to test out the EP1. Using the electric pallet allowed FedEx workers to handle 25 percent more packages a day, Fletcher said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PShWZJE6dX5Zkh1VcgVVWpX2xzk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22229885/BrightDrop_EV600_image_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UV2r16"&gt;The EP1 will go into production in “early 2021,” Fletcher said. Following that will be the EV600, a 250-mile range delivery van with 600 cubic feet of cargo space and a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds. It will have a peak charge rate of up to 170 miles per hour when hooked up to a 120kW DC fast charger. That vehicle will go into production in late 2021, with the first vehicles to be delivered by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqGJ0b"&gt;The BrightDrop EV600 will include a security system with motion sensors to help keep the cargo area secure. Other features include front sliding pocket doors, wide cabin walkways, and a large auto-open cargo bulkhead door. The commercial vehicles will come with a number of advanced driver assist features, including blind spot detection, lane keep assist, and front and rear parking assist. A fairly sizable 13.4-inch digital infotainment screen is sure to be the centerpiece of the interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ehzHr3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FedEx has expressed interest in buying an unspecified number of EV600 delivery vans&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zbpw7U"&gt;FedEx has expressed interest in buying an unspecified number of EV600 delivery vans, said Fletcher, who also alluded to several other unnamed interested customers. “We have letters of intent signed from a number of other customers, and we want to be talking to you about those in the not too distant future,” she said. Fletcher declined to reveal the suggested retail price for the EP1 and EV600. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrJCTG"&gt;BrightDrop is also offering a range of software to customers who purchase its new commercial vehicles. This will enable customers to track the location of each EP1 pallet, remote lock and unlock each pallet, and monitor battery status. EV600 will also get battery status and location monitoring features, as well as driver safety coaching and incident recording, remote diagnostics, safety alerts and predictive maintenance insights, and over-the-air updates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AaeXPlrGPBzOF8MNRDKBfBvoER4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22229886/BrightDrop_Ecosystem.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sfir5k"&gt;Rumors of a GM-made electric delivery van, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280862/gm-bv1-electric-van-delivery-ultium-amazon-ford-transit"&gt;nicknamed “BV1,”&lt;/a&gt; first surfaced last year, after the company unveiled its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;Ultium EV platform&lt;/a&gt; along with plans to roll out two dozen new electric vehicles over the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E22Zgz"&gt;GM has found success with its Chevrolet Express and, to a lesser extent, GMC Savana cargo vans. But it’s far from the only company working on an electric van. Mercedes-Benz is making &lt;a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/388696/mercedes-benz-esprinter-electric-van/"&gt;an electric version of its popular Sprinter&lt;/a&gt; van, while Ford recently revealed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21559954/ford-e-transit-electric-delivery-cargo-van-price-specs-range"&gt;E-Transit&lt;/a&gt; with 126 miles of range and a $45,000 price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507495/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-date-specs"&gt;Amazon is working on an all-electric delivery vehicle&lt;/a&gt; with the EV startup Rivian.

    <title>Who decides what stays on the internet?</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p&gt;Regulation expert Daphne Keller on where moderation goes after banning Trump&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="oWIJqn"&gt;The past week has seen the US government thrown into crisis after an unprecedented attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob — all part of a messy attempt to overturn the election, egged on by President Donald Trump himself. Yesterday, the House of Representatives introduced an article of impeachment against Trump for incitement of insurrection. This is a turning point for the American experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNy8KY"&gt;Part of that turning point is the role of internet platform companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJwQeF"&gt;My guest today is Professor Daphne Keller, director of the Program on Platform Regulation at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center, and we’re talking about a big problem: how to moderate what happens on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNyjlD"&gt;In the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol, both Twitter and Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"&gt;banned Trump&lt;/a&gt;, as did a host of smaller platforms. Other platforms like Stripe stopped processing donations to his website. Reddit banned the Donald Trump subreddit — the list goes on. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;a smaller competitor to Twitter was effectively pushed off the internet&lt;/a&gt;, as Apple and Google removed it from their app stores, and Amazon kicked it off Amazon Web Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9BdSN"&gt;All of these actions were taken under dire circumstances — an attempted coup from a sitting president that left six people dead. But they are all part of a larger debate about content moderation across the internet that’s been heating up for over a year now, a debate that is extremely complicated and much more sophisticated than any of the people yelling about free speech and the First Amendment really give credit to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIij4b"&gt;Professor Keller has been on many sides of the content moderation system: before coming to Stanford, she was an associate general counsel at Google, where she was responsible for takedown requests relating to search results. She’s also published work on the messy interaction between the law and the terms of service agreements when it comes to free expression online. I really wanted her help understanding the frameworks content moderation decisions get made in, what limits these companies, and what other models we might use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gqLaoU"&gt;Two notes: you’ll hear Professor Keller talk about “CDA 230” a lot — that’s a reference to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;Section 230&lt;/a&gt;, the law that says platforms aren’t liable for what their users publish. And pay attention to how quickly the conversation turns to competition — the size and scale of the big platform companies are key parts of the moderation debate in ways that surprised even me. Okay, Daphne Keller, director of the Program on Platform Regulation at Stanford. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RihK5H"&gt;Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KlmjyO"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP3501099770" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VQgGoh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is a lightly edited excerpt from our conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jvb8up"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2020 was a big inflection point in the conversation about content moderation. There was an endless amount of debate about Section 230, which is the law that says platforms aren’t liable for what their users post. Trump insisted that it be repealed, which is a bad idea for a variety of reasons. Interestingly to me, Joe Biden’s platform position is also that 230 be repealed, which is unique among Democrats. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfpMjB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That conversation really heated up over the last week: Trump incited a riot at the Capitol and got himself banned from Twitter and Facebook, among other platforms. For example, Stripe, a platform we don’t think about in the context of Twitter or Facebook, stopped processing payments from the Trump campaign website.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbdxQ0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Following that, a competitor to Twitter called &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, which had very lax content moderation rules, became the center of attention. It got itself removed from both the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google app stores&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Web Services pulled the plug on its web hosting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; — effectively, the service was shut down by large tech companies that control distribution points. That’s a lot of different points in the tech stack. One of the things that I’m curious about is, it feels like we had a year of 230 debate, and now, a bunch of other people are showing up and saying, “What should content moderation be?” But there is actually a pretty sophisticated existing framework and debate in industry and in academia. Can you help me understand what the existing frameworks in the debate look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ve4dJ6"&gt;I actually think there’s a big gap between the debate in DC, the debate globally, and the debate among experts in academia. DC has been a circus, with lawmakers just making things up and throwing spaghetti at the wall. There were over 20 legislative proposals to change CDA 230 last year, and a lot of them were just theater. By contrast, globally, and especially in Europe, there’s work on a huge legislative package, the Digital Services Act. There’s a lot of attention where I think it should be placed on just the logistics of content moderation. How do you moderate that much speech at once? How do you define rules that even can be imposed on that much speech at once?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwRwXo"&gt;The proposals in Europe include things like getting courts involved in deciding what speech is illegal, instead of putting that in the hands of private companies. Having processes so that when users have their speech taken down, they get notified, and they have an opportunity to respond and say if they think they’ve been falsely accused. And then, if what we’re talking about is the platforms’ own power to take things down, the European proposal and some of the US proposals, also involve things like making sure platforms are really as clear as they can be about what their rules are, telling users how the rules have been enforced, and letting users appeal those discretionary takedown decisions. And just trying to make it so that users understand what they’re getting, and ideally so that there is also enough competition that they can migrate somewhere else if they don’t like the rules that are being imposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbCX42"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The question about competition to me feels like it’s at the heart of a lot of the controversy, without ever being at the forefront. Over the weekend, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/google"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, AWS, Okta, and Twilio all decided they weren’t going to work with Parler anymore because it didn’t have the necessary content moderation standards. I think Amazon made public a letter they’d sent to Parler saying, “We’ve identified 98 instances where you should have moderated this harder, and you’re out of our terms of service. We’re not going to let incitement of violence happen through AWS.” If all of those companies can effectively take Parler off the internet, how can you have a rival company to Twitter with a different content moderation standard? Because it feels like if you want to start a service that has more lax moderation, you will run into AWS saying, “Well, here’s the floor.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="oVwCZq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9xGyCZ"&gt;This is why if you go deep enough in the internet’s technical stack, down from consumer-facing services like Facebook or Twitter, to really essential infrastructure, like your ISP, mobile carrier, or access providers, we have net neutrality rules — or we &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; net neutrality rules — saying those companies do have to be common carriers. They do have to provide their services to everyone. They can’t become discretionary censors or choose what ideas can flow on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdC3Id"&gt;Obviously, we have a big debate in this country about net neutrality, even at that very bottom layer. But the examples that you just listed show that we need to have the same conversation about anyone who might be seen as essential infrastructure. If Cloudflare, for example, is protecting a service from hacking, and when Cloudflare boots you off the service, you effectively can’t be on the internet anymore. We should talk about what the rules should be for Cloudflare. And in that case, their CEO, Matthew Prince, wrote a great op-ed, saying, “I shouldn’t have this power. We should be a democracy, and decide how this happens, and it shouldn’t be that random tech CEOs become the arbiters of what speech can flow on the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0leG2S"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So we are talking about many different places in the stack, and I’ve always been a proponent of net neutrality at the ISP level, where it is very hard for most people to switch. There’s a lot of pricing games, and there’s not a lot of competition. It makes a lot of sense for neutrality to exist there. At the user-facing platform level, the very top of the stack, Twitter, I don’t know that I think Twitter neutrality makes any sense. Google is another great example. There’s an idea that search neutrality is a conceptual thing that you can introduce to Google. What is the spectrum of neutrality for a pipe? I’m not sure if search neutrality is even possible. It sounds great to say. I like saying it. Where do you think the gradations of that spectrum lie?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAmprf"&gt;For a service like Twitter or Facebook, if they were neutral, if they allowed every single thing to be posted, or even every single legal thing the First Amendment allows, they would be cesspools. They would be free speech mosh pits. And like real-world mosh pits, there’s some white guys who would like, it and everybody else would flee. That’s a problem — both because they would become far less useful as sites for civil discourse, but also because the advertisers would go away, the platforms would stop making money, and the audience would leave. They would be effectively useless if they had to carry everything. I think most people, realistically, do want them to kick out the Nazis. They do want them to weed out bullying, porn, pro-anorexia content, and just the tide of garbage that would otherwise inundate the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="wNT9Kb"&gt;In the US, it’s conservatives who have been raising this question, but globally, people all across the political spectrum raise it. The question is: are the big platforms such de facto gatekeepers in controlling discourse and access to an audience that they ought to be subject to some other kind of rules? You hinted at it earlier. That’s kind of a competition question. There’s a nexus of competition and speech questions that we are not wrangling with well yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix promises at least one new movie every week in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZpnNfuRWqpWyALqFEbtjwf_HvQ0=/0x1:1619x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68654755/zendaya_jdw.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;DOMINIC MILLER/NETFLIX&amp;nbsp;© 2021&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VvNDgv"&gt;If you’re a Netflix subscriber, the company wants you to know there’s a lot of new movies coming. Netflix has 70 movies on its roster, more than Disney and Warner Bros. combined, according to the 2021 film slate the company released today. They include directorial debuts by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Halle Berry and the final installment in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134580/netflix-to-all-the-boys-ive-loved-before-release-stream-subscriber"&gt;&lt;em&gt;To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;trilogy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48RSlE"&gt;This may not end up being a complete list — Netflix is likely to acquire films throughout the year. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21545812/amc-theaters-financial-earnings-q3-bankruptcy-streaming-warner-bros-disney-regal"&gt;theatrical landscape remains shaky&lt;/a&gt;, and Netflix is in a prime position to purchase films that studios like Universal or Paramount may sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3DJam"&gt;And Netflix was one of the few companies that surged as people stayed at home during a global pandemic. But with more competition in the streaming space, Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22215274/wonder-woman-1984-hamilton-hbo-max-disney-plus-numbers-streaming-success"&gt;needs more films and television shows&lt;/a&gt; to vie for people’s attention and wallets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lr2HIw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If people can’t go to the theaters, the studios will bring movies to people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TCT8W6"&gt;If people can’t go to the theaters, the studios will bring movies to people. That’s the philosophy behind WarnerMedia’s recent decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;simultaneously release movies&lt;/a&gt; on HBO Max as they debut in theaters. Executives hope that some of those films, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21075594/dune-movie-trailer-denis-villeneuve-paul-atreides-timotee-chalamet-spice-sandworm-rebecca-ferguson"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377415/suicide-squad-2-james-gunn-fandome-characters-introduction-dc-comics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/21/20826649/matrix-sequel-m4trix-keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss-lana-wachowski-fan-wishes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;will bring in HBO Max subscribers — and in doing so, take some of the attention away from Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5nrNm"&gt;Netflix has never released its slate of films all at once. But it hasn’t had this much competition before, either. WarnerMedia had its Warner Bros. and HBO Max announcement, and Disney held a massive investor day in December, firing off title after title coming to Disney Plus 2021 and 2022. Netflix, which is better at retaining subscribers, is reminding customers why they stick around: consistency and talent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuFe18"&gt;Below are the 70 films Netflix has announced for 2021. Some have previously announced release dates attached to the titles, while others are due out later in the year. Synopses for each &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-2021-film-preview"&gt;can be found on Netflix’s site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Condé Nast Entertainment wanted a major podcast network, but the producers say they got burned instead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A39ydv2WxBniXTLmacOq3Q22GQ4=/0x0:1593x1062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68654740/cne.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Condé Nast Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="isfBkU"&gt;Condé Nast &lt;a href="https://www.condenast.com/news/conde-nast-debuts-influence-network"&gt;had big plans&lt;/a&gt; for podcasts in 2020. It launched its new, eponymous podcast network and three initial shows — &lt;em&gt;The Pitchfork Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Get Wired&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;In Vogue — &lt;/em&gt;this summer with an initial presentation at the NewFronts conference for media buyers&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;But by the end of December, most of the people who created and worked on those new shows were no longer employed by the company. In &lt;a href="https://formerlycneaudio.medium.com/our-experience-making-podcasts-for-cond%C3%A9-nast-1cc802807891"&gt;a statement today&lt;/a&gt;, 11 former Condé Nast Entertainment (CNE) contract producers and editors allege the company mishandled their employment, outsourced their work to additional contractors, and, generally, bungled the network through mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wBa79"&gt;“We believe that Condé Nast could have a bright future in audio,” they write. “However, we don’t foresee success for this or any audio initiative that doesn’t respect its producers, editors, engineers, or the creative work they’re making.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqOAoE"&gt;The producers and editors who built these shows were brought on as contractors, and often worked longer hours than scheduled, even pulling all-nighters, without benefits. They pitched, produced, and edited the shows, along with training magazine staffers on how to create audio content. They say Condé told them they couldn’t be brought on as full-time staff because of a hiring freeze. Only two people who worked on these shows were full-time employees, they say, and both of these employees have since turned in their resignation notices, making it unclear who will produce the network’s shows in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9YhMOq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The statement also details lessons they believe companies should learn from this situation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gm8UrK"&gt;Media companies have been increasingly interested in podcasts as the buzzing industry continues to offer opportunities for monetization. But many companies have found that making a great show requires expertise and a dedicated staff, and they don’t necessarily want to employ all those people themselves. That’s led Condé and other companies to seek help from partners that specialize in audio. &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;, for example, partnered with iHeartMedia to create its &lt;a href="https://blog.iheart.com/post/buzzfeed-news-and-iheartmedia-have-come-together-make-impeachment-today-podcast-trump"&gt;impeachment podcast&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeedpress/buzzfeed-iheartmedia-announce-original-podcast-news"&gt;a news program&lt;/a&gt; it launched last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYXmVb"&gt;When Condé’s contractors were hired, most were actually employed through a contracting company called Ettain instead of Condé itself, the former employees say. These producers and editors also say they were kept on short-term contracts and left in the dark about the future of the shows they helped create. &lt;em&gt;The Pitchfork Review&lt;/em&gt; team says they were “teased” with the possibility of a full-time staff position, only to later be told the show would instead be outsourced to an outside production company, Neon Hum, starting the next business day. They were offered the chance to move to the &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yz4peP"&gt;“They wanted [us] to train this production company, that they were outsourcing our show to, to take our jobs,” Caitlin Pierce, a senior producer for the show, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s not that they didn’t think we could do it, or we’re doing a bad job, but they wanted us to move over all our processes to other people to make it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CZ7orM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One producer quit after being told she’d have to transfer teams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PC92gS"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;In Vogue &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Get Wired&lt;/em&gt; teams then began asking Condé for more transparency on the shows’ futures. Instead, the &lt;em&gt;In Vogue&lt;/em&gt; team says they received an automated, unpersonalized email from Ettain three days before their contract was set to expire saying that they’d no longer be employed and could start filing for unemployment on December 18th. The &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; team was offered an additional three-and-a-half-week contract, which was rescinded after they pushed back asking for an extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNvCu3"&gt;The sudden news for all these teams was especially shocking, they tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, because at &lt;em&gt;Get&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, for example, the team was already discussing 2021 plans. “Most of [December] was spent talking about plans and planning our production schedules for episodes and ideas that we had for season two,” says Ben Montoya, a former producer for &lt;em&gt;The Pitchfork Review&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Get Wired&lt;/em&gt;. He says the team planned “ambitious investigations and miniseries,” yet the company didn’t extend their contracts or negotiate with them about doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sE1Ay"&gt;The fate of these shows is unclear. A source close to the situation says advertisers bought inventory in &lt;em&gt;Get Wired&lt;/em&gt;, which was initially slated to premiere its second season in February. But this source also says Neon Hum hasn’t signed any new production deals with CNE going forward. (Neon Hum declined to comment for this story.) Meanwhile, Condé has seemingly shifted its podcasting plan to outsourcing production, possibly because of a change in leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUjkEB"&gt;Agnes Chu, a former Disney Plus executive, &lt;a href="https://www.condenast.com/news/agnes-chu-joins-conde-nast-as-cne-president"&gt;now leads CNE&lt;/a&gt; and took over for former CNE leader Oren Katzeff in July, after his old, problematic tweets &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/conde-nast-staffers-expose-entertainment-chiefs-old-tweets-about-mexicans-and-women"&gt;surfaced&lt;/a&gt;. The source close to Condé says Katzeff’s vision was to create a podcasting team in-house whereas Chu thinks the most effective way to create shows is outsourcing their production. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, CNE said it saw “much growth” in its audio business in 2020 and suggested it might look to rehire some people, which would be news to the producers and editors. “As we continue those series and develop new projects for this year’s slate, we hope to not only bring back some of our teams, but also build new creative partnerships with the best in the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2HHae"&gt;For the producers and editors, they see what happened as a result of big media companies looking to podcasting for new revenue and bringing in outside contractors to pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98HKOI"&gt;“I think it’s a great example of how the people who do the most work are always treated as if they’re disposable,” says Tarkor Zehn, a former&lt;em&gt; In Vogue &lt;/em&gt;associate producer. “It’s important for companies to realize that if you want to invest in the product, you have to invest in the people who make the work.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber is bringing its EV and public transit features to more cities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEKTexQRO5JLlyI7dD8MJuL7ZdQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68654760/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sZKTzX"&gt;Uber Green, the feature that allows customers to request rides in electric vehicles, is coming to more cities. After initially launching in 15 cities last September, the ride-hail company is bringing the feature to 1,400 additional cities and towns in North America. The new markets include Austin, Calgary, Houston, Miami, New York City, Tucson, Winnipeg, Washington, DC, and hundreds more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1X4Dc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427196/uber-promise-100-percent-electric-vehicle-ev-2030"&gt;Uber claims that “100 percent” of rides&lt;/a&gt; on its platform will take place in electric vehicles by 2030 in the US, Canada, and Europe, and by 2040 for the rest of the world. But rather than pay drivers directly to trade their gas-burning vehicles for electric ones, the company will impose an extra fee on trips completed in an electric vehicle to incentivize drivers to make the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JE0eOl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For a dollar extra, riders can specifically request a hybrid or electric vehicle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AvPZFl"&gt;For a dollar extra, riders can specifically request a hybrid or electric vehicle. Uber drivers who use hybrid or electric vehicles to pick up passengers will get an extra 50 cents per ride, while drivers using specifically battery-electric vehicles get another dollar on top of that — for a total of $1.50 extra per ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIneIu"&gt;Uber is also announcing new partnerships designed to get more drivers in less polluting vehicles. In Los Angeles, Uber drivers can rent hybrid or electric vehicles through Avis’ new EV rental program. Drivers in San Francisco can rent a vehicle with Ample technology and quickly swap their EV batteries in mere minutes, then return to the road fully charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElmGi8"&gt;Uber has been linked to rising car congestion and increased pollution in cities. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7v4kd/uber-and-lyft-say-they-reduce-car-ownership-but-that-might-not-be-true"&gt;A new study from Carnegie Mellon&lt;/a&gt; found that the benefit from people ditching their cars to use ride-hailing services is negated by new vehicles added to the road by aspiring Uber and Lyft drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BG5cts"&gt;Lastly, Uber is expanding its public transportation feature to more cities. The company is launching its journey planning feature, which allows customers to swipe through bus and train schedules and plan their entire journey on public transportation, in Atlanta, Auckland, Brisbane, Buenos Aires, Guadalajara, Philadelphia, Rome, Bangalore, Chennai, and Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZDEzA"&gt;In addition, Uber is launching Uber Transit, which allows customers to plan multimodal trips including trains, buses, walking, and Uber rides in Mexico City and London. They are the third and fourth city to get Uber Transit, after Sydney and Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tplZx"&gt;For years, Uber has faced criticism for its &lt;a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2019/01/22/study-uber-and-lyft-are-responsible-for-u-s-transit-decline/"&gt;negative effects on public transportation&lt;/a&gt; in the US. Declining bus and subway ridership has been pegged to the rise of Uber’s popularity in dozens of cities. The company hopes to blunt that criticism by giving transit equal footing in its app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos introduces $69 battery replacement kit for its Move wireless speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a9XGXhuLrqGUFHmtsdIB7kO_bl4=/72x0:1968x1264/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68654741/sonoskit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f8o9q4"&gt;Sonos will help customers get more longevity out of its $399 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871409/sonos-move-wireless-bluetooth-speaker-review-alexa-google-assistant-wifi-price-specs-sound-quality"&gt;Sonos Move wireless speaker&lt;/a&gt; by offering a new battery replacement kit. The Move is Sonos’ first battery-powered speaker, whereas the company’s other products all plug into the wall. The kit costs $69 and includes the battery, a couple tools that help remove the old one, and a pair of replacement screws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="in3OLa"&gt;“The new replacement battery kit was designed so customers can continue to enjoy extended battery life for their speaker even after years of use, without needing to replace the speaker altogether,” Sonos says. The company has previously mentioned that the Move’s battery can be swapped out, but it hasn’t offered the standalone battery until now. You can order it from the Sonos website.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_KayO3-sJlEUXj7X-F5paCPoizY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19208412/dseifert_190915_3647_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Move’s battery is estimated to last around 900 charge cycles (approximately three years).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rzBWXI"&gt;Considering how little comes with the kit, replacing the Move’s battery doesn’t seem like that daunting of a task. You can purchase the battery replacement kit in either black or white to match the color of whichever Move you own. As for what to do with the old battery, your best bet is taking it to a local e-waste recycling facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQLw9j"&gt;Fresh out of the box, the Sonos Move is estimated to reach around 11 hours of continuous music playback. And the company has said the factory-installed battery should last for around 900 charge cycles (or roughly three years). But if you eventually notice the battery life getting shorter and shorter, you’ve now got an option for restoring full capacity. That’s an option that a lot of wireless speakers just don’t give you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES Day 1: TCL takes its shot and Intel hunkers down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0niGOAeGhMkknE1uM082mZuo2O8=/0x1:2084x1390/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68654362/TCL8K.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dqRelE"&gt;One of the things that usually happens at CES in Las Vegas is you get a sense that one company or another is really going hard. A few years ago &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/6/16858000/google-assistant-ces-2018-ces-booth"&gt;Google started throwing unseemly amounts of money at an outdoor CES installation&lt;/a&gt; in a bid to show that the Google Assistant was ready to dominate the smart home. It was an acceleration of a trend in the smart home: a battle with Alexa to form an ecosystem. Standing outside the convention center in 2018, that trend loomed large both metaphorically and physically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40Lv8K"&gt;Now that CES is online-only, it’s a little harder for companies to puff their chests out and declare that they (or their products) have hit the big time. One company seemed to be doing its very best to try, though: TCL. And another company, Intel, is trying to drum up excitement for its processors even as we’re still goggle-eyed at the performance Apple achieved on its own chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8KbF5"&gt;I’ll have some thoughts on both TCL and Intel below, then a roundup of the rest of the biggest news from the first day of CES (including LG’s newer, brighter OLED TVs). Before that, though I’ve got a couple pieces of housekeeping. First, it’s time for the yearly requirement for this newsletter to point you to our &lt;a href="https://www.voxmedia.com/legal/privacy-notice"&gt;privacy notice&lt;/a&gt;, which I’m told has no major changes this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="dfhY2J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9028921"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ELlrdk"&gt;Second, we have a new newsletter! &lt;strong&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/strong&gt; is a weekly email rounding up some of the best deals on gadgets our commerce team has found. You &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;can subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upd0Jg"&gt;TCL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="J7QwcQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers might be most familiar with TCL thanks to its well-received TVs, which provide good quality for good prices. They regularly top our recommended lists because of that value. Last year TCL said it would be trying harder to establish its brand in the US phone market, but it didn’t really take. This year, the company has pulled out all the stops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmfjhP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224277/tcl-tv-xl-collection-8k-6-series-od-zero-announced-ces-2021"&gt;TCL announced the XL Collection line of TVs, vowing to take 8K mainstream this year&lt;/a&gt;. TCL has that reputation for value, but it what it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wants is to be considered a tech innovator — in the same class as Sony, Samsung, and LG. As Chris Welch notes, the company went so far as to publish a “prickly” blog post that touted its early adoption of Mini LED technology. It also took a shot at OLED TV technology, which is functionally equivalent to taking a shot at LG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ix4uCV"&gt;TCL is also trying to get you to associate it with other categories of products. It is readying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22221389/tcl-wearable-display-glasses-moveaudio-s600-pet-tracker-ces"&gt;Wearable Display glasses for launch, new wireless buds, a pet tracker&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219269/tcl-nxtpaper-tablet-color-display-ereader"&gt;TCL NXTPAPER, a cross between a tablet and an e-reader&lt;/a&gt;. That last gadget has an interesting LCD screen that behaves a bit more like e-paper yet provides full color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1ejzQ"&gt;TCL’s phone announcements today included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219101/tcl-20-5g-20-se-android-phone-price-specs"&gt;two low-end 5G phones with the promise of more to come&lt;/a&gt;. When I saw that, I joked that “TCL” stands for “Tryin’ to Copy LG.” But the more I think about it, the more I think it’s not a joke. When it comes to phones, TCL is in fact trying to occupy the space LG used to take up. It has 5G phones ready to go and wants to be the brand carriers turn to when they want something less expensive than Samsung and Apple to sell to customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bcY2jt"&gt;TCL is flooding the zone with inexpensive smartphones this year, part of its overall push to gain more brand recognition in the US. So it’s not about copying LG after all — it’s about supplanting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rNr0G"&gt;Why should TCL’s push matter to you? In a word: competition. Even if you don’t buy a TCL gadget this year, it’s worth watching to see if the pressure it’s trying to bring to bear will have any impact. Or if, like so many things at CES, it’s all for show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FllMUL"&gt;Intel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RxZTyD"&gt;Intel is another company that tried to tell a big story about big changes this year. Intel has tried to use CES as a launch point to bolster its brand more than once. The most notable recent example would be 2018, when its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/9/16867298/intel-keynote-ces-2018-brian-krzanich-behind-the-scenes-show-meltdown-spectre"&gt;flamboyant keynote happened immediately after a series of very bad security problems for its chips&lt;/a&gt;. The whole issue cast a shadow over the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCMmHY"&gt;No security problems this year, but there’s still a shadow. This time it’s being cast by Apple, which recently introduced the truly superb M1 Arm-based chip on its laptops and gave Intel the boot in the process. Now I usually dislike the way these chip battles are sometimes set up because it’s too reductive: the PC market is vast and multifaceted. But Apple’s chips are such a big deal that there’s really no way to think about Intel and PCs without reference to how the company suddenly has a competitor that is producing systems vastly more efficient than Intel can manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMElSm"&gt;It’s not reasonable to expect Intel to have a full response to the M1 already, but it turns out the company does plan on introducing something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225514/intel-12th-gen-hybrid-alder-lake-chips-2h-ces-2021"&gt;later this year that could be competitive in the form of its 12th Gen chips, dubbed Alder Lake&lt;/a&gt;. I have no idea if Intel can come anywhere close to the performance per watt Apple has achieved, but I do like that Intel is pushing to experiment with the the overall package of high-performance and high-efficiency cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="I0mRHY"&gt;But what’s notable is Intel’s scope here, with plans for hybrid chips that will scale far beyond simple mobile devices. The timing is particularly apt: the Alder Lake chips represent Intel’s closest product to Arm-based chips that are built like the game-changing M1 processors that Apple introduced in November. The fact that Intel is looking to scale its hybrid chips across its lineup could indicate that the company is looking to emulate Apple’s Arm success with its own technology going forward — an intriguing idea, particularly as Intel’s more traditional chip strategies continue to face delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TUaE28"&gt;The knock on Intel is that it can’t seem to get it together and transition its chips down to the 10nm and 7nm processes that power so much of the competition. That knock is well deserved, but it too is reductive in some ways. Even under the constraints of 14nm, Intel does have a few things coming that could power some pretty great devices this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1255838446"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225541/intel-processor-11th-gen-ces-2021-chips-specs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intel’s new Core i9-11900K flagship processor will arrive in early 2021 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qclnM8"&gt;Despite the 11th Gen moniker, though, the new Rocket Lake-S chips are still technically 14nm chips — they don’t use the 10nm process. However, they do feature Intel’s Cypress Cove cores, which bring over the 10nm core design back to 14nm, allowing for faster speeds along with Intel’s faster Xe integrated graphics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1255837745"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225370/intel-11th-gen-h-series-chips-ultraportable-gaming-laptop-ces-2021"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intel’s latest 11th Gen H-series chips promise the fastest ultraportable gaming laptops yet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="IKlQHh"&gt;So while the new 35W H-series chips won’t be the processors found in the beefiest and best gaming laptops money can buy, they will offer some pretty impressive performance — meaning smaller or lighter laptops could start punching above their weight class, even with smaller core counts and less thermal headroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Ty0iRc"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fe6RRT"&gt;Laptops and PCs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6T74ny"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218445/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus-features-price-specs-release-date"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft’s new Surface Pro 7 Plus has a bigger battery, removable SSD, and LTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; All good additions, and it’s good Microsoft recognized this is a “Plus” update and not a full revision. Because the design here still looks stale compared to the Surface Pro X. Which makes me wonder what will come first: an Intel chip in a Surface Pro X, an Arm-based chip with powerful performance in the Surface Pro X, or the heat death of the universe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGihnb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22221393/lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-convertible-laptop-price-release-date"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lenovo’s ThinkPad X12 Detachable has a 12-inch screen that’s, well, detachable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a dead-ahead ThinkPad take on the Surface Pro and in some ways it’s what I wish Microsoft would do. Slightly updated design that still feels classically “ThinkPad” with some very utilitarian benefits (MIL-SPEC 810G for durability), but sadly not enough ports. Excited to see this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1255857053"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224455/hp-elite-folio-announced-arm-convertible-laptop-specs-ces-2021"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HP announces Snapdragon-powered Elite Folio convertible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Unique form factor and checks a lot of spec boxes. I just wish I could trust that Windows on Arm will be good enough this year to recommend to most people. Some people will get huge benefit out of this, though, as long as they know what they’re getting into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="jrfDrS"&gt;The processor is Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2, and there’s also LTE and 5G connectivity through the X20 and X55 modems. The Folio can be configured with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There are two USB-C 3.2 ports and a headphone jack. HP is claiming up to 24.5 hours of battery life when watching locally stored video files, but we’ll have to see for ourselves how that plays out in more realistic workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sCmh6H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/11/22225044/western-digital-portable-ssds-storage-4tb-price-announced"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Western Digital doubles the storage in its portable SSDs to 4TB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; It won’t work very well as external storage for next-gen consoles, but it could be a boon for video creators on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0W1onf"&gt;So instead of building yet another flap, the garage door opener company set out to build an entire door of its own — with a doggie portal that would completely seal and lock when it closes. Preferably, it’d be a pet door you wouldn’t even know was there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ajHNc5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224950/lutron-caseta-outdoor-smart-plug-lights-severe-weather"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lutron’s outdoor smart plug can control your lights through any season&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Oh this is smart. Separating out the computer guts from the outdoor lighting is a really good idea, as outdoor lighting is way more diverse and less standardized than indoor bulbs — by necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qJmHWG"&gt;The original Aware motion-sensing system detects how Wi-Fi signals bounce around your house between routers in a mesh system. Movement naturally interferes with those signals, allowing the routers to act as a motion-sensing setup without the need for any additional hardware. ... Now, Linksys is adding support to leverage other internet-connected smart home products — like speakers, smart switches, and thermostats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The “bright room” thing is second only to high prices when it comes to things that make me reticent about OLED (burn-in is third, but it’s a distant third).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="apBLxu"&gt;Brightness has remained a winning factor for LCD TVs over many years; despite perfect blacks and amazing viewing angles, sometimes an OLED set just won’t get the job done if you stick it in an ultra-bright room. But LG says the Evo panel found in its new G1 series — succeeding 2020’s GX lineup — can crank higher than any of its previous OLED TVs for improved luminosity and HDR. LG likens this achievement to past OLED milestones like 4K HDR and the introduction of 8K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yNjU20"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223767/lg-webos-6-tv-software-oled-qned-lcd-redesign"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LG is overhauling its webOS TV software — and maybe ruining it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; ”Look how they massacred my boy,” &lt;em&gt;The Godfather&lt;/em&gt;, 1972 and also me, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

Some time ago Apple anointed an LG monitor as the go-to display for its computers. It was and is a very nice monitor — and this seems like it will be a worthy successor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3Wj12T"&gt;Bravia Core isn’t going to replace Netflix, but it seems like it was specifically designed to show customers the ultimate capabilities of their new TV set.
