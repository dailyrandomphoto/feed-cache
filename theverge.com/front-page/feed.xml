    <title>PSA: you’ve only got a few more weeks to upload unlimited pictures to Google Photos for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TtIxvtarQWoUrN9nRsKMK-Coc5s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69251716/1BEB77B1_EB2C_4E1F_A9C1_1B863908E956.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YBFsWJ"&gt;Google Photos’ free, unlimited storage is going away on June 1st — which means that you’ve only got a few weeks left to upload all your pictures and videos before the company’s new 15GB cap kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODAbiA"&gt;As the company had previously announced last fall, Google Photos’ beloved policy of allowing users to back up an unlimited number of  “high quality” photos and videos will be ending next month, replaced by a 15GB limit before customers will have to pay for more storage space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6RKQsa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Photos will end its free unlimited storage on June 1st, 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jDEzrm"&gt;But everyone gets to start fresh with that 15GB (minus whatever you’re already using with your Gmail and Google Drive accounts, which might be a lot for some users) starting on June 1st: anything you’ve uploaded beforehand won’t count toward that cap, meaning that if you’ve got a pile of pictures on your camera or hard drive, it’s a good time to upload them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFTfO3"&gt;There are a few catches, of course: the unlimited storage still only applies to “high-quality” photos, which are compressed down to 16-megapixel stills. Anything uploaded with the “original quality” counts toward your storage cap — although, unless you’re a Pixel owner, that’s already been the case for years, so that’s not much of a change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXWcVr"&gt;Similarly, current Pixel owners — who get unlimited original quality pictures under the current policy, before getting downgraded to unlimited “high quality” pictures on June 1st — should take the rest of May to upload any pictures they haven’t put on Google Photos before the lower quality limit kicks in. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562908/google-future-pixel-phone-no-unlimited-photos-storage-confirmed"&gt;Google has already confirmed&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that future Pixel phones won’t get the same perks, unfortunately.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IK68Tv"&gt;You can, of course, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22286339/google-drive-storage-more-space-how-to-photos-files"&gt;always pay more for Google’s storage&lt;/a&gt; once June 1st comes along (prices start at $2 per month for an extra 100GB). But why not make the most of Google’s free space now before the deadline comes up?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These art collectors are making their own metaverse through games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fAVqT7HLLxkMjXrZHtOePf7rqUQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69251656/ss_856dc0a7fdf8bffb04cff24a3c9176e628879ff5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgetter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Dslcollection is using technology to explore new ways to show off works of art&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="5YicZt"&gt;Sylvain Levy just co-produced his first video game, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1499990/Forgetter/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgetter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which launched on Steam on April 17th. Sylvain Levy has also never played a video game in his life. “I’m not kidding,” says the 67-year-old art collector on a Zoom call from Paris. “The three games that I know are &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt; football game because my son plays it, and the &lt;em&gt;Forgetter&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTQyic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgetter&lt;/em&gt; isn’t Levy’s first foray into the digital world, but it’s his first time working with game designers. In this case, Hong Kong-based Allison Yang Jing and &lt;a href="https://www.kwanalan.com/"&gt;Alan Kwan&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an acerbic take on sanitizing creativity: the player works for a startup that scrubs dysfunction and trauma from dead artists’ brains and sells the clean brains to parents who want gifted, untroubled babies. While obliterating these intimate memories, you can also find real artwork by Chinese artists — all from Levy’s collection — and smash them into bits. It’s also a quasi-janitorial sim, so you get paid extra for vacuuming up the mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OIYZpR"&gt;After 10 months of development, Yang and Kwan made a walkthrough video of the game for Levy to watch. “I don’t think my hands are agile enough to be efficient in a game,” he says, turning over his palms. “But I love video games, and I love to look at people playing video games.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8sRTG"&gt;Levy isn’t just a collector. He’s a new type of video game patron, eager to explore what he calls our “digital twin” — our evolving online personae that have different appetites and behaviors. “It’s really important to understand that we have this double personality,” he says, especially as tech drives more human transformation. As digital spaces continue to define our post-COVID lives, the closer we come to what a metaverse could really offer. Commercial games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have long been pegged as forerunners for the idea of a shared virtual universe where we live, work, and play. But Levy’s work with games could spur deeper conversations about what we want (and need) in a metaverse that will inevitably be shaped by corporations and mainstream culture.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfxBK6"&gt;In 2005, Levy and his wife Dominique created &lt;a href="http://www.g1expo.com/v3/dslcollection/"&gt;Dslcollection&lt;/a&gt;, an influential collection of Chinese contemporary art that never exceeds 350 objects. Their daughter Karen also helps run the collection, which includes work by Chinese art stars like &lt;a href="https://theallureofmatter.org/artists/gu-dexin/"&gt;Gu Dexin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.mariangoodman.com/artists/73-yang-fudong/"&gt;Yang Fudong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://gagosian.com/artists/jia-aili/"&gt;Jia Aili&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://gagosian.com/artists/zeng-fanzhi/"&gt;Zeng Fanzhi&lt;/a&gt;, and Ai Weiwei. The couple started out in fashion and has collected art and design pieces for the last “36 or 37” years. Things changed after Levy’s brother-in-law moved to Shanghai, inadvertently introducing the Levys to contemporary art in China and nudging the family business into a new era. “We said okay, since art is a mirror for society, let’s collect Chinese contemporary art and try to find the energy… we are experiencing in the city,” says Levy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZrIIE"&gt;Using the internet and YouTube, the Levys also decided to make their new collection public — something they’d never done before. As an early advocate of new technology, Sylvain Levy remembers making a Dslcollection iPad app at the end of 2010. “It was very funny when I was showing my app when walking into fairs,” he smiles. “The galleries were turning to me, ‘you don’t have enough money to print the catalog?’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tu5VvbqtlT59x_bk3dNUsvi3_zE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496666/ss_83f453bd2c3562bb238ad6958a05ee130b136c7c.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgetter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jrsTtj"&gt;It wasn’t a far stretch for Dslcollection to reimagine how they wanted to share their art with the world. In 2009, they created a &lt;a href="https://rhizome.org/community/15150/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; museum&lt;/a&gt; with new media artists &lt;a href="http://lilyhonglei.com/"&gt;Lily and Honglei&lt;/a&gt;. A few years later came a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x5yNEdiFKA"&gt;virtual exhibition&lt;/a&gt; in a hacked re-creation of the Grand Palais museum in Paris, which required stereoscopic glasses to fully enjoy the artwork. And not long after that came &lt;a href="https://arts.vive.com/us/articles/projects/art-photography/the_dsl_collection/"&gt;virtual reality&lt;/a&gt;. “Very quickly, we learned that immersion and gamification were becoming very important in the experience of art, and especially with VR, we were trying to reach missing audiences,” Levy says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U26fT4"&gt;When Allison Yang mentioned &lt;em&gt;Forgetter&lt;/em&gt;’s art “patron” to other game developers, they seemed surprised. Levy had initially approached her about a VR project, but she countered with the idea of a game. “A lot of people who might be either intimidated by a museum, or not interested in contemporary art, would be forced to see your art in a game without knowing it beforehand,” she told him. After working on a few demos, Yang and Kwan held monthly meetings with Levy, who also supplied part of the production budget. “[Sylvain] is a very bold person,” she says. “He gave us total creative freedom to do whatever we felt to be appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vq934m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We were trying to reach missing audiences.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qM9RXN"&gt;Kwan, who has been making art games for almost a decade, sees this new patron-producer partnership as a potential financial model for experimental games. After all, public art funding isn’t a gold mine. “So what we are trying to do is explore, apart from crowdfunding, apart from getting a publisher, other alternative models to support experimental indie game projects,” he says. A recent &lt;a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-collectors-art-market-2021-report"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; valued the global art market at around $50 billion. Of course, the fine art world is mostly a playground for the wealthy looking to spend money, and collectors like Levy are rare. But it’s thrilling to imagine a scenario where more progressive minds in the art world contributed their capital — financial, cultural, and otherwise — to the vision of a fuller and richer shared universe. (No, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, I don’t mean you.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUF14c"&gt;“We have deliberately chosen people not from the video game industry to make these games,” says Levy of his new endeavors. “When you look at [the games], you feel that this has been done by an artist, people molded by art or culture, and not only molded by technology or marketing. You can feel the soul… you can feel it’s done by people more related to the art world, than to the leisure industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VTmePk"&gt;According to designer Calin Segal, Dslcollection is one of the first (if not first) art collectors to help develop games. Segal co-founded the multidisciplinary group &lt;a href="https://www.childrenofcyberspace.com/"&gt;Children of Cyberspace&lt;/a&gt;, which is working with the Levys on a game called &lt;a href="https://junethegame.net/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;June&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “I’ve seen...collections that have rented or borrowed artwork for video games, but it was always in the form of a gimmick,” Segal says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGgmBQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;June&lt;/em&gt; traces the evolution of a child in cyberspace and will feature more conventional platforming elements. The game unpacks the artist’s journey of self-discovery, using everything from direct artwork scans and digital reproductions to hints of textures and visual Easter eggs. It’s also forged new connections between the game designers and the artists whose work is being featured. One of the team’s biggest inspirations is the performance artist &lt;a href="http://www.zhanghuan.com/"&gt;Zhang Huan&lt;/a&gt;, who was part of Beijing’s avant-garde &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/inside-a-vanished-hub-of-beijings-experimental-art-scene"&gt;East Village&lt;/a&gt; art community — a photograph of his discomforting piece &lt;a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/291672#:~:text=12%20Square%20Meters%20was%20a,during%20the%20heat%20of%20summer."&gt;&lt;em&gt;12 Square Meters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is part of the Dslcollection. The character of June will endure her own version of Zhang’s grueling performance, with his blessing. “[Zhang] is super open,” says Segal. “He’s the one who’s actually encouraging us to think more and more outside the box.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdwXDz"&gt;But it’s virtual reality where Levy seems most comfortable — he uses it at home, and it’s easy on his hands. It’s the most intuitive way to dip into the future while “staying human,” something that Levy believes will be the most difficult thing to do in a metaverse where millions of users interact in thousands of different ways. It’s even more vital to stay human as our current reality veers into dystopia. “If you look at what’s happening all over the world, the world is looking a little bit like &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt;,” he muses. “We have to bring back humanism in the core of all technologies… and the best way to do that is through culture, through art, and I do believe that more and more, art can be a way to counterbalance this new world which we’re entering.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="i7eP4k"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VSd9BhdZ5bM?rel=0&amp;amp;list=TLGGnlN2KKAphOUwNjA1MjAyMQ" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="29HB44"&gt;With his old &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; collaborators Lily and Honglei, Levy is now working on an &lt;a href="https://lilyhonglei.net/vr-art-village/"&gt;ambitious VR project&lt;/a&gt; to re-create the East Village, where several of Dslcollection’s artists honed their craft. Lily and Honglei considered several platforms for the VR Art Village: VRchat, Sinespace, and &lt;em&gt;Second Life &lt;/em&gt;/ Linden Lab’s Sansar, eventually going with Sansar for its capability to host several hundred people at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4gKK1L"&gt;A short clip of the project shows a semi-armored virtual avatar jogging around a rural village on a cloudy evening. An abandoned cement factory looms large in the background. Players will be able to take part in events, watch live performances, and meet artists in the space. There’s even a transport system to get around. There will be artists’ workshops and storefronts — a barbershop and a bookstore — and a countryside school that houses a cinema, stemming from Lily and Honglei’s memories of growing up in Beijing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWKAjc"&gt;Beyond bringing the fine art world into one small corner of the metaverse, the VR Art Village is also a living homage to one of the significant periods in Chinese contemporary art history, of which little historical material survived. “To everyone’s surprise, systemic documentation about 1980s and 1990s society in China is surprisingly scarce and scattered, you just can’t find things,” says Lily. Born from the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, the East Village was a short-lived haven for political discourse through art in a particularly volatile era. “I think if we can provide the social context for the Dslcollection, that will be something special,” Lily says. “When you look at artwork in museums and galleries, they’ve somehow lost context with the society and environment which produced or influenced those artworks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rK2kxM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s a fictional place that we have created to give meaning to our times.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lI7xPh"&gt;The designers are also opening up the village to the Grand Palais, which will have a sculpture garden for their collection. The ultimate plan is to keep adding more spaces and connect them together, and Lily eventually hopes to include the art community in New York. “This platform is a bit like the game of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;,” says Levy. “I think this will be the next level, and we will release this platform by the end of the year.” Lily estimates that the village is about 70 percent complete; they’re just waiting for the art to arrive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSXiIW"&gt;Of course, art games and virtual reality experiments are not new. Independent designers have been working on their craft for years, often without the resources available to larger studios. But Levy’s enthusiastic embrace of games — small, experimental games made by tiny two-person teams — is a beacon for more artists and collectors to meaningfully participate in our shared digital universe, using the language of our times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8pTin"&gt;So far, popular perceptions of the metaverse are so vast, so intimidating, that only billion-dollar corporations like Facebook or Epic could afford to develop and implement the necessary infrastructure. As a distinctly commercial space,&lt;em&gt; Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; lets all our favorite celebrities and brands hang out together, from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; to the NFL and Major Lazer. At the end of the day, it’s all business — a business that will continue to thrive on gimmicks and cultural capital. But however our impending metaverse unfolds, it won’t be one monolithic, monocultural world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="fzp8GE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQCHNbwkihI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Upc6k2"&gt;“There’s always a bleak vision of how capitalists can manipulate things, but I still think there are some opportunities... like for Sylvain, a patron, to work with artists and designers like us, and to generate something interesting,” says Kwan. “Of course, the scale is much smaller, but I think they can still be interesting collaborations that make things work in between those two worlds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPxCRI"&gt;There’s plenty of room for artists to bring truth and empathy, even within the confines of a corporate or capitalistic world; some might even argue it’s an artist’s duty. “[The metaverse] at the same time is a real and an imaginary place, because what we consider the metaverse or cyberspace, at the end of the day, it’s a mythical land,” says Segal. “It’s a fictional place that we have created to give meaning to our times, and in the practical sense… it will never be a centralized system, but it will have pockets of resistance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6R8NdJ"&gt;For now, Levy’s vision for the family collection is an adventurous new conduit between fine art and games. He’s very happy if what he does encourages other art collectors to go into games and VR, not for the money, but to create humanistic experiences and bring fresh experimentation to a notoriously profit-driven space. “I’ve only had one principle,” he says. “It’s better to have a shop in the street where there are many shops, than in a street where nobody is. But we have to be the best shop in the street.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The autonomous vehicle world is shrinking — it’s overdue</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘The AV industry has promised too much for too long, and has delivered too little’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="30PAVY"&gt;After years of positive vibes about the future of autonomous vehicles and nearly unrestricted access to cash from Kool-Aid-drunk venture capitalists, the AV industry is confronting some hard truths. The first is that autonomous vehicles are going to take a lot longer to reach mass scale than previously thought. The second is that it’s going to be a lot more expensive, too. And the third hard truth: going it alone is no longer a viable option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGpFNZ"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404406/toyota-lyft-autonomous-vehicle-acquisition-amount-deal"&gt;Lyft sold its self-driving car division to a subsidiary of Toyota&lt;/a&gt; for $550 million. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331794/cruise-acquires-voyage-self-driving-car-merger"&gt;Cruise bought Voyage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;Aurora merged with Uber’s autonomous vehicle unit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/nuro-acquires-autonomous-trucking-startup-ike/"&gt;Delivery robot startup Nuro acquired self-driving truck outfit Ike&lt;/a&gt;. There have been so many mergers, joint ventures, and various tie-ups lately it can be difficult to keep them all straight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jdlfYW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It can be difficult to keep them all straight&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7vnWQC"&gt;Where that leaves things is a little unclear. There is still money flowing to these companies, and nearly all of the executives, engineers, and software developers working on the technology remain bullish about the future. But there is a growing sense among experts and investors that the heady days when anyone with a couple of test vehicles, some LIDAR, and a vision for the future could launch a startup are at an end. And there will definitely be more shrinkage to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETwHio"&gt;“The consolidation is long overdue,” said &lt;a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~raj/"&gt;Raj Rajkumar&lt;/a&gt;, robotics professor at Carnegie Mellon University. “The AV industry has promised too much for too long, and has delivered too little.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="QynkTW"&gt;There are other signs of general unease in the AV world. Last month, John Krafcik &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364317/waymo-ceo-john-krafcik-stepping-down-self-driving-cars-google-alphabet"&gt;announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Waymo&lt;/a&gt; after helping lead the company since 2015. Krafcik oversaw the transformation of Google’s self-driving car division from “Project Chauffeur” to its own standalone company. During his time, Waymo struck partnerships with several automakers, launched a limited ride-hailing pilot with fully driverless vehicles in Arizona, and expanded its commercial ambitions to include trucking and last-mile delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vB9dP6"&gt;As a former auto executive with years of experience at Hyundai and Ford, Krafcik was seen as someone who could bring self-driving cars to the mainstream. But his decision to step aside at a time of heightened uncertainty highlights the difficult road ahead for self-driving cars — especially as many of those early predictions have failed to come to pass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3mGhGQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Krafcik’s decision to step aside at a time of heightened uncertainty highlights the difficult road ahead&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fHGm9p"&gt;Krafcik was not able to bring to market an autonomous vehicle that can drive on any road and in any conditions without years of rigorous testing. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona"&gt;Aside from a small area outside Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, Waymo’s cars require backup drivers to monitor the vehicle’s operations and take control if anything goes wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjlTTe"&gt;Waymo still has a commanding lead in autonomous vehicles, but diminished expectations about the future of self-driving cars are affecting its business in other ways, too. In 2018, Morgan Stanley published a research note &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/29/waymo-alphabets-self-driving-unit-morgan-stanley-forecast-to-highs.html"&gt;valuing the company at $175 billion&lt;/a&gt; based on its perceived leadership in the space and the potential for massive amounts of revenue from its autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHRytl"&gt;A year later, the bank slashed Waymo’s valuation to $105 billion, still an extraordinary amount of money for a company with no revenue. But last year, when Waymo announced its first external funding round of $2.25 billion, the company declined to discuss what valuation that investment was based on. Later, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ed8dc4ca-5eaf-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; it to be $30 billion — a nearly 85 percent decrease from 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3w20R"&gt;Valuations aren’t the sole indicator of where things stand with autonomous vehicles. But they do point to investor sentiment. And right now, investors are not feeling as confident in the prediction that autonomous vehicles will soon become the dominant form of transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fnwAE1Ee3kIxKoL1SoQ-oUd23l0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10793777/Van_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Drive.ai&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq6Ud7"&gt;For years, &lt;a href="https://pratt.duke.edu/faculty/missy-cummings"&gt;Missy Cummings&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab at Duke University, has been criticizing rosy predictions about our driverless future. She’s consistently warned that the technology is much further away and harder to get right than anyone in the industry cares to admit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoCPjO"&gt;The recent trend in consolidation is vindication for her position, she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZG8EQ1"&gt;“It’s kind of like the elephant in the room,” she said of the shrinking of the AV world. “People will mention that and then they’ll stop themselves from making the Socratic connection to what this means about the viability of this industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jl1Ncp"&gt;But Cummings doesn’t think people in the industry will be able to ignore the truth for much longer. “There is an embarrassingly large sum of money that’s been invested in this, so people feel like they have to keep going down that path because surely all these people who invested all this money can’t be wrong,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J1W5IR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Not everyone is delusional. Just most people in this business.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lgF1Iy"&gt;“Not everyone is delusional,” she added. “Just most people in this business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zigYR"&gt;That said, Toyota and Aurora weren’t delusional when they decided to buy the automated driving teams at Lyft and Uber, respectively. They likely saw the value in the code produced by those teams, as well as the talent accrued by the ride-hailing companies over the years. When you can’t hire the people you’d like to staff your own projects, then you have to acquihire them, the distinctive Silicon Valley practice of buying a smaller company for the express purpose of acquiring their team of software engineers. Also, Uber and Lyft were very motivated to sell as recently public companies under pressure to staunch the bleeding and become profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQsbWp"&gt;Another recent acquihire was when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18758820/drive-ai-self-driving-startup-shutting-down-apple"&gt;Apple bought bankrupt self-driving startup Drive.ai &lt;/a&gt;back in 2019. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/24/apple-lays-off-over-200-from-project-titan-autonomous-vehicle-group.html"&gt;Apple had just laid off over 200 engineers&lt;/a&gt; from its secretive Project Titan, its own floundering self-driving operation. The Drive.ai team, composed of several graduates from Stanford’s AI lab, had already had some modest success with a ride-hailing pilot in Texas. Unhappy with its own team, Apple simply fired them and bought a new one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0o4gx"&gt;“The buying up of these companies represents companies being able to buy skill sets that they would not otherwise be able to recruit,” Cummings said. “And I think that’s very valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bTJCt2"&gt;The recent reorganization of the self-driving car industry may also point to a new set of priorities. Namely, robotaxis are out, and logistics and industrial applications are in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqBxk0"&gt;Four years ago, the industry saw plenty of startups come out of stealth promising to do everything: they were going to make hardware &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;software; they were going to build their own vehicle; they were going to do robotaxis &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;delivery &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;trucking. And of course, they were going to change the world in the process. “It was a little bit like the decathlete business model,” said &lt;a href="https://reillybrennan.com/"&gt;Reilly Brennan&lt;/a&gt;, general partner at venture capital firm &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.vc/"&gt;Trucks&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re going to be very good at 10 different things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHHcnn"&gt;Now, most investors are interested in more “structured” applications of automated driving technology, such as construction, mining, middle-mile delivery, and agriculture. “So instead of being a decathlete, you had to pick a javelin thrower,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wkNGZ0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“So instead of being a decathlete, you had to pick a javelin thrower”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WzrNJI"&gt;That’s not to say robotaxis are completely dead — far from it, with major players like Waymo, Cruise, Argo, and Baidu as well as smaller startups like Pony.ai, May Mobility, and Optimus Ride still banking on the proliferation of autonomous ride-hailing vehicles by the middle of this decade. But Brennan says the robotaxi craze has definitely cooled in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6595S6"&gt;“Frankly, we stopped seeing robotaxi startups in probably the end of 2017,” Brennan said. “Here we are in 2021 and there are very few ongoing robotaxi startups that aren’t, you know, Cruise, Waymo, or Argo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQSpoD"&gt;Brennan thinks the concept of autonomous vehicles that can drive anywhere under any conditions is still possible, but much further out than originally thought. They will require huge financial investments — “11 figures” by Brennan’s estimates — and a willingness to tolerate zero cash flow until the technology is mature and safe enough to launch. There are only so many companies with deep enough pockets to take on that challenge: major car companies like Ford, GM, and Volkswagen or tech giants like Apple, Alphabet, and Intel. Everyone else is probably not long for this world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SszjqN"&gt;The mid-level engineers always knew this to be true, Brennan said. It was the CEOs who were making the erroneous predictions about the availability of self-driving taxis by 2020. “I think the CEOs of those companies knew that they were going to be playing golf by 2020,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio’s 55-inch OLED TV is $100 off at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2dVFQ7U3cl5-9QxO4rlza7QaAaU=/68x0:1898x1220/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69251237/Screen_Shot_2021_04_23_at_11.42.52_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G7qhUk"&gt;Vizio’s 55-inch OLED TV has received a price cut during Best Buy’s sale event that will last through the weekend. Normally $1,300, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739879816744555003#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $1,200&lt;/a&gt;, making it one of the most affordable methods of getting an OLED. This model made its way into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our roundup of the best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to its HDMI 2.1 ports that allow for 4K resolution at 120Hz. In other words, it can show up to 120 frames per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPAU1m"&gt;My colleague Chris Welch thinks this is a good option if you want to save money compared to an LG OLED but still want the best possible picture quality and generous viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XAItDj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NnpQHn"&gt;Also at Best Buy, Apple’s new HomePod mini includes a Wemo smart Wi-Fi plug for $110. The speaker alone usually costs $100, and Best Buy reduced the cost of the plug by $15. If you’ve had your eye on the newer, smaller HomePod, you might as well go for this bundle to maximize your savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zOTZxQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10487884"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rTBhdI"&gt;While we’re on the topic of Apple products, its AirPods Pro are still $190 at Woot, which is the lowest price currently available. The discount isn’t tremendous or the best-ever price (the competition is offering them for just $10 more), but it’s nice to save whether you’re buying them as a gift or for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8o8GTp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ATBSOO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Pe8tG2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LiveLeak, the internet’s font of gore and violence, has shut down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kPGITICrqoWSnoREK099Ws4hvyc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69250956/acastro_200915_1777_hacking_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vYX0TS"&gt;Video site LiveLeak, best known for hosting gruesome footage that mainstream rivals wouldn’t touch, has &lt;a href="https://www.itemfix.com/ll"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; after fifteen years in operation. In its place is “ItemFix,” a site that &lt;a href="https://www.itemfix.com/faq"&gt;bans&lt;/a&gt; users from uploading media containing “excessive violence or gory content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1y0JhE"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.itemfix.com/ll"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, LiveLeak founder Hayden Hewitt did not give an explicit reason for the site’s closure, saying only that: “The world has changed a lot over these last few years, the Internet alongside it, and we as people.” In a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/b7iNvp82OTo"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; posted on his YouTube channel Trigger Warning, Hewitt offered no further details, but said that maintaining LiveLeak had become a struggle, and that he and his team “just didn’t have it in us to carry on fighting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yG42SS"&gt;“Everything’s different now, everything moves on,” says Hewitt, before adding in an aside to the camera: “I don’t fucking like it. I liked it much better when it was the Wild West.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pkYmI7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LiveLeak grew out of the “shock sites” of the early internet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5LwNE"&gt;LiveLeak has been a mainstay of internet culture for many years, its name synonymous with footage of murder, terrorism, and everyday incidents of crime and violence. A sinister doppelgänger to sites like YouTube, LiveLeak was founded in 2006 and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316104436/http://www.businessinsider.com.au/profile-of-hayden-hewitt-founder-of-liveleak-2014-10"&gt;grew out of a culture &lt;/a&gt;of early internet “shock sites” like Ogrish, &lt;a href="http://Rotten.com"&gt;Rotten.com&lt;/a&gt;, and BestGore: websites that hosted violent and pornographic content with the express aim of disgusting visitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBS4q5"&gt;LiveLeak, with its tagline of “Redefining the Media,” ostensibly added some nuance to this brutish appeal. Official statements from those involved sometimes defended its content in terms of newsworthiness or truth-telling. When the site attracted controversy in the UK for hosting footage of children fighting, for example, Hewitt defended sharing the videos as a form of bearing witness.&lt;em&gt; “&lt;/em&gt;We have to take a stance of saying ‘look all this is happening, this is real life, this is going on, we’re going to show it,’” he told &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6920817.stm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3oEHq"&gt;Despite this, the site often changed its policies concerning controversial footage. In 2014 it attracted significant attention (and traffic) for hosting a video of the beheading of US journalist James Foley by terror group ISIS. But soon after the site’s owners &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201111225012/https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=a69_1408615973"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it would host no future beheading videos created by ISIS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGGMQU"&gt;“We’ve shown the world the true horror of this form of execution more than once in the past and we cannot find any compelling reason to even be thought of as promoting the actions of this group,” said a blog post. “We know they [ISIS] do not find support here on LL and that condemnation is virtually universal but there is no reason at all to show more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJUIC4"&gt;Similarly, the site chose not to host videos of the 2019 Christchurch shootings, stating in another &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:hnKeuRG4z8YJ:https://www.liveleak.com/view%3Ft%3DuSQT_1552831454+&amp;amp;cd=3&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=uk"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that LiveLeak never had a “show everything” policy, and that hosting the video would only give the shooter what he wanted: more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="aboy7j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LiveLeak attracted sizable traffic, proof of the enduring appeal of its shocking content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVX7qt"&gt;Although the site’s content likely stopped it from reaching the prominence of other video hosts, it still attracted sizable numbers of viewers. A 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/24/style/really-bad-stuff.html"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noted that web tracking firm Alexa ranked it as the 695th most popular website in the world, putting it roughly on a par with mainstream sites like &lt;em&gt;The Onion &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Jezebel&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaBF1T"&gt;The same report cites an academic &lt;a href="https://people.southwestern.edu/~bednarb/capstone/capstone_materials/payton_reading.pdf"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Sue Tait that attempts to explain the enduring popularity of such violent and gory content. Based on her observations of the Ogrish forums, Tait categorized four different “spectatorial positions.” There is the “amoral gaze,” where the content is stimulating and pleasurable; the “vulnerable gaze” where the imagery is experienced as harmful; the “entitled gaze,” where viewers justify their actions as seeing past the “censorship” of mainstream outlets; and the “responsive gaze,” where looking is framed as a way for the viewer to prepare for coming hardships, like a career in the military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IEGu5"&gt;The range of justifications identified by Tait and other academics suggest that demand for such extreme content will always exist, even if individual sites like LiveLeak come and go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0HCSJ"&gt;In his farewell blog post, the site’s founder Hayden Hewitt emphasized the importance of the site’s community. “To the members, the uploaders, the casual visitors, the trolls and the occasionally demented people who have been with us. You have been our constant companions and although we probably didn’t get to communicate too often you’re appreciated more than you realize,” he writes. “On a personal level you have fascinated and amused me with your content. Lastly, to those no longer with us. I still remember you.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC report blasts manufacturers for restricting product repairs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/STLdVDwAAMcAN305IgVlBOTlR98=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69250741/apple_repair_service_expansion_iphone_repair_07072020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K4Mi4o"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/05/ftc-report-congress-examines-anti-competitive-repair-restrictions"&gt;published its long-awaited report&lt;/a&gt; on how manufacturers limit product repairs. The &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf"&gt;“Nixing the Fix” report&lt;/a&gt; details a host of repair restrictions, especially those imposed by mobile phone and car manufacturers. The anticompetitive practices covered by the FTC range from limited availability of spare parts and diagnostic software to designs that make repairs more difficult than they need to be. In response, the FTC wants to develop new laws and rules surrounding repairs, but it also wants better enforcement of existing legislation like the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (MMWA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfRirC"&gt;While debates around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719701/european-parliament-right-to-repair-resolution-hardware-eu-commission-2021"&gt;right to repair rules in the EU&lt;/a&gt; have tended to focus on the environmental impact of sending broken devices to landfills, the FTC’s report leads with the impacts they have on people. It says repair restrictions are bad for consumers when they can’t easily repair their devices, and adds that these “may place a greater financial burden on communities of color and lower-income Americans.” Independent repair shops also suffer as a result of repair restrictions, “disproportionately [affecting] small businesses owned by people of color.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRPHOd"&gt;The timing of the report is also important. Not only has it arrived during an unprecedented period of working from home and remote learning, where teleworking equipment is more important than ever, but it also coincides with a global semiconductor shortage that’s made buying new equipment particularly difficult. Combined, they make it particularly important to be able to repair our existing devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYTYKl"&gt;According to the FTC, manufacturers are guilty of using numerous tactics that make it difficult for customers and independent businesses to repair their products. Here’s the full list from the FTC’s report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2axQtK"&gt;Product designs that complicate or prevent repair;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ckz8W1"&gt;Unavailability of parts and repair information;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKIyh2"&gt;Designs that make independent repairs less safe;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzOvyB"&gt;Policies or statements that steer consumers to manufacturer repair networks;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoIGYg"&gt;Application of patent rights and enforcement of trademarks;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ks3br4"&gt;Disparagement of non-OEM parts and independent repair;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6a7q89"&gt;Software locks and firmware updates; or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wu9KKy"&gt;End User License Agreements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LdeBZZ"&gt;Manufacturers have long argued that they have legitimate reasons for at least some of these restrictions. These include protecting their intellectual property, cybersecurity, and possible safety risks associated with independent repairers opening up our devices and replacing failed parts. But the FTC isn’t buying it. “There is scant evidence to support manufacturers’ justifications for repair restrictions,” the report states, adding that “the majority” of manufacturers’ explanations for repair restrictions “are not supported by the record.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfAwbs"&gt;Apple, one of the companies most frequently criticized for its repair policies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357187/apple-independent-repair-program-in-over-200-countries"&gt;has made moves&lt;/a&gt; to make spare parts and diagnostic tools more available to independent repair shops in recent years. But &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjdjnv/apples-independent-repair-program-is-invasive-to-shops-and-their-customers-contract-shows"&gt;critics say&lt;/a&gt; the new policies still give the company too much power over independent businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erY1ot"&gt;The CEO of repair specialists iFixit &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F50251%2Fftc-report-congress-nixing-fix-repair-restrictions-reactions&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F7%2F22424363%2Fftc-repair-restrictions-report-nixing-the-fix-smartphones-automakers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;welcomed the FTC’s report&lt;/a&gt;. “This is a great step in the right direction,” said Kyle Wiens. “The bi-partisan report shows that FTC knows that the market has not regulated itself, and is committing to real action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4632vN"&gt;With the findings submitted to Congress, the question now is how to make repairing devices easier. The FTC’s report makes several suggestions, including the introduction of new legislation to address repair restrictions and open repair markets. While it also encourages manufacturers to self-regulate, the FTC concedes that the broad range of industries and products involved would make that a challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agyY7y"&gt;The FTC suggests consumers could be given more information on how repairable devices are, such as with repairability scores like those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302664/apple-france-repairability-scores-index-law-right-to-repair"&gt;recently introduced in France&lt;/a&gt;. But the FTC also wants consumers to report when manufacturers aren’t obeying existing rules surrounding repairs, as described in an &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2021/05/ftc-weighs-repair-restrictions"&gt;accompanying blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TasIEE"&gt;Let’s say you took a product to an independent repair shop to fix or maintain it. Then later you go to the product’s manufacturer for a repair — but one not related to the earlier fix. If that repair is covered by your warranty, and if your warranty hasn’t expired, the manufacturer can’t refuse to make the repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhkxzb"&gt;If you’re told that your warranty was voided or that it will be voided because of independent repair, we want to hear about it. Report it to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="P5clzb"&gt;The FTC’s report follows efforts by several US states, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719701/european-parliament-right-to-repair-resolution-hardware-eu-commission-2021"&gt;European Parliament vote last year&lt;/a&gt;, to expand right to repair rules.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sennheiser’s headphone business has been bought by hearing aid manufacturer Sonova</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A pair of Sennheiser HD 800 S headphones. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZZolL1"&gt;Sonova, a Swiss company best known for its medical audio products like hearing aids and cochlear implants, is &lt;a href="https://www.sonova.com/en/expanding-our-offering-and-entering-new-growth-markets-sonova-acquire-sennheiser-consumer-division"&gt;buying&lt;/a&gt; the consumer electronics division of German firm Sennheiser. That means Sonova is taking over Sennheiser’s portfolio of consumer headphones, wireless earbuds, and soundbars, moving into an expanding market for personal audio equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOdZ6V"&gt;Sennheiser announced it was looking for a buyer for its consumer business in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285497/sennheiser-investors-selling-consumer-headphones-soundbars-business"&gt;mid-February&lt;/a&gt; “amid strong competitive pressure.” Although the company’s consumer products hit record sales in 2019, the firm still lost money with profit margins “under pressure” from global rivals. It cut 650 jobs and said “all options are open” to help the division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TPeBiw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sennheiser’s brand (and products) will live on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nB4I2X"&gt;Now the company has found a buyer in Sonova. In a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen-us.sennheiser.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fmessage-from-andreas-and-daniel-sennheiser-otoics&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F7%2F22424367%2Fsonova-buys-sennheiser-consumer-business-headphones-soundbars" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;joint statement&lt;/a&gt; by Sennheiser’s co-CEOs, brothers Andreas and Daniel Sennheiser, the pair said they “couldn’t have asked for [a] better” partner. “A partner who not only shares our passion for audio and a commitment to the highest product quality, but also very similar corporate values,” they write. “This is an excellent foundation for a successful future together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlURCi"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen-us.sennheiser.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fsonova-acquires-sennheiser-consumer-business-wpc768&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F7%2F22424367%2Fsonova-buys-sennheiser-consumer-business-headphones-soundbars" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of the deal from Sonova, the company said it will continue to sell products under the Sennheiser brand. “Combining our audiological expertise with Sennheiser’s know-how in sound delivery, their great reputation as well as their high-quality products will allow us to expand our offering and to create important touchpoints with consumers earlier in their hearing journey,” said Sonova CEO Arnd Kaldowski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwEHAA"&gt;Sonova said the purchase price of the division amounts to €200 million ($241 million), and that Sennheiser’s business generates revenues of €250 million annually. The deal is still subject to regulatory approval, but Sonova says it expects to close it in “the second half of calendar year 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRs8f3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic needs to tarnish Apple’s App Store halo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_dbuH7j00UhHKuAGNbEG0UMwpE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69249704/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D3Yc8Y"&gt;At the beginning of this week’s &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, Apple described Epic’s lawsuit as an “assault” on the entire iOS philosophy. One of the iPhone and iPad’s defining features is a curated ecosystem (or, from a different perspective, a walled garden). A loss for Apple could require it to allow side-loaded apps and alternative app stores, potentially including Epic’s own Epic Games Store. Apple says that would damage the privacy and security that iOS is known for, making Apple spend more money to fix new problems that crop up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qes3P"&gt;Epic spent the fourth day of trial offering its counter-narrative: the iOS App Store isn’t actually very good. Calling two Apple executives to the stand, Epic’s attorneys took jabs at everything from the update review process to Apple allegedly leaking Marshmello’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; concert playlist. They pushed Apple to justify its claims about privacy and security by producing hard research demonstrating threats and breaches — which Apple largely didn’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JAdN3U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic is making the case that the app store just isn’t very good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QOrmnw"&gt;After a short examination of Epic’s online business strategy head Thomas Ko, Epic called on Matt Fischer, App Store vice president and the first witness employee from Apple. Epic’s attorney peppered Fischer with anecdotes from frustrated developers — calling the iOS in-app payment system a “joke,” the refund policies “awful,” the review process “arbitrary and unpredictable,” and the entire store “plagued with outdated, low-quality apps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Spju9Q"&gt;Apple’s App Store has some clear problems. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;my colleague Sean Hollister wrote last month&lt;/a&gt;, you can find ridiculous stories about iOS apps that appear to swindle users yet maintain unbelievably high review stories — and aren’t removed even months after a formal complaint. Eric Friedman, an Apple employee who is set to testify, has been quoted saying the app review team is “more like the pretty lady who greets you with a lei at the Hawaiian airport than the drug sniffing dog” or “bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qssmJ"&gt;But Epic’s questioning today didn’t capture the kind of drama that implies. The attorneys spent much of their time trying to catch Apple executives in contradictions, and while they quoted disgruntled developers like the ones above, they rarely delved into the substance of their complaints. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers became audibly irritated with Epic repeatedly producing documents to establish a “state of mind” about the App Store rather than hard facts, since the files would be uploaded for public viewing. “Non-lawyers don’t understand the difference between something being admitted for its truth and being admitted for some other evidentiary purpose,” she told an attorney. Apple countered one negative review snippet simply by having Fischer read the line above it, where the writer said they were still giving the App Store a high rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YzD79T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic has vividly established the consequences of getting banished from the App Store&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qj6Fko"&gt;There’s one plausible reason Epic doesn’t have more specific stories: many developers are &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/google-and-apple-scare-us-app-makers-tell-congress.html"&gt;reportedly scared to criticize Apple&lt;/a&gt;. That’s been a running theme in congressional scrutiny of Apple, and Epic has vividly established the consequences of getting banished from the App Store — even if developers try to return via Apple’s Safari browser, they’ll be denied access to things like push notifications and AR features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiaM2i"&gt;Epic also still has witnesses who could poke holes in Apple’s narrative. Friedman is scheduled to appear over the next two weeks, and so is an executive from Match Group, which spoke critically of Apple in front of Congress. Epic’s attorneys left a big question hanging about whether Apple &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/06/apple-hulu-special-api-access/"&gt;offers special terms to some developers&lt;/a&gt; — something Fischer denied, but wasn’t heavily pressed on. In any case, this trial hinges on much more than the precise quality of Apple’s developer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fP4keM"&gt;But today demonstrates the difficulty of discussing large-scale moderation without opening yourself up to charges of dealing in mere anecdotes. Judge Rogers made clear that she’s interested in whether Apple is better or worse than its alternatives, not simply whether it’s ever had problems. And while Epic can point to individual screwups, Apple will try to argue that it’s doing its best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvs9pg"&gt;“It’s a human process. We do make mistakes,” said Apple’s marketing manager Trystan Kosmynka, the day’s last witness. “But we certainly try to rectify those mistakes when we learn of them.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: Don’t drive while you are on a Zoom meeting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Man at steering wheel checking messages on smart phone while driving car on road." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dC-BMpjgSuxNumo3e0Wy0J1Nytc=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69249448/923335020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;It’s better not to be distracted while driving | Photo by: Arterra/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VyYANj"&gt;Who among us has not tried during the pandemic to conceal the background of our home offices during a Zoom call for work— lest we reveal a messy bedroom, or get ragged on by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ratemyskyperoom"&gt;RoomRater&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDnJdr"&gt;For Republican state Sen. Andrew Brenner of Ohio, the green screen betrayed him during a video call this week, making it clear he was driving a car even though his background image &lt;a href="http://ohiochannel.org/video/ohio-controlling-board-5-3-2021"&gt;showed what looked like a home office&lt;/a&gt;. That wouldn’t have been a big deal except it was the same day that Ohio’s legislature was considering a bill that would have toughened the state’s rules on driving while using an electronic device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKgpfz"&gt;One could argue that a video call might be a significant distraction while driving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NSA6o"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2021/05/03/ohio-state-sen-andrew-brenner-attended-government-meeting-via-video-while-driving/4929012001/"&gt;Brenner told the &lt;em&gt;Columbus Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he was parked for most of the video call, was not distracted, and was listening to the meeting. He also noted he was wearing his seat belt and paying attention to the road while he was driving. But as &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/politicians-zoom-background-cant-hide-fact-that-hes-act-1846835103"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, throughout the video Brenner turns his camera on and off, and continually adjusts the background as if he’s not happy with how it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mjifQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA134-HB-283"&gt;Ohio House Bill 283&lt;/a&gt; would enhance the state law on distracted driving, “to a general prohibition against using an electronic wireless communications devices.” Hands-free and voice-operated devices would be allowed, and there’s an exception for emergencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqaCkE"&gt;At the very least, Brenner adhered to&lt;a href="https://publicsafety.ohio.gov/static/HSY7742.pdf"&gt; Ohio’s seat belt law&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe for the next meeting he should keep it in park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXUDrA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: An earlier version of this story stated that the Zoom meeting Brenner attended was where the distracted driving bill was discussed. In fact, the bill was being discussed the same day in the Ohio legislature. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5FMbrl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ThpsP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihUjqx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1LEss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvVrKy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tJ7Ec"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4u7qE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A61wE3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing a new Tip Jar feature for sending money to your favorite accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ajljYICFX84AjiO6tkC0zcvnAvA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69248373/acastro_170726_1777_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j1g4b2"&gt;Twitter has started &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-tip-jar.html"&gt;rolling out a new Tip Jar feature&lt;/a&gt; on its Android and iOS apps, which (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399984/twitter-tip-button-jar-great-tweets-profiles"&gt;as rumored&lt;/a&gt;) will allow users to send money directly to their favorite accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WVUWS"&gt;To use the tip jar, simply tap on the freshly added dollar bill icon next to someone’s username when viewing their profile on one of Twitter’s mobile apps. Users will be able to toggle the tip jar feature, too (for those individuals or organizations that don’t want people just sending them cash out of the blue). Android users will also be able to send money in Twitter’s Clubhouse-like Spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uWH8v"&gt;Tip Jar supports a variety of payment options and links: Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, Paypal, and Venmo. Twitter is using those services’ external payment processors for transactions; it doesn’t take a cut. All English language Twitter users can send tips starting today, but only a select group (including “creators, journalists, experts, and nonprofits”) can turn on the feature to accept money for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3xme8z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;show your love, leave a tip &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;now testing Tip Jar, a new way to give and receive money on Twitter   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;more coming soon... &lt;a href="https://t.co/7vyCzlRIFc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7vyCzlRIFc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter (@Twitter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1390396166496522247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cY25Va"&gt;Users have been using Twitter to solicit tips or Patreon follows for years — ending viral threads with a shoutout to a SoundCloud account is practically a meme at this point. So it makes sense that Twitter would be looking to streamline the feature as part of its own app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMinK6"&gt;Notably, the only way to access Tip Jar right now is through navigating to a user’s profile. That means sending someone some money for a truly fantastic tweet will still take a bit more effort than, say, just liking or retweeting it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13beBE"&gt;There are already some issues that Twitter will have to work out. As spotted by Rachel Tobac, sending tips through Paypal using Tip Jar currently allows whoever is sending the money to see the recipient’s address, which is a worrying security issue that Twitter and Paypal will hopefully resolve soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p02t7P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Huge heads up on PayPal Twitter Tip Jar. If you send a person a tip using PayPal, when the receiver opens up the receipt from the tip you sent, they get your *address*. Just tested to confirm by tipping &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yashar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@yashar&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter w/ PayPal and he did in fact get my address I tipped him. &lt;a href="https://t.co/R4NvaXRdlZ"&gt;https://t.co/R4NvaXRdlZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/r8UyJpNCxu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/r8UyJpNCxu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rachel Tobac (@RachelTobac) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RachelTobac/status/1390409874006183936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3gRtp1"&gt;In an update later Thursday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1390451333602422787?s=20"&gt;Twitter’s Support account&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged the issue, tweeting that it was “updating our tipping prompt and Help Center to make it clearer that other apps may share info between people sending/receiving tips, per their terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpclYz"&gt;Twitter also promised there was “more coming soon,” so it’s likely that we’ll continue to hear more about how Twitter is implementing tipping in the coming weeks and months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aetg0L"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 6th, 5:30pm: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information on Paypal address security issues using Tip Jar. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
