    <title>Leaked Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic images reveal traditional design</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VYgBa1ligMaHWD8lHHdMQ_Oz-wY=/1x0:1600x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69528107/Samsung_Galaxy_Watch_4_Classic_AH_02_1420x799.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic in black, gray, and white.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic" target="_blank"&gt;Android Headlines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UUUU0Y"&gt;Images of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4 Classic have leaked online, giving us our first look at what could be the more traditionally-styled entry in Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch lineup. The images, &lt;a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;Android Headlines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, show a smartwatch with a rotating bezel and two buttons on its right-hand side, available in white, gray, and black. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZsbwC"&gt;The watch will reportedly be available in three sizes in total: 42mm, 44mm, and 46mm, and will run on the smartwatch platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;co-developed by Samsung and Google&lt;/a&gt;. The watch will also reportedly be available in either stainless steel or aluminum, will be water resistant up to a depth of 50 meters (thanks to a 5ATM rating), and should be rugged thanks to a MIL-STD-810G certification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YzYnhxuTisc4WxfgQlfVKc90-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693150/Samsung_Galaxy_Watch_4_Classic_AH_06_1420x778.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic" target="_blank"&gt;Android Headlines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The watch is shown with a rotating bezel and two side buttons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H3rwlt"&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic appears to be one of at least two smartwatch models Samsung plans to announce this summer. There could also be a &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-design-specifications-renders-exclusive/"&gt;non-Classic Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt; on the way, which ditches the rotating bezel for a slimmer design that looks closer to Samsung’s previous Active-branded smartwatches (in fact, some leaks have referred to this watch as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546997/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-leak-tizen-wear-os-smartwatch"&gt;Galaxy Watch Active 4&lt;/a&gt;). The non-Classic version will reportedly be available in 40mm and 44mm sizes, and will also feature 5ATM water resistance and MIL-STD 810G durability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYb9Ng"&gt;Regardless of how these watches end up being branded, it looks like Samsung has a busy summer ahead of it for smartwatch announcements. &lt;em&gt;Android Headlines&lt;/em&gt; speculates that we might see these new watches announced at an Unpacked event in early August, which will presumably also include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;new Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 5G foldables&lt;/a&gt; that have &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; recently leaked.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge blocks Florida’s social media law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Florida Governor Ron DeSantis Holds News Conference In Miami" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/faGrg0qyvqV4EDjLBtgf0ga5dm0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69527356/1322345172.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t2eww3"&gt;A Florida internet law is on hold while a lawsuit contesting it continues. Judge Robert Hinkle has &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flnd.371253/gov.uscourts.flnd.371253.113.0_1.pdf"&gt;issued a preliminary injunction&lt;/a&gt; blocking nearly all of SB 7072, a controversial and sweeping regulation of social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ogBgFP"&gt;“The legislation now at issue was an effort to rein in social-media providers deemed too large and too liberal. Balancing the exchange of ideas among private speakers is not a legitimate governmental interest,” Hinkle wrote his order. Moreover, the law “discriminates on its face among otherwise identical speakers,” partly thanks to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22413934/florida-bill-restrict-social-media-politicians-twitter-facebook-disney-trump"&gt;eyebrow-raising exemption&lt;/a&gt; for companies that operate a theme park. That raises the bar for evaluating whether the law violates the First Amendment — and in Hinkle’s estimation, it probably does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5m4u9Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The legislation compels providers to host speech that violates their standards ... and forbids providers from speaking as they otherwise would”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cARv0g"&gt;SB 7072, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451425/florida-social-media-moderation-facebook-twitter-deplatforming"&gt;signed by Governor Ron DeSantis&lt;/a&gt; in May, limits when web services can kick off users. It includes a ban on suspending or annotating the posts of political candidates, a requirement that users can “opt out” of algorithmic sorting systems, and an “antitrust violator blacklist” for companies that break the rules. As mentioned above, the rules don’t apply to “a company that owns and operates a theme park or entertainment complex,” placating media conglomerates like Disney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MTHy0"&gt;Industry groups NetChoice and the CCIA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457200/ccia-netchoice-lawsuit-florida-social-media-law-unconstitutional"&gt;sued to stop the law’s enforcement&lt;/a&gt;, saying it would compel social media platforms to host offensive speech that violated their editorial policies. Judge Hinkle &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-nsf-social-media-law-challenge-20210629-qt7aescdpjgvjolssxumrbuuey-story.html"&gt;heard arguments&lt;/a&gt; from both groups and the DeSantis administration on Monday, when he appeared dubious of the law, calling the theme park exemption in particular a “major constitutional issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XjEHY"&gt;The injunction is similarly skeptical, summarizing the law as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MOps1T"&gt;“The state of Florida has adopted legislation that imposes sweeping requirements on some but not all social-media providers. The legislation applies only to large providers, not otherwise-identical but smaller providers, and explicitly exempts providers under common ownership with any large Florida theme park. The legislation compels providers to host speech that violates their standards — speech they otherwise would not host — and forbids providers from speaking as they otherwise would. The Governor’s signing statement and numerous remarks of legislators show rather clearly that the legislation is viewpoint-based. And parts contravene a federal statute.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="laao68"&gt;The federal statute Hinkle mentions is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a rule that gives websites and apps wide latitude to decide what material they host. Beyond that, Hinkle says social networks regularly use editorial judgment to prioritize, remove, label, and otherwise sort content shown to users — and much of that editorial judgment is likely protected by the First Amendment. “The state has asserted it is on the side of the First Amendment; the plaintiffs are not. It is perhaps a nice sound bite. But the assertion is wholly at odds with accepted constitutional principles,” Hinkle writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dtz0gT"&gt;Federal lawmakers, like state ones, have an appetite for regulating social media. That includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;a package of bills&lt;/a&gt; aimed at reducing the potential monopoly power of companies like Facebook and Google, as well as several proposals for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268421/cda-section-230-25th-anniversary-reform-stakes-big-tech-internet"&gt;changing Section 230&lt;/a&gt;. In April, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368045/clarence-thomas-social-media-regulation-knight-v-trump"&gt;made a case&lt;/a&gt; for regulating social media. But Florida’s law was one of the first, most sweeping rules governing how companies can moderate web platforms — and it’s not surprising that it’s been stopped short.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is building support for digital COVID vaccine cards into Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2NdixgkE_2rijXpFkTiMdbzV9ag=/0x27:1600x1094/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69527264/_GD_BLOG__Covid_cards_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A digital COVID vaccine card in Android.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a1e3j5"&gt;Google is opening up Android’s built-in passes system to &lt;a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/google-updates-passes-api-to-save-covid-testing-and-vaccination-information-on-Android-devices.html"&gt;let Android users store a digital vaccine card&lt;/a&gt;, which it calls a COVID Card, on their phone. The feature will initially roll out in the US, and it will rely on support from healthcare providers, local governments, or other organizations authorized to distribute COVID vaccines. The feature will also support storing COVID test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKcq4t"&gt;For vaccinations, your COVID Card will show info on when you were vaccinated and which vaccine you received, according to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pay/answer/10890261"&gt;a Google support page&lt;/a&gt;. The card can be saved from your healthcare provider’s app or website as well as from texts or emails sent to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnhL79"&gt;Google recommends that you add a shortcut to the card on your home screen and will offer the option when you save your card to your device. Google says that the card won’t be saved the cloud and that it won’t use the information you provide for advertising purposes, but &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pay/answer/10890261#zippy=%2Cwhat-information-is-provided-to-google-when-i-save-my-covid-card%2Chow-your-information-is-used%2Cwhat-information-is-provided-to-google-when-i-use-my-covid-card"&gt;it does say&lt;/a&gt; that it will collect some information, like how many times you use your card and on which days. And you won’t have to have the Google Pay app downloaded to save and access cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJfDvs"&gt;It’s good to see that Google is making it easier for people to save their vaccination status digitally on their phones, though whether you’re actually able to use the feature or not will still depend on your healthcare provider or government. Some states, like &lt;a href="https://epass.ny.gov/home"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/vaccine/vaccinationrecords/"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, have implemented their own digital vaccine cards, but Google’s version could streamline the process for other authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter now lets you set a security key as your only two-factor authentication method </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/liOLy5ZIj6rZdv0OQ_ESxxrvWzM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526952/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CtzN6Z"&gt;In March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332234/twitter-security-key-2fa-authenticator-privacy"&gt;Twitter said it would soon&lt;/a&gt; let you use a security key as your only two-factor authentication method, and on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1410343864431374340"&gt;it announced that feature was live&lt;/a&gt; on both mobile and web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMwetL"&gt;Being able to use a security key as one of your two-factor authentication methods isn’t new, but now you can make it the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; one, if you want to. Physical security keys have advantages over other two-factor methods like an authenticator app or SMS because they don’t rely on a code that a bad actor could intercept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4TrpRn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now security keys can be your one and only two-factor authentication method on mobile and web.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about how security keys can protect your account from attacks: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ta7uQSFhi6"&gt;https://t.co/Ta7uQSFhi6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/aPDOnbRtVk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aPDOnbRtVk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1410343864431374340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0DY7WQ"&gt;In recent years, Twitter has added a number of features to beef up login security. The company expanded beyond SMS in 2017 by adding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16802936/twitter-login-verification-two-factor-authentication-security-update"&gt;support for authentication apps&lt;/a&gt; like Google Authenticator and Authy. In 2019, Twitter let you enable two-factor authentication &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20977436/twitter-2fa-phone-number-authentication-app-security-key"&gt;without giving your phone number&lt;/a&gt;, a positive change given that SMS can be vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks (like the one that led to CEO Jack Dorsey &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping"&gt;losing control of his account&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20841288/jack-dorsey-ceo-twitter-account-hacked-chuckle-gang-shane-dawson-james-charles"&gt;about an hour and a half&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXBcXp"&gt;If you’re interested in picking up a security key for yourself, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235173/the-best-hardware-security-keys-yubico-titan-key-u2f"&gt;check out our guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first five minutes of Netflix’s Fear Street trilogy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UBDoIPC8DioAIruvoYUBJjFD9E4=/210x0:1782x1048/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526851/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.13.51_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BCFb8t"&gt;Netflix has shared &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8BjVmKJnPY"&gt;the first five minutes&lt;/a&gt; of its upcoming horror movie trilogy &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt;, inspired by R.L. Stine’s &lt;em&gt;Fear Street &lt;/em&gt;series of young adult novels. The film trilogy, which will be released over three Fridays starting on July 2nd, is also split across three separate time periods: 1994, 1978, and 1666. Teens fleeing for their lives is universal, regardless of the year, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTvc31"&gt;Here’s Netflix’s synopsis for the films:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QfN0Ru"&gt;In 1994, a group of teenagers discovers that the terrifying events that have haunted their town for generations ​may all be connected — and that they may be the next targets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JXiW4L"&gt;As someone who grew up on &lt;em&gt;Goosebumps &lt;/em&gt;and marathoned the made-for-TV movie adaptations of the books every Halloween, &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt; seems like a pretty great update on that vibe. These first five minutes aren’t super scary, but they do translate some classic slasher movie tropes into R.L. Stine’s goofy style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cip8wY"&gt;If you want a more expansive look at the whole series, rather than just the first entry —  &lt;em&gt;Fear Street Part One: 1994 — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444575/netflix-fear-street-trilogy-rl-stine-release-date"&gt;you can check out this trailer from May&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GFVJjj"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oyMOBcDMS6c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MCKE45"&gt;There’s not long to wait before you can get your R.L. Stine summer going: &lt;em&gt;Fear Street Part One: 1994&lt;/em&gt; premieres July 2nd, followed by &lt;em&gt;Feat Street Part Two: 1978 &lt;/em&gt;on July 9th, and &lt;em&gt;Fear Street Part Three: 1666&lt;/em&gt; on July 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Music Widget brings back the original Mac OS X iTunes widget </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LBUOzLPYFsArf_EmTmaoJFxcNSY=/180x0:2226x1364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526721/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_5.35.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TVvWck"&gt;Way back in 2005, Apple released Mac OS X Tiger, and with it, the original implementation of widgets on the Mac through its Dashboard software. One of those widgets was a now-defunct iTunes media player — but thanks to the efforts of programmer Mario Guzman, who’s recreated an &lt;a href="https://marioaguzman.github.io/musicwidget/#download"&gt;exact replica of the widget&lt;/a&gt; for modern Macs, you can once again enjoy your music in retro OS X style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWlpeF"&gt;Ironically, the new Music Widget isn’t actually a widget (at least, not in the current style of widgets introduced in last year’s macOS Big Sur,) but rather a standalone app that mimics the look of the original iTunes widget from 2005. The app is fully functional, offering the same controls as the original. Music Widget only works with the Apple Music app, though— Spotify (or other music apps) won’t work with the widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5UzDpD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Alright nerds. I have an early beta version of my Music Widget up for download. Let me know what you think. Retweets/screenshots are welcome.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/51sfimm7LI"&gt;https://t.co/51sfimm7LI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mario Guzman  ️‍      (@MarioGuzman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarioGuzman/status/1408876166165893122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pCWRTu"&gt;Guzman’s replica also draws most of the artwork and UI elements directly in code, instead of using images, so you’re not stuck with 2005-era visuals on the widget when running on a pixel-dense Retina display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="R2X14x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Listen to Spotify on this nostalgic iPod-style web music player","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548356/ipod-web-player-spotify-apple-music"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="L6rCTI"&gt;It’s not the only retro-style music player to pop up recently, either: &lt;a href="https://tannerv.com/ipod/"&gt;software developer Tanner Villarete&lt;/a&gt; created a stylistically similar web app that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548356/ipod-web-player-spotify-apple-music"&gt;offers an iPod Classic interface&lt;/a&gt; for listening to your Spotify or Apple Music library earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcZ2uj"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://marioaguzman.github.io/musicwidget/#download"&gt;Music Widget is still in beta&lt;/a&gt;, and can be downloaded for free from Guzman’s website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to restore your iPhone from iOS 15 beta back to iOS 14</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/436VxKbwU5MbJ4reDRcGvy8orFw=/0x8:1984x1331/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526531/Apple_iPhone12Pro_iOS15_3up_060721.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 15 comes with a number of new features and tweaks&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iyiSDk"&gt;Beta versions of new software are great to try out, but sometimes you realize that they’re not so good for day-to-day usage. If you’ve upgraded your iPhone to the iOS 15 beta, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;now available to the public&lt;/a&gt;, and you realize that you need to go back to the stable world of iOS 14.6, you can do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33XqPZ"&gt;The simplest way to go back to a stable version is to delete the iOS 15 beta profile and wait until the next update shows up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4WWqTe"&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “General”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="54TVu0"&gt;Select “Profiles and &amp;amp; Device Management”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cRK43P"&gt;Select “Remove Profile” and restart your iPhone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="UOQ9ma"&gt;Unfortunately, you won’t be able to return to a non-beta version of iOS until a new update is available. (You can check if one is available by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “General” &amp;gt; “Software Update.”) If you don’t want to wait, you can do a more thorough recovery — it’s more complicated, but it will get you back to where you were sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WauVpJ"&gt;The first thing you have to do is put your iPhone into Recovery Mode. This is done by connecting your iPhone to your computer (making sure it’s up to date first). I tested these instructions using a MacBook Pro, but they should work using a PC as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8garSo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to install the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 public betas","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aA7tkf"&gt;You then begin by doing the following (the following three bulleted directions are directly quoted from &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263"&gt;Apple’s support page&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="IXr9IH"&gt;For iPhone 8 or later: Press and quickly release the Volume Up button. Press and quickly release the Volume Down button. Then, press and hold the Side button until you see the recovery mode screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J5BNNc"&gt;For iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or iPod touch (7th generation): Press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Volume Down buttons at the same time. Don’t release the buttons when you see the Apple logo. Continue to hold both buttons until you see the recovery mode screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zQq1vM"&gt;For iPhone 6s and earlier, iPad with Home button, or iPod touch (6th generation or earlier): Press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons at the same time. Don’t release the buttons when you see the Apple logo. Continue to hold both buttons until you see the recovery mode screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="57A5kp"&gt;Whichever iPhone you have, once you follow the above directions, you should see a symbol showing a cable connecting to a computer on your iPhone. Turn your attention to your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Pi5yOq"&gt;There will be a notice asking if you want to update, restore, or cancel. Select “Restore.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JZEKOWpGch4GGahwRN0LFab78Qg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692236/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.25.43_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="4UZSYp"&gt;You’ll be asked whether you’re sure you want to restore your phone since you’re about to wipe out any personalization and go back to factory settings. Select “Restore and Update.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2R7InZ5sccPfHMZ-aIdh3y0B6WA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692200/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.29.45_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Yd7dQP"&gt;You’ll be told that you’re going to be updated to iOS 14.6 (which is the most recent version of iOS 14). Select “Next.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K6zyi6YMqLVBuLycYtwiiGf4cO4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692209/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.30.49_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="inW1XG"&gt;At this point, you’ll be asked to agree to all of the various licensing data that you agreed to last time that you began using your iPhone. Click on “Agree.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8EazkH"&gt;You’ll then be told that your computer is downloading the software for the iPhone. It should take a while, maybe 15 minutes or so, depending on your system and your network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QCF3CvoTljUMX6uPz8AtFFdMsfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692218/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.31.15_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="vNZJFp"&gt;Once the OS has been downloaded, you’ll be told that it is being installed on your phone (and the phone will visibly begin uploading the software and will probably restart once or twice). When it’s done, you’ll be told via your computer screen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-C3RRC8o0Cul_zf74wV-zJwICAQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692231/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.40.31_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VlJLnE"&gt;Okay, now you should have restored your iPhone back to iOS 14.6. That’s all well and good, but you’ve got what is essentially a clean slate — you want to restore all your apps, personalization, and other stuff, right? This is where your backup comes in. (You &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; back up your phone before you installed the iOS 15 beta, right?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fGHQsR"&gt;You’ll be asked if you want to set up your iPhone using the settings from another phone. If you’ve got another with all of your settings on it, well and good — just follow the directions. But assuming that you’re going to restore from a backup, tap on “Set Up Manually.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iWdY5K"&gt;At this point, you’ll enter your Wi-Fi connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TvcyXT"&gt;You then choose how you want to restore your backup: from iCloud, from a Mac or PC, from an iPhone, or from an Android phone. You can also decide not to transfer any data at all. Let’s assume you’ve backed up to iCloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0iv157"&gt;Once you’ve made that choice, you’ll be asked to enter your Apple ID name and password and to enter a verification code sent to your computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xePpsP"&gt;If you’ve made more than one backup recently, you’ll be able to choose which. (Hopefully it will not be a backup from iOS 15, which will not be transferable.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q3K0a4"&gt;Once you’ve chosen your backup, it will be transferred to your iPhone, and you should be back where you started before you installed iOS 15. You should be able to use your iPhone fairly quickly; however, it will take a few minutes before everything is uploaded from your backup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="er2aC6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram may be working on subscriber-only stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhK_-RH-IO9QzRvk7qSg8Sef7sc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526529/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YSyF9l"&gt;Instagram appears to be exploring a new feature that shares some similarities with Twitter’s Super Follows, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/instagram-is-developing-its-own-version-of-twitters-super-follow-with-exclusive-stories/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Called “Exclusive Stories,” the possible future feature, spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a"&gt;developer Alessandro Paluzzi&lt;/a&gt;, allows creators to post exclusive content to their Instagram story that’s presumably only available to subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yjZXRX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1406995654900125702?s=20"&gt;Based on the screenshots Paluzzi shared&lt;/a&gt;, exclusive stories are differentiated in your feed with a purple tag (similar to how Close Friends posts have a green one). When you try to watch an exclusive story without being a fan of the person sharing, you’re prompted with a pop-up that says only fans can watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BlgvH3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Instagram?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Instagram&lt;/a&gt; continues to work on the exclusive stories for Fan clubs  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ℹ️ The Exclusive Stories icon will be purple. &lt;a href="https://t.co/4Qzzdodeqf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4Qzzdodeqf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1408017220391903234?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TgxKaW"&gt;It’s a very early look at what Instagram could be considering — so much so that the company says it’s unable to share more, other than confirm that the screenshots are from an internal prototype and that it's not currently testing anything. It does make sense that Instagram would consider and even implement a feature like this at some point. CEO Adam Mosseri has &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instagram-s-mosseri-is-exploring-subscriptions-open-to-creator-fund"&gt;been open about exploring subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; for the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="actqJP"&gt;There’s been intense focus in the last year on allowing creators to monetize their work across a wide swath of platforms. Following the explosive growth of Substack, Instagram’s parent company Facebook made a recent addition with the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555957/facebook-bulletin-newsletter-subscriptions-substack-competitor"&gt;its newsletter platform Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545167/twitter-opens-super-follows-ticketed-spaces-new-feature-test-application-ios-android"&gt;opened up applications&lt;/a&gt; for Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces earlier this month, which, while somewhat unknown quantities right now, share some similarities with this hypothetical Instagram feature: Super Follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;allow Twitter users to share exclusive tweets&lt;/a&gt; with subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDkAYC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmVwDu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Head of Instagram says Instagram is no longer a photo sharing app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Instagram Reels" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8z33k3Uqxjv2K3b3Fr8GWJx-WmA=/79x0:3127x2032/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526527/Reels_IOSX_3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n5GZ5D"&gt;Instagram is no longer a photo sharing app, according to Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram. In a video posted to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CQwNfFBJr5A/"&gt;his Instagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1410297743285829632"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; accounts, Mosseri said the company is looking to lean into entertainment and video after seeing the success of competitors like TikTok and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERsJgZ"&gt;He describes some upcoming changes and experiments that Instagram will be doing, including showing users recommendations for topics they’re not following and making video more immersive by offering a full-screen experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tNpt79"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Changes are coming to video on Instagram  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Instagram we’re always trying to build new features that help you get the most out of your experience. Right now we’re focused on four key areas: Creators, Video, Shopping and Messaging. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ezFp4hfDpf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ezFp4hfDpf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Mosseri   (@mosseri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1410297743285829632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XDUOiy"&gt;We heard recently about Instagram’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547045/instagram-suggested-posts-test-algorithm"&gt;experiments with algorithmic additions inside the main feed&lt;/a&gt;, but the idea of basing them off of topics that users can select appears to be a new one for the platform. The app has also had full-screen video experiences for a while for content posted to IGTV, Reels, and Stories, but Mosseri says the company wants to “embrace video more broadly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1i30OA"&gt;The message that Instagram is sending is clear: it no longer wants to be thought of as the “square photo-sharing app,” as Mosseri puts it, but instead as a general entertainment app driven by algorithms and videos. At the moment, though, it’s vague as to how Instagram plans on doing that — and whether it’ll be improving and innovating on features popularized by apps like TikTok or just making something with a few Facebook-y tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NaE7bg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Instagram may be working on subscriber-only stories","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557773/instagram-exclusive-stories-subscribers-twitter-super-follow"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Discord now lets you share a little more about yourself in your profile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oYHVKxEuMxW0fZ32mCnmAXmZkjo=/14x0:1280x844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526501/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_1_12_25_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bfOmGF"&gt;Messaging app Discord has added the ability to customize your profile just a little bit more than you could before: on the desktop version of the app, you can now fill in a short “About Me” blurb, and, if you have Discord’s premium Nitro subscription, you can add a banner image to your profile. Discord says it added these custom profiles on June 24th. I first noticed the change on Wednesday, but I haven’t opened the app for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKN4TQ"&gt;To make the changes, at least on the Mac version of the app, click on the User Settings gear, then the “User Profile” section. (That section had a bright red “New!” alert on it when I first opened up Discord settings.) From there, you can write a 190-character blurb about yourself (which can include markdown and links if you want), and Nitro subscribers can add a banner image in the form of a PNG, JPG, or an animated GIF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9T0LMv"&gt;Then, when someone clicks on your name in a server that you’re in, they’ll see your “About Me” bio and banner image if you’ve set them. The banner image defaults to a color that matches the color of their profile picture, according to Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X-XOCHSsJCSaYOdd12rhr_riUS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692356/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_1_47_23_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My updated profile card in a Discord server.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tTtHCm"&gt;The feature is live for all Discord users on desktop. You can view the custom profiles on mobile, but you can’t edit them just yet — though that is coming “very soon,” Discord tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="685zlI"&gt;On Wednesday, Discord added another new feature that is currently rolling out: &lt;a href="https://blog.discord.com/unleash-your-creativity-with-stickers-on-discord-99363194871"&gt;stickers or large animated emoji&lt;/a&gt;. Custom sticker packs can be added to servers that &lt;a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting-"&gt;have been boosted&lt;/a&gt; (which means they are supported by members via direct monthly payments or through free boosts included in a Nitro subscription) past level one, and Nitro subscribers will have access to 300 Discord-made stickers they can use across the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5q8PL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 30th, 8:25PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added details shared by Discord. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
