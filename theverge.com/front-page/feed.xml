    <title>OnePlus Buds Pro gain multipoint support after latest update</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tYMgru"&gt;Multipoint support on earbuds has long been one of Jabra’s hallmarks, but slowly we’re starting to see other brands add the convenience to their buds. The latest is OnePlus, which is adding “dual connection” to its flagship OnePlus Buds Pro with a new firmware update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEaYR8"&gt;Once that update is installed, the Buds Pro will be able to connect to two devices at once, letting you seamlessly switch between, say, listening to music on your laptop and taking a call on your mobile phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtpGkG"&gt;This functionality is common in a lot of premium wireless headphones but has been much slower to make its way to earbuds. For a long time multipoint was a big selling point for Jabra’s Elite 65t, 75t, and 85t earbuds. But other companies like Anker and JBL have increasingly been offering multipoint with their respective earbuds. Meanwhile Jabra’s latest earbuds actually shipped &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; multipoint at launch but should be updated to support it in the coming weeks. Jabra again confirmed the feature is on the way during CES 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYFYBv"&gt;In the case of the $149.99 OnePlus Buds Pro, multipoint adds more value to an already-excellent set of Bluetooth earbuds that feature good sound quality, impressive noise cancellation, and a very comfortable fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFxuqy"&gt;The company says this update is being rolled out incrementally, so not everyone’s going to have it right off the bat. &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oneplus-buds-pro-ota-pair-with-and-seamlessly-switch-between-2-devices.1533910/"&gt;On its forums&lt;/a&gt;, OnePlus said, “the OTA update will initially reach a small percentage of users, and then we’ll begin a broader rollout over the next few days.” Early indications are that the dual connection feature is working just as advertised, so it’s good to see this convenient trick reaching more and more products.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Congressional watchdog calls for stronger regulation of crypto ATMs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQJERcaOByTPmRNf2LmyqP35YlA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70380462/acastro_170726_1777_0007_v5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r2U9Cq"&gt;In a public report issued earlier this week, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105462"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that the IRS and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) be given more information about the location of the kiosks where people can turn cash into crypto or vice versa. In its report, GAO cites crypto’s potential use in sex trafficking and drug dealing as the reason why the government should have more insight into one of the ways people obtain crypto outside of the more tightly regulated exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtMkQB"&gt;While kiosk operators already have to comply with several regulations (they have to register with FinCEN, keep transaction records, and collect extra information for transfers over $3,000), GAO argues that it’s still hard for government agencies to get a complete picture. Not only does the government have to deal with people running unregistered kiosk operations, but registered operators aren’t required to provide a list of locations where their kiosks are located. While they do have to give FinCEN access to detailed info about a specific kiosk if the regulator requests it, GAO says that the lack of location info makes it difficult to target investigations into areas with higher risk of drug or human trafficking activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O73OLe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The government doesn’t know where all the kiosks are&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4S5pre"&gt;This report doesn’t carry any legal force but is likely to be influential in Congress. GAO provides nonpartisan recommendations and information to Congress and other policymakers, often setting the tone for complex new topics like cryptocurrency. Lawmakers had more extensive access to the report as well — the public version makes reference to information that was included in the original report, released in December, that was too sensitive to include for a general release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8w6h4"&gt;You can read the &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-105462.pdf"&gt;full public version of GAO’s report here&lt;/a&gt; (pdf), which I recommend — it’s a detailed look into the state of play when it comes to enforcement. It goes deeper into the marketplaces where people sell drugs for crypto and the websites where sex workers can receive crypto for services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1GBTS"&gt;Crypto kiosks have been implicated in other forms of crime as well: recently, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765900/crypto-scam-fbi-psa-atm-qr-code-wire-transfer-con-artist"&gt;FBI released a PSA&lt;/a&gt; to warn the public about scammers using the ATMs to pull off a high-tech wire transfer fraud, conning people into converting cash into crypto and sending it off under false pretenses. Crypto in general has also been a big part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22822884/us-government-department-of-justice-ransomware-digital-extortion-task-force-report-2021"&gt;the ransomware business plan&lt;/a&gt;, which FinCEN has been paying close attention to — last year the regulator &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728765/us-treasury-ransomware-payout-numbers-reports-2021-first-half-cybercrime"&gt;released a report&lt;/a&gt; saying that ransomware payments for 2021 were on track to reach a billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="iqzsPW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Addresses tied to illegal activity were only responsible for a tiny fraction of blockchain transactions in 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HxhBt4"&gt;However, research suggests criminal activity actually makes up a small portion of blockchain transactions. Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis firm, recently &lt;a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/"&gt;put out a report&lt;/a&gt; estimating that addresses tied to illegal activity only carried out 0.15 percent of 2021 blockchain transactions. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/cryptocurrency-crime-2021-hits-all-time-high-value-chainalysis-2022-01-06/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, that number is likely to go up as it continues to identify criminals’ addresses, but it’s a significant decrease from the percentage estimate of illegal activity for 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAQglT"&gt;The report is coming at time when the government appears to be ramping up enforcement on unlicensed Bitcoin purchases. Last year, federal agents &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599932/bitcoin-raid-keene-new-hampshire-ian-freeman-libertarian-prosecution"&gt;raided several people who operated Bitcoin vending machines&lt;/a&gt; in New Hampshire, accusing them of running an unlicensed money transmission business. The IRS has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22524705/irs-congress-cryptocurrency-exchanges"&gt;been asking lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; to give it more authority to monitor large cryptocurrency transactions, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770798/biden-infrastructure-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-crypto-tax-irs-treasury"&gt;new tax reporting requirements to miners&lt;/a&gt; was bundled into the recent infrastructure bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1kqCv"&gt;The crypto community has pushed back against many of these moves — &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/12/dorsey-proposes-non-profit-bitcoin-legal-defense-fund-for-developers/"&gt;just this week&lt;/a&gt; former Twitter CEO and Bitcoin fan Jack Dorsey proposed a legal fund to help defend Bitcoin developers against “litigation and continued threats.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wear OS will work better for lefties... eventually</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Fossil Gen 6 is a large watch, but looks good on my wrist" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7wgm7bjXlb_yORixXw-U7SM1EBQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70380112/dbohn_211105_4864_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfortunately, us reviewers also tend to snap photos exclusively on the left wrist.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sk7XOn"&gt;Good news for Wear OS southpaws: Google is adding the ability to rotate the screen on Wear OS watches 180 degrees. There is, however, a catch — you might have to upgrade to get the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eolpy4"&gt;The news was initially spotted on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/s19lef/wear_os_is_finally_getting_an_option_to_rotate/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; by journalist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1480975675834212352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1480975675834212352%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Ffuture-wear-os-smartwatches-180-rotation"&gt;Mishaal Rahman&lt;/a&gt; and picked up by &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/future-wear-os-smartwatches-180-rotation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/78592658?pli=1#comment142"&gt;Google IssueTracker thread&lt;/a&gt; requesting customizable screen orientation, a developer wrote, “Our development team has implemented the feature you have requested and will be available on future new devices.” That prompted &lt;a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/78592658?pli=1#comment143"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/78592658?pli=1#comment144"&gt;mixed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/78592658?pli=1#comment145"&gt;responses&lt;/a&gt;. On the one hand, the feature exists. On the other, it’s implied the feature may not make its way to all Wear OS smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUbaRL"&gt;Should this be the case, it’s understandable why Wear OS users are cheesed. It’s customary to wear your watch on your non-dominant hand — meaning your right wrist for lefties, and left wrist for right-handed people. However, as with most things, smartwatches cater to right-handed users. Southpaws who prefer wearing watches on their right wrist have to reach up and around to use the crown. But unlike analog watchmakers who needed to go out of their way &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/history-of-destro-left-handed-watches-and-why-they-benefit-everyone?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;to produce left-handed watches&lt;/a&gt;, the easy fix for smartwatches would be to just flip the display. The initial request for the feature on Wear OS was made nearly four years ago in April 2018. That’s a long wait, and requiring users to upgrade for basic features is always going to upset some customers. Making matters worse, Apple has let Apple Watch users customize screen orientation for years. For now, the only option for Wear OS users is workarounds like &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mutau.lefty"&gt;the app Lefty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fi4hdw"&gt;That said, this is the word of one developer. Until Google makes an official statement saying otherwise, it’s possible that this will eventually make its way to existing watches. After all, Wear OS 3 won’t be arriving for most eligible watches &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;until the latter half of this year&lt;/a&gt;. Google has also repeatedly stated that during this awkward transition period, it’s committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423707/google-wear-os-gboard-swipe-type"&gt;bringing new features to Wear OS 2&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22695976/youtube-music-wear-os-2-app-offline-downloads"&gt;YouTube Music app&lt;/a&gt; is a good example of a feature that launched with Wear OS 3 but was later brought to Wear OS 2 despite &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/11/youtube-music-wear-os-maps-release/"&gt;initial reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0STDE"&gt;“We always prioritize giving our users choice — that includes bringing new features to Wear OS,” Google spokesperson Ivy Hunt told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “In regards to specifics on this feature, we do not comment on future roadmaps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKTxtx"&gt;Picking which wrist you wear your smartwatch on actually matters quite a bit. Not only does it impact which side the crown or buttons are on, but it can also affect the accuracy of fitness tracking algorithms. Most smartwatches have different algorithms for your dominant versus non-dominant hand. It might also make using certain features, like EKGs, uncomfortable or downright unusable. For instance, Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt; introduced a new body composition feature that requires you to place your fingers on the watch’s buttons. As you can see from &lt;a href="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_1600/5b2812ea785b8a973f9f99ed6949b9aa.jpg"&gt;this photo&lt;/a&gt;, using the feature is ridiculous if you choose to wear the smartwatch on your right wrist — and since the Galaxy Watch 4 runs Wear OS 3, there’s &lt;a href="https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-Watch/Flip-screen-orientation-for-right-wrist/td-p/1977212"&gt;no way to switch screen orientation&lt;/a&gt; at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JT8BE"&gt;Even with the uncertain timeline, it’s excellent news that Google is adding this basic accessibility feature. You should be able to wear your smartwatch on whichever wrist you want, and accommodating lefties or people with limb differences benefits everyone. As a wearables reviewer, I wear a smartwatch on both wrists at all times. I can assure you, your experience with the same device can vary widely depending on which wrist you wear it. For instance, when I tested the Fitbit Sense on my right wrist, I constantly set off the capacitive button and ended up recording a lot of accidental workouts. All those problems went away when I switched the device to my left wrist, but it wouldn’t have been an issue if I could’ve flipped the orientation. Frankly, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; smartwatches and fitness trackers makers should be more thoughtful about this going forward. It’s a shame that most haven’t already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OIvIsY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 01/12/2022, 4:05pm: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwR2tX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple patches HomeKit denial-of-service bug with new iOS update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKIfW9xo6YGfBxgtaUb4cDK08us=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70380017/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9h7iO0"&gt;On Wednesday, Apple released the 15.2.1 version of iOS, a minor update to the mobile operating system that fixes bugs, including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22865145/apple-ios-vulnerability-homekit-devices-bug-crash"&gt;denial-of-service vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; previously reported by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvcEXU"&gt;The 15.2.1 patch addresses a vulnerability triggered through HomeKit, the software API for connecting smart home devices to iOS applications. If the vulnerability was exploited, HomeKit devices labeled with a very long name would cause iPhones and iPads to endlessly freeze, crash, and reboot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTLX5z"&gt;Since HomeKit device names are backed up to iCloud, signing in to the same iCloud account with a restored device would trigger the crash again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pec8D"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213043"&gt;security notification&lt;/a&gt; for the 15.2.1 update lists only one change, a fix for the HomeKit vulnerability. Details of the fix state that a “resource exhaustion issue was addressed with improved input validation,” presumably to prevent long HomeKit device names from being read into memory by iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQUHsu"&gt;Besides security updates, the patch also fixed a bug that impacted performance of third-party CarPlay apps and another that prevented the Messages app from loading certain photos sent via iCloud. Users can update iOS by opening the Settings app on a device and tapping “General,” then selecting “Software Update.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RE9TA"&gt;The HomeKit bug was discovered by security researcher Trevor Spiniolas, who &lt;a href="https://trevorspiniolas.com/doorlock/doorlock.html"&gt;published details on his blog&lt;/a&gt; on January 1st. At the time, Spiniolas accused Apple of being slow to respond to his initial disclosure, which was made in August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTr7iW"&gt;According to Spiniolas’ blog, the bug affects iOS versions at least as far back as 14.7 and likely before, meaning these devices are still vulnerable. Owners of iPhones or iPads should update their devices as soon as possible to benefit from the new update.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House to launch COVID test-ordering site ‘by this weekend,’ reports say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks On December Jobs Report" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ESXaI3ZMlyuyfKWUKsktcjkKv0=/0x0:3744x2496/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70379978/1363303992.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFIl1L"&gt;On Wednesday, a senior White House adviser said that a government-run website to order COVID-19 rapid tests “should be online by this weekend,” according to new reporting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffRBennett/status/1481273604729974790?s=20"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;PBS NewsHour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Tests should start arriving this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7kAcw"&gt;The promise comes weeks after President Joe Biden announced that Americans would soon be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848887/joe-biden-google-free-covid-test-near-me"&gt;order 500 million free COVID tests directly from the government&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ll have websites where you can get them delivered to your home,” Biden said in a speech on December 21st as the Omicron variant surged across the country. In prior remarks from White House press secretary Jen Psaki, the website would go live “as soon as these tests are available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cxfLy6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The website would go live “as soon as these tests are available”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kPttlG"&gt;Still, the White House has yet to provide any additional details about the website, like its exact launch date or how many tests a person is allowed to order at one time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXg4mi"&gt;The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhnRxX"&gt;The news comes on the heels of the Biden administration announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878196/covid-at-home-insurance-white-house-testing"&gt;a new policy&lt;/a&gt; requiring insurance companies to reimburse up to eight over-the-counter at-home &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-cb49a8458f33a698c3a4f3b721835270"&gt;COVID-19 tests starting January 15th&lt;/a&gt;. Under this new policy, details of which were &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/01/10/biden-harris-administration-requires-insurance-companies-group-health-plans-to-cover-cost-at-home-covid-19-tests-increasing-access-free-tests.html"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; by the Department of Health and Human Services on Monday, Americans will either have to purchase tests through their insurance or submit receipts for reimbursement. A family of four would be eligible for up to eight tests per person, per month.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kH1ODp"&gt;In addition to the new government-run website and insurance reimbursement policy, the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-protect-americans-against-the-delta-and-omicron-variants-as-we-battle-covid-19-this-winter/"&gt;is planning&lt;/a&gt; to provide 50 million free, at-home tests to community health centers and rural clinics across the country and to establish over 20,000 free community-based testing sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLDvts"&gt;In his December speech, Biden also announced that the administration is working with Google to make it easier for Americans to find testing locations when they search for testing sites through the search engine. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848887/joe-biden-google-free-covid-test-near-me"&gt;Google spokesperson Lara Levin told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the testing arrangements are part of the company’s ongoing work “to make testing (and then vaccine) info available in Search and Maps.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wordle copycat creator apologizes for ripping off the popular free word game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QI4CLuAU4fDwKZ3zDFtV_GDFWpM=/16x0:1110x729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70379829/IMG_3664.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WB6fzi"&gt;Developer Zach Shakked — the creator of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase"&gt;one of several controversial copycat versions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"&gt;Josh Wardle’s popular free word-guessing game&lt;/a&gt; — has responded to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22879295/wordle-clones-app-store-removal-online-backlash-copycats"&gt;Apple removing his app from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; after an internet backlash that followed his boasting about the money-making potential of his clone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QEfPSu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The App Store clones are here to profit off Wordle’s success","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase"},{"title":"The Wordle clones have disappeared from the App Store","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22879295/wordle-clones-app-store-removal-online-backlash-copycats"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="id__wm1k9nlxcnl"&gt;“I realize I crossed a line. And I surely, surely will never do anything remotely close to this again. I fucked up,” tweeted Shakked. He goes on to explain that “Wordle” itself wasn’t trademarked and that Wardle’s game was similar to &lt;em&gt;Lingo&lt;/em&gt;, an older TV game show with a similar word-guessing mechanic. Shakked also says that he planned to expand on &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; with more functionality and change the overall design of the app to less resemble Wardle’s own game, had he been able to before Apple removed his app from the store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TYhRpw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here were my calculations: &lt;br&gt;a) Wordle is a ripoff of another game&lt;br&gt;b) Wordle the word isn't trademarked and there's a bunch of other unrelated word apps named the same thing&lt;br&gt;c) Wow, I'll hack together something on the weekend and see if I can make a buck&lt;/p&gt;— Zach (@zachshakked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zachshakked/status/1481129425706143746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AdMCXq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; has skyrocketed to popularity over the past several weeks, with its minimalist design, bite-sized daily puzzles, and the now-iconic grids of grey, yellow, and green squares. The original game is completely free and solely played through a web browser, leaving an opportunity for any number of copycats to try and make a quick buck off the concept on the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNlc1Y"&gt;Shakked’s clone (called “Wordle – The App”) was one of the more high-profile copies, thanks to the developer’s celebratory tweets about the project and the eyebrow-raising price tag — an optional $30-per-year annual subscription that would allow players to play an unlimited number of puzzles, instead of &lt;em&gt;Wordle’s&lt;/em&gt; one-per-day system. Shakked’s tweets also rubbed many the wrong way, boasting about how many downloads and subscription trials his app was getting and how it was “going to the fucking moon.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PC0egQlWYDuS8aif0492gVf8eRA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163917/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_12.49.58.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="79RPln"&gt;Shortly after reports of &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; knockoffs broke, Apple leapt into action, removing the offending apps from the App Store last night. Currently, there are only two puzzle games called “Wordle” left on Apple’s storefront, both of which offer very different types of word games than Wardle’s viral hit and which predate the web app by a number of years. (Incidentally, the other Wordles appear to be greatly benefiting from Wardle’s game’s success, with both apps rocketing up the App Store charts). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TSQLa"&gt;In a separate thread, Shakked also says that he spoke to Wardle and offered to license the idea, work together to develop an official app, or pay him a percentage of any profit, which Wardle reportedly declined. Shakked also claims that he told Wardle that he would “consider changing the name” before the app was removed entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZShMk"&gt;Wardle, for what it’s worth, has already been extremely clear about the idea of monetizing &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; (which, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html"&gt;as he explained in a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt;, was originally created as a gift for his partner). “I think people kind of appreciate that there’s this thing online that’s just fun,” Wardle said. “It’s not trying to do anything shady with your data or your eyeballs. It’s just a game that’s fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpw8zj"&gt;The aftermath of the blowback seems to have soured Shakked (who had previously complained on Twitter about how “[s]hameless copy/pasting ideas/features will get you nowhere”) on the idea of copycat apps in the future. “I’ll go back to creating apps based on my completely, evergreen, original ideas and never fuck with anything remotely like this again,” Shakked’s thread concludes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6PM50"&gt;Zach Shakked did not respond to request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California is ‘revisiting’ Tesla’s Full Self-Driving beta in light of ‘dangerous’ videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BYydTxgy_G2g269Vl3XhRKO1HU4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70379791/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="17AXjg"&gt;The California Department of Motor Vehicles is “revisiting” its opinion to not regulate Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software. The news comes after numerous safety advocates and regulators have expressed concern about the company’s willingness to allow its customers to test its &lt;a href="https://www.sae.org/blog/sae-j3016-update"&gt;Level 2 driving feature&lt;/a&gt; in public. (The news was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-01-11/dmv-message-to-legislatures-ontesla-full-self-driving-safety-its-not-our-job"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7dM4B"&gt;The state’s DMV oversees the largest autonomous vehicle testing program in the country, with over 60 companies permitted to operate test vehicles on public roads. Only a handful are approved to operate fully autonomous vehicles without safety drivers at the wheel, and even fewer have been approved to deploy vehicles for commercial purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1T2aUG"&gt;Unlike other companies doing autonomous vehicle testing in the state, Tesla is using its own customers, rather than trained safety drivers, to monitor the technology. Tesla owners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/7/22872865/elon-musk-tesla-raise-price-full-self-driving-software"&gt;have to pay $12,000 for the FSD option&lt;/a&gt;, up from $10,000 as of last month. Tesla does have 32 vehicles registered with the DMV, but it routinely reports few or no miles driven in autonomous mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jEXo49"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla is using its own customers, rather than trained safety drivers, to monitor the technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jyybe6"&gt;The DMV has stated in the past that Tesla’s FSD doesn’t fall under its autonomous vehicle testing program because it still requires a human driver to monitor the vehicle. But in a letter sent to State Senator Lena Gonzalez, the agency now says it is “revisiting” that decision. (Gonzalez is not to be confused with Lorena Gonzelez, a member of the California State Assembly, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lorenasgonzalez/status/1259287879177531392"&gt;who once tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “F*ck Elon Musk.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ep3BNM"&gt;In the letter, DMV director Steve Gordon said the agency previously concluded that FSD beta “fell outside the scope of DMV autonomous vehicles regulations” but that it recently informed Tesla that it would be revisiting that decision “following recent software updates, videos showing a dangerous use of that technology, open investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and the opinions of other experts in this space.” (NHTSA is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;investigating incidents involving Tesla cars operating with Autopilot that have crashed&lt;/a&gt; into parked emergency vehicles.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2lWcZ"&gt;“If the capabilities of the feature meet the definition of an autonomous vehicle per California’s law and regulations, DMV will take steps to make certain that Tesla operates under the appropriate autonomous vehicle permits,” Gordon writes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mb4Wg6"&gt;Gordon goes on to note that the DMV conducted several demonstrations of FSD beta and, after consulting with experts at UC Berkeley, concluded that it was a Level 2 system. During a November 2020 demo, the DMV found that “[t]he vehicle could not safely complete the entire task of driving on its own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJkvrA"&gt;Gordon also cites a letter from Tesla, in which the company laid out a list of “limitations... including not being able to recognize or respond to ‘static objects, road debris, emergency vehicles, construction zones, large uncontrolled intersections, adverse weather, complicated vehicles in the driving path, and unmapped roads.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gfYr8Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The DMV is also “reviewing” Tesla’s use of the term “Full Self-Driving”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ax2VPR"&gt;The DMV is also “reviewing” Tesla’s use of the term “Full Self-Driving” in its branding, which has been criticized by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682272/ntsb-official-tesla-safety-elon-musk-full-self-driving"&gt;experts and government officials as misleading to customers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9QrKT6"&gt;Depending on where the DMV lands, Tesla could find itself subject to a whole bunch of new regulatory headaches. Companies that test autonomous vehicles in California are required to report any vehicle crashes, no matter how minor, in addition to the frequency at which human drivers were forced to take control of their autonomous vehicles (called a “disengagement”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZV6pha"&gt;A spokesperson for Senator Gonzalez said she was still reviewing the letter. A spokesperson for the DMV did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did a spokesperson for Tesla, which disbanded its press department in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItewRn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is finally getting a new volume indicator</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxXkIqIXt1zdhKTq_eUci53P0sg=/145x0:516x247/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70379702/windows11volumefull.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ygybcp"&gt;It has taken nearly 10 years, but Windows is finally getting a new modern volume indicator. Originally introduced in Windows 8 in 2012, the black bar that pops up when you adjust the system volume using a keyboard or other device is finally going away. Microsoft is replacing it with a volume indicator that matches the overall Windows 11 design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xWcfH"&gt;Indicators for volume, brightness, camera privacy, camera on / off, and airplane mode are all being updated soon with a more modern design. “These new flyouts will appear when you press the volume or brightness keys on your laptop and will honor light/dark mode to give you a more coherent Windows experience,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2022/01/12/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22533/"&gt;explains Microsoft’s Windows Insider chief Amanda Langowski&lt;/a&gt;. “Brightness and volume indicators continue to be interactive with the update.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YAjK4nuIYivxQVxQf8hugRsZbco=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163898/hw_vol_flyout.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated Windows 11 taskbar and volume indicator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kSDdjQ"&gt;Alongside this design tweak, Microsoft is also allowing testing a new call experience in the Your Phone app on Windows 11. “This update includes a new in-progress call window with updated icons, fonts, and other UI changes that align with the improved design of Windows 11,” says Langowski. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KD3Bxt"&gt;This latest Windows 11 preview build, 22533, also includes an extension of touch keyboard themes to the emoji panel and elsewhere for all Dev Channel testers. If you’ve always wanted to uninstall the Clock app in Windows 11, there’s an option to do that now, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AHyt9IBEHFEGytO_zy7BpJyM56M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163897/YP_new_calls.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New calling interface for Your Phone on Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L7LYPB"&gt;Microsoft may deliver some of these changes on a monthly basis to Windows 11, as the company has moved to delivering a larger annual update for its latest OS. The software maker has not revealed exactly when these new features will appear for all Windows 11 users, but expect to see them at some point this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Magic Leap’s new AR headset is rolling out to healthcare companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Magic Leap 2 headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sh8re6TBmhn0PkKEtBz7HXPhiLw=/504x0:2376x1248/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70379646/ML_Teaser_Desktop.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.magicleap.com/en-us/news/op-ed/my-first-year-at-magic-leap-and-the-opportunity-ahead" target="_blank"&gt;Magic Leap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E0ocSw"&gt;Augmented reality headset maker Magic Leap has announced early partners for its Magic Leap 2 headset — a signal that the once consumer-focused company is still moving ahead with its enterprise-focused business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQmIyM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magic-leap-announces-health-technology-early-access-program-participants-for-magic-leap-2-301459403.html?tc=eml_cleartime"&gt;In a press release today&lt;/a&gt;, Magic Leap named four healthcare partners that are getting access to the device: clinical data visualization company SentiAR, neurotechnology company SyncThink, diagnostics company Heru, and surgical software tool Brainlab. The Magic Leap 2 is slated for more general release in mid-2022. It’s a smaller, lighter follow-up to the Magic Leap headset that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/10/17960722/magic-leap-one-creator-edition-shipping-continuous-us"&gt;debuted in 2018&lt;/a&gt;; in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Magic Leap CEO Peggy Johnson said it would be “slightly” pricier than its predecessor, which starts at $2,295.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02Qe3D"&gt;Johnson tells &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that Magic Leap sees potential for buyers in “industries that are used to wearing something on their eyes,” a category including surgeons and manufacturing workers. Magic Leap is also interested in military customers who could use the headsets for training; the company previously pursued a US Army contract &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18116939/microsoft-army-hololens-480-million-contract-magic-leap"&gt;that eventually went&lt;/a&gt; to Microsoft’s competing HoloLens headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scqTdj"&gt;Magic Leap raised billions of dollars as a consumer headset company, but the company downscaled its plans rapidly — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315864/magic-leap-new-ceo-microsoft-business-vp-rony-abovitz-step-down"&gt;replaced its previous CEO Rony Abovitz with Johnson&lt;/a&gt; — in 2020 amid significant layoffs. It’s reportedly considered acquisition offers from other companies, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-12-magic-leap-up-for-sale.html"&gt;allegedly including&lt;/a&gt; the major healthcare player Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, but ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721345/magic-leap-500-million-funding-ar-headset"&gt;raised $500 million&lt;/a&gt; in funding for enterprise applications last year. If Magic Leap pivoted back to the consumer market, it could find itself competing with more established brands, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22819963/snap-ar-spectacles-glasses-hands-on-pictures-design-features"&gt;including Snap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22749008/facebook-oculus-project-cambria-pro-vr-ar-headset"&gt;Meta, formerly known as Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idv6D2"&gt;However, the company is apparently “absolutely” open to returning — although Johnson says that AR technology would have to become smaller and its potential applications more compelling to be worth the shift.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4C9oZp"&gt;In case you hadn’t noticed, it’s becoming ever-so-slightly less of a maddening exercise to get your hands on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. Granted, it’s still harder than it should be, but recent retailer restocks have taken longer to sell out than they used to. So, here’s hoping that you’re able to purchase whichever console you want &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fearlyaccess&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;during tomorrow’s restock at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is specifically for paid Walmart Plus subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJbH1G"&gt;Starting at 3PM ET / 12PM PT on Thursday, January 13th, Walmart will offer the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 PS5 with a disc drive&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383%3Fathbdg%3DL1100&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 PS5 console that can only play digital titles&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X-Video-Game-Console-Black%2F443574645%3Fathbdg%3DL1100&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. These consoles will be available to non-trial Walmart Plus members, meaning you actually have to opt-in to pay Walmart for the service to get access (&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Faccount%2Fplus%2Foverview&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here’s where you can sign up for Walmart Plus&lt;/a&gt;). Though, Walmart is calling these “early access” deals, perhaps suggesting that they’ll open up to non-Plus customers after a window of time. In the past, the window of exclusivity has been three hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEO0nO"&gt;To ease the checkout process, make sure you have your shipping and payment info ready to go ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="potP0F"&gt;Getting an Xbox Series X? Check out these add-ons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3yJrjt"&gt;If you’re on team Xbox, you may already know about Game Pass Ultimate, which gives you discounts, access to the ever-expanding catalog of Game Pass games, along with online multiplayer. You may never need to pay full price for a game for your new console. Though, whether you do want to pay full price or you just need some ideas on what to play, check out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22825913/xbox-series-x-s-best-games-microsoft-2021"&gt;Xbox’s best games of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
