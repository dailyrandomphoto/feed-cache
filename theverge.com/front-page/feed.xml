    <title>Luna Display can now turn your iPad into a second screen for Windows devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/beif1eQuMH4VMcv6Jati_-qdTfw=/195x0:1503x872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69991001/Screenshot_2021_10_13_12.58.42_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Astropad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b9Ybrs"&gt;Astropad’s Luna Display is a handy way to turn an iPad or another Mac into a wireless external monitor for Apple’s computers. Now the company has updated its wireless dongles &lt;a href="https://astropad.com/luna-5-0-windows/"&gt;to include support for Windows PCs&lt;/a&gt;, a solid step forward for the company after Apple’s Sidecar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18651017/apple-ipad-pro-pencil-sidecar-wwdc-2019"&gt;made its functionality a built-in part&lt;/a&gt; of iPadOS and MacOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQL3ob"&gt;Windows support is included in Luna Display 5.0 and requires “Windows 10 64-bit, Build 1809 or later” and at least iPadOS 12.1, according to Astropad. That means modern Windows devices and iPads can work together in a variety of configurations, including using the Apple Pencil along with an iPad as a very expensive drawing tablet for your Windows machine. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6zHLEKudq02qN_7p4fS1SjB3FMs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924633/lunadisplaywindows.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Astropad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPad’s touch controls, gestures, and Pencil support all translate over to Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EIEzg5"&gt;The company is making Luna Display for Windows available in two types of connectors for plugging into your Windows devices, either USB-C and HDMI. Owners of the older USB-C Luna Display are also able to update to add support for Windows starting today. For what it’s worth, Astropad says the restructuring it did for its 5.0 release also means setting up Luna Display on M1 Macs should be faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfXNZZ"&gt;Astropad &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/8/23/16184080/astro-hq-luna-turns-ipad-into-wireless-display"&gt;first launched Luna Display in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, about two years before Apple “sherlocked” it with the Sidecar feature added in macOS Catalina. Not long after, the company updated Luna Display &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/18/20920510/luna-display-mac-to-mac-mode-sidecar-sherlocked-apple"&gt;to work wirelessly between Macs&lt;/a&gt; as a response to Apple’s move. “Apple zigs, we zag,” Astropad CEO Matt Ronge &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mronge/status/1184881856598237184?s=20"&gt;tweeted at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NRMXdf"&gt;Astropad &lt;a href="https://astropad.com/sherlocked-by-apple/"&gt;has been fairly open&lt;/a&gt; about its experience of being copied, including suggesting it was &lt;a href="https://astropad.com/blessing-in-disguise/"&gt;a blessing in disguise&lt;/a&gt; when it announced it was testing Windows support in beta (other companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21124116/apple-developers-sherlocked-blix-bluemail-anonymous-email-feature"&gt;preferred taking legal action&lt;/a&gt;). The Kickstarter for its new Luna Display for Windows dongles &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/767721702/luna-display-for-windows/posts"&gt;launched on September 30th, 2020&lt;/a&gt; and was successfully funded just an hour later. People clearly want this functionality for Windows, and now Astropad is finally offering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9FIlU"&gt;Luna Display is $129 for Mac or PC, with port options for USB-C, HDMI, and Mini DisplayPort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3N85v"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ooSC9y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook execs tease VR prototype hardware with new photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v7-l0N8nmrT1PU6wpZZFsnAuqqc=/0x178:843x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69990835/245329931_10113982963136581_574941966054337503_n.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M9WeKB"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook virtual reality lead and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688510/facebook-cto-andrew-boz-bosworth-chief-technology-officer"&gt;soon-to-be CTO&lt;/a&gt; Andrew Bosworth (or “Boz”) are playing around with prototype VR (or AR) tech and want to show it off. Both executives have &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10113982963161531&amp;amp;set=a.529237706231"&gt;posted pictures of themselves&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1448336606360838145?s=21"&gt;wearing prototype headsets&lt;/a&gt; and linking the concepts to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;Facebook’s work&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the metaverse&lt;/a&gt;. While the headsets the two are wearing are in no way guaranteed to become actual retail products, it’s an interesting look at what’s going on in Facebook’s virtual reality lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QybSMc"&gt;The headset Zuckerberg is wearing looks similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;the company’s Oculus headsets&lt;/a&gt;. However, he identifies it as “retina resolution,” borrowing Apple’s phrase for screens with such high pixel density that you can’t discern individual points at a normal operating distance. The headset Boz is wearing has a more intriguing design — it looks, to be frank, almost exactly like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;drawings and descriptions of Apple’s rumored VR headset&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond Zuckerberg’s vague “retina” comment, there are basically no details on what kind of headsets they are, what they’re capable of, or even if they’re just nonfunctional design mock-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bxxMxp"&gt;
&lt;div class="iframely-embed" style="max-width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;div class="iframely-responsive" style="padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10113982963161531&amp;amp;set=a.529237706231" data-iframely-url="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto%2F%3Ffbid%3D10113982963161531%26set%3Da.529237706231&amp;amp;key=9ef4a209439e42bc59783ba959d50197"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="cEJ2cx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Proud of the research Michael Abrash's team is working on at FRL-R Redmond—excited to get an early look at some of the technologies that will underpin the metaverse (we work on several prototype headsets to prove out concepts, this is one of them. Kind of. It's a long story.) &lt;a href="https://t.co/Yi9xjy5HmG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Yi9xjy5HmG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Boz (@boztank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1448336606360838145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ihcOXc"&gt;That’s perhaps to be expected, given that this isn’t a product announcement from Facebook. While the company has released a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;smart (and screen-less) Ray Bans&lt;/a&gt;, which it called a step in the path “towards full augmented reality glasses,” Facebook’s virtual reality lab also teases many prototypes that probably won’t make it to market. That includes things like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609564/facebook-reality-lab-reverse-passthrough-vr-prototype-research-siggraph"&gt;horrifying eye-projection headset&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641894/facebook-project-aria-augmented-reality-ar-research-glasses-user-manual"&gt;research-focused Aria AR glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308813/facebook-vr-sunglasses-research-proof-of-concept"&gt;proof-of-concept set of VR glasses&lt;/a&gt; (which show you a virtual world instead of augmenting the real one). Rather than hawking headsets, Boz and Zuckerberg seem to be selling their metaverse concept, which the company says is a virtual world that could be the next version of the internet. If you want to do a deep-dive into what that means exactly, check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;my colleagues’ great explainer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Hilariously, one of HTC’s Vive executives replied to Boz, asking if he’d be willing to trade the prototype headset for one hot off the factory line. Boz declined the offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CNIGbx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;no deal&lt;/p&gt;— Boz (@boztank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1448366889126686720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>How Axie Infinity is turning gaming on its head</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vhf2WiFv1FzxusvxYQ-LzKSfJBE=/168x0:1289x747/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69990831/https___bucketeer_e05bbc84_baa3_437e_9518_adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_418f3acf_2d81_4f05_ad62_2c875ec2c33f_4463x2289.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w8QDP7"&gt;Last month I wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22655077/loot-social-network-open-source-nft"&gt;Loot, a viral social project like nothing I had seen before&lt;/a&gt;. What made it possible was the unique digital objects known as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, which inspired the Loot community to go build an entire fictional universe around them from the bottom up. Today I want to talk about another big social experiment that NFTs have enabled, and the potentially profound consequences of the platform that is emerging as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohDUDq"&gt;I realize that, for lots of you, talk of blockchain projects immediately triggers eye-rolling and tab closing. But as with Loot, today’s edition is about one of those unconventional startups that feels too interesting to ignore. Especially because, on the surface, it can look like little more than a cheap &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; clone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MndSx"&gt;The name of this thing is&lt;a href="https://axieinfinity.com/"&gt; Axie Infinity&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s made by a Vietnam-based company named Sky Mavis. Last week it was in the news because, just five months after raising&lt;a href="https://axie.substack.com/p/seriesa"&gt; a $7.5 million round&lt;/a&gt; of Series A funding, &lt;a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/119521/axie-infinity-nft-series-b-funding-a16z"&gt;Sky Mavis added an additional $152 million Series B led by Andreessen Horowitz&lt;/a&gt;. The company, which was founded in 2018, is now valued at $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aK9D5w"&gt;The fundraising isn’t the interesting part: in 2021, almost any crypto-branded project showing decent growth will find itself showered in venture capital. &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; is interesting because it’s using cryptocurrency to stand up a new kind of video game, one in which you can earn meaningful income just by playing. The game is surrounded by a community that holds a financial stake in &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; via the game’s two currencies, which they can use to influence its development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCv8UI"&gt;In short, it’s a social network where all the participants are buying and selling goods with real money. We have a word for that, one that we would almost never apply to a web-based social network: &lt;em&gt;an economy&lt;/em&gt;. And if &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; continues to grow at its current rate, that’s poised to have some fascinating implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onNKEO"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; is just the beginning,” said Arianna Simpson, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz who led the firm’s &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; investment. “&lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; sort of created this model, but I think it’s going to be extremely widely applied ... If I can play a game, and have an equivalent amount of fun, and also make money — well obviously I’d rather do that, right? And so I think &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; is really just defining a new category, and this mechanism, in my mind, is going to be baked into the coming generations of games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuvTv3"&gt;But let’s back up for a minute: what kind of game is &lt;em&gt;Axie Infinity, &lt;/em&gt;exactly? In short, it’s &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; on the blockchain. (It’s not available in app stores; you either download &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; onto your desktop or sideload it onto your Android phone.) The game offers turn-based combat between teams of three cartoon monsters, known as Axies; each Axie has powers originating from their type (bug, bird, plant, etc.) and their various body parts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0IbWsQf_ZfLh83eDxZOZghDUW3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924743/0_mKVkWxi7ubrmq96K.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YG4PQ1"&gt;Where it differs from &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; is that Axies are unique digital objects stored on &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt;’s own blockchain; to create new ones, existing owners must “breed” them by spending currency earned within the game or purchased from an exchange. By winning battles in the game, or selling Axies to other players, owners can earn the game’s currencies. Those earnings can then be sold on the open market for real money, generating income for the players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1hPpg"&gt;Dedicated players are now earning thousands of dollars a month playing &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt;, and the platform has grown quickly, to 1.8 million users logged in to the platform in August. As &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; reported in August, &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/axie-infinity/"&gt;this has proven particularly true in the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, where 40 percent of today’s &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; players are based. The combination of existing low wages in the country and pandemic-related lockdowns has been a boon to &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt;, as players have flocked to the game in search of economic opportunity. (The outlet interviewed one man who doubled his income selling feed by playing &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt;, to $2,000 a month; a follow-up story explored &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/axie-players-are-facing-taxes/"&gt;how the country’s Bureau of Internal Revenue is now hounding players to pay their taxes&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pkj6Sx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;in some places in the Philippines, people are paying their rent with the game’s SLP token&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s5ooNO"&gt;One stat that struck me: Sky Mavis says 25 percent of its players have never had a bank before, meaning their &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; wallets are the first financial services they’ve been able to access. Simpson told me that in some places in the Philippines, people are paying their rent with the game’s SLP token. That helps explain how &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt;’s total trading volume now exceeds $2.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edkurQ"&gt;I asked Aleksander Larsen, co-founder and chief operating officer of Sky Mavis, why he thought &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; had grown so much faster than other crypto projects. In short, he said, &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; nailed the financial incentives: they gave players a good monetary reason to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFtbiW"&gt;“The way crypto works is that you have something to gain by it, right?” he said. “I think that’s really where it started. And then over the past couple of years, more and more people have have started to believe in our vision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQiFez"&gt;The company also made smart technical decisions: for example, moving the game’s transactions to a dedicated “&lt;a href="https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/technology/ronin-ethereum-sidechain"&gt;side chain&lt;/a&gt;” that enables the game to use the basic structure of Ethereum without processing transactions there, which can be slow and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="i0PAZl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"},{"title":"Blockchain, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xUGO4F"&gt;The question is how much bigger &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; can get from here. While the economic incentives can be powerful, particularly in developing countries, there’s no getting around the fact that playing &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; today is onerous. The&lt;a href="https://axie.substack.com/p/axie-community-alpha-getting-started"&gt; eight-step process&lt;/a&gt; described in the company’s online guide involves downloading not one but two crypto wallets; buying and depositing Ethereum onto the company’s own blockchain; and purchasing at least three Axies, among other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoTeOf"&gt;There are a lot of upfront costs: &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; estimates that it currently costs around $1,500 to buy into the game. (I haven’t yet made the leap myself.) In the Philippines, companies are now loaning out Axies to other players in exchange for 30 percent of their earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jkx5Fq1vRU3rdP7clpmQg5YQhRE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924749/https___bucketeer_e05bbc84_baa3_437e_9518_adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_117b0612_3517_489b_bc52_b8839f55d020_1600x862.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PoPtbs"&gt;Larsen is the first to admit that the current setup is complicated. He likened it to “swimming out to an island” just to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70kmIB"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Axie &lt;/em&gt;is totally isolated out there — you have to do all this hard stuff to get there,” he said. “And yet people are willing to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W01Sd9"&gt;But a change is coming, he told me. The company is currently at work on a free-to-play version of &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; that, at least theoretically, could pass muster in the Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfdAq8"&gt;It should be available within three or four months, Larsen said. He said he was hopeful that the growing popularity of the app would give Sky Mavis leverage with Apple as it navigates app store policies. To date, so far as I can tell, there’s no iOS app for buying and selling NFTs. (Some,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684372/opensea-app-nft-ios-android-apple-google"&gt; like OpenSea’s&lt;/a&gt;, simply least showcase the ones you own.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HijvOP"&gt;The dream is to eliminate everything that’s hard about playing &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; and welcome in the rest of the world. Larsen hopes that in a future version of the game, you’ll be able to acquire your blockchain assets with a single click and start playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKzXzA"&gt;“That’s the dream, obviously,” he said. “That’s what I’m working for. And when that moment in time hits, I think we can get to 2 billion people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNSl1i"&gt;In the meantime, &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; is developing a way for people to buy virtual plots of lands in its fictional setting, the aptly named Lunacia, and eventually hopes to become a platform for games and experiences akin to Roblox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9N5TZl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What will it mean to live in a world where average people can make a little money — or even a lot of money — playing games?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UsT3B0"&gt;But let’s fast-forward a few years to a point when Apple and the crypto companies have worked something out. What will it mean to live in a world where average people can make a little money — or even a lot of money — playing games? How will it affect what kinds of games get built? Will it gradually siphon the attention of people who might have otherwise spent their time thumbing through feeds, mindlessly enriching the platform?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFJhT0"&gt;It’s too soon to say, of course, but sometime this summer, these questions stopped feeling like sci-fi to me. I don’t know whether &lt;em&gt;Axie Infinity&lt;/em&gt; is the next &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. But I do believe that the phenomenon playing out in the Philippines today will be coming to other countries — possibly even more developed countries — in the not too distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZxTYY"&gt;And when it arrives, the idea of playing to earn might bring a lot of people into crypto along with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LCYdgo"&gt;
&lt;p id="WLaZXX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch Series 7 officially ditches the hidden diagnostic port</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 7 in green." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xUh-TcvuezoCV_LzFTHy5kW7_uk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69990785/vpavic_211006_4796_0029.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d22oPe"&gt;The Apple Watch’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/4/8543033/apple-watch-hidden-port-charging-battery-strap"&gt;diagnostic port&lt;/a&gt; has been a mysterious part of the wearable lineup since its first model, but the new Series 7 officially ditches the six-pin port entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RqFb0"&gt;Intended for internal use for diagnostics, the port wasn’t officially acknowledged on Apple’s website or documentation. But the diagnostic port briefly hinted at the possibility of expanding the Apple Watch with hardware accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suxWRo"&gt;The most famous of these &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8676901/apple-watch-secret-port-charges-faster"&gt;was the Reserve Strap&lt;/a&gt;, which attempted to use the port for extending the battery life of the Apple Watch by incorporating extra batteries into a specially made band that would slot directly into the diagnostic port. The port actually offered &lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt; charging than Apple’s own magnetic cable, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmIBnjNnV8fTl2XKhGyRler4aJs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924623/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_3.58.46_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Reserve Strap&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1xk1iH"&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/19/11460712/apple-watch-wristband-reserve-strap-accessory-loophole"&gt;Apple quickly blocked that capability&lt;/a&gt; and Reserve Strap (along with virtually every other attempt at harnessing the port for useful purposes). For the subsequent life span of the Apple Watch, it remained useful for its intended purpose: diagnostics for internal Apple use and repairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xP1EOD"&gt;Of course, Apple still needs a way to do diagnostics on the Apple Watch, and appears to be replacing the mysterious port with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690061/apple-watch-series-7-wireless-dock-data-transfer-port-free"&gt;even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; mysterious 60.5GHz wireless module&lt;/a&gt; that pairs with a magnetic dock capable of local data transfer for internal use. That’s led to some speculation that Apple is using the Series 7 as a test bed for a future portless iPhone that could use similar technology to replace cables for connecting to a computer. But if years of the useless diagnostic port have taught us anything, it’s that sometimes there’s no greater meaning or utility to be found in proprietary diagnostic tools. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Safari extensions on your iPhone and iPad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZxdtPME6LdsDlwMyFZFoxseD6U0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69990647/akrales_210917_4760_0330.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OnAPJ1"&gt;One of the handiest types of software in anyone’s quiver is the browser extension: those cool little applets that let your browser do what you want it to do. And one of the nicest things about iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 is that you can now add extensions to the Safari browser. Even though this is a new feature that launched with the latest iOS version, there are already a number of useful extensions available for you to add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YasHh9"&gt;What follows is a rundown on how to add extensions to your Safari app — while we’ve illustrated the process using an iPhone, you can follow the same basic directions with an iPad. We’ve also included a sampling of some extensions you can try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5WSYPV"&gt;How to add extensions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PeMPW1"&gt;Tap on the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Asir3B"&gt;Scroll down to and select Safari &amp;gt; Extensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TITo5t"&gt;Any extensions that you’ve already installed will be listed here. Tap on “More Extensions” if you’d like to see what’s available in the App Store. (You can also simply go to the App Store and search on “Safari Extensions.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In your settings, go to Safari &amp;amp;gt; Extensions to see your current extensions and get new ones." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3AD67CZ0fV_CpSxi9R5SxShgnpI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924238/makephotogallery.net_1634147611611.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In your settings, go to Safari &amp;gt; Extensions to see your current extensions and get new ones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="8nqVoA"&gt;Once you’ve installed your first extension, you’ll see a little “puzzle piece” icon on the left side of Safari’s address bar. Tap that, and the menu that pops up will include your current extensions plus a “Manage Extensions” selection, which lets you toggle your extensions on and off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s simple to install a new extension from the App Store." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FtOUJLXJMIdbD7qzlHOPGsr-JmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924199/IMG_62BD37855789_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s simple to install a new extension from the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once installed, you can manage your extensions from the Safari address bar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fQeRleRBeQ_EwGaNC_62lTg0tr4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924201/IMG_04F0290642C7_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once installed, you can manage your extensions from the Safari address bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="s7Bn4f"&gt;Some extensions to try&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AGDDk3"&gt;This is a small sampling of some of the extensions that you can now access via the App Store. While there are not many extensions yet available (compared to the number of extensions for, say, Chrome), it’s a pretty safe bet that there will be lots more to come over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EcWNOu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amplosion-redirect-amp-links/id1585734696"&gt;Amplosion&lt;/a&gt; ($2.99)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2ac8e"&gt;AMP, which is short for “Accelerated Mobile Pages,” is a web format created by Google to optimize search results for mobile browsers. However, if you’d rather not have Google tweaking the webpages you upload, you can use Amplosion to redirect the AMP links that show up in search results into normal mobile links. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gdDvT0"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/noir-dark-mode-for-safari/id1581140954"&gt;Noir&lt;/a&gt; ($2.99)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QbnD0m"&gt;When you’re browsing at night and you’ve set your iPhone or iPad to dark mode, you will often hit a website that is bright enough to make your eyes water. Noir allows you to set a dark mode for all the websites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2kHdjr"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; (subscription needed)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LWSUOV"&gt;1Password is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722617/1password-sharing-link-google-docs-secure"&gt;well-known and respected password manager&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a 1Password user, there’s no question that you’re going to want to add this one to your mobile Safari app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mL3I9c"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-agent-for-safari/id1568262835#?platform=iphone"&gt;Super Agent for Safari&lt;/a&gt; (free)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6RVAs2"&gt;This handy extension automatically fills out a website’s cookie consent forms based on your preferences, which can save you a lot of time and irritation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="avc3ZM"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/web-inspector/id1584825745"&gt;Web Inspector&lt;/a&gt; (free)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iJnWA2"&gt;Something for developers: an app that lets you inspect the HTML coding of a website, modify it, debug it, and perform other essential tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fossil fuels are forecast to dry up, but not soon enough</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Climate Activists Continue Protests Outside White House" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T7re8xFu5pQwq8hEKR4zNqzPYqw=/0x18:6076x4069/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69990451/1346211976.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6MCYJn"&gt;This decade could see the beginning of the end of fossil fuels’ dominance as a source of energy, according to a new report from an agency that was formed to safeguard the world’s oil supply. It’s the latest signal that the global energy economy is on the verge of a dramatic transformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWBf08"&gt;The International Energy Agency (IEA) came together in the midst of the 1970s oil crisis to monitor global supply and demand and foster cooperation on energy policy. For the first time, its annual &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2021"&gt;World Energy Outlook&lt;/a&gt; predicts that oil demand will reach a peak and begin to decline in all the future scenarios the agency examined — and it sees that as a good thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y8Q0KN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The cusp of a new era.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oOoaLb"&gt;In the most optimistic scenario, with countries standing by their leaders’ &lt;em&gt;pledges&lt;/em&gt; on climate change, fossil fuel use overall — which also includes coal and gas — will peak around 2025 and begin to fall soon after. In the most pessimistic scenario, which only takes into consideration existing &lt;em&gt;policies&lt;/em&gt; on climate change, fossil fuel use would likely stagnate over the next couple decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSO9rh"&gt;“We stand on the cusp of a new era,” Mark Campanale, founder and executive chair of London-based nonprofit think tank Carbon Tracker Initiative, said in a &lt;a href="https://carbontracker.org/carbon-tracker-statement-on-ieas-weo/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; responding to the IEA’s new outlook. In its own &lt;a href="https://carbontracker.org/reports/2020-vision-why-you-should-see-the-fossil-fuel-peak-coming/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;, Carbon Tracker predicted that demand for all fossil fuels would peak this decade as renewable energy gets cheaper and economies try to tackle climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGomNH"&gt;The speed of the energy transition, however, is still too slow to keep the climate crisis at a level humans would be better able to cope with. Greenhouse gas emissions globally need to be essentially eliminated by around 2050, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;leading climate scientists&lt;/a&gt;, in order to keep global warming from surpassing 1.5 degrees Celsius. The world has already reached &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/2020-was-one-of-three-warmest-years-record"&gt;1.2 degrees&lt;/a&gt; Celsius of warming, and we’re seeing more catastrophic storms, floods, heatwaves, fires, and drought as a result. Breaching 1.5 degrees will trigger significantly worse conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;scientists expect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXc4zr"&gt;More than fifty &lt;a href="https://www.climatewatchdata.org/net-zero-tracker"&gt;countries&lt;/a&gt; around the world have pledged to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the century. Even with their commitments, global carbon dioxide emissions will only fall by about 40 percent by 2050, the IEA found, far short of what’s needed to keep warming limited to 1.5 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3dhCw"&gt;A fault that more progressive environmental activists have found with net zero goals is that they might not aim to reach &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; zero emissions. Instead, net zero pledges allow polluters to continue burning fossil fuels as long as they try to cancel out some of their emissions by turning to unreliable carbon offsets and still unproven technologies that capture CO2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CHR7MG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The stubborn incumbency of fossil fuels”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1QYmG0"&gt;“The world’s hugely encouraging clean energy momentum is running up against the stubborn incumbency of fossil fuels in our energy systems,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/world-energy-outlook-2021-shows-a-new-energy-economy-is-emerging-but-not-yet-quickly-enough-to-reach-net-zero-by-2050"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkCODi"&gt;What’s more, the most optimistic scenario charted out by the IEA assumes that world leaders will be able to make good on mere climate promises. The problem is that the world’s biggest polluters, China and the US, &lt;a href="https://www.climatewatchdata.org/net-zero-tracker"&gt;don’t have actual laws yet&lt;/a&gt; in place to mandate fossil fuel pollution cuts reaching net zero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09Px6L"&gt;The IEA called the Energy Outlook it published today a “handbook” for global climate negotiations scheduled to start at the end of the month. The United Nations climate summit, called COP26, marks a deadline for countries to raise their carbon-cutting commitments, five years after the adoption of the landmark Paris Agreement. There ought to be no new investments in any new fossil fuel projects if the world is to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and stave off global heating beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius, the IEA determined in another groundbreaking &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhpPPE"&gt;“Governments, businesses, industry groups, and investors rely on analysis by the IEA to guide their energy decisions. They have the power to influence key stakeholders, and we are counting on them to do so,” May Boeve, executive director of the international environmental organization &lt;a href="http://350.org"&gt;350.org&lt;/a&gt;, said in a statement today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4bsBFE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Net-zero is not enough”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zsd0ZU"&gt;Hundreds of demonstrators, led by Indigenous activists, are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FightFossils/status/1447564005791473667"&gt;rallying&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, DC this week to demand not only a stop to new fossil fuel projects, or an emphasis on “net zero” pledges, but a stop to fossil fuel drilling in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQPdxp"&gt;“[The IEA] report is an important milestone that hopefully sends a message ahead of these important climate negotiations, but net-zero is not enough,” Boeve said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJihnI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALp3dV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is launching a Spaces accelerator program to pay live audio creators</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d2dIbS"&gt;Twitter&lt;a href="https://media.twitter.com/en/verticals/creators/twitter-spaces-spark-program"&gt; announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that it plans to support Twitter Spaces creators through a new three-month accelerator program called the Twitter Spaces Spark Program. Twitter’s plans follow a similar creator three-month program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/14/22330281/clubhouse-accelerator-creators-davison-app"&gt;that Clubhouse launched in March 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RevIMR"&gt;The Spark Program is designed to “discover and reward” around 150 Spaces creators with technical, financial, and marketing support, Twitter says. For anyone who applies and gets in, that includes a stipend of $2,500 per month, $500 in monthly ad credits to spend promoting your Spaces on Twitter, early access to new Twitter features, support from Twitter’s official social media handles, and “opportunities for prioritized in-app discoverability for well-performing Spaces.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;*unmutes*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;today we’re opening the application process for the Twitter Spaces Spark Program&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;what’s that? it’s an initiative for creators who are excited about the future of social audio   &lt;a href="https://t.co/4zay8uvao8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4zay8uvao8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1447956725924077583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rndQXX"&gt;To be eligible for the program, you need to meet the following criteria (Twitter has &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-spaces-spark-program-policy"&gt;a more extensive explanation&lt;/a&gt; on its site):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tjkmWm"&gt;Be 18 years or older&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tejycQ"&gt;Have 5,000 or more “active followers”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q7ARS3"&gt;Be located in the US (at least for Twitter’s first phase of the program)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vEGXRU"&gt;Commit to hosting a minimum of two Spaces per week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="rouOJQ"&gt;Twitter is offering a slightly different package of perks compared to Clubhouse’s Creator First program from earlier this year. Creator First focused on connecting live audio creators with brands for sponsorships and building their audiences. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420644/clubhouse-creator-first-pilot-program-season-audio-social"&gt;For shows that were part of the Clubhouse’s “Pilot Season,”&lt;/a&gt; it included $5,000 per month — a bit more than Twitter’s offering —  and access to new equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bbpse6"&gt;Reporting from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s senior reporter Ashley Carman suggests the actual results of Clubhouse’s first accelerator program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696403/clubhouse-creators-first-sponsorship-program"&gt;were a mixed bag&lt;/a&gt;. Creators loved the community Clubhouse has helped foster but found that the company couldn’t keep up its end of the bargain to connect shows and creators with advertising and sponsorships capable of supporting them after the program ended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caZYs6"&gt;Twitter’s accelerator seems to be avoiding that “what comes after” question, at least for now. That’s somewhat understandable; it’s a hard problem to solve! But it also leaves creators with the same amount of uncertainty about jumping into another new opportunity from a social media company. A familiar place to be, but not exactly a comfortable one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvWYJi"&gt;Applications for the Twitter Spaces Spark Program are open until October 22nd, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says it will ban content that sexually harasses celebrities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UZn3qDKoma1HJ-SPaleKUfIAuMg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69989751/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VppY7y"&gt;Facebook announced Wednesday that it would start removing “severe sexualizing content” targeting public figures as part of a new update to its bullying and harassment policies. The policy changes also include coordinated harassment attacks against users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gx5Ddj"&gt;As part of this new policy update, Facebook said that it would remove any profiles, pages, groups, or events dedicated to sexualizing public figures, including celebrities, politicians, and content creators. The new policy bans sexualized photoshops and drawings and any degrading content “in the process of bodily functions,” Antigone Davis, global head of safety at Facebook, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/advancing-online-bullying-harassment-policies/"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eq2pY"&gt;Facebook also said that it would remove “unwanted sexualized commentary” and repetitive attacks harassing an individual sexually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d9fiNw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We made these changes because attacks like these can weaponize a public figure’s appearance”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jJDXsf"&gt;“Public figures — whether they’re politicians, journalists, celebrities or creators — use Facebook and Instagram to engage directly with their followers,” Davis wrote in the Wednesday blog post. “We made these changes because attacks like these can weaponize a public figure’s appearance, which is unnecessary and often not related to the work these public figures represent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycQNqB"&gt;Facebook’s policy announcement comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;whistleblower Frances Haugen&lt;/a&gt; testified before Congress last week. Last Tuesday’s hearing focused on a series of reports from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that revealed Facebook executives were aware of the harms its platform could inflict on users, especially teenagers. Haugen is &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58870495"&gt;expected to testify&lt;/a&gt; before the UK Parliament later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2XIyJ"&gt;Wednesday’s update also includes new language banning large, coordinated attacks on users that are at a “heightened risk of offline harm,” even if the posts or messages don’t violate Facebook’s content policies. This update includes Facebook and Instagram posts and direct messages sent to individuals like government dissidents or victims of violent attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RbLnBM"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700937/twitch-safety-tools-verification-phone-hate-raids"&gt;Twitch added new tools&lt;/a&gt; to fight against creator harassment on its platform, including phone number verification options for chat. The streaming platform also announced changes to its email verification system to give creators more control over the viewers using chat. Users are allowed up to five accounts to a single phone number, limiting the number of accounts that could be made to harass a creator. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Visible confirms account breaches, blames ‘outside sources’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WCZPrRgPQ1Sq7t_GHPUEAtQEi8c=/0x25:1336x916/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69989709/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_9.41.35_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Visible&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CCertt"&gt;Cell service provider Visible has confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723587/verizon-visible-cell-network-potential-hack-data-breach-phone-sales"&gt;customer reports&lt;/a&gt; of attackers accessing and changing user accounts, and it has said that the breaches were carried out using usernames and passwords from “outside sources.” In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; (which you can read in full below), the Verizon-owned carrier said that it’s worked to “mitigate the issue” since it became aware of it, though it doesn’t mention exactly what measures it’s put in place to protect customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lp7Iz8"&gt;Starting earlier this week, customers of Verizon’s lower-cost service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723587/verizon-visible-cell-network-potential-hack-data-breach-phone-sales"&gt;were reporting unauthorized charges&lt;/a&gt; from Visible on their PayPals or credit card statements, as well as emails telling them that their accounts’ passwords or addresses had been changed. Some customers have been frustrated with a lack of response from the company, as it hasn’t sent out emails or texts about the situation and was largely silent on social media until Wednesday, when it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Visible/status/1448322446646554633?s=20"&gt;posted a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5oHfGB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; If you use your Visible username &amp;amp; password across multiple accounts, including your bank/financial accounts, we recommend updating your username/password with those services. Reminder: Visible will never call &amp;amp; ask for your password, secret questions or account PINs. &lt;/p&gt;— Visible (@Visible) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Visible/status/1448322446646554633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jXgEea"&gt;In both its statement and on Twitter, the company recommends resetting your password if it’s one you’ve used for other services. It’s good advice, but the company has turned off its password reset system — it wasn’t available yesterday, and as of Wednesday morning you’ll still get an error if you try to change your password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVp1tn"&gt;Hackers getting into accounts using passwords found elsewhere is very common, that’s why everybody (including Visible) says to use unique passwords for each service and to change your passwords in the case of a breach. Security experts also recommend using two-factor authentication, which can help protect you even if your password fails (like in a situation where you’re not able to change it). Visible, however, doesn’t support two-factor authentication, which means that its customers are still potentially open to these kinds of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2KJYg"&gt;Here’s Visible’s full statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="zaaqzD"&gt;Visible is aware of an issue in which some member accounts were accessed and/or charged without their authorization. As soon as we were made aware of the issue, we immediately initiated a review and started deploying tools to mitigate the issue and enable additional controls to further protect our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lE5BM"&gt;Our investigation indicates that threat actors were able to access username/passwords from outside sources, and exploit that information to login to Visible accounts. If you use your Visible username and password across multiple accounts, including your bank or other financial accounts, we recommend updating your username/password with those services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mI9x16"&gt;Protecting customer information — including securing customer accounts — is critically important to our company and our customers. As a reminder, our company will never call and ask for your password, secret questions or account PINs. If you feel your account has been compromised, please reach out to us via chat at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvisible.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F13%2F22724592%2Fvisible-account-breach-cell-purchases-outside-sources-passwords" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;visible.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Call of Duty’s new anti-cheat system includes a kernel-level driver to catch PC cheaters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H4htLgw_WMVWwET2fnS53M_AXII=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69989634/acastro_300505_4008_pcGameHacks_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hRYFef"&gt;Activision is finally cracking down on cheating in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;. A new Ricochet anti-cheat system is arriving in both &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;. The system will use a combination of a PC kernel-level driver, machine learning algorithms to examine player behavior, and a “team of dedicated professionals” working to investigate cheaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTmwp8"&gt;The PC kernel-level driver has been developed internally for the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; franchise by Activision, and will launch first for &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; with the upcoming Pacific update. PC games are increasingly using kernel-level drivers to detect sophisticated cheating, but since they run at such a high level in Windows, there are always privacy concerns surrounding such an approach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-G604PlBtYqYcUUweU6ov7HHX1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923329/The_Pacific.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The kernel-level driver will be part of the Pacific map update for Warzone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WYr7Xq"&gt;The Ricochet anti-cheat system in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; will not always be on, according to Activision. That means the kernel-level driver only operates when you open up &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, and the driver will shut down when you exit. The driver itself will monitor processes interacting with &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; to see if they’re trying to inject code or manipulate the game, and report the results back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRIGoV"&gt;Activision says it has tested the driver across a large range of PCs, and it will be required to play &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; when the Pacific map update launches later this year. The kernel-level driver will eventually arrive in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt; “at a later date.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJvJLA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; players will welcome this new anti-cheat effort, even if there will be inevitable questions and concerns over a kernel-level driver. It comes just a day after the main &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;Twitter account issued a stern warning to cheaters: “Cheaters aren’t welcome. There’s no tolerance for cheaters, and soon you’ll know what we mean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ByzsyG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;See you tomorrow. &lt;a href="https://t.co/BAvAGPkTzx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BAvAGPkTzx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1448000521743314951?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k5JIrp"&gt;While Activision has been banning thousands of accounts, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261947/call-of-duty-warzone-cheaters-hackers-aimbots-wallhacks-problem"&gt;cheaters have still been ruining &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; for months&lt;/a&gt;. Prominent &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; players have become highly vocal about the problem, forcing Raven Software to communicate more frequently about the cheating issues and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632554/call-of-duty-warzone-vanguard-raven-new-map-destiny-2-anti-cheat"&gt;promise a full anti-cheat system in August&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0EPe4I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the only PC game affected by cheaters, though. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"&gt;Cheating in some of the world’s top PC games has been getting worse&lt;/a&gt; over the past year, and aimbots and wallhacks are now common in the industry’s most competitive shooters. Aimbots automatically lock onto opponents, making it easy to hit head shots. Wallhacks expose everyone on a map, so cheaters get a huge advantage by knowing where their opponents are at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r3r438"&gt;The industry has been struggling to combat cheaters even with tools like Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye that also use kernel-level drivers. &lt;em&gt;Valorant &lt;/em&gt;has had some success with its own custom kernel-level driver, but it’s still a big investment to have teams dedicated to fighting what are effectively hackers and malware authors. It’s a continuous cat and mouse game, as hackers regularly work around protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wauODA"&gt;A more coordinated industry effort might be required to really tackle the issue. Microsoft is the Windows platform holder, but the company’s “TruePlay” anti-cheat system for Windows 10 never really materialized. It was limited to the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) for apps, which most game developers have ignored, and it’s not clear if Microsoft will ever provide a full anti-cheat solution at the Windows kernel level to assist game developers.&lt;/p&gt;
