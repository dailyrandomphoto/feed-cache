    <title>Instagram to introduce “take a break” feature and “nudge” teens away from harmful content</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qiXWV4"&gt;Instagram will introduce new measures to nudge teenagers away from harmful content and encourage them to “take a break,” from the platform, Facebook vice president of global affairs Nick Clegg said on Sunday. Clegg made the remarks on &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/10/10/dana-bash-presses-nick-clegg-is-that-acceptable.cnn"&gt;CNN’s State of the Union&lt;/a&gt; show less than a week after whistleblower Frances Haugen testified before Congress about internal research that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;showed Instagram can have a negative effect on the mental health of young people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50IxCc"&gt;“We’re going to introduce something which I think will make a considerable difference, which is where our systems see that a teenagers is looking at the same content over and over again, and it’s content which may not be conducive to their well being, we will nudge them to look at other content,” Clegg said. He added that in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;pausing plans for an Instagram Kids&lt;/a&gt; platform and giving parents optional controls to supervise teens, the company planned to introduce a feature “called ‘take a break,’ where we will be prompting teens to just simply take a break from using Instagram.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rmTmf0"&gt;Clegg didn’t provide a timeline for either feature. In response to an email from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;seeking further details, a Facebook spokesperson said the features are “not testing yet but will soon.” The spokesperson pointed to a &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids"&gt;September 27th blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Instagram head Adam Mosseri which mentioned the company was “exploring” the features: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="se8uqp"&gt;We announced &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/using-research-to-improve-your-experience"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; that we’re exploring two new ideas: encouraging people to look at other topics if they’re dwelling on content that might contribute to negative social comparison, and a feature tentatively called “Take a Break,” where people could put their account on pause and take a moment to consider whether the time they’re spending is meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OUBM15"&gt;CNN host Dana Bash asked Clegg whether Facebook’s algorithm amplified or spread pro-insurrection voices ahead of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;riot at the US Capitol building on January 6th&lt;/a&gt;. Clegg said he couldn’t give a yes or no answer to the question. Haugen is &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/06/tech/facebook-whistleblower-january-6-select-committee/index.html"&gt;reportedly going meet with the committee&lt;/a&gt; investigating the January 6th attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MV1SLW"&gt;Clegg did say that Facebook’s algorithms “should be held to account, if necessary, by regulation so that people can match what our systems say they’re supposed to do from what actually happens.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvEts1"&gt;Facebook has been under intense criticism for the past several weeks, following reporting from the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;based on internal documents that Haugen provided. A former product manager at Facebook, Haugen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;testified before Congress&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday at a hearing focused on the company’s internal research that showed &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;Instagram can be toxic, particularly for teen girls&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook CEO Mark &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113961365418581"&gt;Zuckerberg disputed&lt;/a&gt; Haugen’s account, saying it was illogical for a company that relies on advertisers to push content that makes people angry to turn a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin postpones William Shatner’s space flight by a day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2018 Creative Arts Emmy Awards - Day 1 - Arrivals" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nZBM1JKdnNPxRlLXrBDM7ZGOZgQ=/4x0:4197x2795/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69977202/1029659286.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;William Shatner is heading to space on October 13th | Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fEIWgA"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ spaceflight company Blue Origin said Sunday it will postpone the flight that is slated to fly William Shatner to space due to forecasted high winds at its launch site. The flight of the company’s New Shepard spacecraft is now scheduled for 9:30AM ET on October 13th, a day later than originally planned. It’s targeted to lift off from Blue Origin’s Launch Site One in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRwFsp"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-shepard-ns-18-mission-updates"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on Blue Origin’s website said New Shepard NS-18 has met all mission requirements, and the astronauts have started their training. “Weather is the only gating factor for the launch window,” according to the statement, which is signed with the company motto “Gradatim Ferociter” (Latin for “step by step, ferociously”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teKdip"&gt;The company officially announced last week that Shatner, best known as Captain James T. Kirk from &lt;em&gt;Star Trek, &lt;/em&gt;will join the crew of New Shepard for its second crewed flight. Shatner, 90, will be the oldest person to fly to space. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;New Shepard’s first crewed flight&lt;/a&gt; in July brought Bezos, his brother Mark, aviator Wally Funk, and teenager Oliver Daeman to space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMs9L8"&gt;Shatner will be joined by Chris Boshuizen, a former NASA engineer and co-founder of satellite company Planet Labs, Glen de Vries, the co-founder of software company Medidata and vice chair of life sciences at a French software company, and Audrey Powers, Blue Origin’s vice president of mission and flight operations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Star Trek: Discovery, Doctor Who: Flux, Blade Runner: Black Lotus, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FxRR1uvAuJLwxtMqUF5xdc-AQwI=/103x0:1149x697/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69977124/star_trek_discovery.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sonequa Martin-Green stars as Captain Michael Burnham in Star Trek: Discovery | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIPT9WC6Vsk" target="_blank"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C6WMUo"&gt;Before it premiered, Jason Sudeikis &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2021/07/22/jason-sudeikis-ted-lasso-season-2-star-wars-fans/7979429002/"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; season two of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; as the show’s &lt;em&gt;Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt; season, and sure enough, the entire season focused on fathers and sons, and after the season finale we have a pretty clear “enemy” all set up for season three. I know season two was not as universally liked as its freshman season, but &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; dug into some thorny issues about men and sports and mental health that few other shows attempt, and still managed to make me smile pretty much every week. I’ll miss this show until its return next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyMPUM"&gt;I’ve also managed to binge-watch &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; on Netflix— an interesting if not quite fully-baked examination of organized religion— and am still hanging in there with &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; which has gotten quite spicy thanks mainly to Julianna Margulies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttURCn"&gt;The theme of this week’s trailers: titles with colons in them. A couple of these dropped Saturday during New York Comic Con; look for a recap of this year’s event Monday on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyMB2p"&gt;Here’s this week’s roundup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iGOGHq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JIPT9WC6Vsk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ct93N6"&gt;Star Trek: Discovery &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DJBho9"&gt;The fourth season of&lt;em&gt; Discovery&lt;/em&gt; finds Michael Burnham in the captain’s chair of the ship (yesss), and she and the crew are facing “a threat unlike any they’ve ever encountered,” according to the promo copy. This time it’s a massive anomaly threatening the entire galaxy, Federation planet or not. Sonequa Martin-Green, Anthony Rapp, Mary Wiseman, Wilson Cruz, David Ajala, and Doug Jones return in season four, and the trailer gives us a few glimpses of guest stars David Cronenberg, Oded Fehr, and Tig Notaro. &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; boldly goes (sorry) to Paramount Plus on November 18th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvjFeH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MOcaQC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrGBqKqb3gg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="r2tt9R"&gt;Doctor Who: Flux&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4ytUuh"&gt;Just getting it out of the way early: No, we don’t get a hint of who the next Doctor will be. This is &lt;em&gt;barely&lt;/em&gt; even a teaser at 19 seconds long, but we do get a fair bit of information about season 13. Doctor Who (Jodie Whittaker) tells us “we don’t have much time” and cautions that “the flux is coming” and bringing with it various enemies from across the universe, for “the fight of our lives.” This is Whittaker’s final season as the titular Doctor and we don’t have to wait too long for new episodes;&lt;em&gt; Doctor Who: Flux&lt;/em&gt; comes to BBC America on October 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="arbmRQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUu3lK_Z8VM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KvOtoX"&gt;Blade Runner: Black Lotus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f8UbCr"&gt;The new anime series based in the Blade Runner universe is set in Los Angeles in 2032, so about halfway between &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner &lt;/em&gt;(set in 2019) and &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt;. We got a teaser a few months ago, but in the full trailer we get a look at Elle, a replicant wondering why her dreams are getting worse (“what did you do to us?” she asks), and by the end she’s decided “I’m going to kill them all,” but we don’t know who the “them” are. The animation in the trailer is really stunning, particularly the scenes of seedy future LA. &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner: Black Lotus &lt;/em&gt;is coming to Crunchyroll and Adult Swim on November 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PJxkoR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBYsSos0xhY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BHCKvr"&gt;Dune&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jUHMy0"&gt;After multiple pandemic-related &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551728/dune-movie-release-date-delayed-again-warner-bros"&gt;delays&lt;/a&gt; and a few teasers and trailers, we get one last &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;trailer before its debut. In addition to a reminder that “fear is the mind-killer,” we get a look at some of the movie’s massive battle sequences (look, ornithopters!) We’re all ready. Let’s go. &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; comes to theaters and HBO Max on October 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xh96lM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJomaOzgKpc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6zdiMi"&gt;Hanna&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KJy7bA"&gt;An action series about a woman turned into a super soldier by a shady government program is so relevant to my interests it’s almost comical and yet I haven’t watched &lt;em&gt;Hanna&lt;/em&gt;. Its third season comes to Amazon Prime Video on November 24th, so I’ve got time to watch seasons one and two before then. Esme Creed-Miles stars along with Dermot Mulroney, Mireille Enos, and Aine Rose Daly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change your default browser in Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j8IAO-yddsFROKJiSFhQjwQcl7Q=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69969424/Screenshot__84_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cb5cUv"&gt;If you’ve updated your PC from Windows 10 to Windows 11, you may have noticed that when you click on a link for a website, a PDF document, or a variety of other file types, you will now be sent to Microsoft’s Edge browser. In its new version of Windows, Microsoft seems to have become especially aggressive in pushing its own apps over the apps that had been installed as defaults before the upgrade. In other words, Edge suddenly became your default browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6FBt5H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft is making it harder to switch default browsers in Windows 11","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8h8sJa"&gt;Normally, the first time you go into another browser that is not Edge — say, Google Chrome — the not-Edge browser will ask if you’d like to make it the default instead. However, the process for changing your defaults in Windows 11 has become more complicated than it was in Windows 10. So you may not get that handy request — or if you do, it may land you on a complicated-looking page headed “App &amp;gt; Default apps.” Either way, here’s how to switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IXoc02"&gt;Switch default browsers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPB00S"&gt;If you don’t want Edge to be your default browser, and your favorite browser isn’t offering to make the change for you — or if it did offer but instead sent you to the “Default apps” page — here’s how to switch the default. For this example, I’m using Google Chrome, but this should work with any browser that you have installed on your system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="GQSVmd"&gt;Select Settings &amp;gt; Apps &amp;gt; Default apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PKk51R"&gt;Under “Set defaults for applications,” either scroll down to where your preferred browser is listed or type the name in the “Search apps” field. Click on the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Switching browsers means associating each file type with your new browser." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDDskYt1jzHp3HLJw6aXzow1X2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908532/Screenshot__5_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Switching browsers means associating each file type with your new browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BRZ48p"&gt;You’ll see a list of browser-related files, and under each file name, the app with which it is currently associated. In Windows 11, you can’t simply change your default browser with a single click — you have to change the assigned browser for every specific file type. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MCDLub"&gt;Look for the file types assigned to Edge, such as .HTM, .HTML, HTTP, HTTPS, and perhaps .PDF (unless you have a PDF reader you prefer). Click on the ones you want to change. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you first click on a file type, Windows may try to discourage any changes." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JeVLc0rLMFwg4s4a8cFnjJJPU0w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908534/Screenshot__6_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you first click on a file type, Windows may try to discourage any changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="6e8TOE"&gt;You may get a “Before you switch” pop-up urging you to try Microsoft Edge — go ahead and click on “Switch anyway.” You’ll get a pop-up with a “Keep using this app” selection on top and your other installed browsers below. Go ahead and select the one you want to use. (Be aware that there may be some file types that won’t offer your browser as an alternative.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can change each file type for an appropriate installed app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GSqQpQeceV5bNmVJAzIzEy2Q6zI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908535/Screenshot__8_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can change each file type for an appropriate installed app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="10SILw"&gt;Note: by the time you read this, some browsers may have instituted a system for letting you more easily switch your default browser. For example, when this was written, the first time I opened Firefox, it asked if I wanted it to become the default. I let it go ahead, and when I went to the “Default apps” section of setup, I found that Firefox was now set as the default for .HTM, .HTML, .HTTP, and .HTTPS files. Edge was still listed for .PDF, .SHTML, .SVG, .XHT, and .XHTML files. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Firefox default wizard switches some — but not all — of the browser file settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aOxLw8O3ehIDvA7Wfp9CIs56Yy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910128/Screenshot__92_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Firefox default wizard switches some — but not all — of the browser file settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="45S2Ao"&gt;One more thing: if you do open Edge for any reason, you will get the expected pop-up urging you to return to “recommended browser settings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5F9mA7"&gt;That won’t solve everything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QXShIl"&gt;But wait — there’s more. Even after you switch your browser default to something other than Edge, you’re still going to get Edge as the favored browser for a number of Windows apps. For example, bring up Windows 11’s new Widget pane (by clicking on the Widgets icon in your taskbar, the one that looks like a two-paned window), and click on one of the news items that appear there — and the link will open Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqLu97"&gt;If you find that irritating, there may be an app for that. In order to open Edge-specific links, you need to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eamg7s"&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Apps &amp;gt; Default Apps.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VY8eCQ"&gt;Scroll down to the bottom until you see “Choose defaults by link type.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ntL2zm"&gt;Click on that and then in the search box labeled “Set defaults for link types,” type “Edge.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EqSQxy"&gt;Under the label “Microsoft-Edge, you’ll see “Microsoft Edge.” Click on that, and you’ll see any other browsers that you can use to open those specialized links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="F300zK"&gt;Interestingly, if you install Chrome or Firefox, you won’t see them as choices. But if you install the Brave browser, you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; see it as an option — and if you select that, then whenever you click on a news link in the Widget pane, it will come up in Brave.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can set the Brave browser to open widget links." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HFKfj0oIvaoVtculNxl-nRcJ45g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22914500/Screenshot__10_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can set the Brave browser to open widget links.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YbkyaH"&gt;Another possibility is a tool called &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://github.com/da2x/EdgeDeflector/releases__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!KHujXED3SAH_FmrceqCzfq5hw3Xh54E0ZdSm2Q5xOfzrPpANG2SsodlCDiWcWe09xHc-FNSm%24"&gt;EdgeDeflector&lt;/a&gt; that was originally created to intercept any links in Windows 10 that were Edge-specific and rewrite them on the fly so that they can be opened by the default web browser. I did a little browsing and read that its latest version, v1.2.3.0, would work with Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42C5rv"&gt;I installed and &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.daniel.priv.no/tools/edgedeflector/post-install.html__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!KHujXED3SAH_FmrceqCzfq5hw3Xh54E0ZdSm2Q5xOfzrPpANG2SsodlCDiWcWe09xGOdR8WW%24"&gt;followed the directions for setup&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, while that worked for most links, when I clicked on a link from the news sources in the Widgets pane, it didn’t quite work — the link opened in Chrome, but none of the graphics came through. I’d keep an eye on this app, though...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eY2vh8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 8th, 2021, 1:10PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; What happens when some browsers offer to switch your defaults has been clarified.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QM9NWC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 10th, 2021, 10:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to include directions for allowing the Brave browser to open certain specialized Windows links.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SNL’s take on the Facebook whistleblower hearing reminds us of the good old MySpace days</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OwXL28eMOBiKwEylxuqNtGvbcO0=/221x0:1613x928/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69976641/tom_from_myspace_snl.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwUkFly-xQU&amp;amp;ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive" target="_blank"&gt;NBC/SNL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SE2ZfP"&gt;Last week Saturday Night Live poked fun at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707112/snl-says-what-we-were-all-thinking-billionaire-star-trek-bezos-musk-branson-spacex-blue-origin"&gt;Jeff Bezos and the billionaire space race&lt;/a&gt;, and this week it took aim at the senators who conducted this week’s Facebook whistleblower hearing, portraying them as mostly confused by the social media platform, and the memes they found online (or “mem-ays” as Aidy Bryant’s Ted Cruz pronounces it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxzsJS"&gt;Cecily Strong reprises her role as Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who asks Heidi Gardner’s Frances Haugen about an&lt;em&gt; Animorphs&lt;/em&gt; post, and Kyle Mooney as Sen. John Kennedy asks about Facebook’s algorithm: “do you have it with you now?” while proudly showing off his Jitterbug flip phone (aw).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIVJE0"&gt;Bryant as Sen. Cruz asks whether posts that say “Ted Cruz sucks” should be flagged as misinformation, to which “Haugen” answers that it’s not really misinformation, just one person’s opinion. “Wellll, more than one person,” Bryant’s Cruz replies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1Z2ml"&gt;The biggest laugh of the sketch came when the “hearing” introduced a video statement from “the OG social media king” — Pete Davidson as Tom Anderson of MySpace. “Remember me? I was harmless! I’m not doing any of that weird algorithm stuff— we barely maintained the website,” he said, inviting people to “come on by and check out your friend’s band from 20 years ago.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDslOp"&gt;We did not know how good we had it, Tom. (And yes &lt;a href="http://myspace.com"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; is still around, no, I could not remember my username).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SGGOky"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="da" dir="ltr"&gt;The OG social media king &lt;a href="https://t.co/2OQm1LXGq0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2OQm1LXGq0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1447050032071458819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fUnuAS"&gt;The real Haugen, a former Facebook product manager at Facebook, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;testified before Congress&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday about a trove of internal documents she provided to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. The hearing was focused on Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;internal research that showed Instagram can have a negative effect on young people&lt;/a&gt;. Haugen said during the hearing that Facebook’s need for engagement in order to sell ads meant it kept users on the site even when the company knew the users were engaging with harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2YeJS"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113961365418581"&gt;post on his own Facebook&lt;/a&gt; page. CEO Mark Zuckerberg disputed that characterization, calling it “illogical” that the company would push content that makes people angry just to turn a profit. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Musk says Tesla will begin production at its German Gigafactory by the end of the year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Open House at the Tesla Gigafactory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_8BH34KylkpUPLWfqhbXBNac9FM=/0x64:4230x2884/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69976451/1235786773.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Elon Musk appeared at the Tesla Gigafactory in Germany on Saturday. The first vehicles are due to roll off the production line there by the end of 2021. | Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QNsfg3"&gt;Elon Musk said during an open house at Tesla’s new Gigafactory near Berlin this weekend that the company is aiming to  begin production of its Model Y cars there before the end of the year. And the CEO added he’s hoping the plant will be producing between 5,000 and 10,000 vehicles weekly by the end of 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-08/musk-s-plane-takes-off-to-berlin-ahead-of-tesla-plant-party"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. But Tesla is still waiting for final approval for the plant, as &lt;a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211009-tesla-holds-giga-fest-at-disputed-german-factory"&gt;local authorities evaluate&lt;/a&gt; its environmental impact on the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6LWCO"&gt;Tesla held a “&lt;a href="https://giga-fest.com/faq/"&gt;Giga-Fest&lt;/a&gt;” county fair style event in Gruenheide near the Gigafactory on Saturday, which included music, rides, and food trucks along with tours of the new plant for local residents. Tesla’s German Gigafactory is in the final phases of construction, after being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/17/21140666/tesla-gigafactory-4-berlin-gruenheide-environmental-protest-pause"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt; several times by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/business/tesla-german-gigafactory-delay.html"&gt;complaints&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146770/tesla-berlin-gigafactory-tree-felling-work-continues-environmental-concerns"&gt;environmental groups in the area&lt;/a&gt; concerned about the factory’s water use and disruption to wildlife. Musk said Saturday that Tesla would plant more trees than it cut down during construction and use as little water as possible at the factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXEtVC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961812/elon-musk-berlin-tesla-ceo-fourth-gigafactory-construction"&gt;Musk first announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla would locate its European &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/11/30/18118451/tesla-gigafactory-nevada-video-elon-musk-jobs-model-3"&gt;Gigafactory&lt;/a&gt;— which he’s referred to as a “machine that builds the machine”— in Germany. The company said it aims to produce as many as 500,000 cars a year and have 12,000 employees at the plant. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 6 leak teases Magic Eraser feature, plus five years of Android security updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 (top) and Pixel 6 Pro (bottom)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pJ3qw9qBEwqt_izogsA4VR5JuMQ=/0x1364:4500x4364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69974319/Google_Pixel_6_Pro_Google_Pixel_6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Google Pixel 6 (top) and Pixel 6 Pro (bottom) | Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fA13dV"&gt;New leaks from a marketing site appear to confirm that the camera for the Pixel 6 will have a new Magic Eraser feature, and the devices will apparently get five years of Android security updates (h/t &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/09/pixel-6-magic-eraser-camera-features/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5 Google)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAMizQ"&gt;According to reliable leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446843190892453889?s=21"&gt;Evan Blass, the Carphone Warehouse website&lt;/a&gt; was showing images of Google marketing materials for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro (the images have since been taken down, but you can view the earlier versions of the Carphone Warehouse pages on the Wayback Machine &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211009124417/https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/google/pixel6-river-content.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211009124928/https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/google/pixel6-pro-river-content.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Screenshots show the description for the previously leaked Magic Eraser, which will apparently be linked to Google Photos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AW8juw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magic Eraser makes distractions disappear with a few taps. Remove strangers and unwanted objects in Google Photos, so the people and places that you capture remain the true stars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UQqO77"&gt;Much of what is in the latest photos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714141/google-pixel-6-pro-marketing-images-leak-evleaks-wireless-charger-face-unlock"&gt;has been leaked&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;confirmed already&lt;/a&gt;; the Pixel 6 camera will have a 50MP main sensor and a 12MP ultrawide lens, and the Pixel 6 Pro will have a 48MP telephoto lens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="H22CiN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"This is the Pixel 6","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cczVQ3"&gt;And as &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pro-five-years-android-updates-134435892.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget &lt;/em&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;, some of the copy on the leaked images (in the tiny, tiny fine print) references “Android security updates for at least five years from when the device first became available on the Google Store in the US.” That would mean Pixel 6 devices would have protection into 2026. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmPZaA"&gt;Google did get ahead of some of this year’s leaks with early announcements about the Pixel 6 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686534/google-pixel-6-pro-leak-display-screen-video"&gt;the Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, including hints about its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676099/google-pixel-6-tensor-processor-rumor-arm-cortex-x1-core-mystery-strange"&gt;Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt;. The company will hold its traditional &lt;a href="https://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/"&gt;autumn hardware event&lt;/a&gt; on October 19th, where it will “officially introduce” the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boeing Starliner test flight delayed until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Boeing Orbital Flight Test-2 Prelaunch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P1ARKh_uUMVX0k1z08p2l3HfReY=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69974010/1234298178.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A test flight for Boeing’s Starliner has been pushed back to 2022 | NASA/Joel Kowsky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ItzWo7"&gt;NASA has officially &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2021/10/08/nasa-boeing-update-starliner-orbital-flight-test-2-status/"&gt;pushed back the launch&lt;/a&gt; of its Orbital Flight-Test 2 until next year, as it continues to work on an oxidizer isolation valve issue on Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, the agency announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jtAp5"&gt;The agency said in a &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2021/10/08/nasa-boeing-update-starliner-orbital-flight-test-2-status/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it’s continuing to assess potential launch windows for the mission: “The team currently is working toward opportunities in the first half of 2022 pending hardware readiness, the rocket manifest and space station availability,” according to the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVHnkI"&gt;Steve Stitch, manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, added that it was “a complex issue,” affecting parts of the spacecraft that aren’t easy to access, which has required “a methodical approach and sound engineering to effectively examine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyPsZU"&gt;Boeing’s Starliner is one of two vehicles designed to take passengers to and from the International Space Station as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program; SpaceX’s Crew Dragon is the other. NASA required each company to launch an uncrewed test flight, followed by a crewed test flight as part of the process. So far, Starliner has only conducted one uncrewed flight, but it suffered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21127127/boeing-starliner-spacecraft-nasa-safety-software-glitch-catastrophic"&gt;software problems&lt;/a&gt; before it could reach the ISS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6EqYt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22595730/boeing-starliner-astronaut-capsule-launch-nasa-oft2"&gt;Boeing had hoped to fly the Starliner&lt;/a&gt; without passengers over the summer in a second attempt at an uncrewed flight, but hours before liftoff the company found the problems with some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607683/boeing-starliner-technical-issue-nasa-launch-postponed"&gt;spacecraft’s propulsion valves&lt;/a&gt; and NASA scrubbed the launch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPVFXA"&gt;Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712701/nasa-boeing-starliner-astronaut-assignment-nicole-mann-josh-cassada-spacex-dragon"&gt;NASA announced it was reassigning two astronauts&lt;/a&gt; who were supposed to fly on upcoming Starliner flights to an upcoming SpaceX flight instead. Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada will fly on the fifth crewed SpaceX mission to the International Space Station, currently scheduled for autumn 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="QhjOKD"&gt;Tesla has delayed the rollout of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta 10.2 software rollout because of last-minute concerns, CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1446752265012908032"&gt;Elon Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt; early Saturday. He apologized for the delay, saying the release would likely happen Sunday or Monday. He didn’t elaborate on what the “concerns” were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g5kbkY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A few last minute concerns about this build. Release likely on Sunday or Monday. Sorry for the delay.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1446752265012908032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jp6gGh"&gt;The software was supposed to roll out Friday to about 1,000 Tesla owners with perfect safety scores of 100 —as determined by the automaker— with a gradual rollout for those with scores at 99 and below after that, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1446104772092772352?s=20"&gt;according to Musk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZWVld"&gt;Tesla has been testing the beta version of its FSD software for about a year, and despite the head of the National Transportation Safety Board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682272/ntsb-official-tesla-safety-elon-musk-full-self-driving"&gt;expressing serious concerns about the software’s safety&lt;/a&gt;, the carmaker began expanding FSD access to more drivers last month. Before a Tesla driver gets access to FSD, however, the company &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/safety-score"&gt;determines their “safety score,”&lt;/a&gt; using criteria that evaluate “the likelihood that your driving could result in a future collision.” The score is tabulated using data collected by sensors in the driver’s Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dF5V6n"&gt;The company has required owners who opt in to the FSD beta to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696463/tesla-fsd-beta-nda-video-clips-controversy-full-self-driving"&gt;sign non-disclosure agreements&lt;/a&gt;, and asked that they refrain from sharing video clips online of the system’s mistakes. To reiterate: the FSD software doesn’t make Teslas fully autonomous; Musk himself has said he thinks the “feature complete” version of the software will only be “&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/01/13/tesla-full-self-driving-feature-complete-soon-elon-musk/#:~:text=When%20Musk%20talks%20about%20a,features%20with%20city%20driving%20capability.&amp;amp;text=So%20feature-complete%20means%20it's,it%20would%20still%20be%20supervised."&gt;likely&lt;/a&gt;” to drive someone from their home to work without human intervention and will still require supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXoFAT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to work with the Windows 11 Widget panel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/694f7SWBn0F7wuLDbff8nsj9vK8=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69973224/Screenshot__89_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O6KHvb"&gt;Windows 11 has introduced a brand new Widgets panel, where you can access a variety of updated information using configurable topic boxes (what Microsoft calls information cards). It’s made up of two sections: a top section that offers widgets for weather, sports, your latest photos, and other personalized topics, and a news section that offers clickable headlines from a variety of sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STPP33"&gt;Here’s how to make the most of the current Windows 11 widgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2vfZgW"&gt;Access your widgets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OGVhCa"&gt;To access the widgets, select the Widgets icon in the taskbar (it’s the one that looks like a square divided into white and blue sections). You can also hit the Window + W keys or, if you’ve got a touchscreen, swipe from the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yZhWf"&gt;You’ll probably see a variety of starter widgets on top that will give you info about sports scores, the weather, stock prices, and any images you may have in your OneDrive account. There is also a search field and a button that lets you add new widgets. Under that, you can scroll down to find a number of news sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HjryVg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Windows 11 review: a familiar home that’s still being renovated","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="4KQZpC"&gt;Adjust your widgets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PtemlK"&gt;There are a variety of ways you can tweak your widget panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HF6dUr"&gt;To move your widgets around, long-press on the top of a widget until you see an open hand. (This is as opposed to a “pointing” hand, which enables you to click on a link.) You can then change its position on the panel. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BfwkKR"&gt;To change the size of a widget, remove it from your panel, or customize it, click on the three dots in the upper right corner. The selections that you see will depend on the widget; for example, the Weather widget can be small, medium, or large, and you can customize it to set a default location and work either in Fahrenheit or Celsius. The Photos app, meanwhile, only sizes to medium or large and has no other customizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The three “More” dots let you adjust the size of the widget, customize it, or remove it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8_eGprXR_MNm7yjYogaPmFfDPmY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910889/Screenshot__90_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The three “More” dots let you adjust the size of the widget, customize it, or remove it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HTlFhG"&gt;Click on the name of the widget in the upper left corner, and you will be taken to a separate page where you can access more information — more details on the weather, for example, or more of the latest sports scores. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FppMZ8"&gt;If you want to see the current selection of widgets available, click on the “Add widgets” button that is between your widgets and the news feeds. It’s not a large list right now — I counted 11, all available are Microsoft-produced. Hopefully, however, there will be additional third-party entries coming. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Windows 11 doesn’t yet have a great many widgets, but that may change." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZHPqOBaOByV3qSk_2fR3hhDz59M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910910/Screenshot__9_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 doesn’t yet have a great many widgets, but that may change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kolIrB"&gt;News feed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UeemFV"&gt;The news section is below the “Add widgets” button. It is headed by a “Top stories” section that highlights several headlines, followed by individual stories. Both come with Facebook-like icons that you can attach to each story (including thumbs-up, heart, “surprised,” “thinking,” sad, or angry). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can “react” to each news item with an appropriate mood icon." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/74_KpSX9IOcV4UPgGXQBnIm4A6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910959/Screenshot__93_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can “react” to each news item with an appropriate mood icon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fYZnGF"&gt;Select the three dots next to each headline, and you can see more or fewer stories like that, hide stories from that source, save it for later (in other words, bookmark it), or report it. Any bookmarked stories will have a gray square around those three dots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aYpbBm"&gt;Personalize your interests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0WE0nQ"&gt;The “Add widgets” button also offers a link (in the lower-left corner) that lets you tell the Widget app what you are and are not interested in. (You can get to the same place by clicking on the three dots next to a news story and select “Manage interests.”)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can influence what shows up in your news feed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AJznWtaiHWWCRkbXGegL6CRbyOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910915/Screenshot__96_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can influence what shows up in your news feed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7MuwLr"&gt;Either way, you’ll end up on the Microsoft Start page — essentially, the settings page for the Edge browser. Using the “My Interests” tab, you can tell Windows what types of news stories you want or don’t want. On the left side of the page, you can choose from categories such as News, Sports, Travel, Health, etc.; as you click on each of those categories, you’ll get a list of specific topics in the main window. For example, if you select “Entertainment,” you can choose from topics such as “Celebrities,” “Music,” or “Books,” among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8v3s9"&gt;Other tabs you can choose from include “Profile” (which introduces you to what is called the “Microsoft News Community”), “My Saves” (any stories you saved), “History” (a list of stories you’ve read within the last 48 hours), and “Experience Settings.” You may want to visit this last: it lets you choose the language of your feed (the default is English) or toggle several features on and off, including those Facebook-like reaction icons. You can also toggle off some of the basic information cards, such as finance or weather.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you’re not in the mood for community reactions, you can remove them." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nD4ZpdeGpaLpiMbq3hBWMIeKZt0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910923/Screenshot__98_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re not in the mood for community reactions, you can remove them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oR0nT0"&gt;Currently, the Windows 11 widgets seem to be more of a curiosity or a way to take a quick break than a real tool. However, if and when third-party widgets become available, the widget pane could become truly useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkpwuP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
