    <title>Avatar passes Avengers: Endgame to retake box office crown after China re-release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Avatar" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FPJo7huwKRJBPGbAHcpiSZfy-eY=/64x0:1977x1275/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68960103/avatar16.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: 20th Century Fox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gu0U24"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; has once again retaken its crown as the most lucrative movie of all time, with James Cameron’s 2009 film reaching a new all-time box office high to beat out 2019’s &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/21/20702651/avengers-endgame-avatar-biggest-movie-box-office-comic-con-phase-4"&gt;which took the top spot&lt;/a&gt; with its $2.7902 billion take that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SdmW3"&gt;But thanks to a re-release of Avatar in China, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/avatar-overtakes-avengers-endgame-highest-grossing-film-all-time-worldwide-box-office-china-james-cameron-disney-1234713788/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reports that &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has already grossed enough to push its box office total to $2.798 billion, which edges out Earth’s Mightiest Heroes once again for largest worldwide total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fksJCi"&gt;The surge in &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; ticket sales comes as China theaters are re-opening in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen a rush of theatergoers eager to return to theaters. And seeing as most major Western film studios have yet to release new titles (given that most of the world has very limited theatrical capacity still), that leaves plenty of room to re-release popular titles like &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; in the meantime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xM9yy"&gt;With the rest of the weekend’s box office still ahead of it, it’s all but guaranteed that Avatar will continue to pad out its lead over &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt; over the next several days. It’s the latest development in the ongoing (and slightly petty) fight for the all-time box office record. Back when &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt; was in theaters, Disney worked overtime to ensure it would take the top spot, re-releasing the film several weeks after its initial run with promises of an additional deleted scene to drive the numbers up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANrS9m"&gt;It’s also possible that &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt; might retake its crown: Disney has ben known to put its Marvel films back in theaters as part of marathons or fan events before major new entries come out. So it’s entirely possible that &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt; could return to theaters to make a run at Avatar’s new record in the future — especially if US theaters adopt a similar strategy of re-releasing big past hits to help juice the return to theaters post-COVID over the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNb6ZJ"&gt;Of course, the real winner here is, as usual the Walt Disney Company. With Disney having bought 20th Century Fox (and with it, the &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;films) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273142/disney-fox-acquistion-final-hulu-marvel-streaming-21st-century"&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the company will hold the &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW"&gt;top box office spot&lt;/a&gt; whether &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; ends up on top. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s PlayStation 5 is restocked at Best Buy [UPDATE: Sold Out]</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RSnjJZxFfPXIwiMIsDuSRqZe4nI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68957792/vpavic_4278_20201030_0073.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lYCYSU"&gt;If you missed Target’s PS5 restocks Thursday, you may be in luck. Best Buy has the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053780700716864#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053639217049019#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; models up for purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJwFGh"&gt;According to the product listing, Best Buy will only allow you to pick up your newly purchased PS5 at a local Best Buy store. No home delivery is available for either model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YgwrHO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Rd70W"&gt;Once you get your hands on a PS5, there are a few items you’re going to want to pick up for your console. Some of the most popular PS5 exclusives right now include &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demons-Souls-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC5TTBF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Bluepoint Games and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marvels-Spider-Man-Miles-Morales-Launch-PlayStation/dp/B08FC66ZV4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9Z9TQT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568461"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yh2iyW"&gt;If you plan to play local co-op with family or friends, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723570939328512577" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an extra DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt; might also be a good item to pick up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXm507"&gt;One thing I also recommend buying is &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a one-year membership to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;, as the perks of having a subscription are great for PS5 users. Most notably, it nets you access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, an exclusive perk for PS5 owners, that provides access to “generation-defining” titles that released on the console’s predecessor, like &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xtdOUI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6gezA1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P5Bi9M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A hacker who exposed Verkada’s surveillance camera snafu has been raided </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SF security camera privacy stock 1024" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LC_LNv6hJfokUGNWDxoUlHaXTuY=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68959188/2012-03-23_13-44-49-1024.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cZ0kIt"&gt;Tillie Kottmann, a 21-year-old hacker, has been raided by Swiss authorities and their devices seized, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-12/swiss-police-raid-apartment-of-verkada-hacker-seize-devices?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; — days after helping to reveal how Silicon Valley security startup Verkada’s &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; security was so poor that that hackers were able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22322122/verkada-hack-150000-security-cameras-tesla-factory-cloudflare-jails-hospitals"&gt;access over 150,000 of the company’s cameras&lt;/a&gt; to see the insides of schools, jails, hospitals, police stations, and Tesla factories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JruO5P"&gt;The raid doesn’t have anything to do with Verkada, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, but instead an “alleged hack that took place last year,” and interestingly, a Swiss authority pointed &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; to the US Department of Justice for further questions. (The DOJ declined to comment.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FG2xVf"&gt;It’s not clear which hack the DOJ might be interested in, as Kottmann has been &lt;em&gt;continually&lt;/em&gt; sharing leaked files from various companies for months, but one sticks out as likely: Kottmann &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/intel-leak-20gb-of-source-code-internal-docs-from-alleged-breach/"&gt;leaked a huge collection of secret documents and source code from chipmaker Intel last year&lt;/a&gt;, and Intel vowed to investigate. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says it’s seen the search warrant, which mentions that the FBI was looking into the “theft and distribution of information including source code, confidential documents and internal user data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUqwRg"&gt;As of Friday evening, Kottmann’s GitLab repository, which catalogued quite a few leaks, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ArtemR/status/1370594578391212035"&gt;appears to have been seized&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lr0Td5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;That was fast. &lt;a href="https://t.co/blLegD5z37"&gt;https://t.co/blLegD5z37&lt;/a&gt; already seized by the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheJusticeDept?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TheJusticeDept&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FBI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FBI&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/xYQf2oQOa6"&gt;https://t.co/xYQf2oQOa6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/JJAVgLUN9c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JJAVgLUN9c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Artem Russakovskii (@ArtemR) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ArtemR/status/1370594578391212035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I5uPKT"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XBvo3E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Another Twitter suspension, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SEu3e1"&gt;Kottmann has suggested in the past that they’ve been unfairly targeted for ethical hacking, particularly by Twitter, which suddenly chose to enforce its rules on ban dodging by suspending &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deletescape"&gt;Kottmann’s account&lt;/a&gt; just a few days after the Intel leak in August 2020. Twitter originally suspended Kottmann for “distribution of hacked material” last June, according to screenshots they shared with me last year, and Twitter confirmed the second suspension was for violating the platform manipulation and spam policy that keeps users from dodging their bans by simply creating a new account. Following the Verkada disclosures, Twitter suspended &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nyancrimew"&gt;Kottmann’s most recent account&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxwjP3"&gt;With leaks like Intel’s, though, Kottmann didn’t just pass along documents to journalists or disclose security holes to companies; they pointed anyone to the hacked material. While you could argue that’s also how we get many new product leaks, source code hacks are usually taken more seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xya0ix"&gt;Either way, it’s leading some hacktivists to question platforms’ decisions to deplatform hackers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v2Uoux"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Why is Twitter so hostile to hacktivists? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Especially considering &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dotMudge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@dotMudge&lt;/a&gt;, whose FORMER glory days include being member of Cult of the Dead Cow, who some claim are responsible for giving us the word 'hacktivist' is their current Chief Information Security Officer? &lt;a href="https://t.co/yPIIvq9xYO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yPIIvq9xYO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— punished donk (@donk_enby) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1370270061886377985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i8d3be"&gt;(Hacker donk_enby, above, was the one who scraped &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/01/parlers-amateur-coding-could-come-back-to-haunt-capitol-hill-rioters/"&gt;80 terabytes of videos from Parler&lt;/a&gt;, videos which were later extensively used to reveal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/18/22236750/propublica-parler-capitol-riot-videos-timeline-resource"&gt;what actually occurred during the Capitol Riot&lt;/a&gt;, including as evidence in Trump’s second impeachment trial.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2935v"&gt;It may be a difficult line for platforms to draw. Yesterday, Microsoft-owned GitHub &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vpaz/researcher-publishes-code-to-exploit-microsoft-exchange-vulnerabilities-on-github"&gt;decided to take down a security researcher’s work&lt;/a&gt; that could have reflected poorly on Microsoft, because the proof-of-concept exploited the holes in Microsoft Exchange Server’s code that were used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319934/microsoft-hafnium-hack-exchange-server-email-flaw-white-house"&gt;in the huge Hafnium hack&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft’s argument was that the attack is still occurring and that the code could still be exploited, which does make sense on its face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rA6bKk"&gt;Kottmann (or, at least, someone using an account connected to a recently valid username of Kottmann’s, I’m still trying to confirm) declined to comment on the raid, saying that their previous statements had already resulted in Swiss press harassing their family. Kottmann told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that their parents’ home was searched by Swiss police as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhKoLg"&gt;Kottmann also seems to still have access to a Mastodon account, one that’s currently warning readers to “assume all past communication with me to have been compromised” and “under US control.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KNpQU"&gt;“do not talk to me about any illegal activities or crimes. i do not plan on doing anything illegal for the near future,” reads &lt;a href="https://notbird.site/@deletescape/105877342103653734"&gt;the current pinned post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUzOGq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 13th, 1:13AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Git.rip has apparently been seized by the FBI and DOJ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple discontinues the HomePod, but the HomePod mini will live on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="top of the homepod" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/174-vKAIGR1bUhYwRdDez8RQFhI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68959072/jbareham_180202_2266_0178.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dRK1FF"&gt;Apple is discontinuing the original, full-size HomePod and will now focus its speaker efforts on the HomePod mini, the company told &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-will-focus-on-mini/?tpcc=ECTW2020&amp;amp;guccounter=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; on Friday evening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ETn8m"&gt;Here is what Apple said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OSuvgh"&gt;HomePod mini has been a hit since its debut last fall, offering customers amazing sound, an intelligent assistant, and smart home control all for just $99. We are focusing our efforts on HomePod mini. We are discontinuing the original HomePod, it will continue to be available while supplies last through the Apple Online Store, Apple Retail Stores, and Apple Authorized Resellers. Apple will provide HomePod customers with software updates and service and support through Apple Care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hB7LYG"&gt;The Space Grey model of the full-size HomePod is already sold out on Apple’s online store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTNVVt"&gt;The full-size HomePod had great sound quality, but it was criticized for its high $349 price tag &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16976906/apple-homepod-review-smart-speaker"&gt;at launch&lt;/a&gt;. Apple eventually dropped the price to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295084/apple-homepod-price-cut-299-smart-speaker"&gt;$299 in April 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and came out with the $99 HomePod mini last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hmf5RK"&gt;The move isn’t altogether surprising; sales of the HomePod have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17366778/apple-homepod-sales-estimate-600-thousand-units-smart-speaker"&gt;reportedly been low&lt;/a&gt;, and in our review, we felt that the HomePod mini &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;offered good sound&lt;/a&gt; for its size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpyaZy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack will soon respect your chosen skin tone color when you smash that emoji reaction</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K-Y6zW4pM4v-ey9Ehhh7nz4i9E0=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68959001/VRG_ILLO_4148_003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EZ9AMA"&gt;Many of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; are big fans of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368287/emoji-reactions-discussion-conversation-instagram-imessage"&gt;emoji reactions&lt;/a&gt; in Slack, and today we noticed that our newsroom’s Slack now groups emoji reactions with different skin tones into one mass reaction. The feature is now rolling out to everyone, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWGmG5"&gt;Here’s how it works. Let’s say that your colleague dropped a Simpsons-yellow &lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/flexed-biceps/"&gt;Flexed Biceps emoji&lt;/a&gt; on a Slack message celebrating someone’s huge accomplishment. If your default skin tone for emoji in Slack is a dark skin tone, and you mash that Simpsons-yellow Flexed Biceps emoji reaction, a dark skin tone emoji will show up alongside the yellow one &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your reaction will be added to the total count. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vo2zyM"&gt;My editors have allowed me to post this highly secretive message from our internal Slack so you can get an idea of how the grouped emoji reactions look like in practice: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-SuI4QP38gIOCcHT-ggcfIs2Z4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366917/Screen_Shot_2021_03_12_at_5.02.28_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x5bZ2j"&gt;I’ve seen emoji reaction groups today with four different skin tones represented, so the feature presumably can group all six of the skin tone options available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="im4m0I"&gt;This small change is a huge boon for inclusivity, in my opinion. Now, instead of having to pick between clicking an emoji reaction that doesn’t match your preferred skin tone or adding a new one that better represents you, you can just punch an emoji reaction, no matter the skin tones that are already there, and know that you’ll see yourself represented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNAge5"&gt;“We believe the future of work must be inclusive as it is critical to our success and that of our customers,” Slack said in a statement. “This update to how emoji appear under messages is part of our ongoing effort to help our customers express themselves in ways that feel most authentic to their experience. Diversity, engagement and belonging are core to our company values and we are committed to ensuring that our product reflects that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why game developers can’t get a handle on doors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2EZJhmcMbq2Jgkg_jNQbkVHJqX8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68958370/Nightmare8.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the simplest objects are the most difficult to design&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uhuS5I"&gt;The best kind of door in a video game is the one no one remembers. Sure, everyone can appreciate a big, beautiful door with great animations, says Owlchemy Labs developer Pete Galbraith. But in a video game, doors are often synonymous with a massive design headache. Forgettable means a developer has done their job well. “If it fits into the environment, makes sense for its context, and works exactly how the player expects, then in that instant it was simply a door as real as any other in the player’s real life,” says Galbraith. “I can’t imagine higher praise for a door in a game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tl9NrY"&gt;Over the past week, dozens of developers across multiple disciplines and teams shared their frustrations on Twitter. &lt;em&gt;Death Trash&lt;/em&gt; creator &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/talecrafter/status/1369153361270935554"&gt;Stephan Hövelbrinks&lt;/a&gt; explained that doors “have all sorts of possible bugs.” &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt; co-game director &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kurtmargenau/status/1369347886308265985"&gt;Kurt Margenau&lt;/a&gt; called it “the thing that took the longest to get right.” How doors work is different during “combat tension,” when players are mid-encounter, vs. not, for example: doors slowly close automatically during combat, but remain open during exploration. “If a player is going to open a door, it can’t just magically fly open, the character has to reach to the doorknob and push it open,” Margenau explained in one tweet. “But what about closing it behind you? How do you do that while sprinting?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NjWWdd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If a door hits an NPC, does the door stop, or does the NPC move? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oC4EiR"&gt;Doors aren’t the only ordinary object developers struggle with. Developers &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke to point to objects like ropes or mirror. After&lt;em&gt; Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;’s release, one developer on the project spoke at length about how they managed to make the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2021/1/6/22213232/half-life-alyx-liquid-bottle-shaders"&gt;bottles of booze&lt;/a&gt; look so realistic. Designer Liz England points to ladders, elevators, and moving platforms as well. “I think doors themselves tend to get a much bigger reputation for being terrible because they are (1) so much more common in the real world (I use doors every single day!), and (2) are much more common, then, in games, so more people can use it as a touchstone for ‘unexpectedly difficult interactivity,’” England tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I’ve never had to implement a mirror or a rope, but I have had my fair share of doors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZTbU5"&gt;A door isn’t exactly mankind’s best or even smartest invention in the real world. It’s a comically simple concept — open big rectangle for entry or exit — that in development becomes a team-wide problem. As Crystal Dynamics game director Will Kerslake put it in a message to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, there are “so many issues with doors.” In one example, touching specifically on animation, Kerslake explained that doors can open toward or away from you; handles can be on either side. “If you can engage with that door from different states, like crouch or sprinting, then that’s an additional set of animations,” he says. “A door you pull open, requires you to back up in the real world to step out of the way, that’s another set of issues. In a first-person game you can animate the door and not the player, and this is easier. In a high-fidelity third-person game there is an expectation that the player’s hand will move to the handle.” And the players’ location and angle when they engage with any door can and will vary.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ce7fdr"&gt;Other problems might involve several players all scrabbling for a door at the same time, or even non-player characters. If a door hits an NPC, does the door stop, or does the NPC move? “The choices here can cause all kinds of bugs depending on your game,” says Kerslake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ODhig"&gt;It’s not that making doors in a video game is an impossible task. For some developers, it’s just not worth the trouble. “As a result many games avoid doors in gameplay, you’d be surprised at how many games don’t have interactive doors at all,” says Keslake. “Lots of doorways, but the important doors are missing or already open. The next step up in complexity is doors used only as progress gates, they open only and then can’t be closed again.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="p68urt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“you’d be surprised at how many games don’t have interactive doors at all”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WTWLaz"&gt;Technical points, of which there are many, set aside, how players process the digital representation of a door matters. Everyone knows how a door works and therefore has a subconscious understanding and expectation of how they move, sound, look. The level of accuracy needed for a player to believe the door is a door is higher for a common object than a fantasy one, says Galbraith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2rBrG"&gt;“Our ideas of how we interact with them are incredibly clear due to the cognitive reinforcement we have received from interacting with them so often in a variety of different ways. For doors like the ones in our homes, we subconsciously learn the minute details of how they act, such as the rate at which they close or how much we can move them while they are locked. So when we see a door in a game that closes too fast or without friction or when there’s a locked door where the handle doesn’t jiggle and make a sound we’ll notice that something isn’t quite right about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mt5KKl"&gt;You can still fib it a little. While most doors only go in one direction, for example, game doors will often swing either way. “When these sorts of virtual doors look, sound, and behave like regular doors, then they hit a level of mental acceptance with the player that allows the player to continue without questioning why every door in the game just so happens to open away from them,” Galbraith says. “To them it’s just a weird coincidence that the brain subconsciously chooses to ignore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SONY7S"&gt;Doors aren’t just an aesthetic or immersion technique in video games; often they serve as part of level design. They’re gates that keep players from moving on until they’ve finished a puzzle or beaten a boss; they can act as markers for the player’s progress, build tension, or act as cover. “Doors are just one of a variety of tools that a developer can use when designing levels,” Galbraith says. “Many games employ other methods alongside doors to avoid potential issues and even just to help vary the content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2ZZ1NI"&gt;With one exception: “Unless the door was really tiny and cute, in which case then it’s just a-door-able!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1heEeM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some Bethesda games now on Xbox Game Pass are getting frame rate boosts on Xbox Series X/S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Xbox logo (a white sphere with an X through it) against a dark green background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4FQiXBZhmiC2FLvEWKeMGoiAaPA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68958201/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ea9XbM"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass platform just got a huge boost with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325044/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-bethesda-games-list"&gt;addition of 20 new Bethesda Softworks titles&lt;/a&gt; starting today, and now a quarter of those games will be getting performance boosts on the next-gen Xbox consoles in an upcoming update. The performance gains are in frame rate thanks to an appropriately named &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287001/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-fps-boost-feature-games"&gt;new feature Microsoft revealed last month called FPS Boost&lt;/a&gt;, which can roughly double frame rates of older games using new Xbox hardware without requiring developers do any manual work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqMm8P"&gt;The games that will see performance boosts with frame rate jumps up to 60 frames per second include Arkane Studios’ &lt;em&gt;Dishonored: Definitive Edition &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Prey&lt;/em&gt; and Bethesda Game Studios’ &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fallout 4&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Fallout 76. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WCgbG4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SzJxrUXnadU?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=881&amp;amp;start=881" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zUXwqW"&gt;The announcement was made during a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzJxrUXnadU&amp;amp;t=881s"&gt;YouTube live stream on Friday&lt;/a&gt; between Xbox Live programming director Larry Hryb (aka “Major Nelson”) and comms chief Jeff Rubenstein, in which Rubenstein discussed the benefits the new Xbox Series X/S can bring to older Bethesda titles. The games, while available now, don’t yet have the FPS Boost mode enabled currently, but Microsoft intends to add it as an optional toggle some time soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8Wqi9"&gt;Microsoft said in its announcement yesterday that “a handful of these games will also benefit from FPS Boost on Xbox Series X / S,” though it did not specify which at the time. it also said 16 of the 20 Bethesda games coming to Xbox Game Pass would be available across PC and xCloud in addition to Xbox consoles. You can find a list of which platforms which games are available on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325044/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-bethesda-games-list"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bitwarden adds secure text and file transfer to its arsenal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FVY_HlCtM-mZT3TaN9V0hMaXkKs=/0x0:1866x1244/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68958019/Screen_Shot_2021_03_12_at_7.07.43_PM.5.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gUaTCq"&gt;Many current password managers allow you to share your passwords with family members or other individuals or groups. (You do use a password manager, don’t you?) Managers such as Bitwarden and 1Password have specific methods by which you can share passwords or groups of passwords, making it easier for a family to, say, access a shared streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRoOzJ"&gt;Now &lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/"&gt;Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt; has upped the ante by adding a feature it calls Send, which allows you to send files or text (including, if you wish, passwords) securely via end-to-end AES-256 bit encryption, using a link on its site. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bitwarden Send generates a link and includes a number of security options" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ImjzQK1DzlFzxetqn4wQUn0t6g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366356/Screen_Shot_2021_03_12_at_2.25.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bitwarden Send generates a link and includes a number of security options&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrZ4PX"&gt;Here’s how it works: If you wish to send a file (it can be up to 100 MB), you go to Bitwarden’s website and click on the Send button. After you upload the file, or create a text message, Send will generate a link that you can send out via email, text, or any other method you choose. When the person you send it to clicks on the link (and they don’t have to be a registered Bitwarden user), they are sent to a page where they can either view the text message or download the file.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FWSVWNcqeRtpmmr7LdLJvp1g2II=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366302/Screen_Shot_2021_03_12_at_3.20.45_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cKBlpx"&gt;But before you send out the link, there are a number of security features you can add. You can set a date and time for the file to automatically be deleted from the linked page (in other words, if you click on the link after that, you’ll be informed it’s no longer available) or for the link to expire. You can limit the number of times the file can be accessed and you can see how many times it’s been accessed so far. And finally, you can set a password for the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnNWQN"&gt;If you’re using Send to create a text message, you can also have it be hidden by default when it is accessed (so the text is not immediately readable). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eEpNB0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best free password manager","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dhI1qI"&gt;The new Send feature will be only partially available to Bitwarden’s free users. Members with free accounts will be able to use it to send text, but not files, while those with Premium and other paid memberships will be able to send both text and files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFcjWZ"&gt;Bitwarden is obviously taking full advantage of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295354/lastpass-export-delete-bitwarden-1password-zoho"&gt;recent reported exodus from LastPass&lt;/a&gt; because of the latter’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;new limitations on its free accounts&lt;/a&gt;. Since there are already a number of free services for sending encrypted files, such as &lt;a href="https://wetransfer.com/"&gt;WeTransfer&lt;/a&gt;, and since having a secure way to send information such as passwords, personal information, and account numbers can be very handy, it looks like Bitwarden has given people another good reason to switch from LastPass. The new Send feature should be available Monday, March 15th at 7 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="kFBmGr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 12th, 2021 3:55PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328023/ps5-sony-playstation-5-best-buy-restock"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Buy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; currently has both the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053780700716864#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053639217049019#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; consoles in stock and available for purchase. But you can only request a pickup at your local store and cannot have the console shipped to your home address. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="J7uq4A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony’s PlayStation 5 is restocked at Best Buy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328023/ps5-sony-playstation-5-best-buy-restock"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KMrzmx"&gt;The PlayStation 5 has been quite challenging to find ever since its launch in November. And when it is available, sales have been, for the most part, limited to online-only, with stock selling out almost instantly. Despite this, we here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; are dedicated to helping you keep track of when and where the PS5 is available in the hopes you can get another shot at buying Sony’s next-gen console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qD3Drq"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy either the PS5 (with a disc drive) or the PS5 Digital Edition, as well as any bundles that are not price surged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAoRYi"&gt;Keep in mind that due to the high demand of this console, supply will not last long, with inventory selling out typically less than an hour after being made available. Nevertheless, we’ll do our best to keep this article updated with the latest in-stock alerts and tell you when the most recent restock was available at the retailers selling the console. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="JG5DCV"&gt;Due to the pandemic, most retailers, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734517183541536443#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-console%2F-%2FA-81114596&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, will only sell the console online until further notice. We see restocks happening multiple times in the week from various retailers; most notably, we have seen frequent restocks recently appear at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053639217049019#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5%2F11108140.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in particular. If you are looking for a bundle, retailers like Antonline and Newegg are likely to sell PS5 bundles instead of the actual console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjSIu6"&gt;We have noticed that restocks for the console are more likely to happen later in the week as opposed to earlier in the week. Additionally, places like Newegg are combatting the demand for this console by doing a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fproduct-shuffle%3Fnm_mc%3DAFC-RAN-COM%26cm_mmc%3DAFC-RAN-COM%26utm_medium%3Daffiliates%26utm_source%3Dafc-Vox%2BMedia%26AFFID%3D3430747%26AFFNAME%3DVox%2BMedia%26ACRID%3D1%26ASUBID%3Dverge%26ASID%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.theverge.com%252F%26ranMID%3D44583%26ranEAID%3D3430747%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-XXgkPukHSHvtb9QuMXSZWQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg Shuffle&lt;/a&gt;, which randomly selects winners interested in buying sought-after products. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every PS5 comes with one DualSense controller, but you can use the DualShock 4 controller, but it is only limited to when you’re playing PS4 games on the next-gen console. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o3N05Q"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the PS5?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i98dsO"&gt;The PS5 includes all the basic things you need to get started (minus the games, of course). However, you might want to consider picking up additional accessories to ensure you get the most out of your brand-new console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UsvWd"&gt;First, there’s the controller. Every new PS5 includes one &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6C75Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DualSense&lt;/a&gt; controller. But there are a few benefits to owning at least one additional controller, such as if you plan to play local co-op games with a friend or family member. Or, if you are like me and want to keep playing your game but don’t want to be tethered to the charging cable, a second control lets you continue playing while the other one charges. Normally, $70, we have &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/sony-sony-ps5-dual-sense-white-sony-dual-sense-wireless" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seen the controller go down as low as $60&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MF1y0f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PwJaY2"&gt;The PS5 HD Camera is a neat accessory for people interested in using their PS5 to live-stream video games or broadcast their gameplay with friends.  It includes dual 1080p lenses and allows you to remove the background of your camera’s feed and replace it with something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XqsPQY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562900"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YyqMlw"&gt;I strongly recommend subscribing to &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; if you have not already done so; outside of taking advantage of some online gaming functionalities, PlayStation Plus provides a ton of additional incentives, most notably PS5 owners have access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital library of some of the most impactful titles to release on the PS4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SPQIiW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vVuP0t"&gt;The PS5 comes with a 825GB of available storage right now and unfortunately, there’s no way to expand the fast internal storage currently. Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;reportedly expanding the options for more SSD storage&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to store some older PS4 titles on your console so you don’t use your limited SSD storage, I strongly advise &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Playstation-Portable-External-STGD4000400/dp/B076826S5R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buying an external hard drive&lt;/a&gt; to store those titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8ULn9w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562978"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Amazon Prime Video will soon let you shuffle all the shows you’ve been meaning to binge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8WKjl8z86Ui7kSTbRMVda1MDDCk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68957807/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bR2GID"&gt;Amazon is updating its Prime Video app to include a new feature: the ability to play episodes of a show on shuffle (&lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-prime-video-getting-shuffle-button-too"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This feature could make it easier for people who just want to watch a sitcom without having to actually &lt;em&gt;pick&lt;/em&gt; an episode. Clicking the button should just start playing episodes in a random order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZA1nv"&gt;The feature seems to initially be somewhat limited though — &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/11/amazon-prime-video-app-gets-a-shuffle-button-for-tv-episodes/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t let you shuffle through the entire show, only one particular season. At the moment, it’s only been spotted on Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87ZiOt"&gt;Amazon may be trying to race Netflix to rolling out a shuffle function: according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/netflix-shuffle-play-feature-official-launch-1234888490/"&gt;Netflix has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will be rolling out a a shuffle button to users sometime in the first half of 2021. Finally, I’ll be able to be &lt;em&gt;even more confused&lt;/em&gt; trying to watch &lt;em&gt;JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2EpJR"&gt;It’s unclear whether (or if) this feature will be coming to the iOS or web versions of the app — Amazon did not immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
