    <title>Three questions that will decide Epic v. Apple</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;New filings show both sides’ legal strategies at work&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="UzO5Bd"&gt;On May 3rd, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;publisher Epic Games will finally have its day in court, forcing Apple to defend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;kicking &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt; last year. Epic’s antitrust lawsuit is bigger than a single game; it’s a direct challenge to the App Store model, the most significant legal challenge Apple has faced since the Xerox days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsUOSQ"&gt;Last night, &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/405/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/407/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/"&gt;sides&lt;/a&gt; filed a document called a “proposed findings of fact,” essentially laying out every factual claim they’ll rely on in their arguments. The documents run more than 650 pages in total, giving a detailed roadmap of how each side sees the case — from the early days of the iPhone to Epic’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493096/epic-apple-antitrust-lawsuit-fortnite-app-store-court-hearing"&gt;specific preparations for picking this fight with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. But the filings also bring the case into focus, raising three questions that will be central to the trial over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qQYdC1"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Fortnite vs Apple: App Store Royale|78038" data-volume-uuid="e322ad1d6" data-volume-id="78038" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-605" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="VW8TJd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the exclusive App Store a necessary part of iOS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="SxoDNd"&gt;The heart of the case is the so-called App Store tax — a 30 percent surcharge Apple collects on purchases made through the App Store. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was kicked off the App Store for dodging that tax by installing its own payment system, which is forbidden under App Store rules. Now, Epic is making the case in court that the rules should never have been put in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lRinUq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Legal monopolies and abuses of market power&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W88Sba"&gt;You often hear that this case is about whether the App Store is a monopoly — but Epic’s argument is more subtle than that, drawing on antitrust ideas around legal monopolies and abuses of market power. As Epic sees it, Apple’s monopoly over iOS is legal, but it’s using the market power from that monopoly to dominate the secondary market for app distribution. Epic compares the situation to Microsoft’s antitrust case in the ’90s: a legitimate monopoly over Windows, extended illegally to the secondary market in web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0MXLJ"&gt;It’s a good theory, but it only works if you see the App Store model as fundamentally separate from iOS. In its statement of facts, Apple describes the exclusive App Store as a fundamental part of the iPhone, part of the broader offering that makes the devices valuable. “Apple wanted to ensure that iOS devices were more protected from those malware and instability issues and quality issues that the PC world was used to,” Apple claims in its filing. App Store exclusivity is part of that, but so are security measures like the code-signing and hardware root-of-trust systems. On the software side, there is a range of private APIs and OS-level entitlements that are only enabled after App Store review, tying the systems that much tighter together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Jxu1g"&gt;Of course, it’s inconvenient for this argument that Google is offering a competing mobile operating system with none of these restrictions — to say nothing of Apple’s own macOS, which allows side loading. Clearly, it would be technically possible to allow competing app stores on iOS. The question is whether the court sees that as changing Apple’s business model or changing iOS itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="NQj0UK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is the iPhone different from a PlayStation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="n8lgwx"&gt;One of the biggest challenges for Epic is that the App Store model is fairly widespread. Consoles like Xbox and PlayStation operate on basically the same playbook, delivering games digitally through an open but curated digital store that’s locked to the hardware and controlled by the manufacturer. That alone doesn’t make it legal, but it adds credence to Apple’s claim that the App Store lockdown isn’t trapping consumers. If you don’t want to play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on an iPhone, you can play it on a console or a PC. Some devices come locked into a specific distribution channel and some don’t, giving users the chance to vote with their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PlB1P2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Video game consoles operate under a radically different business model”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DPsUjD"&gt;Epic’s counter to this argument, as explained in the filing, is that “video game consoles operate under a radically different business model than smartphones.” Development for console games is slow and expensive work, and consoles are useless without a steady supply of those games, so console manufacturers are under immense pressure to attract developers. That means hardware itself is often sold at cost, leaving App Store commissions as the primary source of profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXDPDw"&gt;Apple is different, Epic argues, because most of its profits still come from iPhone sales. “Developers do not participate in those profits,” the filing argues, “even though the availability of apps contributes greatly to the sale of devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rb70G5"&gt;On some level, this boils down to the argument that console companies are nicer to developers, so their platform power is less of an issue. The constant competition between Xbox and PlayStation gives game developers leverage to extract more favorable terms. But iOS and Android don’t compete for app developers in the same way, and the lower cost of mobile development means the competition happens on vastly different terms. Apple has given people lots of reasons to buy an iPhone, which means there’s less pressure on any given line of business. But that’s well short of the standard for monopoly power, and Apple ultimately comes away from the console comparison looking pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Ig69R4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much control can Apple exert over its hardware?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="6ezXaY"&gt;Underneath everything else, Apple is facing a profound question of how much control it can exert over its own devices. For critics, this is Apple’s original sin, using industrial and graphic design to lure customers into a walled garden, then locking the gate. For fans, it’s Apple’s genius, integrating hardware and software to deliver a more purposeful and powerful user experience. But it all rests on Apple’s ability to maintain a closed stack, using hardware integration to control what happens in software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMHW0v"&gt;This trial won’t undo that stack, but it could limit what Apple can do with it. The Epic Games fight started over payment processing, but the same legal standard could allow for alternative app stores or limit the restrictions Apple can place on rogue apps like Parler. It’s a first step toward setting regulatory limits on how tech companies operate, similar to the regulations on wireless carriers or banks. At its most basic level, Epic is arguing that Apple’s ecosystem has grown too big and too powerful for it to be run entirely out of Cupertino, and it’s time for it to be directly accountable to antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBIU20"&gt;Hundreds of pages in Apple’s filing are devoted to the benefits of that system for developers and iPhone owners, much of it undeniably true. There really is less malware on iOS devices because of Apple’s software controls, even if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;scam apps sometimes slip through&lt;/a&gt;. The system really does generate a lot of money for iOS developers, many of whom couldn’t compete outside of Apple’s walled garden. The shift to digital distribution really has saved money for developers who don’t need to distribute their product through brick-and-mortar retail anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="wcd3uB"&gt;But in a sense, all of that is beside the point. Abuses of market power aren’t excused just because they’re sometimes helpful, and classical monopolies like Standard Oil or Bell Telephone had lots of side benefits, too. The bigger question is whether courts are ready to dive into the mobile software stack and start dictating the terms of how tech companies can set up their marketplaces. That’s a hard question, and it won’t be settled by a single ruling or a single case. But one way or another, it’s a question this court will have to take on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon adds 720p streaming to its Luna cloud gaming service to improve stability</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x6s55j4YghHo9ijaP6Dbbba6Z78=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69096222/image.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pk4JBZ"&gt;Amazon is adding a new streaming option to its Luna cloud gaming platform that will cap resolution at 720p to help improve stability for players on slower internet connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo3R24"&gt;Right now, Luna streams only at 1080p, with 4K coming at some point in the future. Yet even at 1080p, internet connections that struggle to keep up with the high bandwidth demands of cloud gaming might result in latency, lag, and audio issues for the player when using a service like Luna. Now, Amazon says those using Luna in its early access beta — the platform has yet to release to the public — can toggle on the 720p streaming mode in the settings panel to help with performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hua8qa"&gt;“One of the most requested features is the ability to play at lower resolutions to match unique internet connection speeds and bandwidth demands,” the company said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Starting today, we’re enabling a new 720p option, allowing for decreased bandwidth and data usage by streaming at a lower resolution.” Amazon also suggests the lower-resolution setting for Luna will help those who have home internet data caps, like the ones Comcast has said it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264430/comcast-data-cap-rollout-delayed-twelve-us-states-isp-bills"&gt;start imposing on its customers this July&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZC9sKV"&gt;Luna &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21451371/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-service-twitch-alexa-controller"&gt;released last fall in early access&lt;/a&gt; with a unique channel model that borrows concepts from cable and streaming television. Instead of paying a fee to use the service like Nvidia GeForce Now or buying your games outright like on Google Stadia, Luna itself is free to use but access to streamed games is gated behind “channels” with individual monthly subscriptions. The only two available right now are Amazon’s Luna Plus channel ($5.99 per month) and a dedicated Ubisoft one ($14.99). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Listen to 16 minutes of Final Fantasy VII Remake’s soundtrack performed by a live orchestra</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DCx-1NJEzitWcMlNd_hAtbb9LeM=/40x0:1810x1180/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69096196/FFVIIRemakeCon_1_1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: AWR Music Productions&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vHmfBb"&gt;Square Enix has released &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/kHJVZOCqTAw"&gt;a 16-minute trailer&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; Orchestral World Tour, and if you’re a fan of the game’s fantastic soundtrack, I highly recommend watching this video from beginning to end. Watching the songs performed by a live orchestra brought a huge smile to my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8wAnj"&gt;The trailer features three songs: a medley of the game’s opening, including the bombastic title fanfare that &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; gives me goosebumps; “Stand Up,” the song used during the Honeybee Inn dance scene; and a medley of the classic battle theme, “Let the Battles Begin!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXUBRK"&gt;More than 100 musicians perform the arrangements. If you want to try to catch a show for yourself, you can see the schedule of upcoming performances on the &lt;a href="https://ffvii-remakeconcerts.com/"&gt;tour’s website&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly, the tour isn’t currently scheduled to take place anywhere near me; I guess I’ll just have to watch this video a hundred more times to try to re-create the experience for myself. Darn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F08JGU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>That Fyre Fest tweet with the sad sandwich will be auctioned as an NFT for medical expenses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YCYxDXendLEL1z-0HRJ4bwA7wM4=/0x114:680x567/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69096040/fyrefest.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/trev4president/status/857776562615308288" target="_blank"&gt;Trevor DeHaas/Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N6gI5C"&gt;Trevor DeHaas is auctioning his 2017 tweet of the “dinner” he received at Fyre Fest as an NFT. But unlike the Fest itself, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trev4president/status/857776562615308288"&gt;tweeted photo of the limp cheese slice&lt;/a&gt; on wheat bread with some greens and a sad tomato in a styrofoam container isn’t a grift; as first &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/nft-fyre-fest-blockchain-dinner-tweet-66eea211-4284-4e8e-821a-899cc60b6d74.html"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, DeHaas is hoping to raise $80,000 which he plans to put toward his medical bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTlZH1"&gt;“With how hot the NFT market is right now I figured I’d give it a shot and could hopefully raise enough money that I wouldn’t need to rely on a GoFundMe to pay for my medical expenses,” DeHaas said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The last thing I want is to guilt trip someone into buying the NFT and copyright to pay for my medical expenses but I would like the auction winner to know that their money would be going to a good cause.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5qMjt"&gt;The organizers of Fyre Fest billed it as an exclusive, luxury music festival in the Bahamas, which would include top-notch catering, big-name performers, and transportation via Jet Ski and yacht. Kendall Jenner was among the celebrities paid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/4/15547734/fyre-fest-kendall-jenner-instagram-sponsored-paid"&gt;$250,000 to promote the event&lt;/a&gt;, which guests paid up to $12,000 to attend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sfd6t"&gt;That is not what happened, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnzjTw"&gt;Social posts from attendees like DeHaas showed images of a poorly organized, subpar event that wasn’t close to what was advertised, and soon &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2017/music/news/mcfarland-fyre-class-action-criminal-grand-jury-subpoena-1202446126/"&gt;the lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; began. In 2018, Fyre Fest organizer &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/arts/music/fyre-festival-organizer-sentenced-fraud.html?smtyp=cur&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes"&gt;Billy McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison&lt;/a&gt; after pleading guilty to wire fraud charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="k0R4E2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="onIXO5"&gt;DeHaas said he was inspired by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s auction of his first-ever tweet, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/22/jack-dorsey-sells-his-first-tweet-ever-as-an-nft-for-over-2point9-million.html"&gt;sold for $2.9 million&lt;/a&gt; on March 22nd. “Now, a few weeks before the 4 year anniversary of the festival (4/28) I’m selling the most iconic cheese sandwich on the blockchain along with the ownership of copyright,” he told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHubjc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trev4president/status/1379832081845485569?s=20"&gt;DeHaas clarified on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that he was selling the tweet on &lt;a href="http://flipkick.io"&gt;flipkick.io&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based company for artists and musicians to “monetize their work with Physical NFTs,” according to &lt;a href="https://flipkick.io/about"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;. Ironic twist: Fyre Fest co-organizer Ja Rule is a partner in Flipkick, but DeHaas says the musician is not directly involved in the auction of his cheese sandwich tweet. However, Ja Rule, who was &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ja-rule-cleared-of-wrongdoing-in-major-fyre-fest-lawsuit-2576105"&gt;cleared of wrongdoing&lt;/a&gt; in connection with Fyre Fest, recently &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/mar/25/ja-rule-nft-fyre-festival-artwork"&gt;sold an NFT of a painting of the Fyre Fest logo&lt;/a&gt; for $122,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3CPOR"&gt;DeHaas says he plans to transfer copyright and ownership rights for the NFT to the auction winner. His aim is to raise money for his medical expenses; according to his &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/trevors-kidney-fund"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt;, DeHaas is in end-stage renal disease and needs a kidney transplant.  “I currently do dialysis for 7 hours every day and in the mean time trying to find a living kidney donor,” DeHaas told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The expenses from a kidney transplant can be astronomical even with insurance. Plus there are expenses for my donor that I would like to cover.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFO1kT"&gt;Which raises a troubling question: are NFT auctions going to become another tool — like GoFundMe pages — to raise money for costs not covered in America’s abysmal health care system? If something good comes out of the debacle that was Fyre Fest (other than the &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-or-hulu-which-fyre-festival-documentary-you-should-watch/"&gt;dueling documentaries on Hulu and Netflix&lt;/a&gt;), that’s certainly a win. But using NFTs to pay for surgery and treatment introduces an even bleaker scenario for people desperate to pay their medical bills who aren’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/30/4787602/breaking-bad-series-finale-breaks-records-for-ratings-and-piracy"&gt;Walter White&lt;/a&gt; or independently wealthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvErPq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 8th, 1:02PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added comment from Trevor DeHaas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The wisdom of the crowd&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6YZmXK"&gt;During the aughts, there was a vague notion among techno-optimists that crowdsourcing knowledge was the answer to just about every problem. Using the wisdom of crowds, the thought went, people would have unprecedented access to expertise. “With enough eyes, all bugs are shallow,” said the open-source software community. The success of Wikipedia meant that mass collaboration, open systems of production, and talented amateurs would win the day, this line of thinking went. Books such as &lt;em&gt;The Wisdom of Crowds&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crowdsourcing: Why the Power of the Crowd Is Driving the Future of Business, Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing without Organizations&lt;/em&gt; pushed the idea that the future was the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GQaqR"&gt;It was in this environment, in 2005, that Yahoo! started Yahoo! Answers. In theory, it should have been the biggest, most important site on the internet. In practice, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368488/yahoo-answers-shutdown-may-4-internet-era-over-rip"&gt;Yahoo! Answers will be shut down on May 4th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcb6oz"&gt;So I thought I would preserve, for future generations, the intellectual inquiry that went on there. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Realme 8 Pro review: a peek at what’s next in midrange smartphone imaging</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The 8 Pro uses a new 108-megapixel image sensor that could bring better photo capabilities to the midrange class&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OubfId"&gt;The Realme 8 Pro is a good, inexpensive Android phone that you probably shouldn’t buy right now — at least if you’re in the US. But it’s also a preview of positive things to come to the midrange class, especially in terms of camera hardware. I have seen the future of smartphone imaging around the $400 price point, and it is good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcAQ4u"&gt;If you’re not familiar, Realme is a Chinese company that started off as a sub-brand of Oppo; like OnePlus, it was founded by a former Oppo vice president. Its phones are sold in China, India, and Europe. Although, you can technically &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aliexpress.com%2Fitem%2F1005002356767813.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22372644%2Frealme-8-pro-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy a global version of the phone&lt;/a&gt; and use it in the US, but we wouldn’t recommend it. It’s not compatible with many of the 4G bands we use in the states, so coverage won’t be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rlknuc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10434729"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OpH1Ga"&gt;The 8 Pro uses a relatively new 108-megapixel Samsung sensor. It’s the same pixel count as the main camera in the Galaxy S21 Ultra, but a different, smaller chip designed for budget-friendlier phones. As in the S21 Ultra, the point of this technology isn’t to take 108-megapixel images (though you can do that if you want). It’s to combine information from groups of pixels to create a better optimized 12-megapixel final image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9rJ6T"&gt;There are other reasons to like the Realme 8 Pro. Considering its £279 (about $380) price, performance is very good, owing to a strong combination in its Snapdragon 720G processor and 6GB of RAM. Battery life is healthy and the phone supports 50W fast wired charging. Depending on how you feel about inspirational corporate branding, I guess the “DARE TO LEAP” printed on the back of the phone could be a plus (not my thing, personally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZOVxs"&gt;But the camera impressed me the most, and it’s a component that will likely make its way into many more midrange phones sold around the globe. Let’s take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Realme 8 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zYL68vwQZ04q6a7Q9V0H5pE8grQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422677/ajohnson_20210330_4501_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 8 Pro offers standard wide and ultrawide cameras, plus macro and depth-sensing modules.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9Deyjj"&gt;Realme 8 Pro camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KseLY8"&gt;In case you need a reminder at any point of how many pixels the main camera offers, you can simply look at the back of the phone where you’ll find “108 MP QUAD CAMERA”  etched on the camera bump. Specifically, it’s Samsung’s 1/1.52-inch Isocell HM2 sensor coupled with an f/1.9 lens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpIrz3"&gt;Unfortunately, there’s no optical image stabilization here, but maybe owing to the image processing tricks this high-res sensor can pull off, I didn’t notice a significant number of blurry shots that OIS might have corrected. Other rear cameras include an 8-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth-sensing camera. There’s a 16-megapixel selfie camera on the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PqSNY9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In low light, the camera uses binning to combine pixels into groups of nine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2WslDc"&gt;The main camera is able to do a couple of interesting things. In bright daylight, it can use all 108 million pixels individually, using different pixels to capture your scene at multiple exposure levels at once, and combining the information into a 12-megapixel final image. In low light, the camera switches things up and uses binning to combine pixels into groups of nine, effectively turning relatively small individual pixels — 0.7μm to be precise — into much larger 2.1μm sized pixels, which helps produce less noisy images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hm4ceZ"&gt;Photos in bright light look good as expected. There’s an impressive amount of detail captured, though some overzealous sharpening is evident if you zoom in to 100 percent. Colors are a bit too saturated for my liking; there’s no amount of lawn fertilizer in the world that would make my yard look as green as the 8 Pro thinks it is. It seems more prone to this oversaturation with landscapes and is thankfully less aggressive with portrait mode photos. Portrait mode photos look good, and I appreciate that the camera doesn’t crop in when switching to this mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rs3ppK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10434785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="chzFwG"&gt;Dim indoor lighting and low light are where phone cameras typically struggle, but the 8 Pro turns in an impressive performance in these conditions. In moderate lighting, images are surprisingly detailed and show little noise. The camera’s night mode will bring out even more detail, though it does apply a distracting amount of sharpening and contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="smeJnG"&gt;I had, frankly, low expectations for the 8 Pro’s digital 3x zoom, but I’m pleased to report that it’s much better than I feared. In good light and even moderate indoor lighting, images show a lot of detail and I’m hard-pressed to find the unpleasant artifacts that usually appear in digitally zoomed images. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nOR1WW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10434810"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3JoPTF"&gt;The camera isn’t just cropping in on a 108-megapixel image, either. Comparing them side by side at 100 percent, a photo taken with 3x digital zoom shows more detail and looks less noisy than a crop of a 108-megapixel image. The Samsung HM2’s pixel binning powers are being put to work here, too, and the result is digital zoom that is actually worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNLxwM"&gt;There’s not as much exciting news to report about the 8 Pro’s other cameras; they do just fine. The ultrawide is prone to some subtle but unpleasant color shifts: white balance can skew too warm and blue skies sometimes look a little gray. The macro camera is a low-resolution sensor that is little more than a gimmick, and the selfie camera thankfully avoids over-smoothing faces at its default setting. All fair for a phone at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ggsQ0wf8_f25IqWpW3y0u9KmD00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422682/ajohnson_20210330_4501_0005.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 8 Pro’s processor and RAM combination are more than sufficient for everyday tasks and scrolling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QIXP6V"&gt;Realme 8 Pro performance and screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KwndvP"&gt;Outside of cameras, the Realme 8 Pro is a thoroughly capable midrange phone. Battery life is sufficient to get through a day of moderate to heavy use and the aforementioned processor / RAM combo handles day-to-day app scrolling and tasks with ease. The 6.4-inch 1080p OLED with standard 60Hz refresh rate is fine but nothing special, and I had to fight with auto brightness insisting on making the screen too dim on a couple of occasions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RkSqzm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;this processor / RAM combo handles day-to-day app scrolling and tasks with ease&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wg2ih4"&gt;There’s the flashy branding on the rear of the device, which is either your kind of thing or not. The Realme 8 Pro doesn’t support 5G at all, which is something to consider if you’re in the UK and thinking of buying the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYsb1B"&gt;My biggest gripe, though, is with the optical in-display fingerprint sensor. I’d say at least a third of the time when I unlocked the phone it required more than one try to read my finger. A couple of times — both outside in bright daylight — it gave up and had me enter my PIN instead. If this was going to be my forever phone, I’d probably skip the fingerprint sensor and just stick with a PIN, personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YChxijF9TJL3frDe23zO-C6xCgE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422679/ajohnson_20210330_4501_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Te32ls"&gt;The Realme 8 Pro is the kind of midrange phone that we don’t see very often in the US: great performance and decent all-around specs combined with an excellent camera, all for what would equate to a sub-$400 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zm37iP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the 8 Pro is (hopefully) a sign of good camera hardware coming our way soon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o4Z3xk"&gt;Phones that meet this description are surprisingly scarce stateside; in fact, its closest equivalent is probably the Pixel 4A, which we’ve recommended as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;best low-cost Android phone&lt;/a&gt; essentially since it became available last summer. The 8 Pro goes a step beyond the 4A in some respects by offering an ultrawide rear camera and fast charging. If it came down to it, though, we’d probably still favor the Pixel for its very good device support and excellent lone rear camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3ZY0XQ"&gt;If you live in the UK and you don’t care much about class-leading display specs and the lack of 5G doesn’t bother you, the 8 Pro has a camera and a processor that will keep up for many years to come. For the rest of us, the 8 Pro is (hopefully) a sign of good camera hardware coming our way soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Expedia launches a new tool to check coronavirus travel restrictions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Travelers wait in security lines at Mexico airport" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/py8jw_txBboL0i9Krgdq_Xp4AaI=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69095275/1231957204.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Gerardo Vieyra/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v6uRgE"&gt;As more people get vaccinated against the coronavirus and spring weather coaxes people outside, we’re all thinking about those travel plans we shelved last summer. But with COVID-19 travel restrictions varying by country and by state in the US, it’s difficult to figure out what’s safe and what the latest rules are.  Expedia Group — whose online travel agent (OTA) websites include Expedia, Vrbo, Travelocity, Hotels.com, and others — has created a tool to help travelers plan trips while adhering to COVID-19 restrictions at their destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaVW4X"&gt;“Right now, many people are considering booking trips as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, but at the same time, they’re inundated with conflicting information about where and how they can safely travel,” Stacey Symonds, Expedia’s senior director of experience insights, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The company says 1.6 million travelers participated in a pilot of its COVID-19 Travel Advisor back in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuwmwS"&gt;To use the Travel Advisor tool, enter your departure and arrival airports and your travel dates, and it will tell you whether restrictions are in place, what the quarantine policy is, whether you need to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test, and the mask policy at your destination and upon your return. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w4_97Fk0TjebSMK21Q5AWfoK-lA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429439/bos_to_tor.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Travel Advisor shows the COVID-19 restrictions for a May 8th trip from Boston to Toronto.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C95ktB"&gt;In its latest &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html"&gt;guidance dated April 2nd&lt;/a&gt;, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends US travelers delay travel until they’re fully vaccinated. Once you’re vaccinated, the CDC says you can travel safely within the US and don’t need to self-quarantine before or after your trip. Fully vaccinated travelers don’t need to get tested before or after their trips unless required at their destination. The CDC notes that any passengers entering the US, including returning US citizens, are required to have proof of recovery from COVID-19 infection or a negative COVID-19 test result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4ZFtH"&gt;As of this writing, Americans are still banned from travel to many destinations, particularly in Europe. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-travel-restrictions.html"&gt;compiled a list&lt;/a&gt; of countries that allowed American visitors as of April 1st, and the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html"&gt;CDC has a map&lt;/a&gt; showing where travel may be especially risky due to the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PS5 exclusive Deathloop has been delayed again until September 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tF7x94C8WtUuCWWKXz7kJqqbnUk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69095225/Deathloop_Rival_Showdown.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BakdTh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; has been delayed again, with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1271189286553923584?s=20"&gt;Arkane’s timed PS5 console exclusive&lt;/a&gt; moving from its previous May 21st release date to a fall release on September 14th. The news marks the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374127/deathloop-the-stanley-parable-ultra-deluxe-delayed-2021-coronavirus"&gt;second big delay for &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally supposed to be out in the 2020 holiday season alongside the then-newly released PS5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbSJ0W"&gt;As with the earlier delay, Arkane’s Lyon studio is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deathloop/status/1295722189203832843"&gt;once again citing COVID-19-related delays&lt;/a&gt;, with an increased difficulty in development as it works to ensure “the health and safety of everyone at Arkane.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FgOiof"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/f0OWWxdUkt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/f0OWWxdUkt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DEATHLOOP (@deathloop) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deathloop/status/1380160357872861185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wUTCWm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is the latest title from Arkane’s Lyon studio, best known for the &lt;em&gt;Dishonored &lt;/em&gt;franchise and the rebooted &lt;em&gt;Prey &lt;/em&gt;from 2017. Players assume the role of Colt, an assassin stuck in a time loop who must fight his way out by assassinating his eight targets using a variety of weapons and mystical powers — all while being hunted by a rival assassin, Julianna (who can be controlled by other players over the internet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwRp5D"&gt;As a next-gen exclusive title, &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is only set to be released on the PlayStation 5 (for a one-year exclusivity period) and PC — despite the fact that publisher Bethesda is now owned by Microsoft. Xbox studio head Phil Spencer &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-21/microsoft-to-buy-bethesda-studios-for-7-5-billion-to-boost-xbox"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; back in September that it’ll still be holding to that timed exclusivity for both &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;GhostWire: Tokyo. &lt;/em&gt;That&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;means, with the current delay, Xbox owners will be waiting even longer before they’re able to head to Blackreef. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s latest Galaxy Chromebook is $100 off for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 on a desk in front of a window, open with a mug and small plant on its left and some books on its right.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F0ZPFo"&gt;Samsung’s latest Chrome OS laptop, the Galaxy Chromebook 2, came out a couple of months ago. If you are looking to buy this laptop at a more affordable price, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737191485644991413#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737196912936872712#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; have multiple configurations on sale for $100 off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7VdNv"&gt;My colleague, Monica Chin, thinks this laptop is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the best midrange Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now and notes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in her review&lt;/a&gt; that this Chromebook has much better battery life than its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MyIhdu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10435503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KrDsUI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima &lt;/em&gt;was released last year, and it quickly became one of the more popular games in 2020, so much so that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350484/sony-ghost-of-tsushima-movie-film-director-john-wick-sucker-punch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the game is getting a film adaption&lt;/a&gt;. If you have yet to experience this open-world action title, it is back down to its lowest price yet of $40 at several retailers, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Tsushima-PlayStation-4/dp/B08BSKT43L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724325625436134758#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fghost-of-tsushima%2F11100913.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3Kw9G4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591232"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JOTrEj"&gt;At a sale price of $297, LG’s UltraGear, a 27-inch gaming monitor, is a great deal. It’s been discounted since earlier this week, but the deal is still available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LLD2QXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1621994-REG%2Flg_27gn800_b_27_qhd_ips_hdr10.html%23donotlink&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F8%2F22373433%2Fsamsung-galaxy-chromebook-ghost-of-tsushima-lg-monitor-sale-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. If you managed to get your hands on the latest AMD or Nvidia GPU, or are an early adopter of the Xbox Series X, this 1440p monitor is a good option to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HMD revamps its midrange Nokia lineup with six phones under €350</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TfUuWYki-4j9QODKpaIA2ZsTins=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69095144/Group_shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right, HMD’s Nokia G10, X20, C10, X10, G20, and C20.&lt;/em&gt; | Image; HMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="03e2Sm"&gt;HMD is announcing six new midrange Nokia phones today, ranging in price from €75 (around $90) up to €349 (around $415). At the top, there’s the X-series, consisting of the X10 and X20, followed by the G-series G10 and G20, and then finally, there’s the entry-level C10 and C20 from the C-series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7T55e"&gt;HMD’s pitch for these phones is the length of time it’s offering support, with even the cheapest C-series phones due to receive two years of quarterly security updates. Meanwhile, G-series phones will receive two years of Android OS updates and three years of monthly security updates. Finally, the X-series gets three years of OS updates, three years of monthly security updates, and an extended warranty that HMD says should mean it’s covered for three years in many of its release markets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i4QG5b2wdm-BpCt6Bk-ICtsEKAM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429117/Nokia_X20___Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia X20.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="921Yx8"&gt;At the top of the six-phone lineup is the X20, which HMD says will be priced at the equivalent of €349 (£299.99, around $415) around the world. It’s got a 6.67-inch 1080p display, with a hole-punch cutout in the top-center for its 32-megapixel selfie camera, while on the back, you’ll find a circular camera bump containing four cameras: a 64-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel depth camera, and a 2-megapixel macro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xI8iFq"&gt;Internally, the X20 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 and 4,470mAh battery, with either 6 or 8GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage. It runs Android 11 out of the box and includes three years of OS updates that HMD says will take it through to Android 14. Security is handled by a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, and there’s also a dedicated Google Assistant button on the left. I’ve been using the Nokia X20 for the past week, and you can read my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22136485"&gt;first-hand impressions here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZN_FrgzIUmyI-ULFs3gjo_Vwnn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429118/Nokia_X10_Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia X10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="25RTi5"&gt;A step down from the X20 is the Nokia X10 at €309 (£249.99, around $367). It shares a lot of the DNA of its older sibling. It’s also running on a Snapdragon 480, with a 4,470mAh battery and has a 6.67-inch 1080p display. But it’s available with slightly lower specs: a minimum of 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, and its main camera and selfie camera at  lower resolutions of 48-megapixels and 8-megapixels, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mg0pVe"&gt;Next is the G-series, which is led by the Nokia G20 at €159 (£129.99, around $189). Its screen is a little smaller at 6.5 inches and has a lower resolution of 720p. Internally, it’s using a MediaTek G35 processor with a 5,050mAh battery, upwards of 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of expandable storage. You still get four rear cameras, though: a 48-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Around front, there’s a notch containing an 8-megapixel camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UlZShG1gTCbSJiedbuM23DHBuk8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429123/Nokia_G10_Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia G10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/57_ftm-V7sKRfvQKo668yjNFGhs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429124/Nokia_G20_Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia G20.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gUeNod"&gt;The G20 is joined by the Nokia G10 at €139 (£109.99, around $165). Its display and battery have the same specs as the G20, but it’s got a less powerful MediaTek G25 processor, with 3 or 4GB of RAM and 32 or 64GB of expandable storage. Around back, you only get three cameras: a 13-megapixel main camera, a 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. The Nokia G10 has an 8-megapixel selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKf1qp"&gt;Right at the bottom of the newly revamped lineup is the C-series, which HMD says is designed for people who would previously have bought non-smart feature phones. Both the Nokia C20 at €89 (£79, around $105) and the Nokia C10 at €75 (around $90) have 6.5-inch 720p displays, a single rear 5-megapixel camera, a 5-megapixel selfie camera, and are running Google’s lightweight Go edition of Android 11. The C20 has a Unisoc SC9863a processor, while the C10 has a Unisoc SC7331e processor. Both are available with 1 or 2GB of RAM, 16 or 32GB of expandable storage, and removable 3,000mAh batteries that charge over Micro USB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="OT0jah"&gt;The naming schemes may be different than previous Nokia lines, but with its six new devices, HMD is focusing on its traditional strengths: affordable phones with lengthy support periods. We’re still waiting for HMD to confirm exact US pricing and availability for the handsets, but the G10 and C20 will be available in “select markets” starting later this month, the X20 and G20 will launch in May, and the X10 and C10 will launch in June.&lt;/p&gt;
