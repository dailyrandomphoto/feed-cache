    <title>Android 12 Beta 4 promotes order over chaos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GTHQWc69ttANwwrpFsZJ8lhlhVs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710995/VRG_1777_Android_12_005.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pP18J9"&gt;Google released the first public beta for Android 12 during its I/O event in the spring, and now Beta 4 is rolling out to compatible devices. Instead of a few previously unseen features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576164/android-12-beta-3-auto-rotate-screenshot-scrolling"&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525023/android-12-beta-2-wifi-privacy-location-microphone-camera"&gt;releases&lt;/a&gt;, this version moves things into the “platform stability” section of the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XevF6owqylL7eexDvbXRkTASgEI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775536/Untitled.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12 beta release schedule&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gL73km"&gt;For users trying to dive into the next version of Android as soon as possible, this means things are stabilizing as development proceeds toward a release candidate. The people this release is really important for are &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12"&gt;Android developers&lt;/a&gt;, who can test their apps for compatibility now that the APIs, features, and layout have been locked down. With Google introducing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;the biggest system redesign in years&lt;/a&gt;, there are plenty of areas where an app could run into trouble — double-check those widgets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SEpYVQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Android 12 preview: here’s Google’s radical new design ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="s3Sax5"&gt;Android 12’s refreshed approach to privacy and security is another potential obstacle for apps that haven’t been updated. There’s the privacy dashboard that consolidates settings, alerts when an app snoops on the clipboard for any copy / paste information, and the ability to grant an app access to either your precise or approximate location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGWRY4"&gt;As always, you can register for the beta and see if your phone is eligible to participate &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. Google’s phones from the Pixel 3 forward are candidates, along with &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices"&gt;certain phones&lt;/a&gt; made by Asus, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Sharp, and ZTE.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pay and Messages updates are coming to existing Wear OS watches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lilJjbl8MlyY6M79RfrbwkaSkig=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710987/3._Google_Pay.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Pay on Wear OS.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GPvVbT"&gt;Today’s smartwatch news has been dominated by Samsung’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22382573"&gt;Wear OS 3-powered wearables&lt;/a&gt;, but Google wants you to know it hasn’t forgotten about &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/wearos/thread/120789017/new-and-updated-app-experiences-coming-to-wear-os?hl=en&amp;amp;msgid=120789017"&gt;smartwatches running Wear OS 2&lt;/a&gt;. Updates to Google Pay, Messages, and other third-party apps will be coming to current devices &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/wear-os/galaxy-watch4"&gt;in addition to Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;, giving existing owners something to look forward to as they roll out over the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJCqeq"&gt;For starters, Google Pay’s support for contactless payments from smartwatches is expanding to 16 new countries: Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Slovakia, Sweden, Taiwan, Ukraine, and United Arab Emirates. It’s previously been possible to use &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pay/answer/7454247"&gt;Google Pay from smartphones in these countries&lt;/a&gt;, but not from smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iBseDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More is coming to Wear OS 3&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qTg7yv"&gt;Next up, Google says that its Messages Wear OS app will have improved performance so you can easily use it without taking out your phone. The messages will sync with your paired phone so everything that happens in your wrist is still updated in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUOTer"&gt;Finally, there are also “new experiences” on the way from third-party apps like Calm, Komoot, Period Tracker, Sleep Cycle, Spotify, and Strava. Google says that “many” of these apps will include support for Tiles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525335/google-wear-os-tiles-widgets-new-feature-announced"&gt;Google’s glanceable widgets&lt;/a&gt; that offer quick tidbits of information from supported apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkwC1p"&gt;As well as Google’s existing Wear OS 2 operating system, these features are also coming to upcoming Wear OS 3 watches. Here, they’ll be &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/wear-os/galaxy-watch4"&gt;joined by&lt;/a&gt; a new YouTube Music app, with support for offline downloads, and a redesigned Google Maps app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tetris Effect: Connected is finally coming to the Switch in October</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tetris Effect: Connected" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UJJFIVto_sqDqe0L6OQ5iPrMauw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710720/Tetris_Effect_Connected_Xbox_KeyArt.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Enhance Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b33RFn"&gt;The greatest &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt; game of the last decade is finally coming to the Switch. As a part of today’s Indie World Showcase, Nintendo announced that &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected&lt;/em&gt; will arrive on the Switch October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XU3uZb"&gt;Coming off its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335590/tetris-effect-connected-xbox-series-x-multiplayer-expansion-release-date"&gt;timed exclusivity period&lt;/a&gt; with Xbox and Xbox Game Pass, &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected &lt;/em&gt;is the multiplayer expansion of 2018’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18076140/tetris-effect-review-ps4-vr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Designed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, the creator behind the trippy musical shooter &lt;em&gt;Rez&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt; combined speedy block stacking with slick and impossibly pretty visuals and sounds. In &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt;, classic &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt; gameplay remained unchanged. Players still dropped various shaped blocks into brain-pleasing configurations, clearing rows as stacks of blocks slowly piled up. But &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt; was also a full-on audiovisual sensory experience complete with colorful sights and chill sounds that added a new layer of depth to the 1984 classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QoQKb"&gt;Released on Xbox, PC, PlayStation, and VR platforms, &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt; received a multiplayer upgrade in 2020 with &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected. Connected&lt;/em&gt; added online or local cross-platform multiplayer and co-op modes, allowing players to go head to head or work together in search of the ever elusive row-obliterating Tetris. Though initially exclusive to Xbox and Game Pass, &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected&lt;/em&gt; will hit all platforms later this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram will let you limit DMs and comments from people who don’t follow you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ICkbKirzqCTZgwRxGHZKtwuyRqg=/0x0:890x593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710692/limits.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wHJKGt"&gt;Instagram has been in the news this summer after Black soccer stars in England were bombarded with racist messages following their team’s Euro 2020 final loss. Today, the company’s &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/protecting-our-community-from-abuse-on-instagram/"&gt;trying to prevent&lt;/a&gt; some of that behavior from happening again with the introduction and expansion of three safety features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nHQ1a"&gt;Among them is something called “limits.” Turning this on prevents anyone who doesn’t follow you, or who recently followed you, from commenting or sending a DM. The feature is available to everyone globally today, and Instagram points out that it’ll likely be most useful to businesses and creators who expect a flurry of responses. Of course, turning comments or DMs off entirely would also work, but Instagram says this is a solution for people who still want the possibility of positively engaging with their community. The company says it’s also “exploring ways” to preemptively suggest that people turn this feature on when it detects a spike in activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O127Eb"&gt;Additionally, Instagram is building out its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394611/instagram-tool-filter-abusive-direct-messages-harassment"&gt;hidden words feature&lt;/a&gt; that launched in April, which allows people to automatically filter DMs with offensive words, phrases, and emoji, relegating them to a hidden folder. The feature now has a wider list of potentially offensive words, emoji, and hashtags. And finally, the app is issuing sterner warnings to people who try to post offensive comments. (This type of messaging already existed but only appeared if someone attempted to post multiple times.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFPVTH"&gt;“We hope these new features will better protect people from seeing abusive content, whether it’s racist, sexist, homophobic or any other type of abuse,” the company writes in a press release. “We know there’s more to do, including improving our systems to find and remove abusive content more quickly, and holding those who post it accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXEeOf"&gt;The racist harassment of the soccer stars — Bukayo Saka, Marcus Rashford, and Jadon Sancho — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22574082/black-players-england-italy-football-soccer-racist-instagram-twitter-telegram"&gt;pushed&lt;/a&gt; Prince William and UK prime minister Boris Johnson to speak out, along with England’s Football Association. Instagram clearly had to do something, and these new features may offer some help, at least to the people who find them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kidney transplant patients will test a COVID-19 booster shot in new trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New Vaccinations Are Rebounding in the&amp;amp;nbsp;U.S. Covid Hot Spots" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRyJPIRSHNFyXG29VJz4-fScSoo=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710665/1234456149.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3vYan8"&gt;The National Institutes of Health is giving a booster&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;dose to 200 kidney transplant patients who did not have an immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine in a &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-launches-study-third-covid-19-vaccine-dose-kidney-transplant-recipients"&gt;new trial&lt;/a&gt; that launched yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bAm5E"&gt;Many transplant patients, who have to take immunosuppressant drugs to keep their bodies from rejecting a new organ, don’t produce enough antibodies — or don’t produce antibodies at all — after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. The study will check to see if a third shot of an mRNA vaccine, given on top of the normal two-shot regimen, will generate antibodies closer to the levels seen in healthy people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJ4I7V"&gt;There are some indications that a third dose might help some people. In France, health officials started recommending in April that immunosuppressed patients get a third shot of the COVID-19 vaccine. Half of the patients who did not respond to two shots produced antibodies after the third, according to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782538"&gt;an analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 159 kidney transplant patients. The other half, though, still had no response. In Germany, &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/transplantjournal/Citation/9000/Cellular_And_Humoral_Immune_Responses_after_Three.95188.aspx"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; of 48 transplant patients found that 40 percent who didn’t respond to two doses had a response after the third. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3zknG"&gt;Two other trials looking at kidney transplant patients are also kicking off in &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04961229"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-535930/v1"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3yIcV"&gt;It’s possible that the existing body of research might be enough for health officials in the US to start recommending that immunocompromised patients get a third shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will take up the question at its meeting on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzc3lg"&gt;Currently, COVID-19 vaccines are available under an emergency use authorization in the US that specifies two doses for the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna shots. In order for a third shot to become standard for any group, one of two things would have to happen: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would have to amend that authorization to include the option for an additional shot, or the agency would have to fully approve the vaccines. Once they’re approved, doctors could prescribe a third dose under a practice called off-label use, which lets doctors use pharmaceuticals based on their judgment even if they’re not technically cleared for a particular purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uS0EhC"&gt;Some people in the US are already skirting the FDA and seeking out third shots. More than &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-health-coronavirus-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccine-fe8ecebb3b61c7d3ee8ed4225500cb0e"&gt;900 people&lt;/a&gt; have received a third shot in the US, according to data collected by the CDC, and it’s likely an undercount. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Axiom Verge 2, Boyfriend Dungeon, and more are out on the Switch today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzGKE9ryGtcbcq9POv0QmD_668Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710622/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boyfriend Dungeon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HTeFFc"&gt;Nintendo’s most recent Indie World Showcase was full of lots of cool games, as per usual. But the best part is that many of them are out today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7U1TGC"&gt;That includes &lt;em&gt;Axiom Verge 2&lt;/em&gt; (a sequel to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/30/8311893/axiom-verge-playstation-4"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt;-like adventure from 2015&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;em&gt;Boyfriend Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; (a hack-and-slash game where you can romance your weapons), &lt;em&gt;Necrobarista: Final Pour&lt;/em&gt; (the director’s cut of a visual novel about coffee and death), &lt;em&gt;Islanders&lt;/em&gt; (a procedurally generated strategy game where players build island communities), &lt;em&gt;Slime Rancher&lt;/em&gt; (where players run an alien ranch), &lt;em&gt;Curious Expedition 2&lt;/em&gt; (described as “a turn-based narrative roguelike set in a reimagined version of the late 19th century”), and &lt;em&gt;Garden Story&lt;/em&gt; (a &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt;-like action-adventure game where you play as an adorable grape).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwnpIp"&gt;Outside of the games coming out today, the event also included a number of titles launching later this year and next. Here’s everything that was announced:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QQ0NDn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4drezg"&gt;The chill, music-based take on &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt; is finally getting a portable edition. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18076140/tetris-effect-review-ps4-vr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt; originally debuted on the PS4&lt;/a&gt; before moving to platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335590/tetris-effect-connected-xbox-series-x-multiplayer-expansion-release-date"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258435/tetris-effect-oculus-quest-release-review"&gt;Oculus Quest&lt;/a&gt;, and the Switch edition features both the single-player campaign and the more recent “Connected” multiplayer component. It launches on October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N6JbeK8ywL1u99IpCpgd9tQ_9kw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775961/ss_d853013e1cf2ea2e8987f592c6a8edcbcb4ea17a.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eFKeKx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bomb Rush Cyberfunk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5VQzUx"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Jet Set Radio&lt;/em&gt;-style game about grinding and graffiti. It’s coming to the Switch as “a timed console exclusive” in 2022. (It’s also coming to other platforms, including &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1353230/Bomb_Rush_Cyberfunk/"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="GevhsB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eastward&lt;/em&gt; is described as “an action-adventure RPG with puzzle-solving and dungeon elements” where players explore a post-apocalyptic future rendered in lovely pixels. It’s coming to the Switch on September 16th as a timed exclusive, and preorders are open starting today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="8bVd1a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="s6uUHb"&gt;A game all about taking photos in a beautiful black-and-white world. The developers describe &lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt; as an experience about “talking to quirky characters and solving their problems by snapping neat photos, you can make your way through a variety of different, relaxing regions inspired by the Scandinavian countryside.” &lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt; is coming to the Switch this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="dLBFFM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metal Slug Tactics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wnIAZg"&gt;As the name implies, &lt;em&gt;Metal Slug Tactics&lt;/em&gt; takes the classic run-and-gun game and turns it into a turn-based, tactical experience. It was previously announced for Steam and is expected to debut on the Switch in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Flip 3: all the rumors, news, and announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PtEX7rPSFxh9WkCFM1DP2vQNPls=/0x0:838x559/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710599/E4qkWBHXwAgIQ_W.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1408107239903223808?s=21" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (tweet now deleted)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Here’s everything Samsung might unpack (and unfold) on August 11th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="D7CPc0"&gt;It’s been a little over half a year since Samsung introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229537/samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s21-event-buds-pro-announcements"&gt;the Galaxy S 21&lt;/a&gt;, which means it’s time for something new. Luckily, Samsung’s Unpacked event planned for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;August 11th at 10AM ET&lt;/a&gt;, where it’s widely expected to introduce new versions of its folding phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsHGW1"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 will likely be the stars of the show, with familiar designs featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594685/samsung-z-fold-3-stylus-support-note-durability"&gt;stylus support&lt;/a&gt;, 120Hz displays, and improved durability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWrpzF"&gt;Samsung and Google are also collaborating closely &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;on Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung is expected to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;new Galaxy Watch smartwatches&lt;/a&gt; to show off with its folding phones, and a look at the future of wearables for Android phones. Don’t be too surprised if there’s a fresh pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/27/22552705/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-leaked-renders-four-colors"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; to show off as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byqRSB"&gt;There’s not long to wait now, but if in the meantime you want to catch up on all the details of what Samsung seems to have prepared, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22608535/samsung-unpacked-event-date-time-galaxy-z-fold-flip-earbuds-watches"&gt;check out our roundup&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, keep an eye here for all the news as it rolls in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is adding an interactive periodic table to search</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emlL7ZCfY_QcAIh8vKMr8TgDBYA=/13x0:2035x1348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710395/Screen_Shot_2021_08_10_at_4.22.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K4rC2s"&gt;Google search now has an interactive periodic table you can check out to learn a lot more about the elements. You can find it by searching for “periodic table” and clicking the “explore elements” button on the right side of the page or by &lt;a href="https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/periodic-table/"&gt;navigating to it directly right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvWHAj"&gt;I wasn’t the best chemistry student growing up, but I’ve had a lot of fun clicking on different elements and learning about things like an element’s atomic mass, melting point, and seeing a 3D model of each element, which I find particularly cool. Each element that I’ve clicked on also includes a short fact — like that thallium was used as the murder agent in an Agatha Christie novel, apparently&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GdStO7JH0Jdb37Wlr9TcXEdZpBI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774923/ezgif.com_gif_maker.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7OGRvK"&gt;The periodic table is being announced alongside a few new features in Google Assistant designed to help families, including updates to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353207/google-assistant-smart-display-speakers-family-new-features-homeschool"&gt;Family Bell reminders&lt;/a&gt;. At launch last year, they could only play from Nest smart displays or speaker, but in “several weeks,” they’ll be able to ring on mobile devices, too, Google says. And sometime soon, Family Bell on the Nest Hub will be able to show a checklist when a Family Bell goes off, which could be a useful way to remember a set number of tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gItQA0"&gt;Google is also adding a way to set a routine after you turn off your alarm in the morning, which could let you check the weather and the news right after you wake up, for example. This feature is also coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="686GCl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google is adding new homeschooling features to Assistant smart displays and speakers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353207/google-assistant-smart-display-speakers-family-new-features-homeschool"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HMgbnTzstgDC4b5td2N12dRBAKo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710337/cwelch_210809_4705_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i9nhWr"&gt;It’s official: Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; are now considered last-gen. During today’s Galaxy Unpacked event, the company announced their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/27/22552705/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-leaked-renders-four-colors"&gt;long-rumored successor&lt;/a&gt;, the Galaxy Buds 2, a new set of true wireless earbuds that look to refine Samsung’s recent formula instead of reinvent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3Eo06"&gt;In terms of design, they’re not drastically different from the Galaxy Buds Plus. Each earbud is lighter and features a more rounded exterior. The Galaxy Buds 2 will also be available in four distinct colors (dark gray, green, purple, and white), and each earbud features a three-point microphone, active noise cancellation, and three sizes of silicone ear tips. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price"&gt;Google’s Pixel Buds A-series&lt;/a&gt;, they also come paired with a wireless charging case, one that features a playful interior that matches the color of the buds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FKVHPU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 review: nailing the basics with style","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="agEAD1"&gt;The Buds 2 won’t match the Plus in everything, though. According to Samsung, battery life is estimated to be up to five hours of continuous playback with ANC enabled (the case brings that to 20 hours). If you turn noise cancellation off, you could get 7.5 hours, still short of the 11 hours maximum for the Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lx2hNV"&gt;According to our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, the Buds 2 also don’t have quite the same sound performance as the Plus, offering competent noise cancellation and somewhat mechanized ambient sound. And the Buds 2 are only rated IPX2 for water resistance, as opposed to the Pro’s IPX7.  But they are the least expensive earbuds in Samsung’s lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKa76m"&gt;The Galaxy Buds 2 are &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/audio/headphones/galaxy-buds2-olive-sm-r177nzgaxar/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for preorder&lt;/a&gt; starting today for $149.99, the same price the Galaxy Buds Plus were upon their debut and $50 less than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. For $5 more, you can add a Galaxy SmartTag. They’ll launch alongside the Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G and Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G on August 27th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple settles lawsuit against security startup Corellium</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WpYKpHhGBFJZ8jEeW64xHGEjGa4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710313/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lAYnI7"&gt;Apple has settled its copyright lawsuit against Corellium, a company that sells virtual iPhone environments for security testing. Apple and Corellium agreed to a last-minute settlement yesterday, just days before a trial scheduled for August 16th. The terms of the settlement are confidential, but Corellium confirmed to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/10/apple-drops-corellium-lawsuit/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it would continue to offer virtual iOS systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7D0TY8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/16/20809109/apple-corellium-startup-company-lawsuit-court-virtual-iphone-software-copy"&gt;Apple sued Corellium&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, claiming the company infringed on its iOS copyrights, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047275/apple-corellium-dmca-lawsuit-copyright-research-jailbreak-security-copyright"&gt;expanded the case&lt;/a&gt; with more allegations in 2020. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22205130/apple-corellium-dismissed-copyright-dmca-fair-use"&gt;A judge dismissed&lt;/a&gt; the copyright infringement claims later that year, saying Corellium’s product had a strong fair use case. But the judge let Apple move forward with claims that Corellium violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by breaking iOS copy protection measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzTLiB"&gt;In its complaints, Apple claimed that “Corellium’s business is based entirely on commercializing the illegal replication of the copyrighted operating system and applications that run on Apple’s iPhone, iPad, and other Apple devices.” Corellium countered by saying that Apple was trying to crack down on independent security vendors while launching a competing product. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/29/apple-corellium-lawsuit/"&gt;Court records also indicated&lt;/a&gt; that Apple attempted to acquire the company in 2018 before filing its lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYHhLA"&gt;The lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/section-1201s-harm-security-research-shown-mixed-decision-corellium-case"&gt;highlighted the potential chilling effects&lt;/a&gt; of DMCA Section 1201, a controversial anti-piracy rule that has &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/dmca-security-researcher-statement"&gt;cast a pall&lt;/a&gt; over the repair, software archival, and security research industries. Section 1201 makes it illegal to offer tools and services that circumvent electronic “locks” on copyrighted material, with a handful of exceptions that must be frequently renewed. In June, &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/dmca-security-researcher-statement"&gt;the Electronic Frontier Foundation published&lt;/a&gt; an open letter encouraging companies to cite the law with “great caution and in consideration of broader security concerns, not just for competitive economic advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;
