    <title>Brembo’s ‘intelligent’ brake system could apply pressure to each wheel individually</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LV0f3hAapNMUCiz4LOVkqQzhrs4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70096345/SENSIFY_BREMBO_9.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Brembo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7zqMwi"&gt;High-end Italian brake manufacturer Brembo &lt;a href="https://www.brembo.com/en/ComunicatiStampa/2021/20211025_PR_Brembo_Unveils_ENG.pdf"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in October its plan to release Sensify, an AI-enhanced braking system that promises both “driving pleasure and total safety” when it rolls out via an unnamed manufacturer in 2024. Going beyond anti-lock brakes, traction, and stability control, it replaces hydraulic controls with electronic ones for design flexibility and, potentially, more precise control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XK6gZu"&gt;Incorporating AI into vehicles isn’t new, as algorithms control playlists, maps, driver assistance, and even “self-driving” to various degrees. AI-based brake systems, however, are enough to raise eyebrows about how exactly they will work or enhance safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="raZ6NN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re only as good as the training data you have”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5mACbq"&gt;“As you start to deal with artificial intelligence and neural networks, they’re only as good as the training data you have,” said J. Christian Gerdes, an engineering professor and co-director of the Center of Automotive Research at Stanford University. “If you have a new case that represents something it hasn’t seen before, it’s hard to know in advance what it decides to do.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tFkHg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry-news-tech,-development-and-manufacturing/brembo-sensify-revolutionary-new-ai"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Autocar UK&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Sensify is using a “dedicated app” to program itself based on data and enhance the driving experience. The system supposedly will use predictive algorithms, sensors, and data management tools that give it a “digital brain” capable of controlling each wheel independently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tt3H06"&gt;Gerdes says that modern anti-lock brake systems, first introduced in the 1970s, are a Band-Aid for wheels locking up under heavy braking. “What would make more sense is to have an understanding of what’s going on at each of your wheels. And to then intelligently ask for brake force at different wheels.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Car with various labels describing the Sensify system" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IW6zwPwuEXgQVxgcNc9SYsABWdU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967005/BREMBO_SENSIFY_BRAKE_SYSTEM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Brembo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Brembo Sensify system&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HevVSV"&gt;Despite the digital footprint with AI and Sensify, the physical mechanics have more of a presence compared to the software in the Sensify system, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/brembo-eyes-startup-deals-software-takes-bigger-role-brakes-2021-10-25/"&gt;according to Brembo chief executive Daniele Schillaci&lt;/a&gt;. The exec told &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;“the mechanic and software contents will soon be equivalent and by the end of the decade software will become predominant in braking systems.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ce9huo"&gt;The company plans to open a technology lab in Silicon Valley by the end of the year to further its digital strategies. Brembo says, “Data collection is leveraged to improve the driver experience and allows the system to be constantly updated,” but how it will handle questions like privacy and security of that collected data is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfSICM"&gt;One of Sensify’s benefits is adapting to driving styles, adjusting to weather and road conditions, and shorter locking times. Brembo also says its system will be cheaper over the life of a car because it removes brake fluid by adding electromechanical control, has lower maintenance costs, lower disc consumption, and lower or zero drag torque. In an electric or hybrid vehicle, better control of regenerative braking can help reduce the battery size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zrCkoe"&gt;What happens when there is a hardware failure in that AI brain? In &lt;a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry-news-tech,-development-and-manufacturing/brembo-sensify-revolutionary-new-ai"&gt;a demo for &lt;em&gt;Autocar UK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Brembo explained the system has two ECUs (electronic control units) that are connected as a fail-safe but send their commands separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Es67ej"&gt;The system is set to be released in 2024. Brembo said that it’s designed to work on multiple car types like sedans, racecars, SUVs, and commercial vehicles, but it’s not clear how much it needs to be customized for each type.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 DIY screen replacements break Face ID unless you can microsolder</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Em6G6QkVUlMXgnMLI0x9rZq4sSY=/0x0:1995x1330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70096270/vpavic_210916_untitled_0031.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aSNvSN"&gt;Apple’s new iPhone 13 lineup might pack a lot of new features, but they now have a major restriction that makes it much harder for independent repair shops to replace broken screens. If you try to swap the screen, Face ID just won’t work — that is, unless you know how to microsolder and can successfully move a tiny microcontroller from the original screen to a new one, as detailed &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54829%2Fapples-new-screen-repair-trap-could-change-the-repair-industry-forever&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22764251%2Fiphone-13-screen-replacements-break-face-id-microsolder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in an article from &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPfobS"&gt;The change makes a very common replacement much more difficult for independent repair shops that may rely on screen repairs as a significant part of their business. Authorized Apple shops apparently don’t run into the problem, as they have access to software that “can make an iPhone 13 accept a new screen with a few clicks,” according to &lt;em&gt;iFixit.&lt;/em&gt; But many indie shops aren’t part of Apple’s official Independent Repair Provider program, which reportedly has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126970/apple-iphone-independent-repair-contract-search-audit"&gt;invasive terms&lt;/a&gt;, leaving them to have to try and find a way to repair iPhone screens on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDUwr1"&gt;If you want to see just how involved the microcontroller switch is, check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9MXlhsThmM"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; from iCorrect. The repair is a multi-stage process that looks to take some time and require special equipment. And it’s almost certainly impossible for most iPhone owners to try it on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rni2SA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9MXlhsThmM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WmnXtR"&gt;Apple has steadily been pushing people away from repairs done by indie shops through ominous warnings shown after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20776965/iphone-xs-max-xr-battery-service-third-party-repair"&gt;battery swaps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20884287/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-display-screen-replacement-verification-warning"&gt;screen replacements&lt;/a&gt; for some iPhones. But the situation with Face ID breaking on an iPhone 13 means that people who want a screen repair don’t have many great options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lu0v2F"&gt;An authorized repair &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/screen-replacement"&gt;can be expensive&lt;/a&gt;, as is paying for AppleCare Plus for &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/support/products/iphone/"&gt;reduced screen repair prices&lt;/a&gt;. But when the alternatives include finding an indie shop that has the capability to pull off the delicate microcontroller swap, getting a screen replacement but sacrificing Face ID, or just living with a broken screen, paying up for an authorized repair might feel like the best option, even if it is the worst for your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFfgB9"&gt;Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber prices are still way up, so the company is bringing back carpooling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Uber and Lyft sign in windshield of car, Queens, New York" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w53xIiLeEaXKnbZ6HbgYN0jT3t0=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70096233/1310967778.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NXDYIM"&gt;Uber is preparing to relaunch its carpooling service as a way to combat price increases, officials said in a call with investors. Uber Pool was shuttered in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and remained so even as vaccines became widely available and customers returned to the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk8K6U"&gt;But that could soon change, according to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who hinted that a new shared rides product could be released soon. Along with its rival Lyft, Uber has been struggling to recover from the pandemic, as drivers fled the platform, wait times increased, and the cost of rides soared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfJHwj"&gt;“We are launching an Uber shared pool product,” Khosrowshahi said. “We have been investing for years in a high-capacity product, which is looking more and more attractive as it relates to a unit economic basis, where that can bring the price significantly lower.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XvMe5I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber’s prices are up 20 percent compared to last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pRT2NX"&gt;Uber’s prices are up 20 percent compared to last year, slightly less than they were over the summer but still relatively steep compared to pre-pandemic prices. Introducing a low-cost carpooling service will help ease the demand for Uber’s main ride-hailing products, and hopefully bring those prices down more, Khosrowshahi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZhhyE"&gt;Uber Pool, the service that matches up to three riders in one car based on their destinations, was one of the cheapest options on the company’s platform. But drivers hated it, complaining about low customer ratings, an inefficient algorithm, and roundabout directions that tend to annoy riders despite the low fare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmEa2f"&gt;COVID-19 put a halt to the practice of strangers sharing the backseat of a car. Cities like New York actually banned shared trips in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Lyft also suspended its Lyft Line carpooling service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gk4kWV"&gt;When Uber Pool comes back, it may look different than the pre-pandemic version. Khosrowshahi hinted that it could be more like an employee shuttle service using Uber’s matching technology that the company can sell to its corporate client. A spokesperson called the employee shuttle a “separate effort” from the carpooling service, but declined to share more details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HCQxd"&gt;That likely won’t affect the price of an Uber ride in the near term, though. Khosrowshahi acknowledged that the company is currently involved in “a giant pricing experiment that no one wanted to get into.” The company will continue to struggle with supply and demand problems as the effects of the pandemic continue to be felt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGb1Km"&gt;But Uber reported that its Q3 gross bookings, or the amount of money it takes in before paying drivers, reached an all-time high of $23.1 billion, up 57 percent year over year, despite a 20 percent increase in prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uj9Rcy"&gt;“We’re seeing that as cities reopened, people start using the product,” Khosrowshahi said, “and they use our product a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York City’s mayor-elect says he wants to be paid in Bitcoin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fmGpDd0fTNB9k2CA2GXRG96opZY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70096108/jbareham_180313_1777_bitcoin_cryptocurrency_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UfwR7l"&gt;New York City’s mayor-elect Eric Adams &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericadamsfornyc/status/1456311827550384129"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that he wants his first three city paychecks paid in Bitcoin, in a bid to show up the mayor of Miami and indicate his hopes that New York will be a place where the cryptocurrency industry is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rABvl"&gt;To put it lightly, the feasibility of Adams &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;getting paid in Bitcoin seems dicey. (Is the city’s payroll even set up for that? How will this work with the fluctuating price of Bitcoin? My goodness, what’s the &lt;em&gt;tax&lt;/em&gt; situation going to be like?) Whether it actually happens or not, though, he’s sending a clear message about his intended plans as a mayor — you probably wouldn’t say something like that if you’re going to ignore cryptocurrency and Bitcoin completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sxreEQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In New York we always go big, so I’m going to take my first THREE paychecks in Bitcoin when I become mayor. NYC is going to be the center of the cryptocurrency industry and other fast-growing, innovative industries! Just wait!&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Adams (@ericadamsfornyc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericadamsfornyc/status/1456311827550384129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NZD4jo"&gt;As one of my colleagues noted in Slack, the move is part of a (crypto) wallet-measuring contest with the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez — Adams’ tweet was in response to Suarez saying that he’d take his next paycheck in Bitcoin, and he threw in a remark about New York going big (hence the three paychecks, because three &amp;gt; one). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQTtSM"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/new-york-mayor-elect-eric-adams-to-take-first-3-paychecks-in-bitcoin.html"&gt;CNBC points out&lt;/a&gt;, both mayors are trying to make their cities the center of the decentralized currency space. Adams has promised to look into what’s slowing down crypto investment in New York, and Suarez has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/30/crypto-miamicoin/"&gt;given support to a project called MiamiCoin&lt;/a&gt; that lets people invest crypto into the city. Suarez also said that he hopes the city’s payroll and taxes could one day be paid in Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6olxc"&gt;Culturally speaking, Miami has a head start: Blockchain.com &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crypto-company-blockchaincom-moves-us-headquarters-to-miami-301304969.html"&gt;moved its US operations from New York to Miami earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, and El Salvador’s president announced that the country &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526808/el-salvador-bitcoin-currency-first-country-cryptocurrency"&gt;would be adopting Bitcoin as an official currency&lt;/a&gt; at a Miami conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fvi5i"&gt;As with any political promises or stunts, actions speak much, much louder than words. Adams actually getting a few paychecks in Bitcoin (or getting paid in dollars and immediately converting them into crypto, which would be much easier) won’t really move the needle on the industry. But the fact that he and another prominent mayor are talking about doing it shows a big shift in how (at least some) leaders are thinking about the future of money.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian accused of ‘toxic bro culture’ in gender discrimination lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w_Y0I68lTpknNaP6WKav_-oiEd4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095963/mclark_210923_4776_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3MGjZE"&gt;EV startup Rivian’s former sales and marketing vice president has sued the Amazon-backed company for discrimination, claiming it has a “toxic bro culture that marginalizes women.” The suit, first &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-rivian-executive-sues-for-gender-discrimination-ahead-of-ipo-11636054512?st=ucjb0mosprg2pju&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;comes just days before Rivian is set to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711196/rivian-s-1-ipo-amazon-ford-r1t-electric-pickup-truck"&gt;become a publicly traded company&lt;/a&gt;, and a few weeks after it started delivering its first electric vehicles to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UyVRH"&gt;Laura Schwab, the former VP, says she was fired last month after alerting a human resources executive about discrimination. She sued the company Thursday in Orange County Superior Court, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, though the complaint was not publicly available at the time this article was published. Scwhab also published &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@lauraschwab1/life-outside-the-boys-club-why-i-spoke-up-about-rivians-toxic-bro-culture-and-got-fired-15600b999ae7"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; Thursday titled “Life Outside the Boys Club: Why I Spoke Up About Rivian’s Toxic Bro Culture (and Got Fired).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Up9hM"&gt;A spokesperson for Rivian declined to comment, citing the mandatory quiet period in the run-up to the IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="318d"&gt;Schwab has spent two decades in the automotive industry and joined Rivian in November 2020. She says in the blog post that she was “excited to join a company that was building a brand and its planet-minded vehicles from the ground up &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; that led every conversation with the importance of company culture.” But while Rivian “publicly boasts about [that] culture,” Schwab writes that “it was a crushing blow when I joined the company and almost immediately experienced a toxic bro culture that marginalizes women and contributes to the company making mistakes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hWXFjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“dominated by men at the top”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Un6IVx"&gt;Scwab says she “raised concerns to HR about the gender discrimination from my manager, the ‘boys club’ culture, and the impact it was having on me, my team, and the company.” She was fired two days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hICjw"&gt;Rivian is “dominated by men at the top,” and CEO RJ Scaringe “surrounded himself with a tight knit group of men who constantly had his ear,” Scwhab says. She says she made suggestions about the company’s business plan that got shot down, only to watch the men at the top ultimately accept the same ideas pitched by male colleagues. “Never in my years in the auto industry had I experienced such blatant marginalization,” she writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4836t"&gt;Schwab said she tried to raise these issues with her boss, Rivian’s chief commercial officer, but that she was unable to schedule a meeting with him. She also says she was starting to get left out of other planning meetings. When she asked another female senior executive to help include her, her colleague “informed me that she &lt;em&gt;was also excluded&lt;/em&gt; from these meetings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2E9NL"&gt;“It is unbelievable that two high-level female executives would be left out of these meetings directly impacting their work,” she writes. “This was not the culture that Rivian prided itself on, and I realized that to change it I needed to raise my voice.” After speaking to HR, Schwab says the chief commercial officer finally scheduled a meeting with her, only to fire her. He claimed it was part of a “reorganization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4hIaj"&gt;Scwhab’s account of her time with Rivian comes as employees across the tech industry have been speaking out with greater volume and frequency. Apple employees have spent the last few months &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;organizing and bringing to light stories about harassment and discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. A whistleblower at Facebook recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity"&gt;gave documents to reporters around the world&lt;/a&gt;, and to Congress, after speaking up internally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRmA3H"&gt;Former Pinterest employee Ifeoma Ozoma kicked off a reckoning within that company in 2020 by sharing her own experience with racial discrimination and has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711694/pinterest-whistleblower-ifeoma-ozoma-tech-worker-handbook"&gt;launched the Tech Worker Handbook&lt;/a&gt;, which is meant to guide employees who want to speak out about wrongdoing. Pinterest also settled a gender discrimination suit with its former chief operating officer in late 2020. That former executive was represented by the same firm that has taken up Scwhab’s case, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Taika Waititi is making a movie based on Alejandro Jodorowsky’s The Incal comics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hunt For The Wilderpeople" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2_Hu_HiKG9ElmzSjK077UzEhf9A=/248x0:1400x768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095918/WaititiWilderpeople.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2EVUdI"&gt;Taika Waititi is set to co-write and direct an adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Incal&lt;/em&gt;, the sci-fi graphic novel from writer Alejandro Jodorowsky with art by Jean Giraud, better known as Moebius, according to a report &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/incal-movietaika-waititi-to-direct-1235041908/"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFuDL3"&gt;Jodorowsky’s name has been a popular one in Hollywood recently due to the release of the latest incarnation of &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;earlier this year. Jodorowsky was famously working on a surreal and bizarre adaptation of the novel (alongside Moebius and H.R. Giger), but unfortunately was never able to get any major studios to take the risk on his idea. The journey of that process has since been the subject of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/14/5410996/jodorowskys-dune-documentary-trailer-adaptation-that-never-was"&gt;its own documentary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Jodorowsky’s Dune. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kTYi5a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside the greatest sci-fi film never made","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/27/5554126/jodorowskys-dune-interview-greatest-sci-fi-film-never-made"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pVlvDL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Incal &lt;/em&gt;is also just the first work in a series of connected comics that Jodorowsky wrote (referred to as the Jodoverse), which could see the upcoming film be the start of the kind of long-running franchise that Hollywood has been chasing since the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SutBF"&gt;“The films and graphic novels of Alejandro Jodorowsky have influenced me and so many others for so long. I was stunned to be given the opportunity to bring his iconic characters to life and I am grateful to Alejandro, Fabrice and everyone at Humanoids for trusting me to do so,” Waititi commented in a statement to &lt;em&gt;THR&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXsU4M"&gt;The project is just one of several for the busy Waititi, who’s also currently working on the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt; (out July 8th), &lt;em&gt;Next Goal Wins &lt;/em&gt;(a movie about the American Samoan soccer team’s attempt to qualify for the 2004 World Cup), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246620/new-star-wars-movie-taika-waititi-disney-plus-series-leslye-headland"&gt;a currently untitled &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; film&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://movieweb.com/akira-movie-release-date-canceled/"&gt;on-hold&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/24/18638777/akira-live-action-taika-waititi-thor-ragnarok-warner-bros-release-date"&gt;live-action &lt;em&gt;Akira &lt;/em&gt;adaptation&lt;/a&gt;, a film sequel to &lt;em&gt;What We Do In The Shadows&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/flash-gordon-film-taika-waititi-live-action"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flash Gordon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; remake, and &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/03/taika-waititi-netflix-animated-series-roald-dahl-charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-oompa-loompas-1202875032/"&gt;two animated Roald Dahl shows&lt;/a&gt; for Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GoPro says the chip shortage won’t affect holiday sales</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_0d6axqPQczxL3pqD_HAuJmIrI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095787/bfarsace_210909_4746_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z9B6sv"&gt;GoPro &lt;a href="https://investor.gopro.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/GoPro-Announces-Third-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the global chip and other supply chain shortages won’t affect its holiday sales this year, meaning the action camera company is poised to finish one of its best years in recent memory in strong fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5jhL8"&gt;“Despite supply chain constraints that are affecting many industries, we have successfully partnered with our suppliers to produce inventory to support our fourth-quarter revenue expectations,” CEO Nick Woodman said while &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001500435/000150043521000065/gpro2021-09x30exh992xer.htm"&gt;discussing the company’s third-quarter financial results on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. “GoPro.com and our retail partners will be stocked and ready for shoppers this holiday season.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLfdGb"&gt;That’s especially good news for GoPro’s bottom line because the new Hero10 Black is selling incredibly well despite the higher $499 price tag. GoPro said Thursday that 98 percent of the roughly 800,000 cameras it sold in the third quarter were at or above the $300 price tag — up from 83 percent in the third quarter of 2020. The average sale price for cameras in the quarter was $381, up 25 percent year over year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zZyJIM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The GoPro Hero10: small step for the Hero10, big leap for GoPro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bD4oaZ"&gt;GoPro has also been increasingly shifting to a direct-sales model over the last few years — nearly a third of its revenue this past quarter came from sales on GoPro.com — which means it’s making more on every camera sold. The company said Thursday that it booked $14 million in revenue this past quarter for its subscription service, too, which now has over 1.34 million customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfoyaW"&gt;All that adds up to the company’s best third quarter since 2017. GoPro booked $317 million in revenue and about $49 million in profit. (The company reported a quarterly profit of $312 million, though $263 million of that was attributed to a wonky deferred tax situation.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkoOha"&gt;GoPro’s best quarter every year, though, is the final one. The holiday season has always been kind to the camera company, even in its darkest years. With the Hero 10 Black already doing well and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20954058/gopro-q3-earnings-hero-8-black-sales-figures-revenue"&gt;memories of layoffs and failed products getting fuzzier&lt;/a&gt;, it could turn out to be one of the company’s biggest quarters since its blockbuster holiday season in 2014 — which was when it broke into the mainstream with the Hero4 cameras. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly will start phasing out mask requirements for US retail store customers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man wearing a face mask is seen outside an Apple retail store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-grsg9Sg0X49OeTVZzFNyDnb4QQ=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095412/1232558252.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple is reportedly going to lift mask requirements for customers at some of its retail stores in the US. | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I0ozwj"&gt;Apple is reportedly planning to begin ending mask requirements for customers at some of its US retail stores as early as Friday (via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;). The company told employees about the change in an internal memo on Thursday,&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported, saying the decision was based on a decline in coronavirus cases and a rise in vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVxdeW"&gt;Like many companies with multiple locations, Apple has changed its masking requirements for customers more than once since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic last year. In March 2020, the company closed most of its retail stores &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/17/21261921/apple-stores-reopening-plans-us-locations"&gt;as the virus spread&lt;/a&gt;. It began reopening &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/17/21261921/apple-stores-reopening-plans-us-locations"&gt;some US stores in May 2020&lt;/a&gt;, with many offering only curbside service and not allowing customers inside. Most stores that did open to customers conducted temperature checks and required customers and employees to wear masks. Apple began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307723/apple-stores-reopened-us-retail-open"&gt;reopening all its US retail stores in March 2021&lt;/a&gt; as vaccines became more widely available and eased mask requirements for &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/apple-s-u-s-stores-offices-to-start-dropping-mask-requirement"&gt;customers in June&lt;/a&gt; as vaccination rates began to rise, only to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598686/apple-retail-stores-mask-mandate-requirement"&gt;reinstate them in July&lt;/a&gt; as COVID-19 cases surged once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESRxKQ"&gt;The latest memo states that the updated mask policy will apply to retail customers at more than 100 of Apple’s 270 US stores and will be the same for vaccinated and unvaccinated customers. Mask requirements for Apple retail employees will remain in place, however, and will continue for customers in areas where local governments still require indoor masking. The company added that it will “continue to monitor local guidance and Covid data” throughout the coming holiday season and adjust as conditions warrant, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAiyqz"&gt;Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oog2t8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create a signature for PDF documents on an Android phone </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5oizS_GANTpgtYInVRbIaqiy_-0=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095406/Screenshot_20211104_150854.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFc8fJ"&gt;Sometimes there’s no way around it — you’ve got to use an app. If you need to sign a PDF document from your Android phone, that’s simply how you’ve got to go — unlike iOS, which lets you create a signature using its built-in Markup app, you need to find a third-party source. There are a variety of apps available, but the most well-known is the free version of Adobe Acrobat Reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fTfgT"&gt;So if you want to be able to sign off on contracts and other PDF documents without having to grab your computer, here’s how to use the Android version of Acrobat to do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6iryGy"&gt;Download and install Adobe Acrobat Reader from the Play Store. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bsdKWZ"&gt;Sign in (or create an account); if you’ve just installed the app, you may have to go through a number of popups offering directions and advice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gyD2IX"&gt;Tap the “Files” icon at the bottom of the screen. It will give you access not only to files saved on your device (you will have to allow access to all files first) but to those saved on Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, Adobe’s Document Cloud. You can also search for PDFs that are attached to Gmail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="On Acrobat’s main screen, select File on the bottom menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KWtapISEWocTJYCTl3526mzFdhM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986242/Screenshot_20211104_130819.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Acrobat’s main screen, select File on the bottom menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can download a PDF from a variety of sources." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CQ8Q6Pun7TFxKpyA_S9eo2FtDCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986245/Screenshot_20211104_100806.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can download a PDF from a variety of sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="UqHsDi"&gt;I chose Google Drive. I was invited to access Google Drive and PDFs from Gmail using the same email account; I also had to give the app access to your Google account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tO75ZI"&gt;However you decide to go, choose your source and tap on your PDF file to bring it up in Acrobat. Then tap on the “Edit” icon in the lower right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once you’ve got your PDF, select the edit icon in the corner." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/981TTRy24sKm49S3jGy-gviV2Pc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986248/Screenshot_20211104_113011.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once you’ve got your PDF, select the edit icon in the corner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Fill &amp;amp;amp; Sign.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LXBxhx2YZLYdj_kwxSyidIH3ePI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986252/Screenshot_20211104_113317.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Fill &amp;amp; Sign.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ci4TM1"&gt;Select “Fill &amp;amp; Sign.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Q9befJ"&gt;Tap on the signature icon in the lower right corner (it looks like a pen nib) and select “Create Signature” (or “Create Initials” if that’s all you need).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on the pen icon in the lower right corner." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GWI4ZekwKSkjeDOwYcYaBiBUDHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986256/Screenshot_20211104_113437.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on the pen icon in the lower right corner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Now you can create a signature." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kMBih2FOWKeDssvSINbluOcGWoI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986261/Screenshot_20211104_113536.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now you can create a signature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="PlPxjM"&gt;You’ll get a “Sign Here” box in landscape mode with the options (above the box) to draw your signature, insert an image, or use your camera to photograph a signature drawn on paper. When you’re ready, tap on “Done” in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can draw your signature on the screen, use an existing image, or take a photo." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/34F6-C2tGppDjCwsjnTMXKuvNP8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986262/Screenshot_20211104_113844.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can draw your signature on the screen, use an existing image, or take a photo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9kS0Gr"&gt;You’ll be returned to your PDF document. Tap on the area where you want your signature placed. It will appear in a box; you can pull on the sides of the box to make your signature larger or smaller, or tap on the trash icon (that will also appear) to get rid of it. When you’re done, select the checkmark in the upper left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MBJj4G"&gt;And you’re done! In the future, when you go into “Fill &amp;amp; Sign” and select the signature icon, the signature you just created will be there to drop into your document. If you want to try again, you can tap the “minus” sign to the right of the signature to delete it.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>DoorDash adds in-app safety features, but couriers need more protection</title>

  &lt;p id="wMt3Ur"&gt;DoorDash is &lt;a href="https://doordash.news/2021/11/03/doordash-launches-safedash/"&gt;adding a set of tools for its delivery workers called “SafeDash,”&lt;/a&gt; which includes a way to contact an agent from the ADT security company or to call 911 through ADT. The company is first launching the tool in major cities like Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco, but says it’ll roll out to all its US couriers by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYPydm"&gt;While it’s good that DoorDash is acknowledging the dangers its delivery workers face, some advocates say that SafeDash won’t help solve the problems of thieves targeting them for their money or bikes, and the apps giving them routes that put them in harm’s way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UXgXK"&gt;According to DoorDash, SafeDash will give delivery workers a button that will have an ADT agent call them if they feel unsafe. That ADT agent will also be able to contact the authorities if the driver is unresponsive, or if something obviously goes wrong. Delivery workers will also be able to skip the call in an emergency situation and have ADT contact 911 for them. The security company will be able to give the Dasher’s GPS location to the police and will communicate with the delivery worker through text so they can relay information to authorities without having to actually talk out loud.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k9ZJI2"&gt;Those who work for DoorDash and other services like it face a variety of dangers posed by inattentive drivers, poor infrastructure, the weather, and other people. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; detailed the danger bike delivery workers in New York City can face when their route includes going over bridges or through tunnels where they’re often ambushed by people looking to steal the expensive e-bikes they need to stay competitive. Through it all, they’re expected to complete deliveries on time — otherwise, they worry they might be downgraded and get fewer gig offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Iytj6F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Revolt of the delivery workers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hzxfdl"&gt;One of DoorDash’s competitors, Uber, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17402172/uber-911-panic-button-app-live-us"&gt;also has a panic button&lt;/a&gt; that works in a similar way for drivers, couriers, and riders. But some delivery workers, whose work puts them at risk of injury and robbery, feel like a technology-based solution isn’t going to fix the issue. “We don’t need an app to call 911,” Hildalyn Colón-Hernández from the Worker’s Justice Project told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, she says, workers need to be able to choose areas that they feel safe working, and not face penalties for prioritizing their safety over a completed delivery. While New York City &lt;a href="https://www.romanolaw.com/2021/09/30/special-delivery-new-yorks-new-protections-for-food-delivery-workers/"&gt;is working on legislation&lt;/a&gt; to codify those kinds of protections into law, protections will still be needed for workers in other cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w324tY"&gt;Hernández says that by adding the SafeDash feature, DoorDash is signaling that it knows it has a responsibility to keep its workers safe, which it hasn’t necessarily done enough in the past. The dangers delivery workers face have been shown in reports by both advocacy organizations like &lt;a href="https://losdeliveristasunidos.org/ldu-report"&gt;the WJP and Los Deliveristas Unidos&lt;/a&gt;, and from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;media outlets like &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but until recently they haven’t been faced head-on by companies, legislators, or &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/storm-ida-food-delivery-drivers-wade-through-waist-high-floods-2021-9?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;even customers&lt;/a&gt;. They’re still an everyday reality for delivery workers, though — Hernández says that 19 NYC Deliveristas have died on the job in the past 18 months alone, and there &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/doordash-adds-safety-features-protect-drivers-80949644"&gt;have been other incidents throughout the country&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qSsCQp"&gt;While delivery apps may be beginning to acknowledge that they have a role to play in keeping their workers safe, society is still grappling with how gig workers should be treated. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;California voters passed Proposition 22&lt;/a&gt; almost exactly a year ago, which made it legal for companies like DoorDash, Lyft, and Uber to classify their workers as contractors instead of employees (and therefore exempt them from benefits like company-provided health insurance). The law &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/21/22635286/judge-rules-california-prop-22-gig-workers-law-unconstitutional"&gt;has since been ruled as unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
