    <title>Facebook reportedly under probe for ‘systemic’ racial bias in hiring and promotions </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9ic76E"&gt;The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is looking into allegations of racial bias and hiring practices at Facebook, a probe which the agency has designated as “systemic,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-workers-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-agency-probes-facebook-for-systemic-racial-bias-in-hiring-promotions-idUSKBN2AY006"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdqtPk"&gt;In July, Facebook employee Oscar Veneszee, Jr., who is Black, filed a complaint with the EEOC along with two people Veneszee recruited but whom Facebook did not hire. The complaint alleges that the social platform discriminates against Black job applicants and employees  and promotes racial stereotypes. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/02/886544638/we-have-a-black-people-problem-facebook-worker-claims-racial-discrimination"&gt;Veneszee told NPR&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook has “a Black people problem,” and that the company has failed to create a culture to attract and retain Black workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TO3qwC"&gt;The EEOC has not brought allegations against Facebook, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes, and the agency’s investigation may not produce findings of any wrongdoing on the company’s part. Designating the probe as “systemic” suggests the EEOC may suspect Facebook’s hiring policies are contributing to widespread discrimination, and such a designation could pave the way for a possible class action lawsuit, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. The EEOC did not immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTL2bm"&gt;The complaint is reminiscent of earlier criticisms of Facebook’s diversity. In 2018, Facebook’s then-partnerships manager Mark Luckie &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-s-luckie/facebook-is-failing-its-black-employees-and-its-black-users/1931075116975013/"&gt;published an internal memo&lt;/a&gt; sent to his co-workers on his last day at the company, where he said the company mistreated its Black employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HVQNvB"&gt;“In some buildings, there are more ‘Black Lives Matter’ posters than there are actual black people,” Luckie wrote. “Facebook can’t claim that it is connecting communities if those communities aren’t represented proportionately in its staffing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IVdnVr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325410/facebook-diversity-report-2020-black-hispanic-women-people-of-color-technical-roles"&gt;Facebook’s 2020 diversity report&lt;/a&gt; showed the company was still short of its goal to have 50 percent of its workforce from underrepresented groups by 2024; that figure inched up from 43 percent in 2019 to 45.3 percent in 2020. Last June, Facebook employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21277135/facebook-walkout-protest-virtual-president-donald-trump-posts"&gt;staged a virtual walkout&lt;/a&gt; over the company’s decision not to take action against posts from former President Trump, including a post that included the phrase “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” seen as a threat toward people protesting racial violence across the country last summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lxfigm"&gt;Facebook did not immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday but told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; ”it is essential to provide all employees with a respectful and safe working environment. We take any allegations of discrimination seriously and investigate every case.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 vaccine supplies are on the rise in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Johnson Vaccine Rollout Continues From Kentucky" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ANwa06A0yci1g7bMW-Hrb0v4l8=/12x0:6048x4024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68922526/1231514913.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yrD0XW"&gt;The US government is feeling optimistic about vaccines. By the end of May, it should have enough to vaccinate every adult in the country, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/us/politics/merck-johnson-johnson-vaccine.html"&gt;President Joe Biden said on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXduHa"&gt;Not only that, but Americans are feeling pretty good about the vaccine, too. About 69 percent of Americans had either already gotten the vaccine or were willing to get one when they could, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/03/05/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-plan-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine%E2%80%94or-already-have/"&gt;new survey from Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5mtXX"&gt;That’s a huge relief to public health experts. Last year, they watched vaccine polling numbers &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/09/17/u-s-public-now-divided-over-whether-to-get-covid-19-vaccine/"&gt;drop dramatically&lt;/a&gt; during just four months. In September 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21452244/covid-vaccine-worries-antivaxxer-trump-trust-coronavirus"&gt;only half of people polled&lt;/a&gt; said they’d be willing to take a hypothetical vaccine. Not exactly surprising, given that, at the time, the Trump administration was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/16/trump-says-he-thinks-us-could-start-distributing-a-coronavirus-vaccine-in-october.html"&gt;promising to have vaccines in October&lt;/a&gt;, and people were worried that the &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/07/trump-says-no-presidents-ever-pushed-the-fda-like-him-vaccine-coming-very-shortly.html"&gt;approval process would be influenced by politics&lt;/a&gt;. Now that the vaccines are here — and real, and effective — more people want to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="3gDZ0M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="srKsQP"&gt;The next big challenge will be actually getting that ample vaccine supply into those willing arms. And just because the government predicts it will have enough supplies secured by May 31st, that doesn’t mean that every adult in America will be vaccinated in the next 86 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrJ2F2"&gt;“The vaccine race now is not a race out of the lab. It’s a race to the patient,” said Robin Townley, the head of special projects logistics for A.P. Moller-Maersk, in an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-vaccine-last-mile-logistics-pfizer-moderna"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt; from December&lt;/a&gt;. “It is the largest product launch in the history of humankind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrcUWm"&gt;The figurative “last mile” that separates a patient from their shot is going to be the most involved part of this entire process. Shipping larger amounts of vaccines from a factory to a distribution center is relatively straightforward, even with some of the vaccines needing to stay extremely cold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hOQtdO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is the largest product launch in the history of humankind.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hL4OEn"&gt;But then they have to get from large centers to pharmacies, nursing homes, mass-vaccination sites, and anywhere else that’s getting vaccines. That means having enough delivery vehicles on the road and enough freezer and refrigerator space cleared out. It means backup generators and &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/02/18/the-logistics-of-vaccination-overcoming-last-mile-delivery-challenges/?sh=6355e32574a7"&gt;detailed communication plans&lt;/a&gt; for the inevitable moment when something goes wrong. It means finding better ways to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"&gt;vaccine appointments&lt;/a&gt; so that people can access vaccine supplies. Above all, it’s going to need a trained, fast workforce that’s able to transport the vaccine, store it, and administer it safely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dw45f"&gt;Poor planning and delays contributed to a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/us/vaccine-ca-california-coronavirus.html"&gt;slowed-down&lt;/a&gt; US rollout earlier this year, when local officials were mostly &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/31/health/vaccine-distribution-delays.html"&gt;left to figure out distribution themselves&lt;/a&gt;. As mass-vaccination sites open, and supplies increase, some of those delays are starting to disappear. Back in December, the US &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/31/us-vaccine-rollout-falling-far-short-of-20-million-jabs-by-2021"&gt;had only vaccinated 2.8 million people&lt;/a&gt;, falling well short of its 20 million people goal. Now, more than 82 million people have been vaccinated, with about 2 million shots being administered every day, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/01/28/960901166/how-is-the-covid-19-vaccination-campaign-going-in-your-state"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBDMGx"&gt;Over the next few months, the things to watch will be not just the number of vaccines available, but also the number of vaccines administered. It’s still going to be a huge challenge, but there’s an end in sight. It might still be difficult to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/travel/vaccine-vacation-planning.html"&gt;make travel plans&lt;/a&gt; and the summer could be up in the air — but &lt;em&gt;if &lt;/em&gt;vaccinations go well, and &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; we can curb the spread of highly transmissible variants (big if), &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/life-return-normal-experts-summer-fall/story?id=76277557"&gt;this fall could look a lot more like normal&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="bKNKrO"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s vaccine can be stored at refrigerated temperatures and only requires one dose. That makes it an attractive option for people wanting to increase vaccine equity in the US and around the world. Those vaccines are also proving to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315138/covid-vaccine-single-shot-johnson-distribution"&gt;popular at vaccination sites around the country&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Razer Blade 15 Base review: losing its edge</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Some new specs aside, this laptop has changed very little since 2018&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QkAjVN"&gt;Razer’s Blade 15 Base isn’t broken necessarily, but it could use a tune-up anyway. It’s emblematic of the company’s excellent design chops — stuck in a loop of flexing it in practically the same way as last year and the year before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KOoorX"&gt;The laptop’s all-aluminum build is still impressive to see and use. And yes, it has a webcam, unlike some of the gaming laptops we’ve reviewed recently. But the effect it gives off is getting stale, and Razer still hasn’t addressed all of the annoyances that have been present since this design debuted in 2018. It’s a magnet for fingerprints and smudges, and for a laptop that starts at $1,699.99, its lack of any biometric login method is baffling. You’ll need to type in your password or PIN every time you log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDYTy6"&gt;It’s no longer as ahead of the pack in terms of design as Razer might hope. Some competing machines, like Asus Zephyrus G15 and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;MSI GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt;, are thinner, lighter, and priced aggressively to take on the Blade, with the same (or more) features in tow. 2021 could be the year when other manufacturers catch up or overtake it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2rt9Sl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10376126"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9TzYqW"&gt;We’ll need to wait and see if Razer’s next steps for this laptop are more exciting than what the early 2021 model serves up, but at least some of the improved specs inside make it feel a little fresh. The $2,199 high-end “Base” configuration I’ve been testing features the Nvidia RTX 3070 graphics chip along with Razer’s first QHD screen in a laptop. Those are new specs for 2021, and Razer’s among the first to ship a machine featuring them both. But there are some issues at the starting block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Base " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yeByAYdWmgP0_OG8yiVZUfGEWSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336711/cfaulkner_210228_4451_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The design is gorgeous, and few manufacturers can match Razer’s all-aluminum chassis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pPAh4E"&gt;I’ll get to the specifics in a bit, but right up front, I have to let you know that the latest Nvidia driver more or less can render the Blade unusable if you toggle the wrong setting. Basically, the built-in Razer Synapse software defaults to using Nvidia Optimus, a technology that switches between integrated and dedicated graphics as needed for efficiency and performance. Unfortunately, if you install the latest GeForce driver from Nvidia and try to switch to using the RTX 3070 as the dedicated GPU at all times, it’ll no longer display an image. You’ll need to completely reset the machine, wiping all of your data from it. So as of the date this was published, this laptop actually &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;a little broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7GEPo"&gt;Razer says it’s working on a solution with Nvidia, and I’m confident it’ll figure this out. But it’s only fair to test this machine with the outdated drivers — just as anyone who buys this laptop right now will have to do. Even with older software, it performs about as well as I expected for gaming, given this RTX 3070’s specific specs. Razer recently started to publicly disclose the detailed specs of its GPUs on its site (which can vary wildly at the manufacturer’s discretion), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;as Nvidia now requires&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gx0Mm3"&gt;The RTX 3070 graphics chip in this configuration has a maximum power draw of 95W with a clock speed of 1,290MHz (boosting up to 1,410MHz). Unsurprisingly, given this laptop’s thin build, the GPU can’t run wild compared to the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22244409/msi-gp66-leopard-gaming-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;MSI’s GP66 Leopard&lt;/a&gt;. But that’s not to say it isn’t capable for gaming. Though, in its current state, other intensive tasks like exporting 4K video don’t fare as well. I’ll touch on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Base " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q1jr2LGiI4qn_e9ME3UCwm6tgJc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336710/cfaulkner_210228_4451_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard layout got an update last year, serving as one of the few visible tweaks Razer has made to this laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QJRpLr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; running at 1440p with ultra graphical settings enabled averaged 53 frames per second. &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;, also running at its highest settings with ray-tracing shadows set to ultra, displayed an average of 46 frames per second. I wanted to easily test more games, but I, unfortunately, ran out of space on the 512GB SSD that’s included by default with the Blade 15 Base. Of course, I juggled things around to get more testing done, but this amount of storage is insulting in a $2,199 laptop. It’s a minor consolation that more NVMe M.2 storage can be added with its second open slot, but you’ll have to front that cost. Back to testing, the open-world game &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn,&lt;/em&gt; with all of the graphical tricks set to ultra, ran at an average of 71 frames per second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="2YLGJW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10376147"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ninOjL"&gt;The Blade 15 Base performs worse by a small margin when compared to the new Asus Zephyrus G15, which also features a QHD screen and a slightly more powerful RTX 3070 (same clock speed but with a higher 100W power ceiling). In real-world usage, you might notice Asus’ laptop doing a few extra frames per second better, like we did. Otherwise, performance should be similar. In short, it nearly meets the bar for smooth 60 frames per second gameplay at QHD resolution, and knocking down a graphical setting or two should get you there in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgBMAR"&gt;Interestingly, both laptops make ponying up more money to get the RTX 3080 in a thin laptop next to pointless. These machines perform nearly as well with QHD gaming as the MSI GS66 Stealth that has a QHD screen with an RTX 3080 clocked at 1,245MHz and 95W and costs $2,599. Doing some research could really put some money back in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xb8S8D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This RTX 3070 performs nearly as well with QHD gaming as the 3080&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4pbG9Z"&gt;Like my experience with MSI’s QHD screen, I’m surprised that Razer’s QHD 165Hz refresh rate panel is its first in a laptop because it’s a very good first effort. The viewing angles are generous, the colors are rich but accurate, and of course, the big pixel density boost looks fantastic. The jump from 1080p to 1440p is noticeable during everyday tasks like hanging out in a browser or playing games. Text pops with clarity, and watching content or playing games in the native QHD resolution makes for a better experience than a 1080p panel can provide. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;I think it’s worth paying a premium for&lt;/a&gt;, and the extra $200 cost Razer asks is on par with other manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mvyzv"&gt;As I mentioned before, Nvidia’s driver (at the time of publishing) is causing some issues on the Blade 15 Base. I didn’t notice problems while gaming or during general use, but its ability to do things like export 4K video is severely limited. The most damning example of this is our Adobe Premiere Pro test, where we export a five-minute, 33-second project from our &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;video team to see how long it takes. With the default driver, it took six minutes, 40 seconds. I went ahead and downloaded the new driver, just to see how much of an improvement it can make. The same test only took three minutes, 46 seconds. That’s where we expect performance to be for these specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Base" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BcmqxK-iW0Gq9E3SRkEFQBisVD0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336713/cfaulkner_210228_4451_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can customize the backlit keyboard to be as bright and colorful or dim as you please.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="FzDpLz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10376140"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9KCCKi"&gt;If you’ve used any of Razer’s Blade laptops in the past few years, you’ve essentially used them all. If not, you’re in for a treat with its keyboard and trackpad, which are among the best around. The keyboard has backlit keys, and you can customize their color or lighting pattern to be as extravagant or subtle as you prefer. Razer fixed the &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tqi6q2kSdWQ3OKu2gPjeWRjLNPg=/0x0:2040x1360/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19367231/akrales_191107_3772_0057.jpg"&gt;problematic arrangement of its directional keys&lt;/a&gt; starting with last year’s model, so the layout is just as ideal for my 9-to-5 workflow as it is for gaming. Unlike every other laptop Razer currently makes, this one doesn’t have a Windows Hello-enabled IR webcam or any other biometric login method. It’s a disappointing omission, but sadly, not a new one. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17485494/razer-blade-15-review-gaming-laptop"&gt;Our review from June 2018&lt;/a&gt; criticized that year’s Blade 15 for the same thing, citing that the power button, which looks like (and should be) a fingerprint reader, isn’t one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgBkmQ"&gt;The arrangement of ports should be suitable for most people, but it’s one of the key areas where this Base model differs from the more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;Blade 15 Advanced model&lt;/a&gt;. Both have a Thunderbolt 3 port and an HDMI 2.1 port (capable of up to 4K resolution at 120 frames per second) in common. Outside of that, Ethernet is exclusive to the Base configurations, while the Advanced models have a slew of exclusive ports and features, including a UHS-III full-sized SD card reader, a Windows Hello IR webcam, up to 20V charging via USB-C, along with Bluetooth 5.2 and Wi-Fi 6E. I’d happily trade an Ethernet port for an SD card reader in the Base, but getting one in a 15-inch Razer gaming laptop will bump the cost up to $2,499 at minimum — and you’ll lose the Ethernet port. The strategy of sectioning off ports based on the model cost is outdated and out of touch, given that this machine is nearly just as capable for creators and gamers as the Advanced model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PwcRNt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;First-time Blade 15 buyers will adore this machine for several reasons&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vznjV6"&gt;The last thing I’ll touch on is the heating and cooling, which is something Razer has struggled a bit with past models. During gaming, this one gets toasty as well, but it doesn’t seem noticeably worse than before. It also didn’t cross my threshold of what I’d consider to be a loud laptop, even during intensive loads. Also, its 65Wh battery can last about six hours. That’s Razer’s claim for longevity, and my experience matches up with it when in battery saver mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nRRdU"&gt;The Blade 15 is a competent, well-designed gaming laptop that first-time buyers will adore for many reasons. This particular configuration is noteworthy as the first Base with a luscious QHD display, and with it, the RTX 3070 performs well for both gaming and productivity. The lack of biometrics and an SD card reader might be bothersome for some, though, since the step-up Advanced model has both. Beyond that, it’s tough to give the Blade 15 Base a pass again when it’s getting easier to find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;other similarly priced thin and light gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt; with just as many features and sleek designs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple to stop selling iMac Pro base model, which is listed as available ‘while supplies last’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xV0wrJwOqKM0YdwIvufCLd_sflI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68922212/jbareham_171213_2180_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The iMac Pro was first introduced in 2017 | Photo James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="crCdu2"&gt;In a sign that the iMac Pro is on the way out, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac-pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F6%2F22316831%2Fapple-store-imac-pro-base-model-while-supplies-last" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;only model currently available&lt;/a&gt; for purchase on the Apple Store website is the $4,999 base configuration, “while supplies last.” As first &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/06/apple-discontinues-imac-pro-apple-store-says-buy-while-supplies-last/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all build-to-order configurations for the iMac Pro have been removed from Apple’s site (but may still be available at third-party retailers like Amazon). Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; once supplies of the base model run out, iMac Pro will no longer be available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FC56W-wMtMpr1uWQt3-A1zlWfTg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22349982/buy_imac_pro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Kim Lyons/The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A screengrab of the Apple Store listing for the iMac Pro on March 6th, 2021&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O0NIJ2"&gt;It’s not a huge surprise that Apple may be phasing out the iMac Pro; there have been well-sourced reports that the company will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233191/apple-silicon-redesigned-imac-mac-pro-rumor-features"&gt;introducing a redesigned iMac&lt;/a&gt; and doing a revamp of the Mac Pro sometime this year. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-plans-redesigned-imac-new-mac-pro-smaller-mac-pro-cheaper-monitor?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported in January&lt;/a&gt; that the overhaul would get rid of the “chin” beneath the screen, and have a flat-back design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3wXiN"&gt;Apple hasn’t officially deemed the iMac Pro as discontinued, but it’s unusual for the company to use “while supplies last” in its product listings. In the meantime, the 27-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353899/apple-imac-2020-webcam-price-specs-release-date-announcement"&gt;iMac introduced in August&lt;/a&gt; is a solid option Apple says is popular among professional iMac users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTSizt"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15741540/apple-imac-pro-announced-price-specs-release-date-wwdc-2017"&gt;launched the iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 with an eye toward gaming, VR, and high-end editing and graphics work. It was first unveiled at the Worldwide Developers Conference that year, with Apple touting it as “the most powerful Mac ever,” replacing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15175994/apple-mac-pro-failure-admission"&gt;outdated Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; line. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gaming ruled this week’s best deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iQ_XoeFVh2bIzxir6oLHKwU9i98=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68922074/akrales_190429_3371_0087.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HXj0QY"&gt;This was another week of gaming dominating our deals coverage. That’s mostly because my colleague Taylor Lyles has been diligently keeping readers in the know about every (fleeting, sadly) restocking of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21440300/ps5-playstation-5-preorder-price-release-date-buy"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437954/xbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date"&gt;Xbox Series X / S&lt;/a&gt; consoles. Outside of consoles, there are some good game deals happening, in addition to tech that might be able to make gaming more enjoyable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Dk7MIx"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VBQJbj"&gt;Save on this speedy 1TB external SSD from Crucial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Xz1rwb"&gt;Whether you need a fast external drive for plugging into a PS5, Xbox Series X, or PC, this Crucial model is a good deal at $125. Its low-profile design means it can fit easily in most entertainment centers or desk arrangements, and it ships with a USB Type-A adapter in case your device doesn’t have a USB-C port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7IkVEF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371534"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oKlYWt"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eZgQbd"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;THPS 1+2&lt;/em&gt; is $25, a bargain if you plan to upgrade to the PS5 version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="m5EtGx"&gt;Best Buy is selling the PS4 version of the &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 &lt;/em&gt;collection for $25. That’s a good deal for the game, and even better for PS5 owners hoping to get the graphical update later in March. That update will cost $10 when it launches, totaling $35 altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IyS78L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10248596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rde6Lu"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tzv8Rs"&gt;Oculus offers refurbished Quest headsets for $200 off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DNer5j"&gt;If you want to dip into VR with a good headset but don’t want to shell out $300 for the Quest 2, check out this deal straight from Oculus. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s selling refurbished original Quest headsets for $200&lt;/a&gt;. These come in brand-new condition and have a full one-year warranty attached. They can run all games made for Quest, including PC VR games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301151/oculus-store-virtual-desktop-native-pc-vr-game-streaming-quest-2"&gt;if you purchase the Virtual Desktop app for Quest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J43I0k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10375901"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Move over, SolarWinds: 30,000 orgs’ email hacked via Microsoft Exchange Server flaws</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DA37sYLrtMciQ45kYXShC58RVZ8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68920934/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VVJVnq"&gt;Four exploits found in Microsoft’s Exchange Server software have reportedly led to over 30,000 US governmental and commercial organizations having their emails hacked, according to &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/at-least-30000-u-s-organizations-newly-hacked-via-holes-in-microsofts-email-software/"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-microsoft-exchange-server-hack-victims/"&gt;is also reporting&lt;/a&gt; “tens of thousands of email servers” hacked. The exploits have been patched by Microsoft, but security experts talking to &lt;em&gt;Krebs &lt;/em&gt;say that the detection and cleanup process will be a massive effort for the thousands of state and city governments, fire and police departments, school districts, financial institutions, and other organizations that were affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNlXNi"&gt;According to Microsoft, the vulnerabilities allowed hackers to gain access to email accounts, and also gave them the ability to install malware that might let them back into those servers at a later time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCnRj6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krebs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-microsoft-exchange-server-hack-victims/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;report that the attack was carried out by Hafnium, a Chinese hacking group. While Microsoft hasn’t spoken to the scale of the attack, it &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F03%2F02%2Fhafnium-targeting-exchange-servers%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F5%2F22316189%2Fmicrosoft-exchange-server-security-exploit-china-attack-30000-organizations" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also points to the same group&lt;/a&gt; as having exploited the vulnerabilities, saying that it has “high confidence” that the group is state-sponsored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66Ncq6"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/em&gt;, the attack has been ongoing since January 6th (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;the day of the riot&lt;/a&gt;), but ramped up in late February. Microsoft released its patches on March 2nd, which means that the attackers had almost two months to carry out their operations. The president of cyber security firm Volexity, which discovered the attack, told &lt;em&gt;Krebs&lt;/em&gt; that “if you’re running Exchange and you haven’t patched this yet, there’s a very high chance that your organization is already compromised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbLbRF"&gt;Both the White House National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, and former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Chris Krebs (no relation to &lt;em&gt;KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/em&gt;) have tweeted about the severity of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nmnADt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is the real deal. If your organization runs an OWA server exposed to the internet, assume compromise between 02/26-03/03. Check for 8 character aspx files in C:\\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\system_web\. If you get a hit on that search, you’re now in incident response mode. &lt;a href="https://t.co/865Q8cc1Rm"&gt;https://t.co/865Q8cc1Rm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Krebs (@C_C_Krebs) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/C_C_Krebs/status/1367673471669526528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="trcEWs"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/02/multiple-security-updates-released-for-exchange-server/"&gt;has released&lt;/a&gt; several security updates to fix the vulnerabilities, and suggests that they be installed immediately. It is worth noting that, if your organization uses Exchange Online, it will not have been affected — the exploit was only present on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1366943160572796929?s=20"&gt;self-hosted&lt;/a&gt; servers running Exchange Server 2013, 2016, or 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vsxGV"&gt;While a large-scale attack, likely carried out by a state-run organization may sound familiar, &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/02/new-nation-state-cyberattacks/"&gt;Microsoft is clear&lt;/a&gt; that the attacks are “in no way connected” to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288961/solarwinds-hack-100-companies-9-federal-agencies"&gt;the SolarWinds attacks&lt;/a&gt; that compromised US federal government agencies and companies last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdjErP"&gt;It’s likely that there are still details to come about this hack — so far, there hasn’t been an official list of organizations that have been compromised, just a vague picture of the large scale and high-severity of the attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svoMzY"&gt;A Microsoft spokesperson said that the company is &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;working closely with the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency], other government agencies, and security companies, to ensure we are providing the best possible guidance and mitigation for our customers&lt;em&gt;,” &lt;/em&gt;and that “[t]he best protection is to apply updates as soon as possible across all impacted systems.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m3ofto"&gt;There’s nothing like an explosion of blockchain news to leave you thinking, “Um… what’s going on here?” That’s the feeling I’ve experienced while reading about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308075/grimes-nft-6-million-sales-nifty-gateway-warnymph"&gt;Grimes getting millions of dollars for NFTs&lt;/a&gt; or about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres"&gt;Nyan Cat being sold as one&lt;/a&gt;. And by the time we all thought we sort of knew what the deal was, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables"&gt;the founder of Twitter put an autographed tweet&lt;/a&gt; up for sale as an NFT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vZyml"&gt;You might be wondering: what is an NFT, anyhow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qq4l9b"&gt;After literal hours of reading, I think I know. I also think I’m going to cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vM2Wj0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, let’s start with the basics. What is an NFT? What does NFT stand for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XAkRR1"&gt;Non-fungible token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lwjaI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That doesn’t make it any clearer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBCh6D"&gt;Right, sorry. “Non-fungible” more or less means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced with something else. For example, a bitcoin is fungible — trade one for another bitcoin, and you’ll have exactly the same thing. A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card, you’d have something completely different. You gave up a Squirtle, and got a 1909 T206 Honus Wagner, which &lt;em&gt;StadiumTalk&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.stadiumtalk.com/s/most-expensive-baseball-cards-985687df1bbe45c5"&gt;calls “the Mona Lisa of baseball cards.&lt;/a&gt;” (I’ll take their word for it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HudKGN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do NFTs work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbvoGM"&gt;At a very high level, most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin or dogecoin, but its blockchain also supports these NFTs, which store extra information that makes them work differently from, say, an ETH coin. It is worth noting that other blockchains can implement their own versions of NFTs. (&lt;a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/tron-introduces-nft-standard-trc-721"&gt;Some already have&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ifr4y9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s worth picking up at the NFT supermarket?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbHk7K"&gt;NFTs can really be anything digital (such as drawings, music, your brain downloaded and turned into an AI), but a lot of the current excitement is around using the tech to sell digital art. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vAcH3qsbkwApyVu4-Zl-AJ1hXFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341197/doge.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x3b3ee1931dc30c1957379fac9aba94d1c48a5405/576" target="_blank"&gt;NyanCat on OpenSea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dogecoin isn’t an NFT. But this GIF of a dogecoin is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Go0IlP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mean, like, people buying my good tweets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4V58lf"&gt;I don’t think anyone can stop you, but that’s not really what I meant. A lot of the conversation is about NFTs as &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/nfts-guide-nonfungible-tokens-cryptomedia-trend-ownership-internet/"&gt;an evolution of fine art collecting&lt;/a&gt;, only with digital art. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLI5c1"&gt;(Side note, when coming up with the line “buying my good tweets,” we were trying to think of something so silly that it wouldn’t be a real thing. So &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables"&gt;the founder of Twitter would take a shot at it&lt;/a&gt; just days after we posted the article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaSIX4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do people really think this will become like art collecting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ig7cLB"&gt;I’m sure some people really hope so — like whoever paid almost $390,000 for a &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x948b3515d81034a3c16d5393c6c155946c93c103/1"&gt;50-second video by Grimes&lt;/a&gt; or the person who paid $6.6 million for &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/100010001"&gt;a video by Beeple&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, one of Beeple’s pieces &lt;a href="https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/lots/2020"&gt;is being auctioned at Christie’s&lt;/a&gt;, the famou—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q3dcQxqw8oMubtaqyVI6ZzIM37o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341206/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.31.26_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beeple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoink!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i77Dld"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorry, I was busy right-clicking on that Beeple video and downloading the same file the person paid millions of dollars for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNNHsj"&gt;Wow, rude. But yeah, that’s where it &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-boom-collectors-shell-out-crypto/"&gt;gets a bit awkward&lt;/a&gt;. You can copy a digital file as many times as you want, including the art that’s included with an NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmQtyf"&gt;But NFTs are designed to give you something that can’t be copied: ownership of the work (though the artist can still retain the copyright and reproduction rights, just like with physical artwork). To put it in terms of physical art collecting: anyone can buy a Monet print. But only one person can own the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWoqGE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No shade on Beeple, but the video isn’t really a Monet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBUNfq"&gt;What do you think of &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x4140783cc1ba30653a0777126b122931e233ba14/1300010027"&gt;the $3,600 Gucci Ghost&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zeTKAEvLmop3TJky4G1whbuRXB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341209/GucciGhost.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Trevor Andrew&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This last sold for $3,600, but the current owner is asking for $16,300.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lGn9Ci"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also, if I got a Monet, I could appreciate it as a physical object. With digital art, a copy is literally as good as the original.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WyUKa"&gt;But the &lt;em&gt;flex &lt;/em&gt;of owning an original Beeple...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juDtL1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6d92bZ"&gt;That really depends on whether you’re an artist or a buyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dt7KYi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m an artist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ1eqE"&gt;First off: I’m proud of you. Way to go. You might be interested in NFTs because it gives you a way to sell work that there otherwise might not be much of a market for. If you come up with a really cool digital sticker idea, what are you going to do? Sell it on the iMessage App Store? No way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIsq2g"&gt;Also, NFTs have a feature that you can enable that will pay you a percentage every time &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/nft-art-boom-is-the-same-concept-as-the-photography-market?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;the NFT is sold or changes hands&lt;/a&gt;, making sure that if your work gets super popular and balloons in value, you’ll see some of that benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7oBax"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m a buyer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwjNxk"&gt;One of the obvious benefits of buying art is it lets you financially support artists you like, and that’s true with NFTs (which are way trendier than, like, Telegram stickers). Buying an NFT also usually gets you some basic usage rights, like being able to post the image online or set it as your profile picture. Plus, of course, there are bragging rights that you own the art, with a blockchain entry to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVWIC6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, I meant I’m a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;collector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYjdCo"&gt;Ah, okay, yes. NFTs can work &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/nft-art-boom-is-the-same-concept-as-the-photography-market?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;like any other speculative asset&lt;/a&gt;, where you buy it and hope that the value of it goes up one day, so you can sell it for a profit. I feel kind of dirty for talking about that, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuKmlZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So every NFT is unique?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91YTgt"&gt;In the boring, technical sense that every NFT is a unique token on the blockchain. But while it could be like a van Gogh, where there’s only one definitive actual version, it could also be like a trading card, where there’s 50 or hundreds of numbered copies of the same artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09JRP3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for what basically amounts to a trading card?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQVHLe"&gt;Well, that’s part of what makes NFTs so messy. Some people treat them like they’re the future of fine art collecting (read: as a playground for the mega-rich), and some people treat them like Pokémon cards (where they’re accessible to normal people but also a playground for the mega-rich). Speaking of Pokémon cards, Logan Paul just sold some NFTs relating to a million-dollar box of the—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1JJGI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please stop. I hate where this is going.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/laUmvyGGiD-HsDas7TBDZall_n4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341219/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.39.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Logan Paul&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ve activated my trap card (which sold for $17,000).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Mv0A8X"&gt;Yeah, he sold NFT video clips, which are just clips from a video you can watch on YouTube anytime you want, &lt;a href="https://shopnfts.net/"&gt;for up to $20,000&lt;/a&gt;. He also sold NFTs of a Logan Paul Pokémon card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gh63Tc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who paid $20,000 for a video clip of Logan Paul?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWkQs7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Calvinn_Hobbes/status/746227239755251712?s=20"&gt;A fool and their money are soon parted&lt;/a&gt;, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8ZNFb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It would be hilarious if Logan Paul decided to sell 50 more NFTs of the exact same video.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXPBux"&gt;Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda (who also sold some NFTs that included a song) &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/linkin-park-mike-shinoda-happy-endings-nft-interview"&gt;actually talked about that&lt;/a&gt;. It’s totally a thing someone could do if they were, in his words, “an opportunist crooked jerk.” I’m not saying that Logan Paul is that, just that you should be careful who you buy from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="611ErY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I buy this article as an NFT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cw2A6d"&gt;No, but technically anything digital could be sold as an NFT. deadmau5 has sold digital animated stickers. William Shatner has sold &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/william-shatners-nft-collectibles-sell-out-at-warp-speed"&gt;Shatner-themed trading cards&lt;/a&gt; (one of which was apparently an X-ray of his teeth).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1DjDJOZf5-4jdVe9fHSNlrMuXD0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341226/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.43.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0xa20f75be9427995e596788c29a10c7d734671251/5600020053" target="_blank"&gt;deadmau5 and Mad Dog Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This one I like. Maybe not for $700, but...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e0DpEJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gross. Actually, could I buy someone’s teeth as an NFT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2y73FL"&gt;There have been some attempts at connecting NFTs to real-world objects, often as a sort of verification method. Nike has patented a method to &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/12/10/nike-blockchain-sneakers-cryptokick-patent/"&gt;verify sneakers’ authenticity using an NFT system, which it calls CryptoKicks&lt;/a&gt;. But so far, I haven’t found any teeth, no. I’m scared to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRUxvr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look? Where? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEbiIN"&gt;There are several marketplaces that have popped up around NFTs, which allow people to buy and sell. These include OpenSea, Rarible, and Grimes’ choice, Nifty Gateway, but there are plenty of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwUvnp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve heard there were kittens involved. Tell me about the kittens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zszcnd"&gt;NFTs really became technically possible when the Ethereum blockchain added support for them &lt;a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/"&gt;as part of a new standard&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, one of the first uses was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoKitties"&gt;a game called CryptoKitties&lt;/a&gt; that allowed users to trade and sell virtual kittens. Thank you, internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkghYZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love kittens&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgMnW6"&gt;Not as much as &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/cryptokitties-bought-a-digital-cat-for-172000/"&gt;the person who paid over $170,000 for one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uedrnj7kfMuTOKIghiRp4yUtLOk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341171/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.21.50_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/kitty/896775" target="_blank"&gt;Cryptokitties.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My face when I’m worth $170K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yFaF1c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arrrrrggggg!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JD0ynI"&gt;Same. But in my opinion, the kittens show that one of the most interesting aspects of NFTs (for those of us not looking to create a digital dragon’s lair of art) is how they can be used in games. There are &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/26/the-deanbeat-how-non-fungible-tokens-nfts-will-change-games/"&gt;already games&lt;/a&gt; that let you have NFTs as items. One even sells virtual plots of land as NFTs. There could be opportunities for players to buy a unique in-game gun or helmet or whatever as an NFT, which would be a flex that most people could actually appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk4a1a"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could I pull off a museum heist to steal NFTs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-wuFlpK8EGVxFIUYTKb0hFd3pBM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341161/robbery.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This image is not an NFT. Yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rBINrG"&gt;That depends. Part of the allure of blockchain is that it stores a record of each time a transaction takes place, making it harder to steal and flip than, say, a painting hanging in a museum. That said, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49177705"&gt;cryptocurrencies have been stolen before&lt;/a&gt;, so it really would depend on how the NFT is being stored and how much work a potential victim would be willing to put in to get their stuff back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAPTND"&gt;Note: Please don’t steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnhPUz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I be worried about digital art being around in 500 years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIQPdV"&gt;Probably. Bit rot is a real thing: image quality deteriorates, file formats can’t be opened anymore, websites go down, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227535/nyt-bitcoin-millions-forgot-passwords-digital-wallet"&gt;people forget the password to their wallets&lt;/a&gt;. But physical art in museums is also &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETAcIbzOTYs"&gt;shockingly fragile&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6zH8E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to maximize my blockchain use. Can I buy NFTs with cryptocurrencies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU56ST"&gt;Yes. Probably. A lot of the marketplaces accept Ethereum. But technically, anyone can sell an NFT, and they could ask for whatever currency they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZmGbU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will trading my Logan Paul NFTs contribute to global warming and melt Greenland?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOtuLt"&gt;It’s definitely something to look out for. Since NFTs use the same blockchain technology as cryptocurrencies, they could also end up using a lot of electricity per transaction. There are people working &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/ethereum-plans-to-cut-its-absurd-energy-consumption-by-99-percent"&gt;on mitigations for this issue&lt;/a&gt;, which is great because I don’t want to set the world on fire for CryptoKitties, much less Logan Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23nZ0d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I build an underground art cave / bunker to store my NFTs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhQ69E"&gt;Well, like cryptocurrencies, NFTs are stored in digital wallets (though it is worth noting that the wallet does specifically have to be NFT-compatible). You could always put the wallet on a computer in an underground bunker, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UXB6fZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you tired of typing “NFT”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNFTvl"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RM05sp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 5th, 8:07 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added the news that Jack Dorsey was selling one of his tweets as an NFT because I originally made a joke and cannot believe it actually happened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="YWCub9"&gt;Jack Dorsey, the billionaire co-founder and CEO of Twitter, a man who stans bitcoin &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack"&gt;right on his Twitter bio&lt;/a&gt;, is attempting to sell his very first tweet as an NFT — a digital good that lives on the Ethereum blockchain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wadzT"&gt;You’re probably familiar with the famous tweet, “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/20"&gt;just setting up my twttr&lt;/a&gt;”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oUWGxZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;just setting up my twttr&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/20?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 21, 2006&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0LxLim"&gt;Despite the fact that this tweet has been publicly available as a free digital item to look at whenever anybody wanted for nearly 15 years, Dorsey is now trying to sell it as an NFT, or “non-fungible token,” &lt;a href="https://v.cent.co/tweet/20"&gt;through a platform called Valuables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KpY5to"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/xCnWG9EqgD"&gt;https://t.co/xCnWG9EqgD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1367990471759306752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FWFYMr"&gt;As you would rightly expect, bidding is already north of $80K. As of Saturday morning, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1368223699254398976"&gt;highest offer for Dorsey’s tweet&lt;/a&gt; was $2 million, from tech entrepreneur Justin Sun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="oexyzt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OvD7Qm"&gt;What does “buying” this tweet actually mean? “What you are purchasing is a digital certificate of the tweet, unique because it has been signed and verified by the creator,” &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kBx-HXY8ow_7bElsJZ6Sk3r2V9cQjSRdWFyKCUXZtAs/edit"&gt;according to Valuables’ FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmMiQA"&gt;In other words, an autograph. You’re buying an autograph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rneaHm"&gt;The tweet will continue to live on the internet for as long as Dorsey, and Twitter the company, choose to keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWHfUD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 6th, 3:20AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The highest offer is now $363,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YakGhF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 6th 11:59AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The highest offer rose to $2 million&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udueqU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXXhDm"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZCGgz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Perseverance rover scoots around on Mars for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZA26xJgtS9y1ittuHz0RRJHILYw=/0x0:1280x853/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68920555/pia24482_4_1041.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A trail of wheel tracks left by NASA’s Perseverance rover after making its first drive on the Martian surface | NASA/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L4B9rn"&gt;Perseverance, the car-sized rover NASA landed on Mars last month, has taken its first spin on the rocky surface of Jezero Crater, NASA announced today. The rover’s six wheels drove about 21 feet to carry out a key mobility test on Thursday, as engineers back on Earth prepare to execute the mission’s core science objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QO6c6R"&gt;The rover’s six aluminum wheels left tracks on the Martian dirt — as captured by one of its on-board cameras — after driving straight for 13 feet, then turning around to back up 8 feet. Anais Zarifian, Perseverance’s mobility testbed engineer, told reporters it went “incredibly well” and performed better than it did during pre-launch tests on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c5J8XNFKf8nNp7aovCiHftWsDdg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22349165/Mar_05_2021_17_48_58.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA/JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An animation showing Perseverance’s first drive on Mars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eq2F0D"&gt;“I don’t think I’ve ever been happier to see wheel tracks — and I’ve seen a lot of them,” she says. “This is just a huge milestone for the mission and the mobility team. We’ve driven on Earth, but driving on Mars is really the ultimate goal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQ76jn"&gt;Though short and slow, the drive demonstration gave engineers refreshing confidence that NASA’s $2.4 billion rover is ready to travel some 656 feet over the next two years to analyze rocks and scoop up coveted Martian soil samples for a future return mission. “This was just so amazing to see last night. We’re really happy about this,” says Robert Hogg, Perseverance deputy mission manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVkcL8"&gt;Like its sister rover Curiosity, Perseverance’s top speed is 0.1 miles per hour, “so not very fast,” Zarifian says. It uses a “bogie” suspension system that can climb over rocks as big as its own wheels, about 20 inches in diameter, while keeping its main body level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUzlcd"&gt;But landing a wheeled robot on Mars isn’t about speed. With an improved computer for avoiding obstacles and sand pits, “we’ll have less time planning drives and down time, and more time to do science,” Zarifian says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X6pOVjIWDat5cVWefGtAI8sIWVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22349166/PIA24485_K4_ZCAM_main_sol004_Delta_Remnant_unannotated.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An elevated slab of land that Scientists say is a junction where ancient rivers once flowed into Jezero, a dried up lake bed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tSyauE"&gt;Since landing on February 18th, Perseverance has beamed back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291412/nasa-perseverance-rover-first-images-landing-skycrane"&gt;thousands of images&lt;/a&gt; from most of its 19 on-board cameras, including a frame released Friday showing Jezero’s Delta, &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25700/the-road-ahead-for-perseverance/"&gt;a target site&lt;/a&gt; for the rover to drive toward in the near future. Scientists say the elevated landform, seen surrounded by an obstacle course of rocks and sand pits, is a junction between an ancient dried-out river and the lake that Jezero used to be 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0hbR6"&gt;Mission teams at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California are mulling different paths for Perseverance’s trek to the delta, aiming to settle on one in the coming weeks that is “most efficient, safest, and most scientifically interesting,” says Katie Stack Morgan, the mission’s deputy project scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6LVgn"&gt;NASA released &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25674/perseverances-mastcam-z-first-high-resolution-panorama/"&gt;Perseverance’s first high-resolution panorama&lt;/a&gt; this week captured by the rover’s Mastcam-Z camera. The mosaic’s 79 images were taken on the Martian afternoon of February 22nd, and one YouTube user edited it into a 4K video that slowly pans across Jezero’s horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eoDVlJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z0PtX-1xre8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UcVQjj"&gt;The rocks appearing in Perseverance’s new images “were likely deposited by rivers flowing into the ancient lake Jezero,” Morgan says, adding that scientists are working to understand the rock’s origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cweExj"&gt;Perseverance &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21346844/nasa-mars-2020-rover-perseverance-launch-atlas-v-success-travel-time"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; from Florida last summer for a seven-month trek to the Red Planet, exploiting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266752/uae-china-nasa-mars-missions"&gt;a two-month window of time&lt;/a&gt; when Earth and Mars align closely in their orbits around the Sun once every two years. 293 million miles later, it survived a blazing fast, seven-minute plunge through the Martian atmosphere last month and carried out an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;extremely complex landing&lt;/a&gt; at Jezero Crater, a dried up lake bed that scientists hope could hold signs of microbial life fossilized from billions of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5jBMdo"&gt;The rover’s mission team memorialized the rover’s landing site at Jezero by &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25701/welcome-to-octavia-e-butler-landing/"&gt;naming it after Octavia E. Butler&lt;/a&gt;, the late science fiction author and the first Black woman to win a Hugo Award and Nebula Award.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The SEC is dragging AT&amp;T to court for illegally duping analysts into lowering expectations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/get-fnU1xDnsBORtAThkdh0L7Qc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68920429/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mABC7X"&gt;The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is suing AT&amp;amp;T for providing nonpublic information to 20 different analyst firms so they would lower revenue estimates ahead of earnings, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-43?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. That let AT&amp;amp;T “beat” expectations for the quarter when the information-sharing took place, turning what could have been some nasty headlines in the financial press into a win instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7kq7R"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20500640-sec-complaint-against-att"&gt;SEC’s complaint (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T learned in March 2016 that its quarterly results would fall short of estimates due in part to “a steeper-than-expected decline in smartphone sales.” As you might recall, we used to live in a world where carriers like AT&amp;amp;T subsidized part of the cost of your smartphone, but by then AT&amp;amp;T had passed that cost along to the customer — which meant far fewer customers were upgrading them every year or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NHVe1"&gt;This quarter was going to be AT&amp;amp;T’s worst-ever for smartphone upgrades: a record low of just 5 percent, according to the complaint. As a result, AT&amp;amp;T expected that its consolidated gross revenue “was expected to fall more than $1 billion below the consensus estimate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLmm7w"&gt;Here is what happened next, from the complaint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eCN37P"&gt;Fearful of a revenue miss at the end of the quarter, AT&amp;amp;T’s Chief Financial Officer instructed AT&amp;amp;T’s IR Department to “work the analysts who still have equipment revenue too high.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VBQK5"&gt;In turn, the Director of Investor Relations (“IR Director”) instructed Womack, Evans, and Black to speak to analysts privately on a one-by-one basis about their estimates in order to “walk the analysts down”—i.e., induce analysts to reduce their individual estimates. The goal was to induce enough analysts to lower their estimates so that the consensus revenue estimate would fall to the level that AT&amp;amp;T expected to report to the public—i.e., AT&amp;amp;T would not have a revenue miss, which would have been the company’s third consecutive quarterly miss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TQtoRe"&gt;In their calls, the three IR executives “intentionally disclosed material nonpublic information regarding AT&amp;amp;T’s results to date,” the SEC alleges. Of the 20 analyst firms listed in the complaint, all of them lowered their revenue estimates — and many took AT&amp;amp;T’s 5 percent number directly. The SEC suggests that AT&amp;amp;T’s executives hid the fact that these numbers weren’t the kind that are supposed to be shared, so analysts may not have known that they shouldn’t have had access to that information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1t1w8"&gt;Executives emailed amongst themselves the day before its Q1 2016 earnings in relief, the complaint shows. The company’s CFO even &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaveCBenoit/status/1367955623321735179"&gt;apparently told&lt;/a&gt; the CEO that two analyst updates “may do it for us,” with the CEO replying, “Good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kG4VX5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is AT&amp;amp;T anxiously pushing analysts to lower estimates so that a single quarter of earnings doesn't create bad headlines, even though the results stink. And it goes all the way to the top, per the SEC. &lt;br&gt;Just another reminder of what CEOs actually care about in private. &lt;a href="https://t.co/qxbMNvVsYQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qxbMNvVsYQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dave Benoit (@DaveCBenoit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaveCBenoit/status/1367955623321735179?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zPHf9Z"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T ended up reporting $40.535 billion in revenue for Q1 2016, barely beating the revised consensus analyst estimates by less than $100 million, according to the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLASME"&gt;The company disputed the SEC’s allegations &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/att-disputes-sec-allegations-301241737.html"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that “there was no disclosure of material nonpublic information”.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMB2Sf"&gt;“The information discussed during these March and April 2016 conversations concerned the widely reported, industry-wide phase-out of subsidy programs for new smartphone purchases and the impact of this trend on smartphone upgrade rates and equipment revenue,” the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtEuMa"&gt;“Not only did AT&amp;amp;T publicly disclose this trend on multiple occasions before the analyst calls in question, but AT&amp;amp;T also made clear that the declining phone sales had no material impact on its earnings,” it continued. “Analysts and the news media frequently wrote about this trend and investors understood that AT&amp;amp;T’s core business was selling connectivity (i.e., wireless service plans), not devices, and that smartphone sales were immaterial to the company’s earnings.”&lt;/p&gt;
