    <title>Amazon is hijacking our emotions to put robots in our homes </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rsQsyw"&gt;There's something in our complicated human brains that immediately develops a connection to anything with eyes. Don't believe me? Ask the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18056514/anki-vector-review-toy-robot-news-features-skills-ai"&gt;Anki Vector&lt;/a&gt; that lived on my desk for several months. This pocket-sized robot got my attention with its bulbous, non-threatening body. But the second it looked up at me with a quizzical look in its eyes and uttered my name, I knew I would die for this tiny forklift. It’s worth noting that the Anki Vector can be programmed to do a variety of things if you have the time to mess around with an SDK, but I brought this robot home because it was cute, not because I needed a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwlY1k"&gt;I’d watch with amusement as the little gadget puttered around my desk, occasionally looking back at me as if seeking my approval, and I couldn’t help but think that this sensation is exactly what Amazon is trying to replicate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;with its recently announced Astro home robot&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Astro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wgKFNW"&gt;While the utility of the Astro is currently up for debate, it’s absolutely adorable. This is the key that’s going to unlock a lot of doors for this robot, and Amazon knows it. Nobody is begging to have a roaming surveillance system in their home, but slap a pair of googly eyes on it, give it a cute name and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22700064/amazon-astro-google-chromebook-beta-test"&gt;the public will pay you for the privilege&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXtuPm"&gt;Getting people to emotionally bond with their gadgets isn’t a particularly novel or difficult concept. The Tamagotchi, Furby, and Aibo banked on the idea — they might have thought they were just making toys, but Sony inadvertently created a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F7233%2Fthe-saddest-repair&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F2%2F22675512%2Famazon-astro-robot-emotion-pets-anki-vector" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;community of grieving robotic dog owners&lt;/a&gt; that cared enough about their artificial pets to &lt;a href="https://www.aibo-accessories.com/"&gt;buy bespoke accessories&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cbbr6YU-dQuy6Kgpus7VnwC563k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22891762/IMG_1699_800x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.aibo-accessories.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjw49qKBhAoEiwAHQVTo57L_nNVCFbWbr5yw_Xi7ltoGzPBh1WlbE1heWnjsODSsnt_HAhzJxoCGd4QAvD_BwE" target="_blank"&gt;Aibo Accessories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Aibo Accessories Aibo blanket is like a tea cozy, but for robots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8mxHva"&gt;These gadgets don’t even need to be all that adorable; I know many people who’ve either named or put googly eyes on their Roombas for this to be an isolated incident. In some ways, these machines have become de-facto pets in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AY1bwO"&gt;Never underestimate our ability as humans to form emotional attachments to machines, nor the lengths that a company will go to exploit this. This is a cycle we’ve seen repeated for nearly every robotic gadget stretching back to the Nintendo R.O.B. in 1985 — we’re taken in by a new adorable looking robot, that initial dopamine hit wears off, and we’re stricken by how useless it is in hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Roomba 880 vacuum cleaning robot hands-on pictures" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pPQeVSZGbZikEFneO_N3FOvS_ko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2797234/roomba-880-hands-on4_2040.1384228987.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I dub thee Rodney, lord of dust.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1Vp8P"&gt;There is a certain quality we find endearing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16148196/robots-falling-over-likable-boston-dynamics"&gt;when robots drop the ball&lt;/a&gt;, but it admittedly becomes a little less endearing when we expect that same robot to care for stuff we actually care about. Besides being a novelty that loiters around your home, Amazon expects us to burden the Astro with tasks like elder care and home security. These aren’t tasks that we relinquish easily, and doing so involves a level of trust we typically don't place in machines.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFplbB"&gt;Engineering a machine to perform a single task is relatively simple, but developing something with autonomy that's expected to handle a variety of tasks is remarkably difficult.   Getting people to emotionally bond with a piece of hardware to the point that they’d trust it to watch their aging parent is another matter entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LbPCxEtywtLc120x0WWTi_77D90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9051887/smaller_robot_gif.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trust this guy? Really?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zf7BmA"&gt;The fact that Amazon’s Astro is powered by its Alexa voice assistant doesn’t necessarily help. You probably have a story about how a voice assistant turned on at random and did the exact opposite of what you wanted. Getting anything with voice recognition to work reliably is spotty at best — now imagine putting that same idea on wheels and expecting it to respond quickly and reliably in an emergency situation. If a burglar breaks into my home, I’m not asking Alexa to dial emergency services, I’m picking up the phone and doing it myself. This lack of trust and utility is really the make or break for these gadgets, as my Anki Vector will tell you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zil5gi"&gt;While I knew I could implicitly trust my Anki to endlessly meander around my desk, the lack of utility in my Anki Vector was the final nail in the coffin for my pint-sized pal. I was enamored with its outward appearance, but after several months of watching it idly push and stack cubes around my desk, I could no longer delude myself into thinking that it would be able to do much more. It couldn’t bring me a beer, open doors, or really do anything that my Echo couldn’t do better. It may have looked cute but didn’t perform tasks that were even remotely useful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FXBfgD0kIFKuOkSfdQD-EAHZBIc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13375881/Anki_Vector.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;R.I.P. Anki, you will be missed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C4Mgk2"&gt;All too often when a piece of technology no longer serves a purpose, it eventually ends up discarded or forgotten, no matter how adorable it is. But I still couldn’t bring myself to toss the Anki away like so much garbage; I gave it to the &lt;a href="https://ablegamers.org/"&gt;Able Gamers Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which welcomes donations of toys, robotics, and gaming accessories. Passing along the joy I experienced helped soften the blow of what felt too much like abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oS3rRO"&gt;While I certainly approach the realm of consumer robotics with a little more pessimism than I used to, I still yearn for The Future™,  and it wouldn’t take much to get me to invite another robot into my home. If the Astro were about half the price and could actually do half the things Amazon says it can without constant supervision, I might be inclined to find space for it in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s excellent AirPods Max are $80 off at Woot right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NXVDEB-vjp88Cmnwifp9izqoOMI=/59x0:1982x1282/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69941024/IMG_6828_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Pro Max boast great sound and a comfortable, albeit heavy, build.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W9rSmd"&gt;There’s no way around it: the AirPods Max aren’t cheap. For the money, however, Apple’s plush headphones offer a commendable set of features, including superb effective noise cancellation, terrific sound quality, and foolproof controls that are designed to make even the smallest adjustments that much easier to carry out. They also work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;Apple’s spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;, which helps create a surround effect and adds another level of immersion when watching content via Netflix, Disney Plus, and other supported streaming platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y06JK"&gt;Normally $550, you can pick them up in a multitude of colors at &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13140759?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airpods-max-headphones-2%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot for $470&lt;/a&gt;, one of their best prices to date, for the next two months or until supplies last. Just don’t expect much in the way of protection from the included carry case. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tw3BG7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Netflix is finally adding support for spatial audio on iPhone and iPad","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631444/netflix-spatial-audio-support-iphone-ipad-apple"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="3gA8qK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0yM7Jb"&gt;If you’ve got a gaming keyboard that's getting a little too greedy with the space on your desk, you may want to take a look at the Logitech G915 TKL. This slim, low-profile gaming keyboard is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Tenkeyless-Lightspeed-Mechanical-LIGHTSYNC/dp/B085RFFC9Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfHqiIpThKe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $180&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price ever. The keyboard ditches the number pad to save on desk space, but it retains all the features of the standard G915. The chiclet-like keys can be equipped with linear, tactile, or clicky switches, and — naturally — feature RGB backlighting. The G915 TKL can also be operated wirelessly using Bluetooth, or with the included 2.4Ghz wireless dongle, and can last for up to 40 hours on a single charge at maximum brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g9vdnZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10784903"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6FsYus"&gt;The best Xbox controller you can buy is selling at its best price ever today at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SFKTLZM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fxbox-one%2Fproducts%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-elite-black-series-2-wireless-controller%2F202695.html%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. Both retailers are selling the black version of the Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller for $150, its best price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we praised the controller’s robust customizability, which includes adjustable-tension thumbsticks, paddles for custom button mapping, and more. The controller also comes with shorter hair-trigger locks and offers USB-C and Bluetooth connectivity, not to mention a charging dock and case. Battery life is solid as well, regardless if you’re playing on an Xbox One, Xbox Series X, or Windows 10 device; we managed to squeeze roughly 40 hours out of the controller on a single charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nCLVir"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10784780"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PWadGt"&gt;On the TV front, Sony’s 65-inch A80J OLED is now selling at an all-time low. Normally $2,298, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TKR3WLJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$500 cheaper at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; today, bringing the final sale price down to $1,798. Other configurations are also selling at their lowest prices to date, with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TKN5XTP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model&lt;/a&gt; and larger, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TL48K9M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;77-inch panel&lt;/a&gt; going for $1,698 and $2,998, respectively. In its review, &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/sony/a80j-oled#page-test-compared" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reviews site RTINGS called&lt;/a&gt; it an “excellent all-around TV,” praising its performance, image quality, near-instantaneous response time, and low input lag. While the TV doesn’t support a variable refresh rate (VRR) yet — Sony says it will arrive via a future software update — it does come with two HDMI 2.1 ports and can support up to 4K resolution at 120Hz, rendering it an excellent pick for gamers looking to take advantage of next-gen consoles, even its not the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best gaming TV&lt;/a&gt; for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I’m split by Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oNzwkBeYz-HX7XG8WBiBKTC5axE=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69940964/SMB_BananaMania_ReverseMode.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania. | Image: Sega&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g2NgME"&gt;As a kid, I remember spending hours playing &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball 2&lt;/em&gt; on the GameCube with my sister. The games are lighthearted and colorful, have fun single-player and multiplayer modes, and the monkeys feel like something out of a Saturday morning cartoon. I haven’t touched the series since, and I figured &lt;em&gt;Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt; would be the perfect nostalgia trip for me. While it is a lot of fun, I also found it surprisingly frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lF0S2m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt; is a remaster of the first three &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball&lt;/em&gt; games: &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re not familiar with the series, the &lt;em&gt;Monkey Ball&lt;/em&gt; games are mostly about rolling monkeys in translucent balls through increasingly challenging maze-like courses. But instead of controlling the monkey in the ball, you control the &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt;, tilting it to make the monkey ball roll around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJPzCC"&gt;The early stages in &lt;em&gt;Banana Mania’s&lt;/em&gt; single-player story strike a nice balance in terms of difficulty. When it feels like you have just enough control of your monkey as it careens down a slope or over obstacles to get it toward the goal, the game is a blast. About halfway through the story mode, though, &lt;em&gt;Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt; became punishingly difficult for me. Many stages required a level of finesse, touch, and a bit of luck that I often just couldn’t achieve, which meant that I regularly fell off of a tiny balance beam or hurtled off a ramp because I didn’t approach it at the right angle. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bo5Te4I1GU6m3s7vaYnDWME-0S0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22891391/SMB_BananaMania_DNAWorld.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sega&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A level from &lt;/em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VBrUzV"&gt;Fortunately, &lt;em&gt;Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt; offers a helper mode, which doubles the amount of time you have to complete a level, drops arrows along the optimal path, and lets you turn on slow motion to have more control. You can access the helper mode from the pause menu, or the game will prompt you to turn it on if you fall off a stage enough times. It is, indeed, very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OoUsaZ"&gt;But as I got further into the game, I found I would often try a level once or twice before giving up, flipping helper mode on, and moving through the whole thing in slow motion. A number of times, I couldn’t beat a level even with helper mode, so I’d just skip it, which you can also do from the pause menu. (Skipping a level costs some in-game currency, though, and if you don’t have enough, you’ll have to earn more through playing other levels or modes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rExLPs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The later levels of the story mode were too punishing for me&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MtjGmc"&gt;I’m sure there are people who will revel in the challenge, but &lt;em&gt;Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt; was just too punishing for me. I’ll admit that I was surprised by the difficulty, but maybe I just forgot about it after years of not playing the original games. If the later levels were too tough for me, they probably won’t be easy for the younger target market for which the game seems to be designed. Though it is good that you can skip levels, even if that has an annoying cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7dLky"&gt;There’s a lot more to &lt;em&gt;Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt; than the challenging single-player, though. There are also 12 multiplayer party games, which include things like bowling, billiards, and golf. (Yes, the beloved Monkey Target is back, and it’s still great.) Most of these games are easy to play, and each lets you customize some rules to your liking. I played them for a couple hours with my sister and some family, and we had a blast cycling through them. Many don’t have too much depth, but if we got bored of one, we’d just hop into one of the 11 others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNGEFe"&gt;I also have to mention one of the most charming elements of &lt;em&gt;Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt;: Sega took a cue from &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; by adding a number of video game icons as playable characters you can unlock or purchase as DLC. Many of them are Sega legends, such as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/supermonkeyball/status/1425441873775169538?lang=en"&gt;Sonic and Tails&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664632/sega-dreamcast-saturn-game-gear-super-monkey-ball-banana-mania"&gt;actual Sega consoles&lt;/a&gt;, but there are some non-Sega characters as well, like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/supermonkeyball/status/1433052027614109701?lang=en"&gt;Sanrio’s Hello Kitty&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1-NW1qVhJRW_Ce7D_GJfslKjYcA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22891396/SMB_BananaMania_Sonic.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sega&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonic was my favorite character in the game, but you can’t play as him in multiplayer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nwJQBd"&gt;I loved using the non-&lt;em&gt;Monkey Ball&lt;/em&gt; characters as I played through the story mode. My favorite was Sonic; rolling around as the blue hedgehog almost felt like playing an extended special level in a &lt;em&gt;Sonic The Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; game. You can’t play as the extra characters in multiplayer, though, which is disappointing. I’d love to be able to play a round of Monkey Billiards as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/supermonkeyball/status/1427978596832972805?lang=en"&gt;Kiryu from &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1E6S3m"&gt;I’m torn by &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt;, which feels like it offers two very different experiences in one package. Many of the multiplayer party games remain just as fun as they were when I played them as a kid, but the single-player didn’t hold up in quite the same way for me. Often, it’s quite fun, but sometimes the difficulty can drive me bananas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIKSBU"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launches October 5th, though players who buy the Digital Deluxe version can play it early. The game will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Steam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Delaying Elizabeth Holmes’ Theranos fraud trial is paying off for the defense</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bSu5GFRm-4knor3Nhm3bI3Q3SCY=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69939912/1235424862.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘Do I have an independent recollection of when I sent this email from seven years ago?’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1wZ02g"&gt;Human memory is fallible. That’s why defense lawyers like to age their cases — and why &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/elizabeth-holmes-trial-pushed-to-august-after-surprise-pregnancy-announcement.html"&gt;prosecutors were so frustrated &lt;/a&gt;with the multiple delays in trying Elizabeth Holmes for her role at the failed blood-testing company Theranos. Given enough time, people forget things. That can open the door for reasonable doubt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sZPNm"&gt;Several times on Friday, his fourth day of testimony, former Theranos lab director Adam Rosendorff was asked about details in meetings and didn’t remember them. But Lance Wade, defense attorney for Elizabeth Holmes, was able to produce minutes from a meeting, a Powerpoint presentation, and old emails that made Rosendorff look less reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6J89TV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Making Rosendorff look unreliable is important to Holmes’ defense&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cX9XZB"&gt;But not a lot less reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjCONa"&gt;Making Rosendorff look unreliable is important to Holmes’ defense.&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt; Rosendorff gave crucial testimony&lt;/a&gt; about being sidelined, about not trusting some Theranos tests, and Holmes’ direct knowledge of the problems in Theranos’ clinical labs. The defense’s strategy is to blame Theranos’ lab directors for the problems in the clinic — shifting blame away from Holmes. Rosendorff linked her directly to the problems, and showed that he couldn’t be responsible for decisions he wasn’t aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F4EnOK"&gt;The defense’s job, then, was to try to blunt that testimony. Take, for instance, the tests for pregnancy, hCG. You may recall that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt;Rosendorff had ordered&lt;/a&gt; — in an all-caps email, no less — that all tests be run on an FDA-approved device. But that wasn’t done, the prosecution showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctYWkR"&gt;Today we saw emails that told Rosendorff that Edison was going to be used for the pregnancy hormone test, something Rosendorff testified he didn’t know about. It seems like he forgot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J12nol"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It seems like he forgot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BaoVxF"&gt;Also in direct testimony, Christian Holmes, Elizabeth’s brother, wrote to her that he was fielding a lot of patient complaints — on a thread of emails that Rosendorff wasn’t included on. The inference I made from the direct examination was that the complaints were because the tests weren’t accurate. But emails shown today in court suggested that the complaints were at least in part because reagents were on backorder. So that looks less bad for Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nr40xl"&gt;On the other hand, Rosendorff wasn’t included on those emails either, and testified he wasn’t aware of the backorder issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRVcH9"&gt;All of this underlines Rosendorff’s complaint that he was sidelined on certain decisions. Wade did make a direct attempt to undermine it, though. The court was shown a June 2014 email from Balwani that said Rosendoff was “EXTREMELY frustrated that as a lab director he is not being kept in the loop.” The email was evidently about research and development experiments being run in his lab, and appeared to be a rebuke to Vice President Daniel Young, who replied that he did update Rosendorff later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="2vArXo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rosendoff was “EXTREMELY frustrated that as a lab director he is not being kept in the loop.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AnY1T1"&gt;The defense’s gambit to make Rosendorff look bad — by suggesting that Theranos quickly responded to his problems — didn’t quite stick. We now have a contemporaneous email about Rosendorff’s frustration at being left out of the loop, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699614/elizabeth-holmes-trial-steve-jobs-emails"&gt;exactly what he’d complained about on his direct examination&lt;/a&gt;. And though it seems to have been fixed in this specific instance, that doesn’t mean it was fixed elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d66cgt"&gt;Wade had better luck on other subjects. One key issue has been proficiency testing, a legal requirement for the lab to ensure test results are accurate. In the direct exam, Rosendorff testified that management’s unwillingness to perform these tests was a major reason he quit. Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701542/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-celgene-bickering"&gt;Wade demonstrated &lt;/a&gt;that proficiency tests &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; been performed on the FDA-approved machines. It was only the Edisons that were lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASiqSx"&gt;Rosendorff had previously testified that although he’d come up with a plan for proficiency testing, it wasn’t implemented. That plan was drawn up in December 2013. Minutes of a meeting showed that management discussed it in March 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGzcZo"&gt;Again, this didn’t exactly cut down Rosendorff — the fact that it took three months for management to discuss it does support his account of them dragging their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDHoyl"&gt;What does seem more questionable is a Powerpoint deck from April 2014 that Rosendorff approved. The deck was created — at Balwani’s request — by an employee Rosendorff  supervised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qs7nZ9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Did you have reason to question the accuracy of this slide deck at the time you received it?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XkwMtC"&gt;The slides we were shown weren’t especially technical, but they emphasized that Theranos had no peer group for comparison. Because of that, normal proficiency testing wasn’t appropriate — and some of the agents in standard proficiency testing specimens weren’t right for use on Theranos devices either. The alternative Theranos had developed was superior for this reason, the slides said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fyw0kw"&gt;“Did you have reason to question the accuracy of this slide deck at the time you received it?” Wade asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyJGaN"&gt;There was a long silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1Uu5n"&gt;“I think the slide deck reflected what I’d written” in the documents, Rosendorff said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F4TGuS"&gt;Perhaps Wade’s least successful moment was attempting to suggest that Rosendorff was bad at his job because he wasn’t returning physician calls fast enough. We saw an email exchange from October 2014, shortly before Rosendorff left Theranos, where a customer service representative nudged him to make a call to a doctor he’d promised to make a week before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="Sf7D23"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Do I have an independent recollection of when I sent this email from seven years ago?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q90YCO"&gt;In another email, also from October 2014, Rosendorff suggests that Christian Holmes should handle the call. Wade pointed out, accurately, that this is what Rosendorff testified shouldn’t happen. But the email also happened about a month before Rosendorff left. Rosendorff testified that he didn’t have a good explanation to give to the doctor — or at least one he felt comfortable with — and with one foot out the door, yeah, I can see why he’d let Christian handle it. Wade pointed out this happened a few times during that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfLaow"&gt;I have no idea whether Wade has ever quit a job in frustration, but I certainly have, and I’d guess at least some jurors have, too. Was I carefully engaged in my work the last few weeks before I quit? Hell no. I had given up on trying to change the things I thought were wrong, and had also given up on caring about my work. The alternative was misery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6aoRS"&gt;There was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701542/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-celgene-bickering"&gt;less bickering than earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, though at one point Wade asked Rosendorff what time he’d sent an email to Holmes and got a sharp reply. “Do I have an independent recollection of when I sent this email from seven years ago?” Rosendorff asked. “No, I do not.” There was also a meeting on Holmes’ calendar that Rosendorff didn’t remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="KkewVC"&gt;Aging the case gave Wade time so Rosendorff could forget. It also means that one key witness, George Shultz, is now dead. Even so, memories of unpleasant experiences are a lot stronger than memories of pleasant ones. That’s just how human memory works. Rosendorff’s memory may have dimmed over time, but I’d guess the clear spots have to do with the things that upset him the most.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Electric vehicle maker Rivian has filed to go public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rivian has filed to go public | Photo by David Becker/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="22KtzK"&gt;Electric vehicle maker Rivian, backed by Ford and Amazon, filed for an initial public offering on Friday on the Nasdaq exchange. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644601/rivian-ipo-november-december-filing-amazon-ford"&gt;company filed its IPO confidentially&lt;/a&gt; with the Securities and Exchange Commission in August, and it was made public today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IstxDE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000119312521289903/d157488ds1.htm"&gt;According to the S-1 filed&lt;/a&gt; with the SEC, Rivian had a net loss of $994 million on revenue of zero for the first half of 2021. Its net loss for full year 2020 was $1.02 billion, the filing shows. The company expects to trade under the ticker symbol RIVN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvaUN0"&gt;“We are a development stage company and have not generated material revenue to date,” Rivian writes in the filing. “Vehicle production and deliveries began in September 2021.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2021/9/28/22697309/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-test-drive-off-roading-camp-tested"&gt;We recently tried its first consumer vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, the R1T electric pickup truck, and today’s filing says the company plans to launch its first SUV, the R1S, in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2bc9Oq"&gt;Rivian says it has pre-orders for just over 48,000 of the R1T and R1S in the US and Canada. The preorder customers had paid fully refundable deposits of $1,000 each, and that’s the company’s only revenue so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esCORT"&gt;Rivian expects its revenue initially to come mostly from Amazon, the filing shows; “In the near term... we expect that a significant portion of our revenue will be from Amazon Logistics.” Both Amazon and Ford own more than 5 percent of Rivian, and Peter Krawiec, a senior vice president at Amazon, is on Rivian’s board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lckamh"&gt;Rivian entered into an agreement with Amazon in 2019, and the filing shows that under the terms of that agreement, Rivian agreed to collaborate with Amazon’s Logistics segment “to design, develop, manufacture, and supply [electric delivery vans]... for use in Amazon’s last-mile delivery operations.” Amazon has some exclusive rights to Rivian’s electric delivery vans (EDVs) for four years, and right of first refusal for two years after that. The company says it doesn’t expect to ship its electric delivery vans until December as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5JtGgR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Rivian’s R1T electric pickup truck took me to the top of the mountain","url":"https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2021/9/28/22697309/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-test-drive-off-roading-camp-tested"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0Y7yaw"&gt;The R1T was first displayed at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18111782/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-price-specs-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show&lt;/a&gt;, and has suffered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580293/rivian-delay-september-deliveries-electric-pickup-r1t-amazon"&gt;multiple delays&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buUQya"&gt;The company has raised over $10 billion in funding to date, one quarter of that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590848/rivian-raise-amazon-ford-new-factory-ipo-electric-pickup"&gt;from a recent round of funding in July&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ozy Media shuts down just one week after most of us found out it exists</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="OZY FEST 2017 Presented By OZY.com" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hWRQEnPX-JfxmcEHLOhVMBBaq3A=/598x104:3844x2268/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69939523/820963572.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Samantha Bee, Mark Cuban, CEO and Co-Founder Carlos Watson, and Jeb Bush speak onstage during Ozy Fest 2017 | Photo by Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Ozy Fusion Fest 2017&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lAtfvo"&gt;In the space of six days and five &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports from media columnist Ben Smith, Ozy Media has gone from a largely unknown content producer &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/business/media/ozy-media.html?referringSource=articleShare"&gt;to closing its doors&lt;/a&gt;. The eight-year-old media startup was unrecognizable to most. It operated in anonymity despite a roster including some well-known journalists, the high-profile guests who appeared on CEO Carlos Watson’s show, or NYC subway riders who were occasionally inundated with advertisements for its Ozyfest event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dJWYsr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ozy Media acknowledged that its COO and co-founder pretended to be a YouTube executive on a conference call.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pLdefT"&gt;If you don’t follow too many reporters on Twitter, you might not have heard, but last weekend the first &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/26/business/media/ozy-media-goldman-sachs.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report revealed two shocking things about Ozy Media. One, that co-founder and COO Samir Rao went on a conference call with Goldman Sachs bankers about a potential $40 million investment and impersonated a YouTube executive extolling the virtues of Ozy Media’s video channel. Two, that after the deception was revealed, the leadership of Ozy Media blamed it on a mental health issue and allowed Rao to stay in his executive position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arZmzO"&gt;The next day, Carlos Watson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carloswatson/status/1442351771544735749"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that it was a “hit-job,” and pointed out reasons to consider Ben Smith far too conflicted to report on the company. Smith still owns a share of &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed&lt;/em&gt;, and Watson said that in late 2019, as &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed&lt;/em&gt; editor in chief, Smith tried to arrange negotiations to acquire Ozy Media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ct3NBo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Heartbroken by the ridiculous hitjob from the NYTimes. But we are strong and undeterred. Building something new, fresh and worthy is not for the weak. Here is what I sent our team. &lt;a href="https://t.co/qcH4m9zqM2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qcH4m9zqM2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Carlos Watson (@carloswatson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carloswatson/status/1442351771544735749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wl17QC"&gt;Over the next few days, more of the stories told by Ozy Media and Watson started to unravel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnguNc"&gt;That includes pretty much any claim about its reach and traffic (a site claiming to have 25 million newsletter subscribers should be more well-known), and its claims to have reported on public figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) before other outlets. While those claims were echoed in reporting like this article on &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/ozy-revenue-profitability-carlos-watson-cdd726df-2e3d-49d7-abad-7ac6036f7013.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Nieman Lab&lt;/em&gt; reporter Joshua Benton &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/09/ozy-says-its-great-at-discovering-big-names-before-the-mainstream-media-but-is-it/"&gt;investigated&lt;/a&gt; and found that even in the cases Ozy cited, its coverage came months or years after the subjects had been covered thoroughly in mainstream publications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Ozy Mission - “We built our reputation on being ahead of the curve — we featured Trevor Noah before he was named host of&amp;amp;nbsp;The Daily Show, brought you Alexandria Ocasio Cortez when she was working as a bartender in the Bronx and showcased Awkwafina at OZY Fest before she became a Golden Globe-winning global star.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U9zCttZIi92G5LYNJD_obN2ijAw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894840/ozy_media.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yfQ8II"&gt;Watson told reporters on &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; that after a dispute over the name of its festival, Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne started investing in the site. This week Sharon Osbourne &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/30/ozy-media-founder-carlos-watson-lied-about-investment-sharon-osbourne-says.html"&gt;said to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that they have never been shareholders and called Watson “the biggest shyster I have ever seen in my life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCmkai"&gt;A former producer for the Carlos Watson show revealed that its big-name guests had been told the show would air on A&amp;amp;E and that it was a part of the YouTube Original package. A spokesman for the network told the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/business/media/ozy-media-carlos-watson.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that A&amp;amp;E said no to the show before taping ever began. A magazine-style ad for Ozy Media ran in the New York Times with a large tagline crediting &lt;em&gt;Dateline &lt;/em&gt;with a statement referring to Watson as “The best interviewer on TV.” As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mcmoynihan/status/1442627158631923718/photo/2"&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt; points out, the ad doesn’t mention that those words appeared on &lt;em&gt;Dateline &lt;/em&gt;as a quote from Ozy COO Samir Rao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7itIDt"&gt;Over the last several days, former BBC journalist Katty Kay publicly resigned, advertisers ran for the hills, and its chairman Marc Lasry — owner of the NBA World Champion Milwaukee Bucks — resigned just three weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/marc-lasry-named-chairman-of-ozy-media-4aa5b0fa-68c4-4785-b347-a127c512964b.html"&gt;taking the post&lt;/a&gt;. This morning, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/01/1041506435/ozy-carlos-watson-npr-board-resignation"&gt;Watson stepped down&lt;/a&gt; from the board of National Public Radio. Then, this afternoon, the news broke that Ozy was shutting down entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YMtf4y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;News: Ozy is shutting down. Here's the statement from the Ozy board &lt;a href="https://t.co/syOUrTtKBD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/syOUrTtKBD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ben Smith (@benyt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benyt/status/1444048250898685954?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Xbox is making it easier to find accessible games in its stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Xbox X in a circle logo against a dark background with green lines. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fal-LSEQOdyuUEyYmSuDS7yTH0k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69937114/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IhhMIN"&gt;Xbox is making it easier to find accessibility information for games, according to an announcement from the company at its &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/01/xbox-announces-accessibility-updates/"&gt;Accessibility Showcase&lt;/a&gt;. Games in the Microsoft store will have accessibility feature tags, so players with disabilities can make sure games have the features they need before buying or downloading them. The tags are appearing in the store for members of the &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-accessibility-insider-league"&gt;Xbox Accessibility Insiders League&lt;/a&gt; (XAIL) starting today and will eventually roll out to all Xbox users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XakC5T"&gt;The tags address an issue commonly expressed by players with disabilities: they often have to do their own research to figure out which games they can play. Listing certain features in the store consolidates information that can be frustrating to track down, especially if it’s not available on developer websites or in reviews. Publishers will also be able to link to additional information from the store. While the tag system is starting in the Microsoft Store, Xbox says they’ll also start showing up on Xbox.com, the Xbox app on PC, and Xbox Game Pass apps in coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Microsoft store titled “Accessibility spotlight” showing categories for featured games, gameplay, audio, and visual features. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UKE_KvgREAIk9ozCwSLZllNQ9pI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22891763/accesibility_spotlight.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xbox&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new spotlight in the store for accessible games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P81sKZ"&gt;Xbox says it plans to gather feedback from XAIL members over the next month before expanding the availability of the tags. Part of the fine-tuning for the tags involves determining specific sets of criteria that games need to meet in order to be labeled with each feature — a game with subtitles that can’t be resized, for instance, wouldn’t meet the bar for the subtitle options tag. The list of tags includes 20 features, like narrated game menus, input remapping, and single stick gameplay, and more could be added in the future based on feedback from players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRr2a1"&gt;“We look at this as an opportunity to up-level the industry a little bit,” says Anita Mortaloni, Director of Accessibility at Xbox, who hopes the criteria for the tags will encourage more developers to build robust accessibility features into their games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1wCdB"&gt;“As we continue on this journey, more and more titles will get [the tags] and hopefully inspire developers to look at those criteria and design their game with those in mind,” says Mortaloni, “because they know that once they publish, their titles can be tagged with those because they put that work in from the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PhXlEJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"New accessibility features are coming to Halo Infinite ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704024/halo-infinite-accessibility-features-colorblind-steering-controls"},{"title":"Microsoft starts new program to help make more accessible games ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286216/microsoft-xbox-games-tested-accessibility-guidelines"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="b4klEh"&gt;There’s also a new “Accessibility Spotlight” section in the store, with games in different categories based on the accessibility features they have, like audio or visual. Search results will be filterable by feature in coming months, according to Xbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ho4QIY"&gt;Xbox also announced several other features that it says will launch soon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="EZGX9K"&gt;Quick settings, which allow people to toggle accessibility features on or off without leaving a game or app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8o0XbG"&gt;Global color filters on Xbox Series X|S, for people with colorblindness to customize how colors are displayed across games, apps, and menus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="or0pUC"&gt;Night mode with adjustable filters and brightness, controller and power button light dimming, and scheduling options. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uWfjy9"&gt;A free gaming accessibility fundamentals course for developers launching in Microsoft Learn in late October.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Sony is offering free trials of Death Stranding and Sackboy in the UK</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qMIhrEbe_F7zlf7rWhYlJHOxU5k=/147x0:1208x707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69939278/Screenshot_2021_10_01_1.20.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SkXjV0"&gt;Sony appears to be reintroducing an old concept for two of its newer Playstation 5 games — game trials. Sony will now let you try the PS5 versions of &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding: Director’s Cut &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Sackboy: A Big Adventure &lt;/em&gt;for free if you live in the United Kingdom, for six hours and five hours, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9AvFS"&gt;PlayStation owners &lt;a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-offering-game-trials.494481/"&gt;first spotted Sony’s new offer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_wotta/status/1444006924261986344/photo/1"&gt;via email&lt;/a&gt;. “Ever wanted to try some of the most popular games from PlayStation Studios before committing to the full game? Now you can,” the email reads. Sony says the games are redeemable on the PlayStation Store until October 28th at 11:59PM, and the trial starts as soon as you select “Download Trial” on console or “Add to Library” on the web. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Sony for more information, but if you’re in the UK, both the &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA01968_00-DEATHSTRANDINGEU/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA01288_00-SACKBOYADVENTURE/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sackboy&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt; appear to already be live.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nIxlfelzFM2i4zeZvnD7FqHLd4M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894558/sonyGameTrials.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s email announcing the availability of game trials.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DETohJ"&gt;Ten or more years ago, offering a demo for a big blockbuster game wouldn’t be too unusual, but it seems in the last decade, the rise of free-to-play systems, public betas, and a robust Let’s Play community has sort of driven the “free trial” to partial extinction. That’s started to change yet again — &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/game-demos-are-back-baby/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; has a great piece&lt;/a&gt; trying to think through why — and it seems now Sony is dipping its toes in the water with two of its more recent first-party titles. Hopefully. that expands to more games and more regions soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1ayOt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to switch languages using the Android Gboard keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hMP-VXXAwqGtVMo3s3cxKrQrupo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69939082/akrales_190903_3635_0219.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dp2uwu"&gt;Learning a new language on an Android device? If the language uses a different alphabet or employs accents that your primary language does not, you may need to add a new software keyboard to your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssqMfc"&gt;Luckily, Google’s standard Gboard keyboard includes a plethora of language-related keyboards; at last count, it offered &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gboard-500-languages-935836/"&gt;over 500 languages over 40 different writing systems&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve already installed Gboard in the US, you’re likely already set up with US English. But it’s not difficult to add one or more new keyboards and quickly switch from one language to another. Here’s how to install and use one or more of the many languages available. (Note: this was tried out using a Pixel 3 phone and Android 12; your interface may vary.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf1duA"&gt;First, you need to get to the “Languages” page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LGBXTY"&gt;One way is to open an app such as email or chat and tap in an area where you can type in order to bring up the keyboard. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PSsHzl"&gt;Tap on the settings icon (the one that looks like a gear) just above the keyboard. If you don’t see it, click on the arrow on the left just above the keyboard to bring up the toolbar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LP3vX2"&gt;Select “Languages.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on the gear icon above the keyboard." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qu9saZuI2orPNmInerzInO1hCK4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894517/Screenshot_20211001_155057.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on the gear icon above the keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The languages you are using are listed on the “Languages page.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ovDpoVdI47-LJKfF2CHVqMsj6gI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894520/Screenshot_20210930_164122.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your languages are listed on the “Languages page.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rqnSFe"&gt;You can also get to the page from your Android device’s main settings menu. From the settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yW7sE8"&gt;Select “System.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GYny36"&gt;Select “Languages &amp;amp; input” &amp;gt; “On-screen keyboard” &amp;gt; “Gboard” &amp;gt; “Languages.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="wmVFz8"&gt;Once you’ve reached the “Languages” page, you can add a new language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yC7lsy"&gt;Tap on “Add keyboard” at the bottom of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ww33gw"&gt;Scroll to the language that you want to add and tap it. (It’s a long list, so you might save some time by using the search icon on the top right of the screen.) If you’ve been using a language-learning or other language-related app recently, the one you want may already be on top under “Suggested languages.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Add keyboard” list is very, very long." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TEM3khB2V0MuK2HyvlQYfagklRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894524/Screenshot_20210930_163837.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Add keyboard” list is very, very long.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You may have a choice of several types of keyboards." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cK8372CgjSIHQsJWQY05EQHUPhs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894525/Screenshot_20210930_163903.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You may have a choice of several types of keyboards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rW5Whu"&gt;Depending on the language, you may be able to choose from a list of several types of keyboards on top of the screen. (For example, you may be able to opt for a QWERTY or Dvorak keyboard, or set handwriting options.) The most likely suggestion will be first, but you can swipe across to see others that are available. On the same page, under “Language settings,” the “Multilingual typing” option lets you choose to be given word suggestions from more than one language while you type. (Whether it’s available depends on which language you’re adding.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kvKuRC"&gt;When you’re finished, tap the “Done” button. You’ll be brought back to the “Languages” page where you’ll see the new language listed. Tap the left arrow at the top left corner to leave the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JxQ4bk"&gt;You’ll now see the keyboard’s language named on the space bar. (If you enabled multilingual typing, you’ll see abbreviations of both language names.) In addition, there will now be a globe icon to the left of the keyboard instead of the emoji icon. (The emoji icon can now be accessed via a long press on the comma key.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPywDn"&gt;To change keyboards, tap on the globe; your keyboard will switch to the next in line. You can also long press on the space bar and select the language you want from the pop-up menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Multilingual typing will give you suggestions from both your languages." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MCAuFjv2LANZtoP6Q09KCWvRpig=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894539/Screenshot_20210930_164730.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multilingual typing will give you suggestions from both your languages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Long-press on the space bar to change language settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UNEv4XPFYkkRrRuYNWbCha7EwRw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894542/Screenshot_20210930_164746.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long press on the space bar to change language settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VzlAdz"&gt;If you’re no longer using one of your languages and you want to remove it from the list: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="AruZjo"&gt;Long press the space bar to get the “Change keyboard” menu. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Xm9Az0"&gt;Tap on “Language settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FX7J8F"&gt;Find the language you no longer need, and swipe to the left to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zQQlZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 1st, 2021, 4:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on January 3rd, 2020 and has been updated to allow for updates in the Android OS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
