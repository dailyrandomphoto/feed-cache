    <title>Vaccines are changing how we interpret COVID-19 numbers</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ShS4kr"&gt;It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241402/infection-count-coronavirus-cases-survellience-flu-hospital-sewage-data"&gt;never been possible&lt;/a&gt; to know for sure how many people in the United States are sick with COVID-19 at a particular time. Instead, we combine all of the metrics — the percentage of tests run that come back positive, the number of new cases reported each day, people coming to the emergency room sick with COVID-19 symptoms — to get an estimate. It’s like the story of the blind men and the elephant: experts can feel out the different pieces of information to get a sense of what an outbreak looks like, even when they can’t see it directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pT311"&gt;We’ve seen the same elephant emerge over and over again over the past year. First, the percentage of tests that come back positive increases. After a slight lag, hospitalizations start to rise, and then deaths. But this time, there’s a new wrinkle: vaccinations. That’s going to change the pattern and make the COVID-19 trends over the next few weeks and months harder to interpret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYHC0n"&gt;One of the most important data points to track the virus’s spread has been the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19-like illness at a particular time. It’s a concrete metric. If someone is so sick that they need to be hospitalized, they’re usually in the hospital. Other measures, like the case rate and test positivity rate, are finicky; they fluctuate based on how many people decide to get tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yR1xMC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If someone is so sick that they need to be hospitalized, they’re usually in the hospital&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hz3U2q"&gt;“Hospitalizations are our hard outcome. Everything else is so dependent on testing,” says Melissa McPheeters, co-director of the Center for Improving the Public’s Health through Informatics at Vanderbilt University. That’s why we’ve looked to hospitalization trends to get a sense of the direction of the pandemic, even when case rates wobble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwRBe5"&gt;Now, COVID-19 cases are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html"&gt;starting to go up again&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. But this time, over &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people over the age of 65 in the United States have received a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. That’s the group that, if they catch the virus, is most likely to be hospitalized or to die. Now they’re vaccinated — and their risk of hospitalization and death is incredibly small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7KXLp"&gt;That could throw our normal data patterns out of whack. Cases could go up because many states are relaxing restrictions while most people still aren’t vaccinated. But the unvaccinated people getting sick may be younger and less likely to be hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Tw2URL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dV9h5J"&gt;Our normal method of visualizing the elephant wouldn’t work anymore. It’s a good problem to have — fewer people in the hospital is a wonderful victory. But when case numbers wobble and testing goes up and down, hospitalizations will no longer be a reliable backstop to clarify what’s happening with the pandemic. “I don’t know that we can get as good of a sample of what’s going on in the community,” McPheeters says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNtvAf"&gt;It might mean that we need to recalibrate the way we monitor the pandemic. Maybe there will be fewer people in the hospital, but we could take a closer look at that group, for example. If lots of people from one area of a city are in the hospital, or people who work in a similar industry, that might be a signal that there is more virus in that particular community — which could help people to determine their risk and show officials where to direct resources. “It’s not just how many people, it’s &lt;em&gt;who &lt;/em&gt;is ending up in the hospital,” McPheeters says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usKvq1"&gt;For the past year, people have scrutinized COVID-19 metrics to guide decisions on how they should behave — whether to send kids to school, meet up with a few friends, or get groceries delivered. Eventually, as more people get vaccinated, new patterns could start to emerge that might guide that analysis. And when the pandemic starts to fade, we won’t have to scrutinize the COVID-19 numbers quite as closely. But for now, everything is in flux, and we can’t assume that a number means the same thing today as it did in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7JYFa"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s not an easy task, and international politics is making it that much harder. (Anthony Regalado / &lt;em&gt;MIT Tech Review&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QTphua"&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ANw99x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AstraZeneca’s wild ride&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Monday, AstraZeneca announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344191/covid-vaccine-astrazeneca-effective-us-study-disease-protection-fda"&gt;its vaccine was 79 percent effective&lt;/a&gt;. The next day, the government issued an incredibly unusual public rebuke of the company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346135/covid-vaccine-us-astrazeneca-niaid-statement-concerns"&gt;saying those numbers were outdated&lt;/a&gt;. AstraZeneca released new numbers later this week finding that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22346706/covid-vaccine-astrazeneca-data-niaid-effective"&gt;really 76 percent effective&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Whew.&lt;/em&gt; In the end, it's a pretty good vaccine with a bad communications problem. The FDA committee hearings for this one are going to be interesting. (Nicole Wetsman / &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLpK4n"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/health/coronavirus-children-vaccinations-pfizer.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pfizer Begins Testing Its Vaccine in Young Children&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Children under 12 are starting to participate in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines. Pfizer and Moderna are both starting their own trials to test how well the vaccines work in younger patients — and whether they are safe.

&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a great video from our colleagues at Vox explaining the differences between vaccine efficacy numbers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nBnQhP"&gt;Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="TYGJxe"&gt;There were the two weeks in the summer when all she could smell was phantom smoke. The odor was so strong that she woke up one morning startled, convinced that something in her house was on fire. Sometime later, she was able to smell her boyfriend’s cologne again—but instead of the familiar scent she had always loved, it was a sickening chemical odor. There’s also the hand soap at work, which used to smell generically fruity to her but now smells exactly, and eerily, like Burger King Whoppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="YMLNUO"&gt;— Sarah Zhang writes about Ruby Martinez’s experience recovering her sense of smell after COVID-19 in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CMSpOg"&gt;As of December 10, my health-care plan had billed me for $536,000. My plan paid for most of it, but I still owe around $150,000. That doesn’t include my bill for the implant. The medical bills lag; it takes months for things to come through. At first, it was stressful for me to look at them, but now it’s a joke. I look at them and think, I don’t know how to pay that. My premium is $750 a month, and my co-workers have been chipping in to cover that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="kfzSS7"&gt;— Liza Fisher tells journalist Wudan Yan about the costs of COVID-19 in a story for &lt;em&gt;Intelligencer&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qf7Oat"&gt;More than Numbers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzHy5l"&gt;To the more than 505 &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/"&gt;million people&lt;/a&gt; who have been vaccinated — thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krtvPW"&gt;To the more than 125,864,307 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeseHs"&gt;To the families and friends of the 2,761,409 people who have died worldwide — 547,756 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3RK5w"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6eCQq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix planning to launch 40 anime shows in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYPArJwMj5HfWhSckl1MuyM3CTQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69035469/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vmTnyO"&gt;Netflix announced at Tokyo’s AnimeJapan 2021 Expo Saturday that it will launch 40 new anime titles in 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-27/netflix-to-launch-40-new-anime-shows-after-blood-of-zeus-win?srnd=technology-vp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, following the success of its &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/5/21551756/blood-of-zeus-season-1-ending-hades-twist-season-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood of Zeus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;series last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynNdCQ"&gt;The new series to be released this year include an adaptation of the Japanese manga &lt;em&gt;Record of Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;, set to premiere in June; &lt;em&gt;Yasuke&lt;/em&gt;, about an African samurai in feudal-era Japan which will premiere April 29th; and &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness&lt;/em&gt;, based on the video game franchise. Netflix previously announced its anime series &lt;em&gt;The Way of the Househusband,&lt;/em&gt; also based on a Japanese manga series&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;will debut April 8th. &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/streaming/asia/netflix-japan-anime-record-of-ragnarok-1234938795/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that the number of anime titles coming to Netflix this year is nearly double the number of anime series and movies it released in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Snqtbt"&gt;“We want to be able to pride ourselves as being the top entertainment destination with good quality content,” Taiki Sakurai, Netflix’s chief anime producer, told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “The growth of our business is directly connected to the growth of our anime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qZMge"&gt;The worldwide anime market reached $23 billion last year, and is expected to grow to more than $36 billion by 2025, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Sony announced in December it planned to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166585/sony-buy-anime-streaming-service-crunchyroll-at-t-funimation"&gt;buy anime video site Crunchyroll&lt;/a&gt; for nearly $1.2 billion (although that sale has been delayed due to an &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sonys-hopes-of-countering-netflix-in-anime-market-delayed-by-antitrust-probe"&gt;antitrust probe by the US Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;). According to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, Netflix said the number of households that streamed its anime offerings last year &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/business/japan-anime.html"&gt;increased by half&lt;/a&gt; from 2019.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook temporarily freezes Venezuela president’s page for spreading coronavirus misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nicolas Maduro Announces Launch of Vaccination Campaign" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4vS0eScqETbdSYbTVb7WqJUIyzU=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69035382/1231221694.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Carolina Cabral/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hhSRSl"&gt;Facebook froze the page of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro for violating its policy against spreading COVID-19 misinformation, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-venezuela-exclusive/exclusive-facebook-freezes-venezuela-president-maduros-page-over-covid-19-misinformation-idUSKBN2BJ03Z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Maduro has promoted a “miracle” remedy that he claims will cure the coronavirus, but those claims have not been supported by the medical community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CCKbB"&gt;Facebook removed a video where Maduro touted Carvativir, a homeopathic remedy extracted from thyme. Maduro has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/coronavirus-venezuela-vaccine-maduro/2021/02/08/99ee1200-663a-11eb-8468-21bc48f07fe5_story.html"&gt;praised the solution in the past&lt;/a&gt; as “miracle drops” and a “medical breakthrough.” Doctors in Venezuela have called Maduro’s claims that Carvatavir can treat the coronavirus “dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWbcCU"&gt;This is not the first time Maduro has made false claims about coronavirus treatments on his social media platforms. Last March, Twitter &lt;a href="https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2020/03/25/twitter-elimino-un-tuit-de-maduro-sobre-un-supuesto-antidoto-contra-el-covid-19/"&gt;removed one of Maduro’s tweets&lt;/a&gt; that endorsed a “brew” that he falsely claimed could “eliminate the infectious genes” of COVID-19. The removal came despite Twitter’s stance &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2019/worldleaders2019.html"&gt;against removing tweets by world leaders&lt;/a&gt; unless the tweets explicitly violated its other rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zx3iAm"&gt;Facebook has tried with mixed success to combat the spread of coronavirus misinformation throughout the pandemic, enacting policies that required posts that could lead to “imminent physical harm” to be removed. It &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/coronavirus/#misinformation-update"&gt;expanded the policy&lt;/a&gt; to require the removal of false claims about COVID-19 vaccines, including conspiracy theories and false statements about the vaccines’ safety and side effects. It also applied labels to posts with incorrect coronavirus information, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/17/21223742/coronavirus-misinformation-facebook-who-news-feed-message-avaaz-report"&gt;guided users to accurate information&lt;/a&gt; from reliable medical sources.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJnItG"&gt;Facebook did not immediately return a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday, but told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that it follows guidance from the World Health Organization which says there is no cure for the coronavirus. “Due to repeated violations of our rules, we are also freezing the page for 30 days, during which it will be read-only.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get in on this week’s best tech deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/89o_6EWiilz0oaXZGSzC_IXfAmY=/0x56:2529x1742/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69035366/VizioOLED.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wqJkb2"&gt;Would you believe that it’s Friday already? That means it’s time for this week’s roundup of tech deals that are better than the rest. We comb through hundreds of deals from a variety of retailers each week, picking only the best sales to tell you about. By the time Friday comes around, some of them have usually expired, but we’ve included the good ones that are still happening below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IQdYO"&gt;Enjoy the weather this weekend if it’s starting to get nice outside where you live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oAKYTw"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gF9219"&gt;Save $10 on &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&lt;/em&gt; before it’s discontinued on March 31st&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dzqyqt"&gt;For reasons only Nintendo can explain, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&lt;/em&gt; will no longer be produced after March 31st. Even the digital version of the game will be delisted on the eShop. So if you want the game while it’s still relatively easy to find (and affordable to buy), head over to Walmart where you can get the compilation that contains &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; for $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ATwu7M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10355141"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LJCK37"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gFqFmT"&gt;Save $150 on Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones by buying refurbished at eBay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E3i83I"&gt;Normally, we recommend buying products new when possible (especially headphones), but this deal’s too good to pass up. At eBay, a well-rated seller is offering a like-new set of Sony’s high-end noise-canceling headphones for $208 before tax (originally $349 new). And with offer code &lt;strong&gt;PICKCR5 &lt;/strong&gt;added at checkout, you can knock the price down to $198.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgD3xt"&gt;We feature deals on this model a lot. And there’s a reason for that: they sound fantastic, and they’re comfortable. If you want to see what they’re all about — and save a bunch of money — check out this deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0Y0tjZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10411678" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="unDnzE"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NB7xHF"&gt;Vizio’s 55-inch OLED TV is back down to $1,000 at Best Buy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aLRrlQ"&gt;It’s been about a month and change since Vizio knocked the price of its debut OLED TV down to $1,000, but that time has returned. This model’s OLED panel has unparalleled picture quality and color accuracy compared to LCD, and its HDMI 2.1 ports allow the Xbox Series X, PS5, and PCs with certain graphics cards to display up to 4K at 120 frames per second in games that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5U9oWS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733767"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Bose Frames Tempo review: the specs to beat</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Bose’s sporty shades offer good sound, a steady fit, and total awareness&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FNpYyb"&gt;It’s still fair to call audio sunglasses a niche category, but with Bose offering several models, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;Amazon in the game&lt;/a&gt;, and counting recent announcements from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314474/razer-anzu-smart-glasses-announced-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;Razer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22219425/jlab-audio-jbuds-frames-open-ear-headphones-price-release-date"&gt;JLab&lt;/a&gt;, it’s certainly a growing one. There are people out there who just aren’t particularly fond of earbuds — often because they dislike the feeling of silicone tips plugging up their ears. Open-style products like the standard AirPods and Galaxy Buds Live are one alternative, but then you still face the possibility of losing them. If you’re running on a trail or out for an intense bike ride, it’s not an insignificant risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7ENkh"&gt;For those people, I can absolutely see the appeal of the Bose Frames Tempo, which have speakers built right into their frame and will stay planted on their face no matter how strenuous outdoor activity gets. The Tempo glasses are the sportiest model of Bose’s Frames family, clearly geared at hikers, runners, cyclists, and anyone else who spends a good chunk of their time outside. Bose says they’ve also got the best sound performance of the bunch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sFRdRG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10414314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ejbqly"&gt;From the front, they look like your typical pair of Oakley, Nike, or Under Armour sunglasses. Bose is clearly going after that same market with the $250 Tempos. If you’re more fashion-forward or looking for a pair of audio sunglasses that don’t give the impression you’re in the middle of a triathlon, you’ll want to stick with the Tenor or Soprano styles of Frames. These come with black mirrored lenses in the box, but Bose also sells a couple of other pairs of $40 lenses that you can swap in to let different amounts of light pass through. The oversized temples are where it becomes more obvious that these are audio sunglasses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OnX4us"&gt;But there’s a benefit to that chunky design: unlike the Tenor and Soprano Frames, which use a proprietary charger, the Tempo model has a regular USB-C connector on the left temple. Bose says the frame is made from “TR-90 nylon.” There’s not much give, but they feel rugged to me, and they’ve got an IPX4 water and sweat resistance rating, so if you get caught running or biking in the rain, they’ll survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/31eYWBrkY8nTLxTrG9Wu6O0Vs7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297692/cwelch_200927_4359_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The large temples are the obvious tell that these are audio sunglasses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C5-w4FzhCl2WmB3MC2SAh-YuzDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297697/cwelch_200927_4359_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Frames Tempo have simple controls that let you stay focused on your activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q8gtu0rHkK8xmhoe_hgSeyaNoEk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297700/cwelch_200927_4359_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three sizes of nose pads come included.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0Y8ORN"&gt;For the first couple of days wearing the Tempos, I felt a slight squeeze at the sides of my head that got uncomfortable. Now, I’ve got an extremely large dome — they used to have to bring out a special-sized helmet in Little League, friends — but thankfully, the fit loosened up a bit because this pressure went away by the end of the first week. The sunglasses didn’t get loose enough to where they started bobbing on my head or anything; they still felt nice and secure. (My friend Theresa, who has a normal-sized head, never mentioned any headache-inducing tightness.) Bose includes three sizes of nose tips in the box, and I found the large to be the right match. Even if my face was covered in sweat from a long run, the nose tips helped ensure the sunglasses didn’t slide around. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z1g2o-AkX8tJRZDQdhItRqKiaEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297695/cwelch_200927_4359_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The frames have an IPX4 rating for water and sweat resistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uyqKV7"&gt;The controls that Bose came up with are wonderfully foolproof, which is crucial when you’re trying to stay focused on other things. You swipe across the right temple to raise or lower the volume, and on the underside of that temple is a small circular button that you can press to play / pause, double-tap to skip tracks, or triple-tap to go back. In no time at all, these controls felt so natural and &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;. Powering off the Frames Tempo just takes holding down the button for a few seconds. Or you can flip them over and lay them down with the top of the frame on a surface. After two seconds in that orientation, they shut off. (You can disable this in settings, but I found it really convenient and, again, natural.) Battery life is listed as eight hours, and that’s lined up with my experience so far. The sunglasses take roughly an hour to charge back to 100 percent. Bose’s mobile app lets you update the sunglasses’ firmware, but there aren’t any EQ controls or other options that adjust their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N0H3LshrVobE92af08xzWK5myl4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297702/cwelch_200927_4359_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sunglasses stay firmly in place through all sorts of outdoor activities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DWoQIu"&gt;Describing the sound quality of audio sunglasses can be tricky. They’re nothing like headphones or earbuds since these are essentially down-firing speakers pointed at your ears. But Bose stepped up its game compared to the first-generation Frames, which I’ve tried on occasion. These have more life to them across the whole EQ range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="NGrMoF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10414391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kop70c"&gt;There’s a surprising amount of separation between vocals and instrumentation, and the Frames Tempo have a nice clarity and even-handed balance. There’s more bass than before, but this is where I think it’s most important to set reasonable expectations: the low end you get from any decent pair of in-ear buds will blow these out of the water. No contest. That said, Bose has at least reached a place where the bass no longer sounds anemic or flat, which is a legitimate improvement over the first-gen Frames. It’s there and perceptible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsBupf"&gt;Sound bleed is easily canceled out by everyday street noise, but if you’re inside with the volume turned up, people nearby will be able to tell that you’re listening to music. These are sunglasses, after all, so I imagine those situations will be few and far between. The Bluetooth connection has held stable throughout the vast majority of my time with the Frames Tempo so far. No complaints there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZPrsZ"&gt;Voice calls while wearing the Tempos have also been a joy. Callers say I sound nearly as good as when speaking directly into my phone, and something about taking calls with your ears totally open just feels very cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jnzrc3nz17qM7RC_2LLjDsfjCxk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399542/cwelch_200927_4359_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose sells additional $40 pairs of lenses that let in different amounts of light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3mlr5M"&gt;Even after a relatively short time using the Frames Tempo, I get this audio glasses thing. I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; get it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22330833/open-ear-headphones-review-best-bike-riding"&gt;It’s like Dieter recently wrote&lt;/a&gt;: “Not having to put in or take out headphones changes your relationship to audio — it’s just always available, always there when you want it.” Do I wish I could pop clear lenses into them and wear them everywhere? In theory, you bet. But this style wouldn’t really work for that, nor is it what the Tempos are meant to be at the end of the day. So I can’t knock Bose for the disappointment I feel when switching back to my normal glasses, which now seem so very primitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="FnaDAD"&gt;The Bose Frames Tempo let you hear the world around you with no obstructions — with a soundtrack playing over everything, while at the same time giving your ears a bit of a break compared to normal earbuds. At $250, they will be a tough sell for some. But I’ve come to realize that audio sunglasses are the exact sort of thing you won’t ever realize you needed. Until you put ‘em on — and all of a sudden, you do. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I do not Feel Good Inc about the Gorillaz NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CLVrlvLoQcKKS2ENEyhSQwFfbuM=/0x0:2004x1336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69034271/Screen_Shot_2021_03_26_at_3.21.40_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me, after the ice caps melt.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04mfKJWDSzI" target="_blank"&gt;Gorrilaz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dCdjY2"&gt;Virtual band Gorillaz’s debut album is turning 20 years old today (a fact I’m going to try to immediately forget), and in celebration the group will be carrying out the usual anniversary celebrations: re-releasing albums, selling new merch and, &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/gorillaz-celebrate-20-years-of-their-self-titled-debut-album-2908720"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;NME&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, selling NFTs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAM2Z6"&gt;This news has &lt;em&gt;Broken&lt;/em&gt; me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="endB6v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kMMtXa"&gt;At this point, it’s pretty clear that NFTs are a thorny environmental issue — while it can be hard to calculate exactly how bad they are in terms of carbon emissions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;the picture is not looking good&lt;/a&gt;. In general, upon seeing the torrent of NFT news, it’s been easy to needle people about participating in a marketplace that is doing actual damage to the world: “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/3/17/22336115/charmin-nft-toilet-paper-cryptoart-marketing"&gt;Okay, Brand&lt;/a&gt;, hope this marketing stunt was worth setting the Earth on fire?” Turns out it’s not as fun when someone you actually like is doing it, especially if that artist has previously &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSffezqR_XA&amp;amp;list=PLxzSZG7g8c8xYzHnxKrYxJ2FobX8rd2_C"&gt;made&lt;em&gt; an entire album about ecological destruction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qPORhn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;O green world, don’t desert me now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qhRfBk"&gt;I don’t want to come off like I’m trying to cancel Gorillaz, or say it’s bad for artists to make money. Artists should absolutely be paid more for their work, and I’m all for them trying to come up with new things to sell to fans willing to pay. But NFTs come with a cost that’s hard to justify, and seeing a band I like seemingly ignore that has left me sitting on a &lt;em&gt;Melancholy Hill.&lt;/em&gt; And I’m not &lt;em&gt;All Alone&lt;/em&gt; — there have been &lt;a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/gorillaz/gorillaz-self-titled-nfts/"&gt;plenty of other fans voicing their disappointment&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. It probably doesn’t help that their ecological album was called &lt;em&gt;Plastic Beach&lt;/em&gt;, and they’re reportedly working with a company called Superplastic to sell the NFTs&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Life comes at you fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRIpyb"&gt;If you’re an artist, here’s a &lt;em&gt;Song 2 &lt;/em&gt;repeat: &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO gives George R.R. Martin an eight-figure deal to keep A Song of Ice and Fire on ice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="IMDb LIVE After the Emmys Presented by CBS All Access" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IBMyLIBDWrc2PVu4BsVpeWbumwQ=/0x0:4055x2703/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69034221/1176465771.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Rich Polk/Getty Images for IMDb&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XvuOCr"&gt;George R.R. Martin, the author of the &lt;em&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire&lt;/em&gt; book series that was turned into HBO’s smash hit &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, has signed a huge new deal with HBO to make content for the network and HBO Max, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/george-r-r-martin-signs-massive-five-year-overall-deal-with-hbo-exclusive"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a five-year deal worth “mid-eight figures,” sources told &lt;em&gt;THR.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnEdEi"&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;ended in 2019, HBO owner WarnerMedia has already announced a prequel series, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21067850/house-of-the-dragon-hbo-game-of-thrones-prequel-premiere-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;House of the Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;based on Martin’s 2019 book &lt;em&gt;Fire and Blood. &lt;/em&gt;And there are five projects in development based on the &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; universe, &lt;em&gt;THR &lt;/em&gt;reports. Martin is also developing series for HBO based on the novels &lt;em&gt;Who Fears Death &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Roadmarks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVoTVk"&gt;My worst fear, though, is that this huge new deal keeps Martin from working on the sixth book in the &lt;em&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire&lt;/em&gt; book series, &lt;em&gt;The Winds of Winter&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2021/02/02/reflections-on-a-bad-year/"&gt;The author said in February&lt;/a&gt; that he wrote “hundreds and hundreds of pages” of &lt;em&gt;The Winds of Winter &lt;/em&gt;in 2020, which was the “best year” he’s had on the book. Fingers crossed he’s been keeping that momentum going. The previous title in the seven-book series, &lt;em&gt;A Dance with Dragons&lt;/em&gt;, was released in July 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wait, GameStop sells GPUs now?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jg8EBPMRBEAuirHUQ-FYoWlZw4o=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69034003/20170822_Sean_Hollister_Verge_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ps4rDY"&gt;GameStop has sold PC gaming hardware for a while now, including entire gaming laptops, monitors, headphones, mice and speakers, but in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323839/gamestop-stock-price-dramatic-rise-fall-stonks-return"&gt;the post-stonks era&lt;/a&gt; it apparently wants a piece of Best Buy and Newegg’s desktop components business as well. Most prominently, the company has started selling Nvidia RTX 3000 series graphics cards — where by “selling,” I mean engaging in the same sort of barely-there, blink-and-they’re-gone listings as every other purveyor of GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYaR9T"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gamestop-starts-selling-gpus-obviously-doesnt-have-any-gpus-to-sell/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, GameStop made its entire weekly circular ad revolve around PC gaming this week, including several GPUs, motherboards, a power supply, and a case:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WeJRF96V6DEU-ekTmI6HCz1PSzw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22401083/gamestop_weekly_ad.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameStop’s weekly circular for March 21st-27th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DebatL"&gt;Back in reality, though, GameStop sold out of these GPUs days ago, roughly the instant they  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GameStop/status/1374420993607831561"&gt;first went on sale&lt;/a&gt;. Judging by the replies to GameStop’s tweets, this was the typical reaction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JMTvIQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;wanted a 3080 but javascript happened &lt;a href="https://t.co/ILZor3DWvd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ILZor3DWvd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 『ᴇɴ ᴠᴛᴜʙᴇʀ』Freya @ TFF SUN 3/28 3AM EDT (@FreyaFloof) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FreyaFloof/status/1374424835833483264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FafEE2"&gt;And as best as I can tell, the entirety of GameStop’s PC component selection consists of two motherboards right now. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oSiK5m_FlRxaiT7Mcgw5Pvb-Zoo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22401091/gamestop_selection_hardware.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The selection of GameStop PC hardware that is “available now.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="etV0CP"&gt;It’s hard to blame GameStop for selling out of components, though, hilarious Javascript or no — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;the street prices of Nvidia and AMD GPUs are utterly out of control&lt;/a&gt;, selling for 2x-3x their worth. I just don’t understand why GameStop would even bother to try during the shortage. Maybe it could refurbish old graphics cards at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/10/3230609/gamestop-tour-interview-spawn-labs-paul-raines-tony-bartel"&gt;its refurbishment plant&lt;/a&gt;? Even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278562/nvidia-rtx-2060-gtx-1050-ti-gpu-shortage-global-chip"&gt;older cards are in high demand&lt;/a&gt; right now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon gets FDA authorization for an at-home COVID-19 test kit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OCwR2AlUfZ93EApaYK_4BGaO8TY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69033532/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nWj5B7"&gt;Amazon received Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/147050/download"&gt;authorization&lt;/a&gt; for a COVID-19 test made by its&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;subsidiary STS Lab Holdco, and it plans to use it for its onsite coronavirus testing programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PznzYo"&gt;The test is done using a nasal self swab that can be done either under the supervision of a health care provider or as part of an at-home kit where a patient takes their own sample and mails it to a centralized lab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuwEFz"&gt;“Amazon plans to use the Amazon Real-Time RT-PCR Test for Detecting SARS-CoV-2 (Amazon Test) as part of the company’s overall Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) preparedness and response program,” the FDA’s &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/147053/download"&gt;authorization reads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEi4an"&gt;The authorization also describes Amazon’s employee-screening program. Some Amazon employees will be automatically given testing appointments around every 14 days. The tests are voluntary. “Amazon has partnered with a third-party healthcare provider who will issue the necessary prescriptions and individual test orders,” the authorization said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQJAZa"&gt;The authorization letter is addressed to Cem Sibay, the vice president of Amazon Labs. Last summer, Amazon tapped Sibay to build its in-house COVID-19 testing lab, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-cem-sibay-now-leading-covid-19-test-lab-2020-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. In October, &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/how-we-ramped-up-onsite-covid-19-testing-for-amazon-employees"&gt;the company said&lt;/a&gt; it had the infrastructure to run tens of thousands of tests for employees each day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQs5jT"&gt;The new test is a modification of another COVID-19 test made by&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;BGI Genomics, which &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/147053/download"&gt;the authorization&lt;/a&gt; said Amazon used at the end of August. The company began using the modified version that would become the Amazon test on August 28th, 2020. Between late September and early December 2020, it ran over 560,000 samples, according to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/147053/download"&gt;the authorization&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DnXDCu"&gt;Amazon started selling at-home COVID-19 testing kits made by genomics company DxTerity &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2021/01/06/amazon-sells-home-covid-19-testing-kits-cases-continue-rise/6561595002/"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;. That test sells for $110. The company continues to expand into health care: last week, it announced that it would start offering its in-house telehealth and at-home health care program to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336010/amazon-care-expand-employees-virtual"&gt;other companies&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon has also expressed interest in medical testing before. In 2018, the company &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/amazon-explored-medical-diagnostics-was-in-talks-to-buy-confer-health.html"&gt;was in talks&lt;/a&gt; to buy diagnostics company Confer Health.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Fast charging and elegant software offset a so-so camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KqtAyf"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro is a legitimate flagship phone that is genuinely competitive with the best Android phones on the market — at least from a features and quality perspective. Yet in terms of market and mind share, it’s still destined to be a niche device for a small group of enthusiasts looking for a specific kind of elegance in their Android device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAjS4O"&gt;And that’s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0Ns9M"&gt;If you live in the US and you’re buying an Android phone, chances are very high that you’ll end up with a Samsung Galaxy phone. Samsung has the carrier relationships, quality, and marketing that have led directly to market share. LG, Motorola, and even &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america"&gt;sell more phones here than OnePlus does&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4shcPS"&gt;But after nearly seven years and dozens of phones, OnePlus has established itself as a brand that can make great phones that are serious alternatives to the mainstream. The $969 OnePlus 9 Pro achieves that goal with only a handful of notable compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2jYBg"&gt;OnePlus’ flagship phones always come with a laundry list of top-of-the-line specs, but what makes the OnePlus 9 Pro good isn’t the numbers; it’s how well those specs translate into one of the best experiences you can get using Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AHu1Vy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi-pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"},{"title":"This $159 OnePlus Watch is OnePlus’ first smartwatch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22334322/oneplus-watch-smartwatch-features-price-specs-battery"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro announced with Hasselblad-branded cameras ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22340406/oneplus-9-phone-price-release-date-availability"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hpoEZD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10406462"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 Pro has an elegant design, but won’t support 5G on all networks" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NjdZe-bk4k4KgMTns8qChqCoZ-o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388892/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0068.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has an elegant design but won’t support 5G on all networks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bQiCrq"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro hardware design and 5G support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rZIXVc"&gt;The hardware design on the OnePlus 9 Pro is the most seamless, elegant phone that the company has designed to date. It is, of course, big. It has a 6.7-inch screen that goes from edge to edge in a body that’s narrow enough to make it just barely usable for me in one hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MZ4NI"&gt;What I can’t help but notice is how far OnePlus has come in build quality. The glass on the front and back curves into the aluminum rail on the edges with no seams at all. It’s well-balanced, beautiful, and solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Top: OnePlus 9 Pro; bottom: Galaxy S20 Plus. Both phones have similarly curved glass and molded aluminum rails." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sTvlAj6Darv2g-R9N0QJ9O44UZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389264/oneplus9progalaxys20plus.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top: OnePlus 9 Pro. Bottom: Galaxy S20 Plus. Both phones have similarly curved glass and molded aluminum rails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It has a three-stage ringer switch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAp70uBpGGWtFpcHUizuZRTE4QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388880/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0054_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It has a three-stage ringer switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYWqZR"&gt;It’s also the spitting image of a Galaxy S20 Plus. Shift a couple of buttons around, move the selfie camera to the middle, and swap out the logo, and it’s the same design. I get that there are only so many ways to sandwich curved glass and aluminum together, but it’s uncanny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSjJvc"&gt;To be fair, OnePlus does keep some of its identity in the three-stage ringer switch, which easily lets you toggle between a ringer, vibration, and fully silent. It may still be my favorite feature on OnePlus phones, and I remain baffled as to why more Android phone makers don’t adopt a physical ringer switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVSttu"&gt;Speaking of vibration, the haptics on the OnePlus 9 Pro aren’t sloppy at all, unlike many Android phones. Unfortunately, the trade-off is that they aren’t very strong; I often can’t feel it vibrate in my pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6vr0E"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has the top-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is paired with eight gigs of RAM on the 128GB model. You can’t get it in a smaller screen size, but you can spend $100 more to get 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM. There’s no microSD card slot for storage expansion in either model. What you get is what you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMXoXr"&gt;It supports both Sub-6 and millimeter-wave (mmWave) styles of 5G, but there’s a significant caveat: the phone supports it, but OnePlus has only managed to land 5G certification from its carrier partner, T-Mobile. If you buy it unlocked, as of now, it will only work with T-Mobile’s 5G network. Everything else will be LTE. AT&amp;amp;T 5G support doesn’t appear to be in the cards at all, and as for Verizon, OnePlus says that it “continues to work with Verizon to certify both the 9 and 9 Pro on its 5G network.” Later, on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353052/oneplus-9-pro-verizon-5g-network-certified"&gt;March 26th, Verizon announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would support 5G on the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OnePlus’ wireless warp charger can fully charge the phone in under 45 minutes" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gyFkyRjI2k4qCPN085Bz4kQTDBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388875/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus’ wireless warp charger can fully charge the phone in under 45 minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w5puLi"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro battery and charging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zfl3AK"&gt;For OnePlus, the standout spec is its proprietary charging technology. There’s a 65W charger included in the box, and it can charge up the phone ridiculously fast. The phone’s 4,500mAh battery is actually split in two, which helps further speed charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 65W charger comes in the box (pictured with the regular OnePlus 9)." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bYtldbablBg79ONjjiRExDVLu8E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388874/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 65W charger comes in the box (pictured with the regular OnePlus 9).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJcrVY"&gt;If you like, you can spend an additional $69 on OnePlus’ new Warp Charge 50 wireless charger. It charges at 25W, but since the battery is split, it’s essentially the same as charging at 50W, wirelessly. It also works if you set the phone on the charger in landscape mode. With the phone fully dead, it charged completely in 45 minutes. With ambient mode in Google Assistant on, it took a bit longer — but it was still wicked fast compared to other wireless chargers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1P12A6"&gt;That 4,500mAh battery was enough to get me through a full day and a half of moderately heavy usage. However, OnePlus phones do tend to be a little more variable in their battery life depending on use. Spending a day shooting 4K video and pushing the processor with games meant I could kill it with less than four hours of screen-on time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fG6qV"&gt;So while the battery life might not be best in class, the way OnePlus has built its ecosystem for charging means I’m able to top off faster than I can with other phones — provided I use OnePlus’ proprietary chargers, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 Pro has an LTPO OLED screen, which can help with battery life" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B5cHhLu_Wn4xSxFlJ9pZp5KWWUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388890/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0066.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro has an LTPO OLED screen, which can help with battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X8qQlG"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="OAFOOG"&gt;After wireless charging, the next standout spec on the OnePlus 9 Pro is that 6.7-inch screen. Like Samsung, OnePlus has switched over to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;an LTPO style of OLED&lt;/a&gt;, which can be more power efficient and allows the company to have more control over the refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ9Qor"&gt;The screen can go all the way from 120Hz on down to 1Hz, depending on what’s happening on the display. OnePlus has branded the touch response rate on the screen as “Hyper Touch,” clocked at 360Hz for certain games, and though I am dubious it makes that big a difference for gamers, OnePlus says it could. More consequential is the screen resolution: 1440 x 3216 at 525ppi. You can leave it at that high resolution and have the high refresh rate screen going at the same time. Doing so probably hits battery life, but to me, the point of this max-spec phone is to max the specs, so I didn’t turn down the resolution or the refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yI05D4"&gt;Those are the specs on the screen, but it’s the experience that matters. And again, I think OnePlus has done a remarkable job here. Something about the tuning of the animations in OxygenOS makes this phone feel just a little bit smoother than even Samsung phones. I also appreciate the color tuning — although it’s not as subdued as an iPhone or even a Pixel, it’s more restrained than Samsung’s default settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBNXzq7K6YNBtQHo8bKFRoCNvZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388879/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid but has room to improve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0avD9X"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bt7aQC"&gt;Without delving into a lot of history, I will just point out that until very recently, camera quality has been the main downfall for OnePlus phones. It’s a particularly bad way to fall down, too, because often, the clearest and simplest way to compare phones that otherwise look and perform nearly equivalently is to look at the photos they take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95RI9o"&gt;OnePlus knows all of this and wants to position the OnePlus 9 Pro as a heads-up competitor — or at least a viable alternative — to the very best Samsung and even Apple have to offer. So it did a thing a lot of challenger brands do: called in a ringer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="G9j19S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Hasselblad partnership is only about color tuning and interface design this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Xt3br"&gt;That ringer is Hasselblad, which OnePlus is partnering with to improve its camera results. It will be a multiyear effort, and it’s far from guaranteed it’ll be a fruitful partnership. In fact, most of these sorts of deals don’t really do anything notable when it comes to the camera’s quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhWaA4"&gt;This year, Hasselblad’s participation with OnePlus’ development process amounted to helping the company tune the colors from the camera and lending a bit of its interface to the camera’s Pro mode. Oh, and most importantly for OnePlus, Hasselblad allowed its logo to be stamped next to the lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOkITZ"&gt;I do think there’s some credit due to this color-tuning influence. In the same way that other smartphone brands have a “look” to their photos, I think OnePlus is developing its own. iPhone photos are generally flat and neutral, tending to the warm side of color; Pixel photos contrasty and blue; and Samsung photos have the vibrancy slider set to max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OnePlus 9 Pro: indoor with mixed lighting handles color well" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AsREolMsK8SMr90RWIWvZnhRREM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389337/17_LE2125_IMG_20210313_111817.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro: indoor with mixed lighting handles color well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus tends to ramp up blue colors, which is usually fine but can sometimes get the camera into trouble.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OnePlus does a good job not adding too much vibrancy when it’s not there in the first place" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XaIF0PK3g-pGh0OMJy-SxrBH9XU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389336/15_LE2125_IMG_20210313_110553.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus does a good job of not adding too much vibrancy when it’s not there in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vFHBSJ"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro’s image output lands mostly in the middle. It tends toward blue, and it definitely lifts up shadows to create more even lighting. Its photos are more striking but less accurate than what you’ll get out of an iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yYysn"&gt;The camera system is good, but it can’t quite match the quality you get from an iPhone 12 Pro Max or Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra — both of which cost more than the OnePlus 9 Pro. It handles a variety of conditions quite well, but sometimes I just had to take an extra beat to compose my shot. It let me better judge what the viewfinder was showing and, honestly, gave me time to try the shot again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ps0XCc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10406526"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GnGiG3"&gt;As usual with smartphone cameras, I think the difference comes down to software. I like the colors the 9 Pro produces, but sometimes it just tries too hard and whiffs. Similarly, OnePlus seems to want to bring a little of that Pixel contrast magic to bear but instead just oversharpens. And lightening shadows is sometimes laudable, but not when it adds completely unnecessary and distracting image noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The camera can try too hard to brighten shadows, introducing noise" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CF7YOM7t6e5tB0A06yC8faoLao4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389355/18_LE2125_IMG_20210313_112304.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera can try too hard to brighten shadows, introducing noise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The camera oversharpens sometimes, too. Take a look at the fringing around the runners on the lake in this ultrawide shot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gDooOLmKNWq0aQR0K3UtcKZlt6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389354/06_LE2125_IMG_20210311_160459.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera oversharpens sometimes, too. Take a look at the fringing around the runners on the lake in this ultrawide shot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jmns55"&gt;The main camera uses a new 48-megapixel Sony sensor with OIS, though when I pressed OnePlus to tell me what exactly that sensor brings to the table, I didn’t really get a clear answer. You can shoot 12-bit RAW images in the Pro mode (which is two bits more than last year, if you’re keeping count). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noaYb1"&gt;That’s all nice, but the interface on Pro mode is what gets me. You can clearly see what’s set to manual and what’s in auto mode. It’s simple and easy to use, too. Best of all is focus peaking, which draws little lines over the part of the image that’s in focus. It is a lot clearer and more fun to use than the tap-to-focus you need to use on other phones. (You can do that here, too, of course.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qMoum"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro’s other cameras include a big, 50-megapixel ultrawide with a sensor that’s quite a lot nicer than the usual step-down sensors ultrawides get stuck with. I loved using it right up until it went haywire with sharpening. OnePlus put in a custom lens to help with distortion at the edges, and it works as well or better than pure software fixes at keeping straight lines from bowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGBpJb"&gt;The telephoto camera is 3.3x, and it’s not anything special at that zoom level. Beyond it, digital zoom is kind of a mess. It gets pantsed by the S21 Ultra with its periscope-style lens. There’s also a monochrome camera that serves only as a helper for the rest of the system, but I suspect it’s not doing anything especially important. OnePlus did drop the gimmicky and pointless “color filter” camera from last year’s 8 Pro this time around. It will probably drop the monochrome camera next year, if I had to guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="exkR3H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10406545"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TReqrH"&gt;OnePlus’ software-focused Nightscape mode works really well for capturing nighttime shots, although to my tastes, it over-brightens the image. Portrait mode is a mixed bag; heads often look artificially cut out from the blurry background. Again, I can get good shots, but portrait mode was often one of those situations where I needed to try the shot a second time. The selfie camera is passable in good light but falls down fast in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkqOPE"&gt;Unfortunately, video is equally messy. The OnePlus 9 Pro will let you shoot up to 8K 30 or 4K 120, but neither looked good. In fact, regular old 4K 30 has that overprocessed and oversharpened look you see so often from smartphones. The big new feature is improved HDR for backlit subjects, but the effect is minimal at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uC8chD"&gt;That’s a whole pile of critical takes compared to phones that cost more than this phone. But despite the price difference, I think the OnePlus 9 Pro’s camera should be held to as high a standard as possible — it’s a flagship phone. It can sometimes hang with the best of the best, and that’s a win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pLQs9q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10406554"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can put all your widgets in a drop-down menu instead of on your home screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZN4UWi"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro performance and OxygenOS 11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iYZu5Q"&gt;Even though the camera is often the main differentiator for an Android phone, it’s not necessarily everybody’s highest priority. When I’m not pixel-peeping photos, the OnePlus 9 Pro is the best Android phone I’ve used so far this year. The performance is great. I’m especially impressed with the optical in-screen fingerprint sensor, which is super fast and doesn’t seem to be thrown by weird lighting conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHyiSQ"&gt;OnePlus’ version of Android is called OxygenOS, and it’s now at version 11. The company has borrowed Samsung’s idea of shifting content down to meet your thumb and added in support for an always-on ambient display. The animations feel smooth, and OnePlus has learned its lesson about how annoying it can be to have apps close in the background too often. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bWqNDM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OnePlus has a more elegant version of Android than Samsung&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eOb2Eg"&gt;OnePlus has committed to two major OS updates and three years of bimonthly security updates, which puts it ahead of brands like LG but behind Samsung and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpxgUZ"&gt;You can customize a few things like the font and icons, too. My favorite customization is an ambient display mode that displays a colorful bar that shows how often you’ve been using your phone throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXAAvg"&gt;One feature borrowed from Apple and / or Microsoft is the ability to put your widgets into a separate panel so they’re not littering your main home screen, accessible via a quick swipe down. I love it, but I wish it wasn’t mapped to the same thing other Android phones use to quickly bring down notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIRq8d"&gt;Mostly, though, OxygenOS just feels &lt;em&gt;chill&lt;/em&gt;, especially compared to Samsung. OnePlus isn’t pushing its own ecosystem of apps and services (though with a new OnePlus Watch coming, perhaps that may change). It’s also not festooning its own apps with advertisements, unlike Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="waqTIv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10406439"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 has a slightly smaller screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7cetFjAfrRKtYErNsip_4ScK7t4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388898/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0077_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 (right) has a slightly smaller screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="p8uB5Z"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro is not a “flagship killer.” It’s a flagship. Although it still costs a little less than its top-tier competitors, it nevertheless is a pricey phone that makes a lot of promises. Mostly, it delivers on them. Even though a tiny fraction of customers buy OnePlus phones compared to Apple and Samsung, the company has built a track record long enough to deserve its status as an established brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GhSKH3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The regular OnePlus 9 is a fine choice for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NA5uRY"&gt;If you’re considering one of the new OnePlus phones, I am actually hard-pressed to make the case for the OnePlus 9 Pro over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;regular OnePlus 9, which Allison Johnson reviewed.&lt;/a&gt; The regular OnePlus 9 is $240 less, and the things you lose are mostly the nice-to-haves that justify the Pro’s existence: fast wireless charging, OIS, a telephoto lens, mmWave 5G, and the slightly larger screen. The cheaper OnePlus 9 lacks telephoto, but its other cameras take photos that are nearly equivalent to the pro. It has a high refresh rate screen, fast wired charging, wireless charging (though it’s not as fast), and most importantly, a nice OnePlus software experience with great performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="mMX9ur"&gt;The reason to opt for the 9 Pro over the regular 9 is in some ways the same reason you’d opt for a OnePlus phone over a Samsung phone in the first place: it’s just a little nicer and a little different than what everybody else has in their pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iuxd2s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 26th, 2021 5pm ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353052/oneplus-9-pro-verizon-5g-network-certified"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon announced&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; it would support 5G on the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro and OnePlus confirmed they will not work on AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network. The review has been updated to note the new information. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
