    <title>Twitter will label COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and enforce a strike system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8wThdWc5ICq5o30zG0wPAWGsFyA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68894023/acastro_201106_1777_vote_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="miqZ2y"&gt;Twitter announced Monday that it will &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/updates-to-our-work-on-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation.html"&gt;start labeling tweets&lt;/a&gt; that share misleading information about COVID-19 vaccines. The labels will include links to relevant information from official bodies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Twitter plans to enforce a five-strike system for repeat offenders that can lead to locked accounts and permanent suspension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUH3q2"&gt;The new labels are similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150425/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-misinformation-ban"&gt;Facebook’s anti-misinformation banners&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254733/twitter-covid-19-misleading-information-label-warnings-misinformation"&gt;the labels Twitter began deploying&lt;/a&gt; early in the pandemic. They appear as text underneath misleading tweets, with links to information from official sources or Twitter’s rules. Twitter says it applies these labels through a combination of human and automated review systems and is starting its rollout with English-language content first.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iM6Rrx6W9jt5mrMJl7xkZVfv8cY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22337625/Screen_Shot_2021_03_01_at_12.44.04_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of a labeled tweet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rFBsOk"&gt;Twitter has specific criteria for labeling in its &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/medical-misinformation-policy"&gt;COVID-19 misleading information policy&lt;/a&gt;, but generally, the company targets five categories of false or misleading information: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VJ2AYF"&gt;Misinformation about the nature of the virus &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Snq6Tv"&gt;Misinformation about the efficacy of treatments and preventive measures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OR9wmE"&gt;Misinformation about regulations, restrictions, and exemptions in association with health advisories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PpuYZ4"&gt;Misinformation about the prevalence of the virus and the risk of infection or death&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jQsynJ"&gt;Misleading affiliations (for example, claiming to be a doctor or public health official)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zFbSxM"&gt;Labels also feed into the new strike system for COVID-19 misinformation. A harmful, labeled tweet counts as one strike. If Twitter determines the misinformation is particularly dangerous in its questioning of COVID-19 treatments and invokes a larger conspiracy connected to the virus (like the idea that vaccines include microchips for tracking people), the company may also delete the tweet, which counts as two strikes. From there, account-level strikes accrue, triggering different actions from Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLlLzi"&gt;Appending labels has been part of the larger strategy to fight misinformation Twitter used during the 2020 election, adding labels to tweets from politicians — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271207/twitter-donald-trump-fact-check-mail-in-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-california"&gt;including the former president&lt;/a&gt; — when they included inaccurate information. While the labels seem helpful, they don’t necessarily deter people from sharing the information. Holding real punishment like a suspension until there have been five bad tweets also means that misinformation could spread with only some text as a warning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpjMDX"&gt;You can see Twitter’s various punishments for the different number of strikes below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1AD8G3"&gt;One strike: no account-level action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zISbEb"&gt;Two strikes: 12-hour account lock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OeJ2DN"&gt;Three strikes: 12-hour account lock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="icX1YB"&gt;Four strikes: 7-day account lock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FQiStj"&gt;Five or more strikes: permanent suspension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="dSDUoY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: this is your last chance to grab these Mario games for your Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/35C4L1vnZ8kEK9qL9LnToRkUYw0=/159x0:1797x1092/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68893895/Screen_Shot_2021_03_01_at_4.25.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEXDO3"&gt;It’s March, which means Nintendo will soon pull a handful of games released specifically for anniversary celebrations. Switch owners have until the end of this month, March 31st, to grab games before the developer pulls them off the eShop. That includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21778351/fire-emblem-shadow-dragon-and-the-blade-of-light-nintendo-switch-online-retro-games"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and the Blade of Light, Super Mario Bros. 35&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Game &amp;amp; Watch Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J82zK4"&gt;Similar to Disney’s infamous “vault” tactic — offering films for a limited time before they’re stuffed back into a metaphorical vault and become impossible to get — Nintendo announced last year that it would only offer certain games until this year. It’s unclear if the developer will rerelease these games further down the road or if they’ll remain unavailable indefinitely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHA8yU"&gt;Nintendo continues to celebrate Mario’s 35th anniversary with different events and cross-promotions. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288246/animal-crossing-new-horizons-mario-update"&gt;Last month&lt;/a&gt;, it released an update in &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; that added Mario costumes and items to the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PjnxZI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10355141"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vez579"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdWVf1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A folding iPhone could be coming in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The dual camera system on the iPhone 12." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nx66yCszvvh2QlUkxEAsrq_gBUI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68893636/vpavic_4243_20201018_0139.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FqJ72b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233644/foldable-iphone-apple-screens-report"&gt;Rumors about a folding iPhone&lt;/a&gt; are nothing new, but analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/17/18228861/apple-iphone-kuo-rumor-ipad-ipod-touch-airpower-airpods"&gt;who has a very strong track record&lt;/a&gt;) is weighing in with information of his own: he says that Apple could be looking at a 2023 launch, and that the phone could have a screen between 7.5 and eight inches (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-foldable-iphone-2023/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-considers-foldable-iphone-minor-changes-planned-for-2021-models"&gt;Previous rumors have suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the screen would be smaller, closer to the size of an iPhone 12 Pro Max.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKsKu9"&gt;There have been numerous reports about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233644/foldable-iphone-apple-screens-report"&gt;Apple prototyping a folding iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, but according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;, Kuo says that the product has “not yet officially kicked off.” Meanwhile, competitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22149866/royole-flexpai-2-hands-on-folding-phone"&gt;Royole&lt;/a&gt; have all released multiple foldable phones (though they’re mostly expensive and clearly early implementations of the tech). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7AoOv"&gt;According to Kuo, the screen will be iPad Mini-sized when folded out, so it seems as if Apple is going for the Galaxy Fold approach of having a regular-sized phone that folds out into a small tablet, rather than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;Z Flip&lt;/a&gt; or Razr approach of having a compact folding phone. (This is a bummer to me, but it seems like the folding phablet approach is the most popular at the moment.) It’s unclear who would be making those folding displays — there have been rumors of Apple working with both &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/17/lg-apple-foldable-displays/"&gt;LG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/10/apple-orders-samsung-foldable-display-samples/"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryn334"&gt;While the rumors of a prototype and this report from Kuo indicate that Apple is indeed working on a folding phone, it’s not something to wait around for just yet. Kuo’s 2023 launch date is dependent on Apple being able to figure out “key technology and mass production issues.” As we’ve seen, folding phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price"&gt;can be hard to get right&lt;/a&gt;. If Apple can do it, though, it could be in the position to do what it does best: adopt a technology after other companies have figured out the bugs and pitfalls, and release a product that seems polished in comparison. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon shaves app icon mustache that raised eyebrows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EgKDOwPWLnwRqGYUTGFm0-yAW4g=/34x0:2550x1677/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68893611/iconcs.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old (left) and updated (right) versions of Amazon’s new app icon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NmOe0l"&gt;Amazon has quietly rolled out a slight update to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249675/amazon-new-ios-app-logo-color"&gt;its new app icon&lt;/a&gt; that it debuted back in January, which alters the colorful strip of tape on the icon that bore an unfortunate resemblance to a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush_moustache"&gt;toothbrush-style mustache&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h230ED"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;lmao I completely missed that amazon quietly tweaked its new icon to make it look… less like hitler &lt;a href="https://t.co/Jh8UC8Yg3u"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Jh8UC8Yg3u&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— alex hern (@alexhern) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexhern/status/1366396140116131842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="85uw2H"&gt;The toothbrush mustache was originally popularized by comedians like Charlie Chaplin in the early 1900s before it was forever associated with Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpmloE"&gt;Amazon made some changes to the icon following customer feedback from its initial rollout before it rolled out the final design worldwide. An Amazon spokesperson commented that “Amazon is always exploring new ways to delight our customers. We designed the new icon to spark anticipation, excitement, and joy when customers start their shopping journey on their phone, just as they do when they see our boxes on their door step.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Se8Nr7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10368265"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kTsolt"&gt;It’s a change that makes sense. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18112516/amazon-holiday-commercial-captain-america-winter-soldier-twitter-christmas"&gt;Amazon’s ads&lt;/a&gt; have portrayed the swooping A-to-Z arrow that adorns its packaging as singing mouths, and in that light, the ragged edge and width of the blue tape on the previous icon design looks uncomfortably similar to the tonsorial trim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeOzAi"&gt;The updated icon looks to avoid the issue entirely, swapping out the mustache-style adhesive for a two-toned folded piece of tape that alludes to the (presumed) joy of tearing open an Amazon package instead of one of the most brutal dictators in modern history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uqfatg"&gt;Amazon’s design team can take some consolation, though, in joining the storied annals of modern companies that have been forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/16021794/superman-mustache-justice-league-extended-reshoots-henry-cavill-warner-bros"&gt;digitally shave controversial mustaches&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, the new icon is already getting much more favorable comparisons: apparently, the angular tape now makes it look like &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/em&gt;’s Aang instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HcAMDj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;i know the new amazon app icon is supposed to represent their packages but every time i see it i just see Aang from Avatar smiling at me lololol &lt;a href="https://t.co/kIPwneHr2p"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kIPwneHr2p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— flipboitamidles (DAMN%) (@flipboitamidles) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/flipboitamidles/status/1365353610939273220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kqP1h0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 1st, 4:18pm: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Amazon comment on the updated app icon logo. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>San Diego Comic-Con, E3, and Anime Expo cancel geek gatherings for the second year in a row</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nGqeAOe2wA9Nu4_RJp2WNVBJTfc=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68893583/sdcc_stock31_1020.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H4J9Zo"&gt;San Diego Comic-Con &lt;a href="https://www.comic-con.org/cci"&gt;has just announced&lt;/a&gt; this year’s show will not go on, at least not in person. For the second time in 50 years — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225299/san-diego-comic-con-canceled-dates-july-2021-refunds"&gt;the first was last year&lt;/a&gt; — Comic-Con has been canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There’ll still be a virtual event from July 23rd to the 25th, and organizers are planning a three-day in-person convention tentatively set for November, but they’re clear that the full shebang has been postponed until 2022 — and offering refunds and rollovers as appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uQNN3a"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/YftNZhDuk5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YftNZhDuk5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— San Diego Comic-Con (@Comic_Con) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Comic_Con/status/1366478468091965440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B7jJid"&gt;And it’s not the only big California geek gathering that’s not going to happen: the Los Angeles Department of Convention and Tourism &lt;a href="https://ens.lacity.org/lacc/laccdcagendas/lacclaccdcagendas250148287_03032021.pdf"&gt;has filed documents (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; that show that the biggest US video game and anime shows — E3 and Anime Expo — have also ditched their in-person gatherings (via &lt;a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/e3-2021-as-live-event-cancelled-going-forward-as-digital-working-on-broadcast-options-at-la-live-lacc.385877/#post-59678096"&gt;ResetEra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/e3-2021s-live-show-has-been-cancelled-according-to-la-t-1846373286"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O9X-pFh7WobSNCNfssIvNvlVRyM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22337636/e3_anime_expo.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LODzQy"&gt;E3 typically draws upwards of 60,000 attendees while Anime Expo can attract over 100,000, so they’re big losses for tourism that the city will be discussing later this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4j2KW"&gt;Mind you, the Entertainment Software Association that runs E3 already hinted that it would be “transforming” its showcase, so a virtual event wouldn’t be much of a surprise. Anime Expo held &lt;a href="https://www.anime-expo.org/2020/07/14/anime-expo-lite-livestream-event-draws-500000-views-around-world-celebrate-japanese-pop-culture/"&gt;a successful virtual event last year&lt;/a&gt; that drew 500,000 viewers, and it sounds like organizers will try that again. Neither E3 nor Anime Expo organizers have technically confirmed that their events won’t be happening in-person yet, but the city would know. An ESA spokesperson would only reaffirm that they’re “transforming” E3, and that “we’ll have official details very soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple not switching to USB-C iPhones in the near future, according to Ming-Chi Kuo</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hHAgyX"&gt;The dream of a USB-C iPhone may be dead, according to the latest research note from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The company reportedly has no plans to adopt USB-C on future iPhone devices or integrate a Touch ID sensor into the power button (two technologies that exist on Apple’s iPad hardware, like the 2020 iPad Air).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXXwNe"&gt;The report, &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/01/iphone-not-migrating-to-usb-c-or-getting-touch-id-on-power-button-any-time-soon"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, explains the rationale behind Apple’s decision: “We believe that USB-C is detrimental to the MFi business’s profitability, and its waterproof specification is lower than Lightning and MagSafe,” according to Kuo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="aWjFlS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 might finally bring a smaller notch and faster screens, Ming-Chi Kuo reports","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0XWYYV"&gt;Therefore, instead of a USB-C iPhone, Kuo suggests that Apple may jump straight to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/5/20997166/apple-iphone-no-ports-2021-oled-rumors-2020-se-kuo-research"&gt;long-rumored portless iPhone&lt;/a&gt; that relies exclusively on wireless charging — and specifically, Apple’s MagSafe technology — to charge. MagSafe, in particular, would provide a neat solution to both of the concerns Kuo raises: by eliminating ports, MagSafe would be even more waterproof than even Lightning, and Apple still controls the MagSafe standard through its MFi program, ensuring it’ll be able to continue to reap the rewards of licensing fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KnBM7"&gt;However, Kuo also notes that Apple doesn’t think MagSafe’s ecosystem has reached the point where it can be relied on as the sole charging method for the iPhone. Instead, he predicts that Apple will continue to use its Lightning port “for the foreseeable future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bmjx9A"&gt;Kuo’s report also shoots down another persistent rumor for future iPhones: the idea that Apple might introduce a Touch ID sensor in the power button, similar to the one it offered on last year’s iPad Air refresh. According to Kuo, there’s no timeframe for Apple to add that upgrade either. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-considers-foldable-iphone-minor-changes-planned-for-2021-models"&gt;An earlier report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, however, notes that Apple is testing a Touch ID scanner integrated directly into the display for this year’s iPhone lineup, although whether it actually makes the cut remains to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZx0B2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;The entire report from Kuo&lt;/a&gt; contains far more information on Apple’s future iPhone lineup, including a smaller notch and faster refresh rates for this year’s iPhones, rumors of a hole-punch camera in 2022, and a potential eight-inch foldable iPhone that could launch as early as 2023. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Klobuchar calls on Congress to get serious on tech reform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Neera Tanden Confirmation Hearing To Be OMB Director Before Senate Homeland Committee" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nxyvftuy9rdRclB3wA3yUWHqCss=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68892896/1231062107.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wuAoZk"&gt;Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) plotted out a multi-pronged approach to taking on the power of dominant tech firms like Facebook and Google in a speech for a &lt;em&gt;Verge Live &lt;/em&gt;event Monday. In her remarks, Klobuchar called for the passage of legislation addressing issues from competition to data privacy and content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRdpmu"&gt;“We need to be asking more from Big Tech companies, not less,” Klobuchar said in her speech Monday. “We have seen that how they operate has real life effects on the safety and civil rights for all of us as well as on our democracy.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Holding them accountable for problems that can lead to real-world harm is critical to our success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8wtqt"&gt;Klobuchar leads the Senate’s top antitrust subcommittee, positioning the Minnesota Democrat as one of the most important legislators in the debate over tech reform. Last month, she introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21078903/podcast-house-antitrust-chairman-cicilline-tech-monopoly-vergecast"&gt;a sweeping bill to revamp&lt;/a&gt; US antitrust enforcement. Klobuchar’s Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act would provide law enforcement with more resources to take competition cases to court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9aETFg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our laws shouldn’t remain stagnant as they were 25 years ago”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3mQFVJ"&gt;“Our laws shouldn’t remain stagnant as they were 25 years ago,” Klobuchar said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="om6kiW"&gt;Klobuchar stopped short of saying that companies like Facebook and Google should be broken up, although she did describe the antitrust action against Bell as broadly successful. Still, it’s unclear how aggressively congressional Democrats will push for antitrust action as part of the broader effort to regulate tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxbNJA"&gt;“Do we want better safeguards on tech platforms? Yes. Increased transparency? Yes. Nondiscrimination rules? Yes,” Klobuchar said Monday. “I would say much of this we can do with rules of the road we put in place through legislation which until now and this year wasn’t even seriously being considered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKdf6W"&gt;Last week, top antitrust lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee met for a hearing on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301453/antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-reform-cicilline-buck"&gt;proposals to reform US antitrust law&lt;/a&gt; as it’s applied to tech companies. Outside of requiring tech firms to make their platforms interoperable, some House Democrats are considering a Glass-Steagall for the internet. A measure like that would prohibit tech companies from running a platform while developing their own products or other services. Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), the top Republican on the subcommittee, has come out against the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bE1Yhp"&gt;In the Monday speech, Klobuchar also touted bills that she introduced in previous years, including measures aimed at protecting user data privacy. In 2018, Klobuchar put out the Social Media Privacy and Consumer Rights Act that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18041882/congress-data-privacy-google-facebook-gdpr-markey-klobuchar"&gt;would force big tech companies&lt;/a&gt; to notify users of security breaches within 72 hours. It would also define information like emails, phone numbers, and health data as “sensitive” information, imposing harsher penalties if the data is breached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13eChF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple has reopened all of its US retail stores for the first time in nearly a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SHOPPING-ELECTRONICS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LoYFHbCa90XAyR7dKdfw8YLebB0=/0x0:3202x2135/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68892868/1230283678.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by DANIEL SLIM/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iCSRB7"&gt;Every Apple Store location in the US has reopened as of today, roughly two weeks prior to the anniversary of the first store closures due to the coronavirus pandemic that began on March 13th, 2020. The news, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/01/apple-retail-stores-us-all-reopened/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this morning, coincides with the last of Apple’s Texas retail stores reopening on Monday. Apple also confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that all 270 US Apple Store locations are now open in some capacity for either in-store shopping or online order pickup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QP4Gd"&gt;This, of course, has no direct correlation with the rate of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US; Apple, in many cases, follows local health guidelines and has preemptively closed its retail stores in some instances. But it does signal that Apple feels confident in its restrictions on in-store shopping at certain locations and the safety measures it has put in place, which include mandated face masks and limited occupancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bjj7Yt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple first began closing its retail stores outside China on March 13th, 2020&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0PhKUN"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook announced nearly a year ago that the company would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/14/21179542/apple-closing-retail-stores-march-27-coronavirus"&gt;close all of its retail locations outside of mainland China&lt;/a&gt; until the end of the month. At the time, Apple had been developing its COVID-19 mitigation strategy for its China network of stores, which had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/1/21117941/coronavirus-apple-china-close-stores-offices-outbreak"&gt;first started closing on February 1st&lt;/a&gt; prior to the coronavirus’ widespread outbreak in the US. On March 17th, Apple said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183792/apple-retail-stores-closed-coronavirus-indefinitely-iphone-locations"&gt;keep all retail stores outside China closed indefinitely&lt;/a&gt; as COVID-19 cases skyrocketed around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLWtUW"&gt;What followed in the months after involved a complex mix of store openings and closures as Apple adhered to local and state health guidelines and also prioritized the safety of its own retail employees. In some cases, stores were opened in limited capacity only to close again later on, while others stayed shut for extended periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7LWYf"&gt;Apple began enacting its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/8/21252400/apple-us-stores-reopening-date-location"&gt;official reopening strategy in the US in early May&lt;/a&gt; and that carried on for months through the summer into the fall. Yet Apple has shown a willingness to act fast in responding to changing conditions. In December 2020, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/19/22190895/apple-close-retails-stores-covid-19-london-california-pandemic"&gt;shuttered every store in California and London&lt;/a&gt; as case numbers surged through the holidays. Early last month, Apple temporally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22214203/apple-close-remaining-uk-apple-store-covid-19-lockdown"&gt;closed every store in the UK&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ie7Nz0"&gt;For a fascinating pair of infographics detailing the rate of Apple Store closures in the US from last March to today, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/01/apple-retail-stores-us-all-reopened/"&gt;check out &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;’s story here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gatorade’s new Gx Sweat Patch tests your sweat for smarter hydration</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G8ZEFglTqfvmiBV77b3KC-NDWXw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68892781/580166.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Gatorade&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lBfoDe"&gt;Gatorade is today releasing &lt;a href="https://gatorade.newsmarket.com/news-announcements/gatorade-launches-first-to-market-sweat-patch-and-app/s/b59942aa-f98b-4122-a3e6-632ccb362a96"&gt;a new fitness wearable&lt;/a&gt; that tests your sweat to let you know how and when to best rehydrate after working out. The Gx Sweat Patch is sold in packages of two for $25 and pairs with Gatorade’s Gx app to let you efficiently hydrate and hopefully recover faster and avoid cramps in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELRdDp"&gt;The sweat patch is applied to your left inner arm before a workout and slurps up sweat as you move, funneling the fluid through a color-changing channel on the patch. After you’re done working out, you use the Gx App to scan the patch. Gatorade says it’s able to offer insights on how much body fluid was lost and how much sodium needs to be replenished (presumably with Gatorade) to recover efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v-J_gb2Ptu_QL1PdeiBnGBRSvu0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336990/Scanning_in_the_gatorade_app.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gatorade&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gx app scans the sweat patch to generate a “sweat profile”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qFd2Wk"&gt;The Gx app also attaches these hydration insights to specific workouts, so you should theoretically have a recommendation of how much to drink before, during, and after every 10-mile run you do, if you’ve created a sweat profile for it in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTY0pH"&gt;Even with all of the polished Gatorade branding, $25 for a package of two patches puts the individual price around $12.50, which seems high considering a patch can only be used once. Gatorade imagines using a patch for each of the workout types that someone does, so if you only play basketball and run, maybe a single $25 purchase is enough. But Gatorade also recommends creating a new sweat profile for each climate or temperature you work out in. So the more ways and places you exercise, the more you may need to spend to accurately hydrate and recover efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OmrbZVhKBP80-K0gwUCz7J6k_Es=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336995/Screen_Shot_2021_03_01_at_9.39.52_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gatorade&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gx Sweat Patch has a color-changing channel that it funnels sweat through.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jPbtTZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gatorade.com/gx/sweatpatch"&gt;The Gx Sweat Patch&lt;/a&gt; may seem a little unusual, but for a world increasingly comfortable with all sorts of biometric fitness tracking, it seems like a logical next step for a serious athlete. It’s a way for Gatorade to sell more Gatorade, but depending on the person, the possible annoying upsell of future Gatorade products might be worth the extra knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15ySGH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Minneapolis will no longer use influencers to cover first George Floyd murder trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Americans Watch Joe Biden Being Sworn In As 46th President Of The U.S." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qIVPFnGjS4aSID9J4CnWgKDFH8Y=/0x83:7727x5234/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68892740/1297490705.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yknj3M"&gt;The Minneapolis City Council has walked back a plan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/28/22306203/minneapolis-social-media-influencers-george-floyd-derek-chauvin-police"&gt;approved last week&lt;/a&gt; that would have paid influencers to share city-approved messages during the upcoming trial of ex-police officer Derek Chauvin, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dp85q/george-floyd-derek-chauvin-trial-minneapolis-influencers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. He’s one of four former Minneapolis cops charged in the May 2020 death of George Floyd, which sparked protests across the country last summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d0JiiN"&gt;The Minneapolis &lt;a href="https://lims.minneapolismn.gov/RCA/7568"&gt;City Council approved the plan&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, which called for six influencers to be paid about $2,000 each to spread the city’s messages with Black, Native American, Hmong, and Latino communities. The goal was to “address/dispel incorrect information” by using “trusted messengers,” part of a program the city refers to as its Joint Information System to share “timely and relevant information” with the public during the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXc843"&gt;However, during a city council meeting on Monday, the director of the city’s Neighborhood and Community Relations Department, David Rubedor, apologized for the influencer plan, saying the term caused confusion in the community, &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reported. Rubedor said the city was “not trying to change public opinion about any particular message,” but rather seeking to get information out “quickly and in an equitable way” during Chauvin’s trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDbzsa"&gt;Floyd died in police custody last May after former officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on Floyd’s neck while he lay on the ground in handcuffs. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-news-health-trials-coronavirus-pandemic-minneapolis-075d9b5f4a2a1f80d26cb33b77ca59b5"&gt;Chauvin faces second-degree murder&lt;/a&gt; and manslaughter charges. Jury selection for his trial will begin on March 8th. The other three ex-officers involved in the incident are due to go on trial in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTdQyH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
