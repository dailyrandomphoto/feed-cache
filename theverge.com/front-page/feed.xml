    <title>Sex ed info on TikTok shows gaps in traditional education</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CCoHwO"&gt;Teens and adolescents might be turning to TikTok to learn about sex when their typical sex education isn’t sufficient. But the videos on the platform aren’t screened for misinformation and don’t give teens ways to ask additional questions, notes &lt;a href="https://mcusercontent.com/c20b80e633c1998112f620cfb/files/0017dc64-cb7d-8c68-8eb8-690168d497a1/Fowlerarticle.pdf"&gt;a new analysis.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69Fh8R"&gt;Sex education offered in schools in the United States is usually inadequate — most states don’t require kids to be taught about topics like contraception, consent, and gender diversity. Information about sex, though, is spreading on TikTok, which has millions of adolescent and teen users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ashtJu"&gt;To evaluate the sex education information on TikTok, one author of a new study created an account as a 15-year-old, downloaded 100 videos under the #sexeducation and #healthclass hashtags, and categorized them. Over half either focused on male and female anatomy or on sexual pleasure, with most focusing on female anatomy and female sexual pleasure. Thirteen percent talked about contraception, and only five of the sample covered other aspects of sexual health — like safe sex, consent, and how to navigate health care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7RTtQ"&gt;The volume of content on female sexual anatomy and pleasure on TikTok shows one area traditional sex education isn’t effective, the study authors note in their analysis. If teens are looking to TikTok for information on those topics, it might mean they’re not getting it elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1EKBW"&gt;Having a place to privately see information that might answer questions about sex could be helpful. However, adolescents looking through those videos don’t have a clear or easy way to get additional information if they have more questions, the authors said. They also may not have an easy or clear way to determine if a video includes misinformation. Some health care professionals make videos and answer questions on TikTok, but there are so many videos that it’s difficult to keep up with them all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jrs28X"&gt;“The ever-growing quantity of content available on TikTok makes responding to all misinformation impractical, and there is no guarantee a user will ever encounter these corrective videos,” the authors wrote. &lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/bmjgh/6/11/e007648.full.pdf"&gt;Other studies show&lt;/a&gt; that bad information about other areas of health, like COVID-19 and prostate cancer, has spread on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="271LL6"&gt;Considering the size of the platform — TikTok recently eclipsed &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/1-billion-people-on-tiktok"&gt;a billion monthly users&lt;/a&gt; worldwide &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;experts should conduct more research evaluating the accuracy of sex education information presented on it, the study concluded. That recommendation is in line with a recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808011/tiktok-health-impact-research-plan"&gt;proposed research agenda for TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, which included a call for researchers to study the medical advice given on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eI4K97"&gt;In the meantime, doctors should ask patients about their social media use and could use that as a jumping-off point to answer questions or clear up any misinformation. “Providers have a critical role to play in anticipating common myths and misunderstandings and providing correct information about sexual health topics,” the authors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>8 great TikTok accounts from 2021 to follow </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BJyyxXPHaEPqh0SSftlQVXOq8Ss=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70313734/RoundUpArt_TikTok.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Put these great creators into your algorithm&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="rfKrRj"&gt;Maybe you’re new to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22585248/tiktok-guide-creators-video-how-to"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, or perhaps you’ve been on the app for a couple of years and would like to find some new accounts to follow. While the algorithm does a shockingly great job of surfacing videos a user might like, it’s easy to get stuck in a bubble of repetitive content, so you’re seeing the same creators again and again or hearing one trending sound just a little too often. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2AS5U"&gt;I spend a lot of my downtime perusing TikTok, and I take pride in the list of accounts I follow. So much pride that I’ve got a sizable list of all the creators I’d recommend following. They range from creators who dole out advice to a forager and even to a heavy metal vocalist. If you’re just starting out on TikTok, these accounts are a great place to start. If you’ve been using it for a while, then unless we have the same algorithm, these accounts will be a good way to freshen up the videos you normally see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ea5YNl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@oldtimehawkey?"&gt;Oldtimehawkey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="PqFPoU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@oldtimehawkey/video/7035066592278973702" data-video-id="7035066592278973702" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@oldtimehawkey" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@oldtimehawkey"&gt;@oldtimehawkey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;hot turkey sandwich   &lt;a title="comfort" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/comfort"&gt;#comfort&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ Ylang Ylang - FKJ &amp;amp; ((( O )))" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Ylang-Ylang-6757899185262987266"&gt;♬ Ylang Ylang - FKJ &amp;amp; ((( O )))&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QzuwDZ"&gt;It never fails — when I’m feeling particularly emotional or stressed, oldtimehawkey pops on my For You page with his friendly catchphrase, “Well, hello there, buddy!” This creator’s videos are so calming, invoking a sense of serenity through the screen. The creator takes his followers through the marsh he lives in, alongside his dog. In most videos, he’ll cook himself and the viewer up a little something, split a couple of cold pops, and finally, he’ll have us sit down with him as he watches old VHS tapes or plays vintage Nintendo games. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bnrI8v"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mercurystardust?"&gt;Mercurystardust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="uzGYmB"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XzXpkm"&gt;Mercury is one of the first creators I followed on TikTok out of sheer desperation after a few phone calls to my apartment’s maintenance team for embarrassingly easy fixes. She goes by Trans Handy Ma’am, and she doles out repair advice, life advice, and frequent hilarious anecdotes. Her videos have helped me on so many occasions that I actually keep some saved in my phone to send to friends in case they ever need repair advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TStwHn"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rHktav"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theplantprodigy?"&gt;Theplantprodigy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="bGjaKd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@theplantprodigy/video/7036437916113063173" data-video-id="7036437916113063173" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@theplantprodigy" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theplantprodigy"&gt;@theplantprodigy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did you impulse buy a &lt;a title="poinsettia" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/poinsettia"&gt;#poinsettia&lt;/a&gt; this holiday season? &lt;a title="plants" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/plants"&gt;#plants&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="planttiktok" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/planttiktok"&gt;#planttiktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp"&gt;#fyp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ Deck the Halls (Christmas Instrumental) - Robbins Island Music Group" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Deck-the-Halls-Christmas-Instrumental-6875191769038850050"&gt;♬ Deck the Halls (Christmas Instrumental) - Robbins Island Music Group&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0chvXA"&gt;Jacob Soule, better known as theplantprodigy on TikTok, is my go-to for advice on how to keep my plants alive. He offers helpful, often sassy explainers on different plant types and how to take care of them. Additionally, he debunks a lot of viral plant “hacks” and tips, which saves me a lot of time. Admittedly, even after having followed him for nearly a year now, I still have managed to kill many of my house plants, but that’s totally on me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="WrphWU"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NqxnU4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@alexisnikole?"&gt;Alexisnicole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="CjQG6j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@alexisnikole/video/7030930889265696006" data-video-id="7030930889265696006" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@alexisnikole" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@alexisnikole"&gt;@alexisnikole&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;  ‍♀️ ❄️ &lt;a title="foraging" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foraging"&gt;#foraging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="wildfood" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/wildfood"&gt;#wildfood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="PlutoTVDecades" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/PlutoTVDecades"&gt;#PlutoTVDecades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Alexis Nikole" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7030930756986030854"&gt;♬ original sound - Alexis Nikole&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PSCZOY"&gt;In a bout of misguided assumptions, I assumed the only plants that were edible were already sold in grocery stores. Come to find out from Alexisnicole, a vegan forager on TikTok, there is an abundance of delicious plants right outside my door. Alexis wanders around identifying and cooking up all types of different weeds, nuts, roots, and more. Not only are her videos extremely educational, but her excited way of sharing stories and telling the viewer how to get the most of something is incredibly contagious. I’m fortunate enough to be located in the same city as Alexis, so I use her videos as guides for what I can and cannot eat. So far, using her recipes, I’ve had great success putting hairy bittercress, purple deadnettles, lilac petals, and dandelions to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="stTi8N"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@annrussell03?"&gt;Annrussel03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="bjaSxb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@annrussell03/video/7037521780155665670" data-video-id="7037521780155665670" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@annrussell03" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@annrussell03"&gt;@annrussell03&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reply to @spud_u_like&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Ann Russell She/Her" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7037521759297391366"&gt;♬ original sound - Ann Russell She/Her&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="exvKqo"&gt;Don’t let Annrussel03’s nonjudgmental home and life advice deceive you. She won’t put up with any nonsense, and she’s not afraid to call commentators out for crossing lines. That being said, Ann gives wonderful tips on how to care for oneself and one’s home. I’ve kept her cleaning advice tucked in the back of my mind and have found it useful when I’ve got a particularly nasty mess to clean up. There are a lot of creators that try to do what Ann does, but no one delivers their tips in such an understanding yet commanding way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rYZcNl"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tzDVxB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@teepasnow?"&gt;teepasnow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="XpN3Se"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@teepasnow/video/7033091696934227246" data-video-id="7033091696934227246" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@teepasnow" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@teepasnow"&gt;@teepasnow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;ComforTek Chairs are preferred by all of us!&lt;a title="comfortek" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/comfortek"&gt;#comfortek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="teepasnow" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/teepasnow"&gt;#teepasnow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="chair" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/chair"&gt;#chair&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="dementia" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/dementia"&gt;#dementia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="ot" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/ot"&gt;#ot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="pt" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/pt"&gt;#pt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="rn" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/rn"&gt;#rn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="cna" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cna"&gt;#cna&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="mobility" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/mobility"&gt;#mobility&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="assist" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/assist"&gt;#assist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="snowapproach" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/snowapproach"&gt;#snowapproach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - teepasnow" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7033091557821713198"&gt;♬ original sound - teepasnow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BcuZ8F"&gt;Dementia and Alzheimers run in my family, although I don’t currently know anyone who has it. These diseases alter a person’s memory, often making it easy for them to forget who their loved ones are or even where they’re located in the moment and why. I wish I would have had a source like this when my family members living with dementia were around. Teepa Snow is a wonderful educator, teaching viewers how to interact with people who have these diseases in a way that still respects that person and calms them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a2OwBE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hippiearab?"&gt;Hippiearab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="3pLhPT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@hippiearab/video/7032649246947953921" data-video-id="7032649246947953921" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@hippiearab" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hippiearab"&gt;@hippiearab&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - farah" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7032649194695363329"&gt;♬ original sound - farah&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q8iApx"&gt;Farah, known by the handle hippiearab, has a gift for witty and engaging storytelling. She’s one of the more recent accounts I’ve come across, and she was an instant follow for me. Her tales alone are rife with comedic value, but it’s really her perfectly timed pauses and witty asides that have me laughing out loud. One of her most successful videos (with 6.1 million views) is about a new chair that is both well designed and easily mistaken for a person at night. It is a perfect example of how she can turn a mundane topic into a hilarious story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n5sxzd"&gt;I spent my high school days as a Scene kid going to heavy metal shows on the weekend. I loved the music, clothes, and community that came with these types of shows. However, it was a very male-dominated culture — I only ever knew of a handful of hardcore bands that had female vocalists. Jumping forward to the future, I found scenequeenrocks. Scene Queen has coined the term “bimbocore” and is bringing highly feminine aesthetics to heavy metal. She’s very tongue-in-cheek and unapologetic about taking up space within the heavy metal world. Her music goes hard, has a great message, and ultimately creates some diversity in a space where it’s needed. Rock on, Scene Queen, rock on. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The gadgets we broke</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vKj05xLsTWxfSuBmqxQ9WBgfPzw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70313731/acastro_211205_4931_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The Verge has smashed a bunch of phones... and other things&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="LIPDsv"&gt;This holiday season, let’s talk about the gadgets that are no longer with us anymore — not because they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727322/worst-gadgets-reviews-verge-first-decade"&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt; or became obsolete or were the victims of an upgrade offer too good to refuse, but because they met their demise in a delightfully destructive way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SpvCll"&gt;We broke these gadgets without meaning to. (Probably. Helen is sus.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lv952B"&gt;This started out as a fun conversation in &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; private Slack, and now we’re bringing a more polished version to you. Also, feel free to share your own tales in the comments below this story!&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Wgfvbu"&gt;Canon EOS Rebel T5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="41LINs"&gt;I have a sassy cat named Pablo. As a very large boy, he’s quite particular about when he gets fed. Actually, sometimes he yowls at 4AM because he doesn’t like eating alone, making us sit with him as he chows down on kibble. A few months ago, our vet told us Pablo is “too young to be this fat,” and so, like a fool, I tried to put him on a diet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsjcOM"&gt;In retaliation, Pablo began a crusade of knocking things off high places. Several house plants were harmed, the dirt from their pots spilling like blood on our floor. We lost some good mugs. But the thing that hurt most was my camera, which I used to take product shots for my job. You know, the thing that helps me pay for Pablo’s food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bosxVE"&gt;That day, Pablo was hangry about his new diet. I told him to wait. I was shooting a smartwatch and needed a bathroom break. He was displeased. I naively left it on a counter, thinking my lazy cat wouldn’t leap up just to spite me. But he did. I heard the crash from the bathroom, and when I came out, he was sitting there, smug, probably playing Taylor Swift’s “Look What You Made Me Do” in his little cat brain. Below was my camera, destroyed. I now feed him when he wants. &lt;em&gt;—Victoria Song&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pablo eats when he wants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kdMPOp"&gt;iPhone 5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sR3x91"&gt;Until 2014, I would have gladly and smugly told anyone I have never broken a phone. Then I broke the same phone &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt;. I don’t remember how I first broke my iPhone 5. I think I dropped it at work. I vaguely remember people wincing and me trying to play off the shattering like it was no big deal (it was a very big deal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29AXLi"&gt;I finally got the money together to repair the phone — just in time for my mom to visit. The second day of her visit, we went to Ikea to look at furniture I could not really afford to buy. My mom kept saying I looked tired and frazzled. As we left the store, I took my phone out of my pocket and then... it just flew. Somehow, my dumb ass was too tired to actually hold onto the pricey device I’d just pulled from my pocket. The phone soared through the air and proceeded to land on the pavement, the crunch so audible a family walking by reflexively winced and looked on with sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CsNRD"&gt;My phone was busted less than 12 hours after I had just had it repaired. My mom patted me on the shoulder and said I needed a nap.  &lt;em&gt;—Alex Cranz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our original HTC Vive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jKdhGr"&gt;HTC Vive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WaA4l4"&gt;I lent &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s original HTC Vive headset to the Panorama music festival in the summer of 2016, back when virtual reality systems had months-long waiting lists. This is how I learned that VR screens get sunspots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vhOBn"&gt;And I didn’t even get to see The Arcade Fire. —&lt;em&gt;Adi Robertson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Vn5v1F"&gt;Handspring Visor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vytGPr"&gt;I still have a working &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711230/springboard-handspring-documentary-secret-history-first-real-smartphone"&gt;Handspring Visor&lt;/a&gt;, and one regret — other than my inability to obtain the cellular modem backpack add-on — is that it isn’t the original device. Mine was replaced at an Ohio Best Buy thanks to the company’s perhaps overly generous early 2000s extended warranty plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Handspring Visor, still going strong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9entK"&gt;Why did I need another Handspring Visor? The PalmOS-powered devices were incredibly durable, as evidenced by the fact that mine is still running 20 years later. However, my original device couldn’t survive being in my back pocket when I got body slammed into a table on a Saturday night. The exact details around the incident are hazy, and anyone who has ever visited Court St. in Athens can understand why. —&lt;em&gt;Richard Lawler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VPAizP"&gt;Logitech Bluetooth Multi-Device Keyboard K480&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lMIkCd"&gt;To say I’m terrified of spiders would be an understatement. I once literally spent an entire night standing outside in the cold in my pajamas in an unsafe neighborhood because I found one on my pillow. I am not really certain why my brain registered a spider as more of a threat to my life than potential murderers lurking around, but there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RVyeY"&gt;So, naturally, all rationality flew out the window when one day, a spider decided to crawl on my hands as I typed on my Logitech keyboard. I wailed like a banshee and threw my keyboard at the wall, then ran out of my room. When I eventually summoned the strength to walk back into my room one day later, I then not only sprayed everything — including my keyboard — with Raid, I also added some WD-40, hair spray, and perfume to cover the other awful scents. My keyboard, naturally, died, and it was all for nothing, really. I later found the spider near my bed and stopped sleeping in my room for nearly a month after that. &lt;em&gt;—Sheena Vasani&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9IxSwo"&gt;MacBook (2007)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6GxdRe"&gt;In the winter of 2010/2011, my MacBook’s hard drive died for the second time in less than four years. And with the laptop no longer under warranty, it made the most sense for me to replace the drive myself. A friend who lived down the street happened to have the fancy screwdriver needed to remove the drive’s housing. So one night, after I got the new drive in the mail, I put on a coat, grabbed my laptop, and walked a block through the snowy streets of Pittsburgh to get to his house around the corner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8QCeB"&gt;The fix was easy: remove the battery, unscrew the housing, swap the new unit in, and put everything back in place. Soon enough, I was walking the block back home with a fixed laptop in hand. I remember crossing the street and hopping up onto the curb about halfway between our houses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCP0zB"&gt;It was while falling sideways that I realized I had landed directly on a patch of black ice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="237Vxm"&gt;The laptop landed on its back right corner, exploding the plastic open, a thick silver bar of metal now jutting out between its body and screen. The screen hung off the body at an odd angle, attached only at the left and center portions of the hinge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDzir7"&gt;Somehow, it still worked. It felt like the laptop could have broken in two every time I opened it. But it managed to survive my final semester of college. When Apple finally refreshed the MacBook Air that July, I bought one the very first day. &lt;em&gt;—Jacob Kastrenakes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fuoMOE"&gt;Work-issued Blackberry, circa 2012&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="q6HkyH"&gt;When I started writing about consumer technology, the world was new, iPhones were still on the rise, and companies still issued Blackberry phones to their employees. I worked for such a company, so for a while in my 20s, I lived a two-phone lifestyle, carrying around my personal flip phone to text my friends and my work phone for work email. And you know, things my flip phone couldn’t do, like checking Facebook and Googling stuff. All very work-related, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7JSJV"&gt;As an aside, you haven’t really lived until you’ve sobbed openly at the McCarran baggage claim, typing out apology emails on your phone’s physical QWERTY keyboard for accidentally breaking an embargo. That’s another story, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ksfMA"&gt;Anyway, like I said, I was in my early 20s, and as such, I had a lot of &lt;em&gt;feelings.&lt;/em&gt; I could also leave home after 8PM on a weeknight, get drunk at the neighborhood karaoke night, and somehow function just fine at work the next morning. I came home from such a night feeling particularly emotional about something I don’t remember at all now. But at the time, it was &lt;em&gt;very upsetting&lt;/em&gt;, and it felt necessary to take off my coat and &lt;em&gt;throw it dramatically on the floor&lt;/em&gt;. My Blackberry was in the pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Ce4o9"&gt;This would have been fine if I’d lived somewhere with carpeting. I did not; in fact, I lived in a former can factory converted into apartments with cement floors. My coat hit the floor just right, and I went from being just sad and drunk to being sad and drunk with a broken phone. I told work that my Blackberry “broke,” and if I remember correctly, they just sent me a new one without asking any questions. I learned nothing from this experience. &lt;em&gt;–Allison Johnson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4Vef47"&gt;Pixel 3, 3a, and 3a XL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WkizjT"&gt;I never needed a case for my phone. The early bombproof plastic phones simply &lt;em&gt;wouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; break, and I kept a firm enough grip on modern glass handsets that I rarely worried about it. But the family and I went for a beautiful island vacation in Maui, and I decided to try slapping a case on my new Pixel 3. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Was my rainbow pic worth it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7rlWt9"&gt;As Google’s first IP68-rated phone, I knew I could take it with me into the crystal-clear Lahaina waters, and I was glad when I turned around to see this gorgeous rainbow overhead, dipping nearly all the way to shore. But after I waded back to land and started walking to the car, I realized my phone’s case was probably hurting more than it was helping, trapping water against the phone instead of drying out. I yanked it out... and fumbled. &lt;em&gt;SMACK &lt;/em&gt;— my phone hit the pavement screen-side down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXWnF0"&gt;Yep, my most protected phone yet, the one I was most concerned about protecting, was the one that broke. At least I didn’t pay full price — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2018/11/21/18107357/google-pixel-3-xl-black-friday-verizon-best-buy-sale-deal"&gt;I got it half-off&lt;/a&gt;. —&lt;em&gt;Sean Hollister&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="snkFMX"&gt;
&lt;p id="vkPQ8Y"&gt;I’ve got another Pixel 3 breakage story, I’m afraid. I happily used one as my personal phone for 22 months before it died on me after a particularly lengthy smartphone briefing. Although I can’t say for sure, I’m almost certain it overheated thanks to running &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20996972/google-recorder-app-transcription-audio-available-pixel-2-3-3a-4"&gt;its useful auto-transcription software&lt;/a&gt; continuously for almost two hours while sitting in a case and wirelessly charging. It wasn’t particularly dramatic, but it was a useful reminder that there are limits to what a smartphone can do before it’ll give up the ghost. —&lt;em&gt;Jon Porter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="T0wc30"&gt;
&lt;p id="J6R343"&gt;I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; broke a Pixel 3 (XL). I ordered it right after launch, around Black Friday. I, too, was the type to keep phones bare or maybe use an adhesive skin to add grip and a pop of color, but the Pixel 3 was around the time phones started getting quite pricey, so I was persuaded by my wife (then, girlfriend) to protect it with a case. I used a thick clear-silicone case to start but later swapped it for one of Google’s fabric cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDQoon"&gt;Fast forward to the summer of 2020: I’m now working from home, I get up from my desk, slide the phone into my back pocket, and WHAM — it drops straight onto my hardwood floor, my partner right beside me — so we both get to witness the ensuing heartbreak. I pick it up to find a nice hairline crack across the full width of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTEQTZ"&gt;I had accidentally dropped my phone plenty of times before, seemingly much worse than this one, but this short drop hit it just right. I tried covering up the crack with one of those glass screen protectors that use a liquid adhesive, but it was never the same. I keep it as a reminder and occasionally to take group selfies with its super-wide front-facing camera. &lt;em&gt;—Antonio G. Di Benedetto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ECLOAf"&gt;
&lt;p id="CEqs6t"&gt;It started innocently enough. My eight-year-old nephew wanted to give me a surprise present, so I tucked my Pixel 3a XL hurriedly under my armpit to look for him. Rather than take an extra second to put on a hoodie with a pocket for my phone, I dismissed my gut instinct with a casual “nah.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuConJ"&gt;When my sweet nephew handed me his favorite stuffed dog and told me to bring it to New York, I lost all common sense. I couldn’t help but receive this adorable present with two outstretched arms. It was at that moment that I heard a loud “clunk” and saw my Purplish 3a XL on the marble floor. I picked my phone up as nonchalantly as I could and shooed him away while I frantically hit the power button and swore under my breath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3EHCo"&gt;It was a fatal drop for my beloved Pixel. Unfortunately, I wasn’t in Canada long enough to get the screen repaired, nor did the cost of a replacement screen ($200) make sense for a budget phone. My US phone was incompatible with my newly activated Canadian SIM card and cellular service. Don’t make the same mistake as me, kids: get a case, always travel with more than one phone, and use a damn pocket. —&lt;em&gt;Gloria Sin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3nid45"&gt;PlayStation (PSX) console&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="aVVrXt"&gt;This is an incidental breakage, not an accidental one. Nevertheless, it was devastating. In the two years after I received the PlayStation as a Christmas gift back in 1999 (sorry, Mom, I saw it in the closet a few months before, though I was still plenty excited), I played &lt;em&gt;so &lt;/em&gt;many video games that the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/psx/comments/a04s7p/one_of_the_little_plastic_pieces_circled_in_red/"&gt;circular CD-ROM holder&lt;/a&gt; in my PlayStation broke. &lt;em&gt;Legend of Dragoon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dino Crisis 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tenchu &lt;/em&gt;1 and 2, &lt;em&gt;Um Jammer Lammy&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Spyro&lt;/em&gt; trilogy in particular all clearly got a little too much playtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3p77tj"&gt;I remember that archaic mechanism fondly. It was circular and housed a few small ball bearings that kept the disc in place. Flipped over, it had an orange rubber band that wedged inside of the plastic, likely to reduce vibrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wwwk3Q"&gt;I super-glued all of the fragile plastic pieces together countless times, as the concept of it being a cheap, easy-to-replace part existed outside of my nine-year-old brain. I really thought I’d have to get an all-new console, bless my heart. But one day, I was playing a game, and it broke apart into several pieces while the console was running. That was the end of my PSX days. &lt;em&gt;—Cameron Faulkner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="g479GY"&gt;iPad first-gen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hLrHa4"&gt;My first iPad was a “baby gift” from my husband to celebrate the birth of our daughter in 2011. In a convoluted way, it was the start of my journey into the smart home (my beat here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;) and the best gift you could give a person who spent six hours of every day glued to a couch feeding a baby. Then, just two years later, whilst navigating the cavernous aisles of Costco with a two-year-old and a five-year-old in tow, I made the mistake of lending it to my son. I desperately needed a distraction for him so I could focus on my shopping list, and he promised he would be good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ldlUM"&gt;Not more than five minutes later, I heard the chill-inducing sound of glass meeting concrete as my iPad landed face down on the warehouse floor. I hadn’t owned an iPad since (and neither has my son) until I finally gifted myself a new iPad Mini just last month. It’s good to be back. —&lt;em&gt;Jennifer Pattison Tuohy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My car, full of water. Please excuse the iPhone 6S’s poor quality, my good camera was taking a swim inside the car.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GnQmS3"&gt;Nikon D500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="P7VR3F"&gt;When Hurricane Hermine hit Tallahassee in 2016, I had parked my car at the top of a hill next to a water drain — to keep it, and all the stuff I had inside of it, safe. Unfortunately, that didn’t pan out, and the back seat ended up flooded with a few inches of swampy water. It was&lt;em&gt; just&lt;/em&gt; enough to submerge the brand new Nikon D500 DSLR I had bought less than two months earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6DzhJ"&gt;Despite the D500 being built like a tank and including “weather sealing,” it understandably didn’t survive the night. I mean, the car didn’t either — apparently, the car’s underseat computer can’t get wet? — but as a film student, I was way more bent out of shape about losing my camera than my transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgbW5D"&gt;Thankfully, Nikon was willing to repair the camera for around $400, which (if I remember correctly) meant replacing pretty much all of the internal components. I’m happy to report that, although I continued to endanger my camera and car by taking pictures in pools and off-roading through ponds, both survived long enough to make their way to new, hopefully more careful owners. &lt;em&gt;—Mitchell Clark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gGoSWb"&gt;Huawei Mate 10 Pro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="tCEbLB"&gt;One of my favorite foods is lobster, and one of my favorite places to find lobster is a place called Abbott’s, a few miles south of Mystic, Conn. You place your order at a window, wait until they call your name, and then carry your tray full of lobster, corn-on-the-cob, and whatever else you ordered to a picnic table out on the lawn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANUm2v"&gt;This particular day, we had just parked after a long drive and started walking toward the restaurant when I took it into my head to make sure I hadn’t left my phone in the car. So I started searching through my backpack. I’d actually put it in an unzipped external pocket in that backpack; as I searched, it slipped out and crashed screen-down onto the ground. And since the ground was made up of loose gravel, the case I had around my phone was of no use whatsoever. When I picked it up, I saw that the top area of my screen was beautifully decorated by a spiderweb of cracks. I did not enjoy my lobster that evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFAjLE"&gt;If you have a phone that is neither an iPhone nor a Samsung, it can be nearly impossible to get the screen replaced. But since the phone still worked fine, I couldn’t justify buying another. So I spent a year using screen protectors to keep that display from getting worse until I finally broke down and bought a replacement. &lt;em&gt;—Barbara Krasnoff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4wvHcn"&gt;Pixel 4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pqZA7P"&gt;I have hated my Pixel 4 since almost the first month I bought it. I should have heeded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;Dieter’s review&lt;/a&gt;, which pointed out the horrible battery life and huge top bezel. Instead, I traded in my beloved Pixel 2 — replacing my fingerprint sensor with face unlock just in time to mask up for a global pandemic. An 8-digit passcode is not fun to repeatedly enter when trying to grocery shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxAHj2"&gt;I have been complaining about my Pixel 4 so much that when I accidentally ran it over with my dad’s car this week, my partner accused me of doing it deliberately. So unjust! The screen is now splinters and random pixels, and I am rid of the Pixel 4 once and for all. At least the SIM card survived. As of today, I am using my dad’s old iPhone 6S until I can buy the iPhone 13 Pro — I do plan to take Dieter’s advice this time. —&lt;em&gt;Helen Havlak&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="R1X7Bp"&gt;Nissan Leaf SL (2015)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="weQBqH"&gt;I think it’s safe to say that electric cars are now just devices that take you places. I made my first jump into driving pure EV with a used base model 2013 Nissan Leaf S. After delving nose-first into the addictive world of combatting range anxiety and getting my wife addicted to skipping gas stations, I decided to trade that in for a fully loaded 2015 Nissan Leaf SL. It came with an app to locate where it’s parked, remote A/C starting features, Bose sound, and premium materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfOsdI"&gt;After only six months of driving this beauty (only a Leaf owner can say that), it met its demise — a vehicle entering my lane from a construction site didn’t yield and stomped on its brakes. I could not brake in time, so it became my fault. Thankfully, I can say my Nissan Leaf leaves behind two loving owners and a properly restrained dog. —&lt;em&gt;Umar Shakir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok sued by former content moderator for allegedly failing to protect her mental health </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZunMDsmuT6ksAYij22zeAE_oJIE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70313676/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tr3ZtK"&gt;A former content moderator for TikTok has filed a lawsuit against the platform, alleging that parent company ByteDance provides inadequate safeguards to protect moderators’ mental health against a near-constant onslaught of traumatic footage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZXNIi"&gt;In a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in the California Central District Court, Candie Frazier says she spent 12 hours a day moderating videos uploaded to TikTok for a third-party contracting firm named Telus International. In that time, Frazier says she witnessed “thousands of acts of extreme and graphic violence,” including mass shootings, child rape, animal mutilation, cannibalism, gang murder, and genocide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="clilvh"&gt;Frazier says that in order to deal with the huge volume of content uploaded to TikTok daily, she and her fellow moderators had to watch between three and ten videos simultaneously, with new videos loaded in at least every 25 seconds. Moderators are only allowed to take one 15 minute break in the first four hours of their shift, and then additional 15 minute breaks every two hours afterwards. The lawsuit says ByteDance monitors performance closely and “heavily punishes any time taken away from watching graphic videos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C1XEAO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TikTok failed to meet industry standards for content moderation, the lawsuit claims&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X5aDJn"&gt;The lawsuit states that TikTok and its partners have failed to meet industry-recognized standards intended to mitigate the harms of content moderation. These include offering moderators more frequent breaks, psychological support, and technical safeguards like blurring or reducing the resolution of videos under review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OieamY"&gt;As a result of her work, Frazier says she has suffered “severe psychological trauma including depression and symptoms associated with anxiety and PTSD.” The lawsuit says Frazier has “trouble sleeping and when she does sleep, she has horrific nightmares. She often lays awake at night trying to go to sleep, replaying videos that she has seen in her mind. She has severe and debilitating panic attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bvspc9"&gt;The testimony in Frazier’s lawsuit fits reports of content moderators working (usually indirectly) for other big tech companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21021005/google-youtube-moderators-ptsd-accenture-violent-disturbing-content-interviews-video"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21021005/google-youtube-moderators-ptsd-accenture-violent-disturbing-content-interviews-video"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. Over the past few years, the terrible working conditions facing these moderators — a labor force that is absolutely crucial in maintaining the profitability of some of the world’s biggest companies — has become increasingly scrutinized. Reports like Frazier’s, though, suggest that despite the extra attention, working conditions for moderators are still incredibly challenging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmqlxP"&gt;Frazeri’s lawsuit was filed by California’s Joseph Saveri Law Firm, which previously filed a similar lawsuit in 2018 against moderators reviewing content for Facebook. That case resulted in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21255870/facebook-content-moderator-settlement-scola-ptsd-mental-health"&gt;$52 million settlement&lt;/a&gt; paid by Facebook to its content moderators. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to ByteDance for comment and will update this story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla update lets drivers turn their cars into megaphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A visitor tests and sits in a Tesla model S at the American..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/acz0uDG6G2N4HQY3R6dJ7zkA1xA=/5x0:4996x3327/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70313477/1237080438.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chukrut Budrul/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xEwSg0"&gt;As part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22847952/tesla-christmas-update-2021-sonic-the-hedgehog-sudoku-blind-spot-cameras"&gt;annual holiday software update&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla has released a new feature that lets drivers turn their cars into megaphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fvmxz"&gt;The update was spotted by &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/24/tesla-megaphones-feature-software-update/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which reports that it’s only available in newer Tesla models (2019 or later). This is because the feature uses external speakers that were installed in recent Tesla vehicles to meet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/16/13651106/electric-car-noise-nhtsa-rule-blind-pedestrian-safety"&gt;US regulations&lt;/a&gt;. These regulations stipulate that otherwise silent electric cars should be able to alert pedestrians to their presence at low speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqgwPS"&gt;A video of the feature (below) captures these external speakers repeating everything the driver says with a slight delay and an echo-y, bass-heavy distortion. It’s not clear if this distortion can be changed or removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uSp9kc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NEW Tesla Megaphone feature. This is crazy! These cars haha… &lt;a href="https://t.co/OB8oI3wwhH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OB8oI3wwhH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Shaw (@ryanshawtech) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ryanshawtech/status/1474213262442958852?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="64RnqM"&gt;It’s not the first creative use Tesla has found for its cars’ external speakers. A Boombox mode introduced in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/25/22199963/tesla-holiday-update-fart-sound-horn-goat-boombox"&gt;last year’s holiday update&lt;/a&gt; let owners replace the default horn sound with any custom audio clip, while Sentry Mode, which lets owners stream live footage from the cars’ external cameras, also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750362/tesla-sentry-mode-live-camera-access-premium-connectivity"&gt;includes a remote audio function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Zqic5"&gt;As well as adding new functionality to its cars, Tesla recently said it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22852283/tesla-nhtsa-in-car-games-driving-passenger-play-arcade"&gt;removing a feature that let drivers play video games while driving&lt;/a&gt;. A megaphone, presumably, is less of a distraction than &lt;em&gt;Super Breakout&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel apologizes to China for following US sanctions targeting Xinjiang ‘genocide’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Intel Booth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7Vb__vPEK7U636fqLUdnZyIyEQ=/0x39:4800x3239/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70313451/1237391676.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2nWJT8"&gt;Intel has issued an apology to partners and customers in China after it told local suppliers it would not be using labor or goods sourced from the country’s Xinjiang region. The company has deleted the statement that resulted in the original backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dstTeJ"&gt;International trade with Xinjiang is &lt;a href="https://www.steptoeinternationalcomplianceblog.com/2021/03/eu-uk-us-and-canada-announce-coordinated-xinjiang-sanctions/"&gt;restricted by numerous governments&lt;/a&gt; including the US over Chinese treatment of the region’s minority Muslim Uyghur population. Earlier this month, the US passed a ban on &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/congress-bans-imports-xinjiang-china-slave-labor-uyghurs/"&gt;imports from Xinjiang&lt;/a&gt; unless companies can prove that goods have been created without the use of forced labor. The US government has described the repression of the minority Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang as a “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/us/politics/trump-china-xinjiang.html"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BjLhxT"&gt;In its annual letter to suppliers, Intel said it was “required” to follow restrictions on Xinjiang trade imposed by “multiple governments” and would “ensure our supply chain does not use any labor or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region.” (That portion of the letter has now been &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/supplier/governance/forms/documents/annual-supplier-letter-english.html"&gt;removed from Intel’s website&lt;/a&gt;, but an archived version can be &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211221095357/https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/central-libraries/us/en/documents/annual-supplier-letter-english.pdf"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ctcllx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chinese media said Intel was “biting the hand that feeds it”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iQ9kLt"&gt;This normally-procedural note caused a backlash in China. The letter went viral on Chinese social media, leading Chinese popstar Karry Wang, a former Intel ambassador, to &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/social-welfare/article/3160811/top-chinese-pop-singer-karry-wang-breaks"&gt;cut ties with the firm&lt;/a&gt; (“National interest exceeds everything,” said Wang on social media), while nationalist outlet &lt;em&gt;Global Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202112/1243084.shtml"&gt;accused Intel&lt;/a&gt; of “biting the hand that feeds it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpillk"&gt;The Chinese market is responsible for a quarter of Intel’s global revenue, or around $20 billion. The company also employs more than 10,000 people in China. A &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; investigation in 2020 found that chips made by Intel were being &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/22/technology/china-intel-nvidia-xinjiang.html"&gt;used to power supercomputers&lt;/a&gt; deployed by the Chinese government for Uyghur surveillance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aR51l1"&gt;In response to this backlash, Intel &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/intel?layerid=4717532018382330"&gt;apologized&lt;/a&gt; on Chinese social media sites on Wednesday. In a letter addressed to the Chinese public and local partners, Intel said it was limiting trade with Xinjiang only as a legal formality and not a political statement. “We apologize for the trouble caused to our respected Chinese customers, partners, and the public,” said the letter. “To clarify, the paragraph about Xinjiang in the letter is only for expressing the original intention of compliance and legality, not for its intention or position.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBSmFs"&gt;Asked to comment on the letter, White House press secretary Jen Psaki &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/josh_wingrove/status/1474073033816088578"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that “American companies should never feel the need to apologize for standing up for fundamental human rights or opposing repression.” Psaki did not comment directly on Intel but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/josh_wingrove/status/1474073189848387584"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: “I can say as a general matter that we believe the private sector and the international community should oppose the PRC’s weaponizing of its markets to stifle support for human rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBgXDU"&gt;Intel’s trouble is the latest example of US tech firms being squeezed on both sides by the demands of the US and Chinese governments. There are numerous examples of US companies complying with intrusive Chinese orders in order to retain business in the country. These vary from the significant, like Apple storing user data on &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-censorship-data.html"&gt;servers run by Chinese state-owned firms&lt;/a&gt;, to the absurd, like Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/amazon-partnered-with-china-propaganda-arm-win-beijings-favor-document-shows-2021-12-17/"&gt;deleting all reviews under five stars&lt;/a&gt; for Chinese president Xi Jinping’s book. Intel’s apology for following US law will not be the last example of these pressures leading to hypocritical behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 organizers insist in-person events will go on even as more exhibitors pull back</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="85CMY4"&gt;The pace of companies announcing they will forego the in-person parts of CES 2022 has only increased in the last 24 hours, with major companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22852045/ces-2022-intel-skipping-show-covid-19"&gt;like Intel&lt;/a&gt; and Google announcing their decisions on Thursday afternoon. Despite a growing list of cancellations that includes exhibitors, advertisers, and most tech media organizations we can name (including The Verge), the Consumer Technology Association that puts on the event says it will push forward with in-person events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EpOynU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"CES 2022 seemingly falling apart: Google and GM join T-Mobile and others in opting-out ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="j2OoTt"&gt;

&lt;p id="uzaCZh"&gt;While many of the companies announcing changes in their plans cited health concerns as well as the unknown implications of the omicron variant of COVID-19, organizers posted a statement from a CEO and MD to justify their decision to push forward. They said: “...we are confident that attendees and exhibitors can have a socially distanced but worthwhile and productive event in Las Vegas, or while experiencing it online.” Precautions previously announced included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628787/ces-2022-covid-19-vaccine-proof-cta"&gt;required proof of vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, masks, and free rapid tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xQWig1"&gt;The list of exhibitors that announced plans to skip the show entirely or limit availability on Thursday alone includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="b8ROnL"&gt;Intel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eAlsZO"&gt;Google&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oNSReC"&gt;Lenovo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8AoHDP"&gt;Hisense (canceled press conference but will have a boot)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sPVo1j"&gt;Waymo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="e6R3VS"&gt;On Wednesday, the CTA &lt;a href="https://www.ces.tech/News/Press-Releases/CES-Press-Release.aspx?NodeID=1caddac3-019a-41c7-b800-dcbfcc96adb8"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that it had received 42 exhibitor cancellations. It’s unclear whether any of these names were part of that count, but today’s announcements remove three of eight companies listed as featured exhibitors on the event’s main page. A list of the most notable companies still lined up for in-person showings includes Samsung, Sony, and LG.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung is launching its first HDR10+ gaming displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PBWI823QYpScBZFgw2Yd7NbWwR4=/78x0:923x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70312673/HDR10_GAMING_Standard_main2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Redout 2 playing on an unnamed HDR10+ gaming display&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9bdLDe"&gt;Samsung has &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-delivers-premium-hdr-gameplay-with-hdr10plus-gaming-standard-support-for-its-new-screens"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its first displays that will support the HDR10+ Gaming standard, an expanded games-focused version of HDR10 that can also calibrate automatically. HDR10+ Gaming was &lt;a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1635416918"&gt;initially announced&lt;/a&gt; in October, but now Samsung reveals that its new 2022 lineup of QLED TVs (Q70 and above) and gaming monitors will be the first to support the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gw60iq"&gt;Samsung partnered with Saber Interactive to bring support for HDR10+ to &lt;em&gt;Redout 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pinball FX&lt;/em&gt;, which will both be showcased at CES 2022 (as long as the game developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;doesn’t drop out&lt;/a&gt;). Also, Game Mechanic Studios will have its HDR10+ gaming title &lt;em&gt;Happy Trails and the Kidnapped Princess&lt;/em&gt; on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdzenB"&gt;The games Samsung is touting are in contrast to major games available on the competing standard: Dolby Vision gaming — including &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;. The Xbox Series X and S &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697993/dolby-vision-xbox-series-x-s-feature-available-now"&gt;already support&lt;/a&gt; at least ten games on Dolby Vision. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qTg6TWrraNWp3ON8HSsOUiIGJJw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122625/image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An unnamed Samsung Odyssey-like curved gaming monitor with the new HDR10+ gaming compatible Pinball FX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lz287z"&gt;HDR10+ Gaming has more visual metadata than regular HDR10 (targets four times its peak brightness), supports variable refresh rate (VRR), and auto low latency mode (ALLM) for better looking and performing game visuals. Samsung also says the standard will work “over 120Hz” but does not go into detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h42Jfp"&gt;The competing standard, Dolby Vision gaming, is already doing all of this (save for the 120Hz plus claim). Also, Samsung’s rival LG &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/6/28/22554939/lg-dolby-vision-hdr-xbox-c1-g1-4k"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its C1 and G1 OLED displays with the Dolby Vision gaming standard in June of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2FvYGb"&gt;The whole experience of HDR10+, much like Dolby Vision, is only executable if the whole setup is vertically integrated to support the format. This means that in order to experience HDR10+ Gaming, your PC will need an Nvidia graphics card (with support coming for GeForce RTX 30 Series, RTX 20 Series, and GTX 16 Series GPUs), a game that is programmed with the extra visual metadata, and one of Samsung’s new displays that can output it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on 4K TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sFSC2h-JZ0-lcBTLwMcFwudM67E=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151213/LG_A1_OLED_Lifestyle_Press_Image.16.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s A1 OLED is now available starting at just $799.99, making it one of the most affordable OLEDs to date.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pYdAAO"&gt;There are a lot of 4K TVs available to choose from, complete with a wide variety of prices and performance. And while we saw some incredible TV deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, fret not, as there are still plenty available for those looking to pick up a TV. Even if your budget is less than $500, you can get a good 4K TV in a bigger size than you might expect. Whether you want a secondary TV for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built for a cinema-like experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals across four common categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2lRkA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: We provide regular updates to this post so be sure to check back periodically for the most up-to-date info on the best deals available. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="E3xT2B"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PBNYtv"&gt;Select a category&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tf9rXR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eeM2RN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vzRoT0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mlO4U5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#O5Vjam"&gt;The best deals for 4K TVs for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1I1ma7"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mszLRr"&gt;A 55-inch TV is a popular size for good reason. It’s not too big, nor is it too small, making it a safe size if you’re looking to upgrade the TV in a living room or bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="etpdeM"&gt;Sony X80J&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cart-6484511"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch X80J TV has Google TV software built-in, so you won’t need to purchase any additional streaming boxes, like an Apple TV or Chromecast. The LED panel also supports HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision HDR, and has four HDMI ports (one of which is HDMI ARC). It’s a relatively low-frills affair, but it seems like a good deal that’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743620079563082108" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $549.99, the TV’s best price to date. In addition to free delivery, the retailer is also offering $50 off a Google Nest Hub smart display with each purchase, a month of Philo for $5, and up to $200 off select soundbars. Walmart is discounting the TV as well, but is only&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1192602/9383?subId1=TheVergeBest4KTVDeals12221&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F482924%2F1192602%2F9383%3FsubId1%3DTheVergeBest4KTVDeals12221%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FSony-55-Class-KD55X80J-4K-Ultra-HD-LED-Smart-Google-TV-with-Dolby-Vision-HDR-X80J-Series-2021-model%252F919937738%26veh%3Daff&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; dropping the price down to $598&lt;/a&gt; (without the added incentives).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEtknI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10610217"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="JbaBai"&gt;TCL 6-Series&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="W4zBa6"&gt;The TCL 6-Series R635 model is a good option if you are looking to balance price and performance. The R635 model sports a QLED panel, but it goes a step above with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363318/tcl-2020-5-6-series-4k-tvs-qled-mini-led-backlighting-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mini LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt;, which brings better brightness and contrast. The 55-inch model is currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-Dolby-Vision-QLED-Smart/dp/B0885F5GMP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggC5UJW2ka" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for around $699.99 ($250 off), though, we’ve seen the R635 drop to as low as $650 in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Osz4r"&gt;If you prefer a larger model, Best Buy is also discounting the 65- and 75-inch variants. The retailer is offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCtSSCCCU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $999.99&lt;/a&gt; ($300 off), while selling the 75-inch for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVnwOsusm3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,299.99&lt;/a&gt; ($500 off). Regardless of which configuration you choose, however, Best Buy will also take $90 off Facebook Portal TV, if you purchase the two together. The retailer is even throwing in a month of Philo for $5 and 30 free days FuboTV Pro when you buy the 75-inch version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y8BpYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327662"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kuUEp8"&gt;Samsung The Frame TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HtcmiY"&gt;Samsung’s The Frame blends into your home decor, displaying customizable images that look like a piece of decorative art if its motion sensor detects someone in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into an HDR-compatible QLED TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and support for AirPlay 2. The stylish, 4K TV also boasts a 120Hz refresh rate, access to all the popular streaming services, and four HDMI ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAIL8Z"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 55-inch drop from $1,500 to $998, its best price ever. Sadly, it’s now only $300 off, with the 55-inch model going for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCWIlxESJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,199.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,197.99&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon. Best Buy is also offering a $150 discount when you buy two, assuming you opt for the 50-inch model or larger. Best Buy is taking $90 off of the Facebook Portal TV with your purchase, too, as well as anywhere between $50 and $300 off on select soundbars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JD5CqS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UmMHNt"&gt;Insignia’s 4K HDR Fire TV Edition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zWYgij"&gt;You don’t have to spend a fortune for a 4K TV; spending $500 or less can still net you a TV with good image quality and features. Insignia’s 4K HDR Fire TV Edition model is the perfect case in point, one that supports HDR10, HDMI ARC, and HDMI eArc, among other notable features. Right now, you can pick up the 55-inch model from &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748188127423432886" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $369.99&lt;/a&gt;, a $180 discount on what is its typical $549.99 price tag. Best Buy will also throw in a third-gen Echo Dot with each purchase and take $90 off of Facebook Portal TV. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is also offering the same discount on the TV&lt;/a&gt;, although note these models are also shipped and sold by Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIOPJT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cW4VPC"&gt;Toshiba Smart Fire TV Edition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="by223n"&gt;Another Fire TV Edition TV deal happening now is on Toshiba’s 50-inch Smart Fire TV Edition 4K LED, which normally retails for $499.99. As the name might imply, it allows you to stream content from services such as Disney Plus and Netflix, and includes the option to watch live TV. The latest models also tout an Alexa-enabled remote, an easy-to-use interface, and support for both Dolby Vision HDR and HDR10. Right now at Amazon, you can pick up the 55-inch model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-55-inch-4K-UHD-Smart-Fire-TV/dp/B0924WG7JD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$359.99&lt;/a&gt;, a $160 discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x443tm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="74eOSC"&gt;TCL Class 4-Series&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="irmzdA"&gt;TCL also has competitively priced televisions, and its 4-Series lineup is one of the more affordable options on the market. The S435 model features a built-in Roku interface, dual-band Wi-Fi, HDR10, and support for all Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. You can currently get the 55-inch model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08GWBBH4R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$379.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $220 less than the usual retail price. Other sizes are on sale, too, like the 43-inch model, which is currently going for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08DHDS4T3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$271.14&lt;/a&gt; instead of $349.99, its best price on Amazon yet. We also recently saw the 50-inch drop to as low as $250, but it’s now only available for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08DHFX4FV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$359.99&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not as steep as a discount, but it still saves you about $140. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HtnMEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740197"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SPPi6g"&gt;Amazon Omni Fire TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gGh4Mn"&gt;Amazon’s first TV, the Omni Fire 4K TV, only just recently launched and starts at $370. The self-branded effort features the ability to query Alexa even when the TV is off, as well as a low input lag and support for two-way video calling. We gave it a 7/10 in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22785648/amazon-fire-tv-omni-review-alexa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, while noting how the TV shows great promise thanks to its robust Alexa integration and support for Apple’s AirPlay 2, among other things. At the same time, however, TCL and other similarly priced television makers offer better picture quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nj1DzI"&gt;Right now, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for $409.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $559.99, which is the same discount we saw during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Both the larger and smaller configurations are on sale as well, with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6J1HG8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch going for $659.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $829.99. Best Buy is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggFNuZaIWh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering comparable sales&lt;/a&gt; on various sizes, while throwing in a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV if you purchase the two together. Note, however, only the larger 65-inch and 75-inch models include support for Dolby Vision HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="robl5C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="JzjnIN"&gt;Vizio M7 Series Premium Quantum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="X4U9P7"&gt;If you’re looking for a budget-friendly TV with good picture quality, Vizio’s midrange M7 Series Quantum TV is worthy of consideration, even if it is over $500. The 2021 model sports a 60Hz panel, along with support for Apple’s AirPlay 2, AMD FreeSync, and a variable refresh rate (VRR). It also touts Vizio’s SmartCast system and a built-in Chromecast, allowing you to cast content from your phone and access Netflix, Disney Plus, and all your favorite streaming services. Right now, both Amazon and Best Buy are offering discounts on various size configurations. You can buy the 55-inch, for example, for $579.99 ($170 off) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggJ132Z3aW" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B094MJRG2V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B094MNFP4D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch version&lt;/a&gt; for $20 cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vIRaAl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10946381"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="9H3H8m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vbJRlM"&gt;OLED televisions offer the best image quality you can get in a mainstream TV, and many were heavily discounted during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. If you missed out on those sales, however, you may still have another shot at landing a good deal, as many of the best models are still currently available at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dlhOGg"&gt;LG A1 OLED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="OfP5UO"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggFTcfLZsN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Built-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED48A1PUA/dp/B08WGNBTGV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are discounting various sizes of the LG’s entry-level A1 OLED, selling the 55-inch for around $1,099.99 ($200 off), its best price to date. Best Buy is also taking $90 off of Facebook Portal TV with your purchase, offering 30 days of FuboTV Pro at no additional cost, and giving you the option for one month of Philo for $5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9yade"&gt;The 4K A1 offers support for both Alexa and Google Assistant, as well as an automatic low-latency mode. Unlike more expensive OLEDs, however, it doesn’t come with a slate of advanced gaming features, like those found on LG’s C1 model. It offers a slower 60Hz display and lacks HDMI 2.1, for example, and doesn’t support a variable refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cKOBk3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10596459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EC2RcQ"&gt;LG BX OLED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dc7L53"&gt;Unlike the A1, LG’s BX line supports HDMI 2.1, meaning this TV is perfect for people looking to take advantage of the PS5 and Xbox Series X. The TV also supports Dolby Atmos as well as 4K at 120Hz and a variable refresh rate. At the moment, the popular &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9xg5aTnsu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model is discounted to $1,709.99&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $90.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OMVgrF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MB8PX4"&gt;LG GX Series OLED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4XqEcE"&gt;Despite the high price tag, LG’s Gallery Series GX OLED is a good TV for those looking for a more cinematic experience. It includes support for Google Assistant and Alexa, and for those who want to use their TV for gaming, it features Nvidia G-Sync and HDMI 2.1 support, meaning it can take full advantage of the RTX 30-Series cards or next-gen consoles. Right now, you can get the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744656950369633474" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for as low as $1,619.99&lt;/a&gt; ($180 off) at Best Buy. You can also buy it for the same price at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1555065-REG%2Flg_oled55gxpua_gxpua_55_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, or grab the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1555068-REG%2Flg_oled65gxpua_gxpua_65_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model at B&amp;amp;H for $2,296.99&lt;/a&gt;, which will save you $1,200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lpiA85"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10445785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nGYSCL"&gt;Vizio OLED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HVsMDE"&gt;Vizio’s 55-inch OLED remains a Best Buy exclusive. You can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVB68Xg6uj" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently get it for just $999.99&lt;/a&gt;, its best price to date, and it remains one of the more affordable options if you’re looking for an OLED. Vizio doesn’t have the same kind of experience in the OLED playing field as LG, sure, but it’s a great deal if you want a high-end viewing experience and HDMI 2.1 ports to display high frame rates from your PS5 or Xbox Series X. If you prefer a larger size, the 65-inch model is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVCblSKnxi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also available for $1,499.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, a cool $300 off the list price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKhcwu"&gt;Like with other models, the retailer is also offering a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV with each purchase, in addition to 30 days of FuboTV Pro and a month of Philo for $5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q8lGs4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ubtWst"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Vizio’s profit on ads, subscriptions, and data is double the money it makes selling TVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22773073/vizio-acr-advertising-inscape-data-privacy-q3-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xr7I2E"&gt;Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So, naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of your console, it might be time to upgrade to one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. For the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pFih8V"&gt;LG CX OLED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3Nkhmv"&gt;LG’s CX series of TVs include support for Nvidia’s G-Sync and AMD’s FreeSync adaptive sync technologies as well as a low 1ms response time. The big difference between the CX and the cheaper BX model mentioned above is the CX line has slightly better brightness, which is better for HDR content. It’s currently available in three sizes: 55, 65, and 77 inches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5q5Mh"&gt;Right now, there's a $75 discount available on the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVowrPgJjE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and a larger $800 discount &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggJsnuxSDh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available on the 77-inch configuration&lt;/a&gt;, bringing them down to $1,424.99 and $2,499.99, respectively. Best Buy will also take $90 off Facebook Portal TV and throw in a month of Philo for $5 when you buy the larger model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F5GsVe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9534696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfJNcm"&gt;LG C1 OLED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qapHVJ"&gt;If you’re looking for an even more impressive TV, we recommend turning your attention to LG’s C1 line. Like its predecessor, the CX, the 4K C1 touts support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD Freesync technologies, along with a 120Hz refresh rate and low input lag. The main difference between the two is that the C1 is available in an 83-inch variant and features a better processor. It also utilizes a newer interface that makes good use of a settings pane dubbed “Game Optimizer,” which conveniently brings together a host of game-centric settings — refresh rate, latency, etc. — for quicker access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkH38i"&gt;If you’re interested in all the bells and whistles that come with the C1, the 55-inch model is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747318067989758928?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22135602%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $1,296.99 and $1,299.99, two of the lowest prices to date on the excellent OLED. You can also pick up the smaller, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747323256242351544" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model for $1,099.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,299.99 at Best Buy, and the retailer will throw in a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV as well as 30 days of FuboTV Pro. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggJAvrUtOh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are offering discounts on other configurations, too, including the 65-inch, which is selling for around $1,796.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YU7ceV"&gt;Meanwhile, Newegg is offering the same discounts but throwing in a $100 Newegg gift card as well, selling both the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Flg-c1-55%2Fp%2FN82E16889007771" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Flg-c1-65%2Fp%2F89-007-772" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch&lt;/a&gt; for $1,299 and $1,799, respectively. The retailer is also offering a $500 gift card when you buy the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Flg-c1-83%2Fp%2FN82E16889007769" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;83-inch variant&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get a $50 gift card if you buy the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Flg-c1-48%2Fp%2F89-007-770" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model&lt;/a&gt; for $1,099 from Newegg as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W1e9Fy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10618444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bn523S"&gt;Samsung Neo QLED QN90A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PXnRvH"&gt;For a viable OLED alternative — one that’s currently seeing a rare discount — there’s the Neo QLED QN90A. Unlike the LG models above, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309077/samsung-2021-8k-4k-tvs-now-available-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s most recent flagship&lt;/a&gt; uses Mini LED backlighting, a technology that allows for better contrast, less “blooming” around white objects on a dark background, and brightness levels that outperform even the best OLED TVs. Like the C1, the QN90A is also built with gamers in mind. The 2021 model features an HDMI 2.1 port and a “Game Bar” that gives you the ability to quickly adjust your screen’s aspect ratio, monitor input lag, and check to ensure settings such as HDR and VRR are active, all of which make for a better gaming experience overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYqOuE"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the 55-inch QN90A sold for as low as $1,299.99, however, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748274080574733405" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3W4YXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are currently only discounting the $1,799.99 TV to around $1,499.99. There are also varying discounts available on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V39W74P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75&lt;/a&gt;- and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3B227H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;85-inch configurations&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dHUTPr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462562"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="Wy7BiA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OGJPin"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Shop our curated guide for everyone in your life&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SxVkbR"&gt;Finding the perfect gift for everyone special in your life can be, frankly, a nightmare. Some people are easy to shop for, but others in your family or social spheres might be less forthcoming about their desires. You could do the leg work of asking what might make them a happy camper over the holidays, but who has time for that? That’s a rhetorical question. No one has time for that, especially with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22833986/ups-usps-fedex-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target-shipping-deadlines-2021"&gt;shipping deadlines looming&lt;/a&gt; and delivery dates slipping further and further into January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhSfEV"&gt;Thankfully, our team of writers at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; huddled for weeks to come up with the definitive list of gift ideas that you’ll find below. There are gifts for gamers, aspiring podcast hosts, parents, board game connoisseurs, musicians, film buffs, and much more. Given that we cover tech primarily, you know we’ve got you covered for all of this year’s desirable gadgets. But our team is also comprised of cooks, campers, photographers, fitness enthusiasts, and more, so expect a varied and inspired selection of gift ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIXUPM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: if you’re still looking to pick something up before the holidays, we’ve rounded up a selection of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22834542/digital-holiday-gift-ideas-last-minute-online-subscriptions-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;great last-minute gifts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the bulk of which can be delivered digitally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
