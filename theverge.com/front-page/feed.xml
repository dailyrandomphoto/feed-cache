    <title>Discord now has Threads</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sW1vwj"&gt;Discord is launching its Threads feature today to allow servers to improve the back-and-forth of conversations on the service. Threads is distinctly different from the Replies feature that Discord introduced last year, and users will be able to create new threaded conversations using a new “#” option across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and the web today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2InWF"&gt;Threads work very similar to how they do in many other chat clients, allowing Discord users to branch off a conversation away from a main channel feed. A separate feed is generated for threaded conversations, and Discord server admins will be able to control which members of a server can participate in threads. Moderators will even be able to remove people from threads if they’re being troublesome.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nRu47n-thGflXLIlCBvrrOtx9B4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22742905/image3.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Discord Threads feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2oNcnO"&gt;Discord is also introducing both public and private threads. Public threads in a channel will let any members with the send messages permission start and reply to threads, but private threads will allow certain members to create and chat in private. You’ll be able to @ invite people into a private thread or manually add them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLLul9"&gt;Discord will automatically archive threads within 24 hours to try to reduce the clutter for channels. You’ll still be able to read threads in an archive tab, but you won’t be able to reply to them once they’re archived. Server admins can configure this up to three days for archive by default, but if a server is boosted to level 2 with Nitro boosts, then private threads and a one-week archive option will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6SLoVFb5ScsIyT5CokEbH7uw6Dk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22742687/discordthreadsmod.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Discord&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mods will be able to remove members from Discord threads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gepd3C"&gt;Threads will open up into a split-view panel in Discord, with an option to see a thread full-screen by clicking on it in the channel list. In a busy server, that does mean the channel list could be about to grow in size if users create multiple threads. But the overall goal is to avoid the headache of multiple different conversations happening at once in a single channel, and threads will certainly be useful for the more active Discord servers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The careful balancing act of translating an Ace Attorney game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ofJRNVNxJSsnITK7A18aEzrjbr0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638728/TGAAC_Ryunosuke_01_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A chat with localization director Janet Hsu&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="4Lrd8P"&gt;The success of the long-running &lt;em&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt; series hinges on great writing. Like most visual novel-style games, the quirky legal dramas involve a lot of text, with players reading dialogue and poring over clues in order to help their seemingly doomed clients. This means that localization is particularly important — as each new entry is translated from Japanese to English, localizers need to make it approachable for a new audience while retaining what makes it special in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SF1qh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557963/great-ace-attorney-chronicles-preview-hands-on-switch-ps4-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the latest entry in the franchise, provided an extra challenge. While most titles take place in the modern day, the new game jumps back in time to near the end of the 19th century and features characters and plotlines connected to both Meiji-era Japan and Victorian England. “I think the more difficult parts of this game’s localization lie in the way the historical context compounds the cross-cultural issues,” says localization director Janet Hsu. Against this backdrop, there’s a new lead character, Ryunosuke Naruhodo who replaces mainstay Phoenix Wright, and stories full of death, surprise, and all kinds of wonderfully terrible puns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wN4m2h"&gt;The game — which is actually a collection of two titles that released in Japan in 2015 and 2017 — is only finally coming out for English-speaking audiences this week. Ahead of launch, I had the chance to ask Hsu a few questions about dealing with regional differences, keeping the story accessible, and the challenges of text versus voice acting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIBKaJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qSVQ2OdErPDkqPS7SLm9u1_rffY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741251/TGAAC_Courtroom_02_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P0Sar8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you go about making the dialogue feel period-appropriate but also accessible for a modern audience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCk5zB"&gt;Making the text feel period-appropriate while remaining accessible is a real balancing act, for sure. One of the ways we’ve re-created that style of writing is by using older grammar structures for certain characters’ speaking styles, while with others, it might be by using certain words. But even with slightly older words, we only ever used ones that are still in use today; nothing should be so strange or obsolete that it requires players to look up the actual period definition in a dictionary. We also actively avoided words that are too modern or American in origin, so there might be a few places where people might think, “Isn’t there a more idiomatic way of saying this?” But it’s all part of preserving the overall style. In fact, you’d be surprised just how much of our modern style of English was only created in the last 100 years or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="na3RCO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We only ever used ones that are still in use today”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3GBIB1"&gt;We also took care to balance each line’s accessibility with its importance in the larger scheme of the story or a puzzle to be solved. Places where it’s more flavor text than critical puzzle text might feature more flourishes. However, no matter what type it is, people should be able to work out what a word means through context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0xE7n"&gt;At the end of the day, what is accessible will also somewhat depend on each player’s knowledge base and life experience. I do realize, for example, that perhaps some of our younger players might not know off the top of their heads some of the higher-level words that a university student might know through more years of schooling. However, it is my hope that this game will be something people can revisit over and over and enjoy anew each time. Just as someone might see this game in a new light culturally if they come to live or work in Japan or the UK, so too might a player more fully enjoy the text once they have had more exposure to this sort of writing, I feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qu8nbu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was it like having to localize a story that involves two very different cultures with Japan and the UK?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4vVks"&gt;Luckily, it wasn’t as hard as you’d think due to a number of factors. The first is that [writer and director Shu Takumi] is very familiar with 19th century London, thanks to his love of classic British mystery novels. He and the original development team did their due diligence and researched everything they needed to know about both Meiji Japan and Victorian London to make the story work. From there, the UK-based English translators and I were able to simply take the Japanese and run with it. Naturally, for the UK-based translators, writing about their own culture was a lot easier than me as an American trying to do the same. That is actually one of the reasons I chose to work with Plus Alpha Translations to begin with, in addition to their history of stellar localizations. For the cross-cultural aspects, figuring out how to present them was a no-brainer for me since I’ve been doing it all my life. Growing up in a very Taiwanese household in America means I have a lot of experience “translating” culturally Asian concepts into something more relatable to someone with a more European background and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="A0HnQK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I was hesitant to over-explain things”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cNIgTT"&gt;So more than the locations of Japan and the UK, I think the more difficult parts of this game’s localization lie in the way the historical context compounds the cross-cultural issues. Because the 19th century London setting is something quite literally foreign to Japanese players, there were some great bits of world-building written into the Japanese text to provide cultural explanations. On the other hand, however, there was significantly less information provided about Meiji Japan or it wasn’t explained in as much detail because a lot of it is assumed to be common knowledge. In fact, the opening anime’s very first line in the Japanese version simply says, “A few decades after that history-making opening of the country...” A Japanese audience wouldn’t need to be told this is referring to Japan since they use the word “kaikoku” (開国 / literally “opening the country”), which is more than enough to set up the where and when. But for a Western audience, I felt that this simply wouldn’t be enough information to go on, so we made it very clear that this was Japan and tried to strengthen the impression provided by the Japanese text of just how turbulent the times were in Japanese society through the narration’s writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXTjwK"&gt;Even still, I was hesitant to over-explain things as it would drag the tempo of the story down, so the translators and I tried to sneak in what we could to hopefully provide enough background for the game to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BLZEwi1164vhH5gRBftDkWLHAq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741267/TGAAC_Dance_of_Deduction_01_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z7fSs1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It seems like audiences, particularly for a series like this, understand localization much more than in the past. Is this something you’ve noticed? And how, if at all, does that influence your approach?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RIa8y"&gt;With art and entertainment, I believe there is a relationship of sorts between creators and their audience through a piece of work. Having come from the world of fanworks and fandom myself, I’ve always been very aware of the many differing opinions on localization in general, and what the prevailing expectations among fans of all stripes are as the years go by. It’s been amazing to watch how trends have changed as professionals and fans alike debate the merits of different localization approaches. The fact that these sorts of discussions are taking place at all is fantastic, and it is definitely not something that happened to this extent when I first started localizing games over 15 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bfnwo3"&gt;This greater awareness of localization has led me to trust my audience to think and understand a great deal more about why something might have been changed, or why a certain approach has been taken. Of course, this also means that I am very careful not to betray that trust, so I always make sure every decision I take is necessary and justifiable. But localization is also a creative process, which means not every decision I make will please every player, so it’s also a constant learning process for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qqIyDf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I wanted to make the most of this chance”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aCr3t9"&gt;With &lt;em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; being a standalone title that is not connected to the previous games, I wanted to make the most of this chance to make this localization something more in line with the standards of today. In the past, the complete localization philosophy worked extremely well in making foreign-made entertainment accessible to a wider audience. However, thanks in part to the internet and machine translation software such as Google Translate, it’s easier than ever to learn about other languages and cultures and enjoy foreign movies and other forms of entertainment. But that isn’t to say there is no place for complete localizations anymore, either. Just look at all of the regional remakes of TV dramas and movies that are still being produced to great popularity today. Ultimately, I think what the furtherance of understanding surrounding localization has done is it’s opened up a whole range of new avenues — new options and approaches in addition to the existing older approaches that we can consider and use in localizing pieces of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZowtFV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much did you have to worry about localization choices that were made in past games? Did they limit your options in any way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPoLkM"&gt;For this game, it didn’t worry me much at all. While there were a few very small references that were lost, I think the only major issue was what to do about Phoenix Wright and Ryunosuke Naruhodo’s familial relationship. But given how I’ve localized the mainline games to be a more Japanese-influenced version of California, it made it very easy and also made a lot of sense to simply make Ryunosuke into Phoenix’s ancestor and preserve the intended relationship from the Japanese version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQvTJ9"&gt;Actually, I suppose there’s also the issue of Prosecutor Auchi and his relation to the Payne brothers, but we’ve had Prosecutor Flynch in &lt;em&gt;Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney,&lt;/em&gt; so I figured that connection’s probably not going to be too “painful” for players to make on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wlOA2pL8_8Mxx4t8UsqXILR5BuA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741269/TGAAC_Courtroom_01_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3Cqv2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How big is the team? How many people are involved in localizing and translating a game like this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eN7tww"&gt;For the localization of this title, we had a small team of staff here in our Japan branch along with our translators in the UK. In addition, we also had a team of linguistic QA testers who checked and tightened up our text. All in all, it was a long process. But with a story-heavy game like this, too many cooks spoil the broth, as they say, so slow and steady it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbgkrh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does there being voiced elements change things at all? Do you localize differently depending on whether the dialogue is spoken or text?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvhMOJ"&gt;Just so there’s no misunderstanding, this title is not fully voiced, but there are a number of anime and real-time in-game cutscenes that are fully voiced. In addition, some new gameplay systems have enabled us to employ short voice clips to give our characters more depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="eJFsGL"&gt;That said, there is absolutely a difference in the way we write the lines when they’re spoken versus when it is text alone. This is due to what voice acting can convey that text alone cannot. For example, the translators wrote some really funny deadpan lines, but a few of them ended up being so dry that you could mistakenly interpret them to mean something completely different. Had those lines been voiced, I’m sure an actor’s deadpan delivery would have made it unmistakable that they’re meant to be jokes. That’s why the dialogue in a text-based game can sometimes sound a little off when read out loud since it has to be written in a way to properly convey its intended tone without the help of an actor’s delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFFTNs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wwqz4Z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is making accounts for users under 16 private by default</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OoUryKtebPxofpqD19jq08MvOKg=/0x0:890x593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638629/CD21_471_IG_In_line.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook is making Instagram safer for young people while developing Instagram for under-13s. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Instagam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8svW3F"&gt;Facebook-owned Instagram is introducing changes designed to make the app safer for young people. From now on, anyone signing up to the service who’s under the age of 16 (or under 18 in certain countries) will have their account set to private by default, though the option to switch to public will still be available. Anyone under these ages with a public account now will be sent a notification encouraging them to switch to private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZBQrL"&gt;Instagram has been edging toward making private accounts default for young people for a while. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333580/instagram-bans-adults-messaging-teens-safety-notice-prompt"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt;, it started showing young people signing up to Instagram a message extolling the virtues of having a private account. Now, it’s making private the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iGkRlv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Advertisers will only be able to target people under 18 based on their age, gender, and location&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KGsDiR"&gt;Facebook the company is also introducing changes to how advertisers can target users under the age of 18. Previously, any user could be targeted based on their interests and activity; information that Facebook collects &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ways-facebook-tracks-you-limit-it/"&gt;from across the web&lt;/a&gt;, not just its own properties, analyzing individuals’ web browsing history, app usage, and the like. Now, advertisers will only be able to target under-18 users based on their age, gender, and location. This applies to users on Instagram, Messenger, and Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vb5Z68"&gt;On Instagram, the company says it’s also doing more to limit how problematic users interact with users under 16 years old. The company says it’s able to identify “potentially suspicious behavior” from accounts. This means the account may have been recently blocked or reported by a younger person, for example. These suspicious users will be virtually separated from users under 16: they won’t be shown under-16 accounts in their Explore, Reels, or Accounts Suggested For You pages, nor will they see comments from users under 16 on others’ posts or be able to comment on content from users younger than 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6JSop"&gt;“We are trying to figure out if an adult is exhibiting suspicious behavior,” Instagram’s head of public policy, Karina Newton, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/instagram-s-new-protections-teens-come-experts-say-tween-venture-n1275069"&gt;told NBC News&lt;/a&gt;. “The adult might not have broken the rules yet, but might be doing things that make us look at them more deeply.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ujcqY"&gt;Instagram previously used its ability to identify suspicious accounts to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333580/instagram-bans-adults-messaging-teens-safety-notice-prompt"&gt;warn teens&lt;/a&gt; when they received a direct message from one of these users. It also blocked adults from messaging teens who don’t already follow them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4llHV"&gt;At the same time as Facebook is trying to make Instagram safer and more private for teenagers, it’s still working on developing an app for kids under 13 (the current minimum age to sign up for Instagram). The plans were first reported by &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;, and were met with widespread criticism and complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaIcS8"&gt;Instagram’s Newton told NBC News that Instagram’s under-13 app was still being worked on and that the company was in “deep consultation with experts in child development and privacy advocates” to meet the “needs of families and youth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOwL8H"&gt;Said Newton: “We’re looking to build something that’s compelling for tweens and works for parents.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Joby Aviation’s electric air taxi complete a 150-mile flight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cupr_qOWdSn59_XVg8qeSdQlW-c=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638491/Joby_aircraft.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0F9iUM"&gt;Electric air taxis aren’t a real thing yet, but a host of well-financed startups are out to change that. Chief among them is Joby Aviation, an electric aviation company based in Northern California that just posted a noteworthy video of its six-rotor aircraft completing an impressive 150-mile flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdEvLu"&gt;Granted, it doesn’t sound too impressive, but it’s actually among the longest flights ever performed by an electric aircraft. It’s equivalent to a trip between Seattle and Vancouver, or Los Angeles to San Diego — the type of regional trip conducted hundreds of times a day by regional partners to major airlines. Swapping out those polluting airplanes for a zero-emissions aircraft like Joby’s could be a major step toward the reduction of CO2 emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kOIeP3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;among the longest flights ever performed by an electric aircraft&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i29d2p"&gt;The company, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21068135/joby-aviation-toyota-flying-air-taxi-investment-amount"&gt;backed by Toyota&lt;/a&gt; and recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22086597/uber-sells-flying-taxi-elevate-joby-aviation"&gt;acquired Uber’s flying taxi division&lt;/a&gt;, has said that it plans to have a full-scale air taxi service in operation by 2024, including regional trips. The point of the 150-mile flight was to demonstrate how far its aircraft could fly on a single charge, to allay concerns about the vehicle’s range and battery. If you want to fly from New York City to Montauk, Joby wanted to show that it can get you there without running out of juice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nT2B4l"&gt;“We’ve achieved something that many thought impossible with today’s battery technology,” JoeBen Bevirt, founder and CEO of Joby, said in a statement. “By doing so we’ve taken the first step towards making convenient, emissions-free air travel between places like San Francisco and Lake Tahoe, Houston and Austin, or Los Angeles and San Diego an everyday reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DdfO6V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Joby’s aircraft flew in a 14-mile circle 11 times for a total flight time of one hour and 17 minutes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xysDJ6"&gt;Rather than fly between two points, Joby’s aircraft flew in a 14-mile circle 11 times for a total flight time of one hour and 17 minutes. It’s an impressive feat, given the challenges of electric flight. The power-to-weight ratio is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/14/17686706/electric-airplane-flying-car-battery-weight-green-energy-travel"&gt;biggest inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;. Energy density — the amount of energy stored in a given system — is the key metric, and today’s batteries don’t contain enough energy to get most planes off the ground. To weigh it out: jet fuel gives us about 43 times more energy than a battery that’s just as heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mk8aIO"&gt;But Joby says that its commercially available lithium-ion batteries have been specially adapted for aerospace uses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="56LfSK"&gt;An 811 NMC cathode and a graphite anode cell were selected, following internal testing, to deliver the optimal trade-off between the specific energy required to fly the aircraft 150 miles, the specific power to take-off and land vertically and the cycle life to deliver an affordable service. We have demonstrated in the lab that this battery is capable of more than 10,000 of our expected nominal flight cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="90FfoL"&gt;The team developing Joby’s energy system is led by Jon Wagner, head of powertrain and electronics, who previously led battery engineering at Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdjhrp"&gt;It helps that Joby is starting small with a five-seater vehicle. Higher capacity aircraft won’t come until the energy density in the current batteries improves. But Joby has a financial buffer, having just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298957/joby-aviation-public-evtol-electric-aircraft-spac-hoffman"&gt;gone public via a reverse merger with a special acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;, or SPAC. As part of the deal, Joby will get $1.6 billion in cash, which it will use to continue to tinker and perfect its technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRdygE"&gt;The question is: will it be enough to get the company to 2024?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Sony ZV-E10 is an E-mount camera for vloggers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uxa1TITpx657RpcTJf1oTgdbKFc=/0x84:2015x1427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638487/zve10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZV-E10 features an E-mount for interchangeable lenses and a large, 24-megapixel sensor.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="raXxxl"&gt;Sony has announced the ZV-E10, an APS-C interchangeable lens camera it hopes will appeal to the needs of vloggers. It brings &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328971/sony-zv-1-review-vlogging-4k-camera-price-specs-features"&gt;many of the features we liked from the fixed-lens ZV-1&lt;/a&gt; into a bigger sensor format, including shortcuts to focus and exposure settings vloggers may need to access quickly. Being a bigger camera, there are also some significant benefits that the pocketable ZV-1 didn’t have the real estate to accommodate, like a headphone jack, better battery life, and a larger sensor with more depth-of-field flexibility. And at $799 with a 16-50mm kit lens, it’s a pretty good deal — just over the ZV-1’s current $749 asking price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3b0f0n"&gt;While the ZV-E10 addresses many of our complaints with the ZV-1, the latter still has one feature not offered in the new camera: hardware-based image stabilization. While the ZV-1 included stabilization built into the lens, the ZV-E10 only offers electronic stabilization. To supplement this, it also includes the ability to record gyro sensor data in metadata that can be utilized when applying stabilization in post-processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LGv8qH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10671612"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oHpaCL"&gt;The ZV-E10 offers a 24.2-megapixel sensor with a native ISO range of 100-32,000 equipped with the excellent eye and subject-tracking AF that both the ZV-1 and Sony’s recent interchangeable-lens cameras offer. It also includes the ZV-1’s vlogger-friendly Bokeh Switch mode, which toggles the aperture to blur your background or bring it into focus, as well as a Product Showcase mode to apply AF settings best suited for presenting products on camera. There’s a fully articulated touchscreen display for easier operation from in front of the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K9EWzA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Video recording tops out at 4K / 30p and is taken from oversampled 6K footage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4XnhV8"&gt;Video recording tops out at 4K / 30p and is taken from oversampled 6K footage. Hybrid log-gamma, S-Log2, and S-Log3 profiles are included for videographers who plan to grade footage after capture. Slow-motion footage can be recorded up to 1080 / 120p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gflbTl"&gt;Microphone and 3.5mm headphone jacks are included, and a three-capsule directional microphone is built in with a windscreen included in the box. Livestreaming via USB is supported for phones with Android 11, though not yet available with iOS devices. The ZV-E10 claims up to 80 minutes of video recording on a single battery charge, which is almost double the ZV-1’s claimed 45 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tlmhce"&gt;The Sony ZV-1 will go on sale in August for $699 body-only or $799 with a 16-50mm kit lens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It looks like Fortnite’s next big event is happening on August 6th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SLt2Mcxds1aWUVNeecQNW62L0z4=/584x0:3221x1758/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638321/Fortnite_20210727091441.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFKsvC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s next big live event appears to be very close. After the game’s most recent update, a new alien ship can be found hovering over the center of the battle royale island, projecting a clock counting down to August 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VOzIP3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite’s experimental story is an attempt to create ‘the entertainment experience of the future’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QSsaSA"&gt;Given &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s history with live events — which have included everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;a Galactus attack&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end"&gt;an island-destroying black hole&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333635/fortnites-season-6-single-player-event-storytelling"&gt;an actual single-player mission&lt;/a&gt; — it seems likely this countdown will end in the latest such moment. Developer Epic, as always, is being cryptic about what’s happening. “Its intent doesn’t seem to be for harm,” &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-battle-royale-v17-21-update-the-plasma-cannon-enters-the-invasion"&gt;the developer says of the ship&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s predicted its purpose will become clearer in the near future.” &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-20-huge-fortnite-leak-points-to-upcoming-ariana-grande-concert"&gt;Previous leaks&lt;/a&gt; have also suggested an Ariana Grande concert is coming to the game, though it’s unclear if the pop star has any connection to the alien invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C57Dzk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s current alien-themed season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22519431/fortnite-season-7-superman-flying-saucers-aliens"&gt;kicked off on June 8th&lt;/a&gt;, changing the battle royale game with all kinds of new alien weapons and terrain. Since then, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has seen a steady stream of updates and events, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550240/fortnite-easy-life-concert-o2-arena"&gt;a trippy concert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585705/fortnite-short-nite-2-film-festival-party-royale-july-23rd"&gt;a short film festival&lt;/a&gt;, and new characters like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553914/fortnite-crew-loki-release-date"&gt;Loki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22570612/lebron-james-fortnite-skin-release-date"&gt;LeBron James&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583750/fortnite-world-cup-champion-bugha-skin-release-date"&gt;Bugha&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nothing officially reveals its $99 Ear (1) true wireless earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CdZyatk3QZNGyNso3J3B6lbX6cI=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638162/Nothing_ear__1__ladybirds.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Ear (1) earbud perched atop its charging case.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nothing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q6gBSR"&gt;Nothing, the consumer tech startup led by OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, has officially announced its Ear (1) true wireless earbuds. The noise-canceling buds launch after months of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564819/nothing-earbuds-price-noise-cancellation-anc"&gt;teases&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320915/nothing-true-wireless-earbuds-teenage-engineering-concept-1"&gt;concept images&lt;/a&gt;, and even a presale in which Nothing &lt;a href="https://nothing.tech/blogs/news/nothing-partners-with-stockx-on-first-ever-electronics-dropx"&gt;auctioned off 100 pairs of the earbuds&lt;/a&gt; prior to their official reveal. The Ear (1) earbuds will go on sale on August 17th across 45 countries including the US and UK, priced at $99 / £99 / €99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHqzqV"&gt;In a statement, Pei calls the Ear (1) “a breath of fresh air in a cluttered and indifferent market,” and said the earbuds will “[set] the tone for our connected digital world to come.” Pei has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22250653/nothing-brand-oneplus-carl-pei-announcement-consumer-technology-smart-devices"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; his plan for Nothing is to build up an ecosystem of devices across increasingly complex product categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IlcLzjKPczsxGP8piI4L5Zw1asA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740803/ear__1__R__white_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nothing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You get 5.7 hours of playback from the earbuds themselves...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/olxHasTN6oNgTzNkdYjSv5joxfE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740804/ear__1__case_and_earbuds__transparent_background_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nothing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;... and up to 34 hours when used with the case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QBteut"&gt;With a design based around transparent plastic, the Ear (1)’s have a distinctive look that reveals some of their internal circuitry, and each earbud has a color-coded circle (red or white) to indicate the corresponding ear. They’re equipped with 11.6mm drivers, and Nothing’s hardware and software have both been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298802/nothing-teenage-engineering-swedish-design-founding-partner-audio-headphones"&gt;tuned by Swedish electronics house Teenage Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8dT2E"&gt;Battery life is rated at up to 34 hours when the earbuds are used with their charging case, and 5.7 hours from the earbuds themselves with ANC off (dropping to 24 hours and four hours with ANC on, respectively). They can be charged wirelessly using Qi-compatible chargers or wired over USB-C. The Ear (1)’s use a trio of microphones on each earbud to offer noise-cancelation, which can be set to maximum for loud environments, light if it’s quieter, and there’s a transparency mode for when you need to hear what’s going on around you. The earbuds also cancel out background noise when using their microphones to make calls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gls3jdgfVRE289FWTx-52OefuS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740788/Nothing_ear__1__lifestyle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nothing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ear (1) uses transparent plastic in its construction to reveal some internal circuitry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WtQvJB"&gt;The Ear (1)s have tap and gesture controls, and these can be customized via a companion app which also handles EQ and Find my Earbud functionality. They feature Bluetooth 5.2 and they’re IPX4 water resistant, which should allow them to survive sweat and light splashes. Fast pairing will be supported with compatible Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SA3ySd"&gt;While the earbuds will go on general sale next month, Nothing is selling a limited batch of the earbuds from its own website starting on July 31st. We’ll have a full review of the Ear (1) earbuds coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s second-gen Echo Buds are down to their lowest price since Prime Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IXFGg7zJrqdUzOuMNf2bn2UvaHM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638077/DSCF3852_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The second-gen Echo Buds surpass their predecessors with better noise cancellation and sound. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3kGzHg"&gt;Unsurprisingly, Staples isn’t the only retailer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/7/26/22593999/apple-airpods-pro-homepod-mini-brydge-ipad-surface-keyboard-deal-sale"&gt;discounting the AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; and other earbuds in the buildup to the fall semester. Best Buy, for instance, is currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747339834917966859#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering a sizable $40 discount&lt;/a&gt; on the second-gen Amazon Echo Buds, bringing the price of both the white and black models down to their lowest price since Prime Day. Now on sale for $80, the 2021 Echo Buds build upon their predecessors in a variety of ways, offering up effective noise cancellation, solid sound, and a first-rate passthrough mode that allows you to stay in tune with the world around you. They also support hands-free Alexa, meaning you can quickly check the weather, queue up your Discover Weekly in Spotify, and carry out a host of other voice-enabled tasks without ever reaching for your phone. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lP6M9W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8cB2T9"&gt;Apple’s official space gray accessories for the Mac &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436719/apple-space-gray-magic-trackpad-keyboard-mouse-discontinued" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;may be discontinued&lt;/a&gt;, but there are some good alternatives if you’re looking to maintain aesthetics. Outfitted with a number pad, USB-C support, and backlit keys, Logitech’s MX Keys keyboard is a great case in point. The full-size wireless keyboard — which dons a space gray exterior and works with macOS and iOS — also features up to 10 days of battery life with the backlighting turned on, and the ability to connect to and quickly switch between three devices via Bluetooth. The &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13048831?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Flogitech-mx-keys-wireless-keyboard-space-gray-920-009552%2Fproduct_24450769" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wireless Mac keyboard&lt;/a&gt; usually retails for $100 but is on sale at Staples for $80 with offer code &lt;strong&gt;32547 &lt;/strong&gt;(discount applies at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ItYVKk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10652769" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S1NAda"&gt;If you’re in need of storage for your Nintendo Switch, phone, or camera, you rarely have to look beyond SanDisk. The well-known company produces some of the most reliable and affordable microSD cards in existence, with fast write speeds and a range of configurations that often go on sale. Right now, for example, Costco members can snag a two-pack of &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/sandisk-256gb-microsdxc-card-for-the-nintendo-switch,-2-pack.product.100675941.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SanDisk’s 256GB microSD cards&lt;/a&gt; for $60, more than 30 percent off the initial list price and the lowest price we’ve seen on the versatile, no-frills bundle. Don’t let the Mario-themed design and Nintendo branding fool you — the cards work just as well with other devices as they do Nintendo’s handheld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZXKxFr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10670794"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZCQ4TS"&gt;Other deals of note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch’s data ‘black box’ poses research problems</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Apple Watch Series 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rXR6BFEtdkswsLXeA9o2nffDijY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638061/akrales_171113_2119_0074.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wyuJbq"&gt;A Harvard biostatistician is rethinking plans to use Apple Watches as part of a research study after finding inconsistencies in the heart rate variability data collected by the devices. Because Apple tweaks the watch’s algorithms as needed, the data from the same time period can change without warning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0EuKP"&gt;“These algorithms are what we would call black boxes — they’re not transparent. So it’s impossible to know what’s in them,” JP Onnela, associate professor of biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and developer of the open-source data platform Beiwe, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttq0Sr"&gt;Onnela doesn’t usually include commercial wearable devices like the Apple Watch in research studies. For the most part, his teams use research-grade devices that are designed to collect data for scientific studies. As part of a collaboration with the department of neurosurgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, though, he was interested in the commercially available products. He knew that there were sometimes data issues with those products, and his team wanted to check how severe they were before getting started. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlJ8xl"&gt;So, they checked in on heart rate data his collaborator Hassan Dawood, a research fellow at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, exported from his Apple Watch. Dawood exported his daily heart rate variability data twice: once on September 5th, 2020 and a second time on April 15th, 2021. For the experiment, they looked at data collected over the same stretch of time — from early December 2018 to September 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TrYWaX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Because the two exported datasets included data from the same time period, the data from both sets should theoretically be identical&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TqyYDD"&gt;Because the two exported datasets included data from the same time period, the data from both sets should theoretically be identical. Onnela says he was expecting some differences. The “black box” of wearable algorithms is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681254/data-health-apps-clue-period-tracking-sleep-fitness-research"&gt;consistent challenge&lt;/a&gt; for researchers. Rather than showing the raw data collected by a device, the products usually only let researchers export information after it has been analyzed and filtered through an algorithm of some kind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TvG6Z"&gt;Companies change their algorithms regularly and without warning, so the September 2020 export may have included data analyzed using a different algorithm than the April 2021 export. “What was surprising was how different they were,” he says. “This is probably the cleanest example that I have seen of this phenomenon.” He published the data in a &lt;a href="https://www.beiwe.org/exporting-the-same-data-from-a-wearable-twice-doesnt-give-you-the-same-data/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cpr9lBsmSrREYW-h7ZlxnOJXgeU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740584/HRV_plot_2048x692.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beiwe&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comparing the heart rate variability data collected at the two different time points shows big differences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EkZA2d"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsD1Me"&gt;It was striking to see the differences laid out so clearly, says Olivia Walch, a sleep researcher who works with wearable and app data at the University of Michigan. Walch has long advocated for researchers to use raw data — data pulled directly from a device’s sensors, instead of filtered through its software. “It’s validating, because I get on my little soapbox about the raw data, and it’s nice to have a concrete example where it would really matter,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOyi5o"&gt;Constantly changing algorithms makes it almost prohibitively difficult to use commercial wearables for sleep research, Walch says. Sleep studies are already expensive. “Are you going to be able to strap four FitBits on someone, each running a different version of the software, and then compare them? Probably not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wW7H5i"&gt;Companies have incentives to change their algorithms to make their products better. “They’re not super incentivized to tell us &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they’re changing things,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KN73PU"&gt;That’s a problem for research. Onnela compared it to tracking body weight. “If I wanted to jump on a scale every week, I should be using the same scale every time,” he says. If that scale was tweaked without him knowing about it, the day-to-day changes in weight wouldn’t be reliable. For someone who has just a casual interest in tracking their health, that may be fine — the differences aren’t going to be major. But in research, consistency matters. “That’s the concern,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uycTL4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Maybe you would have a completely different result if you just been using a different model.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pUdzXy"&gt;Someone could, for example, run a study using a wearable and come to a conclusion about how people’s sleep patterns changed based on adjustments in their environment. But that conclusion might only be true with that particular version of the wearable’s software. “Maybe you would have a completely different result if you just been using a different model,” Walch says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0E8kp5"&gt;Dawood’s Apple Watch data isn’t from a study and is just one informal example. But it shows the importance of being cautious with commercial devices that don’t allow access to raw data, Onnela says. It was enough to make his team back away from plans to use the devices in studies. He thinks commercial wearables should only be used if raw data is available, or — at minimum — if researchers are able to get a heads-up when an algorithm is going to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnliQy"&gt;There might be some situations where wearable data could still be useful. The heart rate variability information showed similar trends at both time points — the data went up and down at the same times. “If you’re caring about stuff on that macro scale, then you can make the call that you’d keep using the device,” Walch says. But if the specific heart rate variability calculated on each day matters for a study, the Apple Watch may be riskier to rely on, she says. “It should give people pause about using certain wearables, if the rug runs the risk of being ripped out underneath their feet.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest now lets influencers make money off shoppable pins</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/btXcwi6Dcv1fIndaDSXfn8CQgSA=/0x0:1428x952/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638019/Idea_Pin_Product_Tagging_Branded_Image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Pinterest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x7dgZk"&gt;Pinterest is going after the influencer market. The platform announced its first set of tools today to let content creators earn money by promoting items from around the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpFw1S"&gt;The platform is adding support for affiliate links, letting creators get a cut of purchases they drive. It’s also adding product tagging to its story-like Idea Pins to drive sales from more places, and it’s adding a new “paid partnerships” label to support sponsorships within Idea Pins. The updates come a few months after the platform launched a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/creatorcode"&gt;$500,000 fund&lt;/a&gt; for BIPOC creators and sharpens the company’s focus on shopping as other platforms, like Instagram, start to take on shopping, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Knufkr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s all a way to promote shopping on the platform&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N6WwYY"&gt;Businesses can already upload “Product Pins” to Pinterest, which allow people to click through to find and then buy a product. Creators will now be able to browse these available product pins and integrate them into their Idea Pins, thereby making content with the product and making it easier for potential buyers to understand what they’re seeing and how to use it. The creators can also add their own affiliate links to these tags, allowing them to make money off any product sold. It’s all a way to promote shopping on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxfYKF"&gt;Availability varies, but the product tagging tool within Idea Pins will launch for all business accounts in the US and UK, with access rolling out over the coming months to international creators. The paid partnerships tool is now live for select creators in the US, UK, and Canada, along with 16 other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdgEoQ"&gt;The big idea here is clearly for Pinterest to make it easier for people on its platform to sell the things they’re already promoting and for users to more easily purchase whatever supplies they realize they need to make the various Pinterest project ideas they see come to life. Other platforms have also capitalized on shopping. Instagram, as likely the biggest example, created a full shopping tab in its app, allows for product tagging, and makes it easy for brands and creators to partner.&lt;/p&gt;
