    <title>Julian Assange can be extradited to the US, rules UK High Court</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0by4Tl"&gt;The UK’s High Court has &lt;a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/usa-v-julian-assange-2/"&gt;approved the extradition&lt;/a&gt; of Julian Assange to the US. The decision reverses a ruling by a lower court in the UK that blocked the extradition on the grounds that imprisonment in the US was a threat to Assange’s mental health and increased his risk of suicide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGcU5F"&gt;The US government has now successfully appealed this decision by offering a &lt;a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/USA-v-Assange-summary-101221.pdf"&gt;number of assurances&lt;/a&gt; to British judges. These include assurances that Assange won’t be held in a “supermax” high-security prison during pretrial or if convicted (unless he “commits any future act which renders him liable to such conditions of detention”) and that the US will allow Assange to serve any final sentence in his native Australia, if he wishes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usr2Bt"&gt;As reported by &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/julian-assange-high-court-reverses-decision-not-to-extradite-wikileaks-founder-to-the-us-12491646"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Assange’s fiancee, Stella Moris, said: “We will appeal this decision at the earliest possible moment.” Moris said the ruling was a “grave miscarriage of justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p8H8r4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How can it be fair [...] to extradite Julian to the very country which plotted to kill him?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vsEG6U"&gt;“How can it be fair, how can it be right, how can it be possible, to extradite Julian to the very country which plotted to kill him?” said Moris, referencing &lt;a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/kidnapping-assassination-and-a-london-shoot-out-inside-the-ci-as-secret-war-plans-against-wiki-leaks-090057786.html"&gt;reports earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that the CIA and Trump administration explored the possibility of kidnapping or assassinating Assange in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUB8dk"&gt;Assange has been indicted by US prosecutors on 18 counts, including 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer misuse. He’s accused of conspiring to hack into US military computers in order to publish confidential military and diplomatic documents on WikiLeaks. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison, though the US government claims the actual sentence will be between four and six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhA92J"&gt;The documents published by WikiLeaks exposed US wrongdoings in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. These include the so-called “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_12,_2007,_Baghdad_airstrike"&gt;Collateral Murder&lt;/a&gt;” video, which showed US helicopter pilots in Baghdad killing a group of civilians including two Reuters journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYaPfS"&gt;Groups including Reporters Without Borders and Amnesty International have called on the US to drop charges against Assange, saying that Assange’s work is legitimate journalism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SvpZW"&gt;“Julian Assange’s publication of disclosed documents as part of his work with Wikileaks should not be punishable as this activity mirrors conduct that investigative journalists undertake regularly in their professional capacity,” says Amnesty. “Prosecuting Julian Assange on these charges could have a chilling effect on the right to freedom of expression, leading journalists to self-censor from fear of prosecution.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Witcher season 2 gets a little too serious on its quest to answer some big questions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="witcher season 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_gsPAO4PKZumzFigDaTSGxIjgVI=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70253542/W_201_Unit_00288_RT.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The new season is grander, but less playful, than the first  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="9LmEXm"&gt;The first season of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;Netflix’s live-action adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was a careful balancing act. In some ways, it was the service’s answer to &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, a bloody fantasy epic with a story that spanned a continent (and many years). But, in keeping with the source material, it was also a lot of fun. There were creepy monsters to hunt each episode, some great comic relief in the form of an annoying bard, as well as steamy bath scenes and a full-on orgy. It had everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wC5hKS"&gt;Season 2 attempts to up the fantasy stakes by focusing on some of the bigger, more existential questions about &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; universe, from the origins of monsters to why a young princess’s screams create earthquakes. The result is a show that has a more ambitious, epic feel and one that also loses some of the personality that made it such a hit in the first place. These issues mirror the trajectory of the books, but they feel more pronounced in a live-action series where so much depends on the characters and their performances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2FfsL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: this review is based on the first six episodes of &lt;/em&gt;The Witcher&lt;em&gt; season 2 (there are eight in total) and contains light spoilers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVSKVt"&gt;The story picks up right after the events of season 1’s final episode, in which two important things happened. One, Geralt (a monster-hunting mutant played by Henry Cavill) and his ward Ciri (a princess with strange powers played by Freya Allan) finally reached each other after spending the past eight episodes seemingly running in parallel across an entire continent. At the same time, a huge battle ended after the mage — and Geralt’s on-again, off-again love interest — Yennefer (Anya Chalotra) channeled some dark forces to temporarily defeat an entire army. These events left the cast in some interesting places, which is right where season 2 kicks off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="witcher season 2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Er5AziH2NULdZJUJn7JeP6pS9FQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076391/W_205_Unit_00111_RT.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AiX4Vl"&gt;There’s a lot going on. At the outset, Geralt, always the lone wolf, is now a father figure and takes Ciri with him to Kaer Morhen — a secluded spot in the mountains that serves as the home base for the witchers — in order to keep her safe and plot his next move. Ciri takes this opportunity to train. After spending the first season almost entirely as a victim on the run, she wants to become strong enough to defend herself. Yennefer, meanwhile, is a prisoner of war who is now struggling with a very personal loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNHybo"&gt;Amidst all of the individual struggles, season 2 of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; attempts to broach some big, universe-defining questions. At the center of it all is an event, often spoke of in passing, called the conjunction. Essentially, before the conjunction, there were different realms, or spheres, keeping the likes of humans, elves, and monsters separate. But the conjunction saw them forced together, creating the world as we know it in &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;. So many things are tied to this event — the sudden appearance of new monsters, Ciri’s powers, the existence of the witchers in the first place — that it serves as the connective tissue for pretty much everything happening. (If you’re looking for even more backstory, I highly recommend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638162/the-witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-review-netflix"&gt;the animated prequel movie &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which provides some great context for the history of witchers and monsters.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0RSJ00"&gt;It’s interesting to see these larger questions at play, but the best part of this complicated setup is that it lets you see the main cast from all new perspectives. Geralt has become such a dad, focused almost entirely on Ciri’s well-being, even if it means upsetting the other witchers who just want to kill things and sleep for the winter. Ciri makes a dramatic turn into an incredibly determined budding warrior, while Yennefer is forced to deal with life after losing a defining part of her life. I won’t spoil too much about Jaskier (Joey Batey) other than to say he is no longer a happy-go-lucky bard — more like a lover scorned after his split from Geralt. (Seriously, just wait until you hear his new hit song.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSVH8C"&gt;This season also brings the woefully underused mage Trish Merigold (Anna Shaffer) into a much more prominent position and turns the seemingly heartless Fringilla (Mimi Ndiweni) into a surprisingly sympathetic leader. At the same time, &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; introduces some key new faces. Among them: Geralt’s mentor and father figure, Vesemir (Kim Bodnia), who is desperate to keep witchers from going extinct, a dark mage named Rience (Chris Fulton) tasked with finding Ciri, and Nenneke (Adjoa Andoh), a priestess who helps guide Geralt through this new (for him) territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="witcher season 2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oSj-eNrzVA8P2dh0XVyccbkgzhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076406/W_202_Unit_03248_RT.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iGBHEH"&gt;So yeah, there’s a lot going on, but it’s actually a little easier to keep things straight this time because, unlike season 1, everything is happening on the same timeline. (The show even pokes fun at the complexity of last season with a great self-aware joke.) I do miss the monster-of-the-week structure from 2019, but season 2 works because its central mysteries are so interesting, and the shifting perspectives on the main cast help keep it feeling distinct from what we’ve already seen. It’s not just more of the same. And the show still offers plenty of what I want from a &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; story. There are terrifying monsters (including a particularly unsettling vampire in the first episode), at least one sad death, and that very &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt;-specific kind of tragedy that makes you feel bad when a giant bug monster is murdered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnRo0I"&gt;But the bits it’s missing prove to be very important. &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; is full of political intrigue and fantasy drama, but a core part of the appeal is also all of the sex and jokes. Season 2 is missing both. We still have Geralt’s sarcastic, dry quips, but I definitely realized how important Jaskier’s comedic relief was once it was almost entirely gone. It’s cool to see a new side of the character, but I wish he didn’t take all of the jokes along with him. Likewise, for a franchise where virtually every iteration — from the video game to the anime to the live-action series — is closely linked with an image of a buff man in a bath, it’s remarkable how sexless this season is. &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; is one of the rare dark fantasy stories where the sex is fun and joyful, rather than frequently tied to violence and rape. Now it’s virtually non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="eoDJzQ"&gt;Don’t get me wrong: I still binged through the season incredibly quickly because I just had to see what happened next. The second season has great momentum that keeps it moving forward, along with an even more well-rounded cast than before. But it also felt like the show was slowly moving away from much of what made it so distinct. I love watching Geralt slice apart monsters and accidentally get caught up in political turmoil as much as anyone. But a few laughs along the way would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="929wse"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Witcher &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;season 2 debuts on Netflix on December 17th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Game dev known for cursing at The Game Awards curses at The Game Awards while winning game awards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gw-MfWEJ0WMr9Wl3B_9EHIpqKi8=/157x0:1756x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70253305/2021_12_09__31_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gv2xA8"&gt;Josef Fares is known for making award-winning co-op gaming experiences. He’s also known for showing up at The Game Awards and dropping some well-placed f-bombs. Tonight, Fares followed up his famous 2017 “&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/7/16749886/a-way-out-josef-fares-rant-game-awards-tga-2017"&gt;Fuck the Oscars”&lt;/a&gt; rant with an equally passionate and expletive-sprinkled acceptance speech for the Game of the Year award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaoTwi"&gt;This time, Fares wasn’t on an awkward tear about the Oscars, but both of his f-bombs were in reference to the moment that cemented him for all time in the Game Awards Hall of Fame. After arriving on stage to accept the award and make his speech, Fares recalled the journey from his 2017 moment to now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3aDMS"&gt;“I was up on that stage, 2017 saying, ‘fuck the Oscars’ and now, actually in a way the Oscars got fucked because The Game Awards is getting way better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zHAFRR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Actually in a way the Oscars got fucked because the Game Awards is getting way better.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CinswZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Takes Two&lt;/em&gt; was nominated for several awards and won Best Family Game and Best Multiplayer Game in addition to Game of the Year. But since The Game Awards is one big industry trailer that sometimes masquerades as an awards show, the two wins were quickly announced and dismissed without Fares getting the opportunity to speak. At one point during the show it seemed that these rushed announcements were designed to keep Fares away from the mic. Host Geoff Keighley even jokingly mentioned not wanting Fares near one in case he were to make a foul-mouthed repeat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jM6cu3"&gt;Fares would have had a lot to curse about, too. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-12-03-josef-fares-it-takes-two-hit-by-take-two-trademark-claim"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; his company Hazelight Studios was hit with a trademark claim from &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; publisher Take-Two Interactive and was subsequently forced to abandon ownership of the &lt;em&gt;It Takes Two&lt;/em&gt; name, ostensibly because it contains the words “take” and “two” together. The  needlessly aggressive move would have been ripe for Fares’ ire, but his actual acceptance speech was heartfelt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wx3kC3"&gt;He thanked his team for the work on what was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352157/it-takes-two-interview-developer-josef-fares-hazelight-studio-co-op"&gt;a phenomenal co-op experience&lt;/a&gt;, even if the story missed the mark with its messaging. Fares closed his speech by dedicating the award to his children saying, “If you don’t have children, go get them. They’re the best thing that can happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKfBY6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The biggest news and trailers from the 2021 Game Awards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Game Awards 2019 - Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/maGNWgtpxIGB6uNllPMoabsS8OM=/0x0:3718x2479/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70253238/1193629356.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JC Olivera/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Another busy night&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6jd0ed"&gt;It’s that time of the year: The Game Awards, a three hour-long event where the awards take backstage to trailers and reveals. This year’s show was a busy one, with news covering everything from &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;. We even got a new &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt;. Also, Sting was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyPPm5"&gt;If you weren’t able to catch the show live, here are all the biggest announcements you missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AA01Xk"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Unreal_Engine_5_Keanu|104877" data-volume-uuid="4900396db" data-volume-id="104877" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-419" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0cRFWc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22589143"&gt;Explore the Matrix in Unreal Engine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PkLpdh"&gt;Epic’s latest demo for Unreal Engine 5 isn’t just a pretty cinematic, but rather an interactive feature you can download for free right now on a PlayStation 5. Even better, it’s a chance to explore the cyberpunk world of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; ahead of the fourth movie’s release later this month — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22587160"&gt;which we just so happened to get a fresh look at tonight&lt;/a&gt;, as well. For even more, be sure to check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22589143"&gt;our interview with Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="alan wake 2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oRmmLxSy4mBvwtfaC_PYnWBgy_s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23077773/51736398821_1e22d8526d_h.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WUKhmS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22591266"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alan Wake 2&lt;/em&gt; moves the series into survival horror&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ykT7ws"&gt;One of the biggest surprises was that Alan Wake is getting a sequel. We don’t know much about it, but creative director Sam Lake says the series will be moving in a survival horror direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2laa9W"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Silent Hill&lt;/em&gt; creator returns with &lt;em&gt;Slitterhead&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="03kyM9"&gt;Bokeh Game Studio, a team led by &lt;em&gt;Silent Hill&lt;/em&gt; creator Keiichiro Toyama, teased an extremely creepy new game with the equally creepy title &lt;em&gt;Slitterhead&lt;/em&gt;. It’s so creepy I can’t embed the trailer — check it out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyUGYL9aSww"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OaVZgd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D8YkCHkWRyk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YRRasP"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; still looks incredible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1cGCm1"&gt;We’ve already seen plenty of &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774836/elden-ring-fromsoftware-hands-on-preview"&gt;and even played a little bit of it&lt;/a&gt; — but that doesn’t mean we don’t want to keep watching trailers. The latest is more focused on story than gameplay, and makes the wait for the game’s February launch that much harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="2gFccq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22590627"&gt;A proper look at the &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yR4MlD"&gt;It’s been a long time since Rocksteady — the studio best-known for the &lt;em&gt;Arkham&lt;/em&gt; series of Batman games — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21376280/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-game-trailer-rocksteady"&gt;revealed that it was working on a &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; title&lt;/a&gt;, but we got a fresh look at &lt;em&gt;Kill the Justice League&lt;/em&gt; thanks to a new trailer. The game is expected to launch in 2022, making it Rocksteady’s first new game in nearly seven years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DvumgM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dyA8lnp9Tzg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lRuf70"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22591202"&gt;Wonder Woman is getting her own game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NbasQI"&gt;In other DC news, Monolith Productions — the team behind &lt;em&gt;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&lt;/em&gt; — is making a Wonder Woman game. It’ll be a third-person action game with that will make use of &lt;em&gt;Mordor&lt;/em&gt;’s famed “nemesis system.” No word yet on release date or platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KQatvU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22591275"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; is finally coming to PC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Frvi7Z"&gt;The formerly PlayStation-exclusive remake of classic &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII &lt;/em&gt;is now coming to PCs — and it’s coming soon. The port will be out on December 16th, and it’ll be the enhanced &lt;em&gt;Intergrade&lt;/em&gt; version that previously graced the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="niQIAA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4cJpiOPKH14?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="co3bQE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22591219"&gt;Quantic Dream is making a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ziRO2m"&gt;Quantic Dream, the studio behind the, let’s say, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/24/17387248/detroit-become-human-review-ps4"&gt;questionable game &lt;em&gt;Detroit: Become Human&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is now making a title based in the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe. It’s called Eclipse, is set during the High Republic era, and is described as “an intricately branching action-adventure game that can be experienced in many ways, and puts the destinies of multiple playable characters in your hands.” No word on a release window or platforms yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wGFDzo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WZ2v5eMlcrY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0L6IQn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22590847"&gt;A new trailer for the live-action &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dW8UJV"&gt;While everyone is hooked on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there’s another big addition to the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; universe coming as well. At the Game Awards we got our first real look at the live-action &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; TV show that’s coming to Paramount Plus early next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5tqNhL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L_7U8MwE64M?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Foukyt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22590118"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is coming to VR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BxVne1"&gt;You can already play social deduction hit &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; on a big range of platforms, but its next release offers something different: virtual reality. The new version is being developed by VR studio Schell Games (&lt;em&gt;I Expect You to Die&lt;/em&gt;) and will shift the experience from a cute 2D game to a first-person, 3D experience. No word on a release date, but it’s coming to Meta Quest, PlayStation VR, and Steam VR headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ulUJA5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22591078"&gt;Google Play games are coming to PC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="OgKr6P"&gt;In a surprise announcement, Google teased a new tool that will make it possible to play Android games from Google Play on a PC. We don’t have many details yet, but it’s expected to be available in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WxEzMm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I9nrRmnOJho?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0bBtPt"&gt;A double dose of Sonic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G1LzcM"&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22590848"&gt;the surprise reveal&lt;/a&gt; of a new “open zone” game called &lt;em&gt;Sonic Frontiers&lt;/em&gt;, the latest attempt to make a good 3D &lt;em&gt;Sonic The Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt;, we also got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22590755"&gt;a glimpse at the sequel to the live-action &lt;em&gt;Sonic&lt;/em&gt; movie from 2020&lt;/a&gt; — including the first look (and listen) of Idris Elba as Knuckles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S4Cbc1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OnttuBpqI_4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ItSGxp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22589218"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune: Spice Wars&lt;/em&gt; is an RTS spinoff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="krldC2"&gt;The world of&lt;em&gt; Dune&lt;/em&gt; is set to expand with Spice Wars, a real-time strategy game from developer Shiro Games that’s slated to launch in early access on PC in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gzVhNi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fukYzbthEVU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oJ1SHm"&gt;A long, uncomfortable trailer for &lt;em&gt;Hellblade 2&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="RFDHKY"&gt;The sequel to &lt;em&gt;Hellblade&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16117978/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review-ps4-pc"&gt;a terrifying game about madness&lt;/a&gt; — looks bigger in just about every way, from the world you’ll be running through to the creepy monsters you’ll take on. In short, it looks terrifying, but you can get a good feel for the experience with this lengthy new trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4W2A8rRc4cO3jc9mXQQKdVOyjj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060462/cuphead_dlc_screenshot_1080_2.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SRwqm7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22580829"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cuphead&lt;/em&gt;’s expansion makes a fresh appearance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3zNdGU"&gt;It’s been a long time since we’ve heard from Studio MDHR about &lt;em&gt;The Delicious Last Course&lt;/em&gt;, a big expansion coming to run-and-gun platformer &lt;em&gt;Cuphead&lt;/em&gt;. Now we not only have a fresh look, but a release date: the DLC will be available on June 30th, 2022 on all platforms that &lt;em&gt;Cuphead&lt;/em&gt; is on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GTM8HH24M6gIOA365dy_y4LCrOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060499/Diana_Capture_1.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HtOQf2"&gt;Another chill &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; album&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bp6jd8"&gt;This summer Riot released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22558085/riot-league-of-legends-sessions-lo-fi-chill-music-apple-spotify-youtube"&gt;an extremely chill album&lt;/a&gt; full of copyright-free music designed specifically for streamers. Now it’s released its second, based on &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; character Diana, which features 43 tracks composed by 25 different artists. It’s available to stream now on services like Spotify and Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wNcpW7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22585261"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; is now free-to-play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bS290E"&gt;Years after its initial release, the genre-defining battle royale &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; is finally going free to play.  The change puts the game on even footing with contemporaries like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; (along with the mobile spinoffs &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt;) and should go a long way towards keeping the game’s competitive scene alive for the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SiWthW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22590872"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; gets a Telltale-style adventure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="z7MDBz"&gt;Dramatic Labs, a new studio made up of veterans from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17934166/telltale-games-studio-closed-layoffs-end-the-walking-dead"&gt;ill-fated adventure game developer Telltale&lt;/a&gt;, is using that same choose-your-own-adventure format for an upcoming Star trek game. It’s called &lt;em&gt;Resurgence&lt;/em&gt;, and the studio says it tells an all-new story set not long after the events of &lt;em&gt;The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt;. It’s due to launch next spring on Xbox, PlayStation, and the Epic Games Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vFIf0F"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/13h1mxJUZjc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CwtENV"&gt;...and Telltale is making an&lt;em&gt; Expanse&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="EnqXks"&gt;Meanwhile, the revived version of Telltale is also working on a sci-fi title, with a new series based on &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;. It’s billed as a prequel to the Amazon Prime series, and is being co-developed by &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; studio Deck Nine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kVEhBb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PH2WP4G-WhY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VOKGRo"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Thirsty Suitors&lt;/em&gt; has strong &lt;em&gt;Scott Pilgrim&lt;/em&gt; vibes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7E9Q8z"&gt;The latest release from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/11/18306140/falcon-age-game-ps4-psvr-outerloop-vr-virtual-reality"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Falcon Age&lt;/em&gt; developer Outerloop Games&lt;/a&gt; is called &lt;em&gt;Thirsty Suitors&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s described as “a narrative action-adventure game that grapples with themes of complex family dynamics, navigating difficult relationships, and discovering one’s true self.” It also has some strong &lt;em&gt;Scott Pilgrim&lt;/em&gt; vibes with fights against exes, along with some &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk-&lt;/em&gt;style skateboarding. The Annapurna-published game is listed as “coming soon” for PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d8qqox"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ioxlKDOYOcM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QbktSS"&gt;Release dates for &lt;em&gt;Tunic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CrossfireX,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lost Ark&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="7swbUm"&gt;Nestled amongst all of the trailers and reveals were a few newly announced release dates. The adorable &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt;-like &lt;em&gt;Tunic&lt;/em&gt; is coming out on March 16th for the Xbox and PC — and we also got a charming new trailer to go along with the date. &lt;em&gt;CrossfireX&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21334562/crossfirex-remedy-trailer-xbox-one-series-x-smilegate-fps"&gt;the upcoming Xbox shooter that’s a collaboration between Smilegate and Remedy&lt;/a&gt;, will debut on February 8th. (While Smilegate developed the multiplayer portion, Remedy handled the single-player campaign.) Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;Lost Ark&lt;/em&gt;, an MMO published by Amazon, will be available on February 11th on Steam.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Neo visits his past in new Matrix Resurrections clip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kf04jqlNEoqvYoo8XGsi1OobeRo=/120x0:1316x797/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70253223/_0_52_screenshot.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warner Bros.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HSFxcL"&gt;A new clip for &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; debuted at The Game Awards Thursday evening. In &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlDr6aKBtFg"&gt;the clip&lt;/a&gt;, Keanu Reeves’ Neo and a blue-haired character played by Jessica Henwick walk through a door to board a train heading to Tokyo. But then, they go through &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; door to enter a mysterious room where a clip from the first movie is being played. Yes, in the new movie. I’m intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WU7n7I"&gt;The new clip is the latest in a string of trailers Warner Bros. has already released for the upcoming movie, which will release in theaters and on HBO Max on December 22nd. In one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820636/the-matrix-resurrections-trailer-neo-trinity-keanu-reeves-deja-vu-loop"&gt;released this week&lt;/a&gt;, Neo remarks that “I still know kung fu,” which is something I also definitely say every day when I wake up. That trailer also features a cameo from The Game Awards’ trophy, as teased by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1467975028247449601"&gt;host Geoff Keighley&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WyuwnX"&gt;

&lt;p id="rmFQDD"&gt;A trailer released last week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812697/new-matrix-resurrections-trailer-warner-bros-keanu-reeves"&gt;was all about change&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22640826/matrix-4-trailer-resurrections-release-date"&gt;the first&lt;/a&gt; is personally still my favorite — backed by a sweeping rendition of “White Rabbit” by Jefferson Airplane, it’s packed full of nostalgic references to the original trilogy and hints of the epic action to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEHnjU"&gt;The Game Awards also featured the launch of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820392/the-matrix-awakens-epic-games-tech-demo-unreal-engine-5"&gt;an interactive &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; experience created in Unreal Engine 5&lt;/a&gt;. We got to speak to Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who plays Trinity, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22825102/keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss-interview-matrix-awakens-epic-games"&gt;to talk about &lt;em&gt;Awakens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="FEwwOO"&gt;“How do we know what is real?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MB1Z4I"&gt;It’s a telling question asked by a seemingly real-life Keanu Reeves early on in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820392/the-matrix-awakens-epic-games-tech-demo-unreal-engine-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a playable tech demo built in the new Unreal Engine 5 by Epic Games. Premiered at this year’s Game Awards, the interactive experience stars Reeves along with &lt;em&gt;Matrix &lt;/em&gt;co-star Carrie-Anne Moss and was written by Lana Wachowski, the co-writer/director of the original &lt;em&gt;The Matrix &lt;/em&gt;trilogy and director of the upcoming sequel. It’s available starting Thursday to play for free on the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5exaq"&gt;In an exclusive interview, Reeves and Moss talked with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;about making the Epic demo, how technology is blurring the line between what’s real and virtual, and what to expect from the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; movie. Reeves also revealed that he thinks there should be a modern &lt;em&gt;Matrix &lt;/em&gt;video game, that he’s flattered by &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;players &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253112/cyberpunk-2077-keanu-reeves-sex-mod-ban"&gt;modding the game&lt;/a&gt; to have sex with his character, and why he thinks Facebook shouldn’t co-opt the metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDBQGF"&gt;Apart from serving as a clever promotion vehicle for the new &lt;em&gt;Matrix &lt;/em&gt;movie premiering December 22nd, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens &lt;/em&gt;is designed to showcase what’s possible with the next major version of Epic’s Unreal Engine coming next year. It’s structured as a scripted intro by Wachowski, followed by a playable car chase scene and then an open-world sandbox experience you can navigate as one of Epic’s metahuman characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="DOhoRP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We really believe strongly in big, massive open worlds not just for games”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2mGe1K"&gt;A big reason for doing the demo is to demonstrate how Epic thinks its technology can be used to blend scripted storytelling with games and much more, according to Epic CTO Kim Libreri, who worked on the special effects for the original &lt;em&gt;Matrix &lt;/em&gt;trilogy. “We really believe strongly in big, massive open worlds not just for games,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “You want to be able to navigate massive, huge spaces just like you can in our world. So we’ve made that a lot easier to do in the engine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GotdG5"&gt;The main sandbox experience in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens &lt;/em&gt;isn’t a game as much as it’s a tech demo that Epic plans to release for developers to build on and replicate. Everything in the virtual city is fully loaded no matter where your character is located (rather than rendered only when the character gets near), down to the detail of a chain link fence in an alley. All of the moving vehicles, people, and lighting in the city are generated by AI, the latter of which Libreri describes as a breakthrough that means lighting is no longer “this sort of niche art form.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cI6EXk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“An industry with more crossover between all types of entertainment and experiences is a richer thing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IXCkQA"&gt;Thanks to updates coming to Unreal Engine, which powers everything from &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;to special effects in Disney’s &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian, &lt;/em&gt;developers will be able to use the same, hyper-realistic virtual assets across different experiences. It’s part of Epic’s goal to help build the metaverse. Libreri imagines a carmaker being able to load the same vehicle it creates for an internal simulation into a racing game or even a blockbuster movie. “I think an industry with more crossover between all types of entertainment and experiences is a richer thing.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The live-action Halo TV show looks extremely expensive in its newest trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a5YZ-Sad7KtVDw1GOwzG9lLDf6c=/346x0:2125x1186/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70253172/Screen_Shot_2021_12_09_at_10.39.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tduZhL"&gt;After a short teaser last month, Paramount Plus has debuted the first full trailer for the upcoming live-action &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; TV series at the 2021 Game Awards, ahead of the show’s streaming debut in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7MZF4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; will star Pablo Schreiber (&lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt;) as the armored super-solider, while Jen Taylor will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21561137/halo-tv-show-cortana-recast-jen-taylor"&gt;reprise her role from the games&lt;/a&gt; as Master Chief’s AI companion, Cortana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xz59mh"&gt;The trailer still doesn’t give too much of an idea of what to expect from the show, which Paramount says “will take place in the universe” as the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; games and see humanity face off against the alien forces of the Covenant. But it’s still not clear whether &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;will be trying to adapt the games directly or tell its own story within the world of the franchise. The trailer itself mostly focuses on a few quick shots of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;’s cast, including Natascha McElhone as Dr. Catherine Halsey, the creator of both Cortana and the Spartan super-solider program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gLJI2F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The live-action Halo TV show on Paramount Plus gets its first brief teaser","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783546/halo-tv-show-paramount-plus-live-action-teaser-trailer"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tqWUWByWAAnTg1ay6Hp344geL78=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23077626/image2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gXhQTD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; was first announced back in 2018, and original set to air on Showtime. But after production was delayed following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the series was shifted to become a streaming exclusive on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299828/halo-tv-show-paramount-plus-exclusive-showtime-microsoft"&gt;recently relaunched Paramount Plus streaming service&lt;/a&gt;, where the popular franchise could help draw in new subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9W8fN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; is set to debut on Paramount Plus in 2022, although there’s still no precise release date. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Star Trek: Resurgence is a story-driven game from former Telltale devs coming in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="star trek" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5-CB48j1-0BolPoMy5kR97HCRgg=/102x0:999x598/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70253068/star_trek.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kUk3Xr"&gt;Hot on the heels of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/27/18243280/star-trek-discovery-season-3-renewed-cbs-all-access-michelle-paradise-new-showrunner"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21079004/star-trek-picard-review-cbs-all-access-patrick-stewart"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Picard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356280/star-trek-lower-decks-review-cbs-all-access"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lower Decks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; franchise is getting a new video game. Dramatic Labs, a brand new studio composed of former Telltale Games developers, announced during The Game Awards that it’s working on&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://startrek-resurgence.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Resurgence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a story-driven game reminiscent of Telltale’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/25/5931015/the-wolf-among-us-season-one-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wolf Among Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17896012/telltale-games-the-walking-dead-storytelling-gaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwtvQA"&gt;According to the game’s press release, &lt;em&gt;“Star Trek: Resurgence&lt;/em&gt; is an interactive narrative video game that tells an original story set in the era shortly after the events of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7j3SnY"&gt;Players will control two characters aboard the &lt;em&gt;U.S.S. RESOLUTE &lt;/em&gt;as they work to unravel a mystery in order to prevent a galactic war. Spock made an appearance in the announcement trailer and Dramatic Labs has confirmed players will get to meet other “new and returning characters through a variety of dialogue and action gameplay to determine the course of the story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykTqaI"&gt;Dramatic Labs was founded by Kevin Bruner, co-founder of Telltale Games and, according to some sources, part of the reason for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17130056/telltale-games-developer-layoffs-toxic-video-game-industry"&gt;Telltale’s disastrous end&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, Dramatic Labs became a home for over 20 former Telltale Games employees. &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Resurgence &lt;/em&gt;features Telltale’s lead writer, creative director, and cinematic director, which might signal the studio’s commitment to making the same kind of games Telltale was famous for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QInROp"&gt;As in previous Telltale games, player choice will drive the experience and affect the story’s outcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYlLwK"&gt;“As fans of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, it’s truly an honor to be crafting a story which puts players right in the heart of the action, where significant choices and decisions will affect the entire narrative,” said Bruner in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaDUET"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Resurgence&lt;/em&gt; launches in Spring 2022 for Xbox, PlayStation, and on the Epic Games Store exclusively for PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="siUXzM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iS6E8P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuBied"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqn64E"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsMVp5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is bringing Android games to Windows in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cpNMA3lxGFpsrxh7JrUv8vmnlSY=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70253062/ffT36Kl.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gw2uoz"&gt;Google is planning to bring Android games to Windows PCs next year. A Google Play Games app will be available in 2022, built by Google to allow games from Google Play to run on Windows laptops, tablets, and PCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ngvb4U"&gt;“Starting in 2022, players will be able to experience their favorite Google Play games on more devices: seamlessly switching between a phone, tablet, Chromebook, and soon, Windows PCs,” says Greg Hartrell, Google’s product director of games on Android and Google Play, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This Google built product brings the best of Google Play Games to more laptops and desktops, and we are thrilled to expand our platform for players to enjoy their favorite Android games even more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EgXmX"&gt;Google spokesperson Alex Garcia-Kummert tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company has built this app on its own, which means Google hasn’t partnered with Microsoft, BlueStacks, or others here. The upcoming app will also allow players to resume games on a desktop PC, after playing them on a phone, tablet, or Chromebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReSdal"&gt;For now, Google is simply teasing the app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22811940/game-awards-2021-how-to-watch-announcements-sting-gaming-youtube"&gt;during The Game Awards&lt;/a&gt; tonight, with a promised release window of sometime next year. It’s not yet clear what technology Google is using to emulate Android apps on Windows, but games will run locally instead of streaming from the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1ijuC"&gt;“This will be a native Windows app distributed by Google, which will support Windows 10 and up,” explains Hartrell. “It will not involve game streaming.” Google’s app won’t rely on any special integration with Windows 11, and the company will also distribute the app itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SbWLR7fj_eqqOsux2bAfSx2G4Pk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943049/android2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft is also bringing Android apps to Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Uzth3r"&gt;Google’s announcement comes months after Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736528/microsoft-android-apps-windows-11-test"&gt;started testing Android apps on Windows 11 PCs&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft has built an underlying Windows Subsystem for Android, which is capable of running Android apps from a variety of sources. The software giant has partnered with Amazon to let Windows users natively install games and apps from the Amazon Appstore, but native Google Play support won’t be available officially through Microsoft’s feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqAaPF"&gt;Since Microsoft is only officially partnered with Amazon for that feature, it has meant far fewer Android games and apps available for Windows 11 users to easily install than there might otherwise be. The door is open for Google, BlueStacks, and others to fill that hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFjsuG"&gt;While Microsoft, and now Google, work on bringing Android apps and games to Windows, BlueStacks has gone a step further and is now bringing Android games to web browsers. BlueStacks X is a free way to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701930/bluestacks-x-android-games-browser-free-cloud-gaming"&gt;play Android games in your browser&lt;/a&gt;, and BlueStacks has been focused on Android gaming on Windows since it became the predominant use case for its main app in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLg4Zw"&gt;Details on Google’s plans for Android apps on Windows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22631907/google-gaming-vision-android-windows-mac-cross-screen-controller"&gt;first appeared in a document from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. Dated October 2020, the 70-page document described an ambitious effort to get Android games on Macs and Windows PCs. The document revealed Google would first bring “emulated, native and streamed games” to Windows, and at least part of that effort is starting in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After a lengthy wait, Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad finally has a gameplay trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Suicide Squad" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yz7QWmYwBjt3WgyS4iFb3gi9sjs=/702x0:5954x3501/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70253035/Suicide_Squad_Rain_Team.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fQ13Se"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new game from &lt;em&gt;Batman: Arkham&lt;/em&gt; developer Rocksteady Studios, released its first gameplay trailer and it is &lt;em&gt;explosive&lt;/em&gt;. The video got an amazing introduction (and Geoff Keighley got an earful) from renowned actress and all-around badass Debra Wilson in her role as Suicide Squad overlord Amanda “The Wall” Waller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaJpR1"&gt;From the trailer, it seems you’ll be able to play as multiple members of DC’s maladjusted band of villainous misfits, including Deadshot, King Shark, and fan-favorite Harley Quinn in an squad-based action fighter akin to Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BtULDm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/7/21358467/suicide-squad-game-rocksteady-dc-fandome-announcement-ps5-xbox-one-pc"&gt;Rumors of a &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt; began this summer and were confirmed in August during DC Comic’s fan-event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22729057/biggest-announcements-dc-fandome-batman-black-adam-hbo-warner"&gt;FanDome&lt;/a&gt;. On December 8th, Sefton Hill, co founder of Rocksteady Studios, teased a gameplay trailer would drop during the Game Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yjoNPd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Holy Sh*t - Here’s your first taste of gameplay for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuicideSquadGame?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SuicideSquadGame&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGameAwards?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TheGameAwards&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/criOypPj5L"&gt;pic.twitter.com/criOypPj5L&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League (@suicidesquadRS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1469136019089858561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cw7sHp"&gt;This is the newest Rocksteady Studios game in five years, and the London-based developer has an impressive track record making games in the DC Comics universe. Rocksteady’s &lt;em&gt;Batman: Arkham&lt;/em&gt; series has been generally well-received, with 2011’s &lt;em&gt;Batman: Arkham City&lt;/em&gt; earning several game of the year awards across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSdrly"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have an official release date beyond sometime in 2022, but it will be available on next-gen Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.&lt;/p&gt;
