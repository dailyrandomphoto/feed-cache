    <title>Today I learned about Intel’s AI sliders that filter online gaming abuse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Srsk3mJEKw11WHCsEEE8eqtpxpc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69093965/msedge_ophDP9qyMx.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://youtu.be/97Qhj299zRM?t=1644" target="_blank"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FUFOLe"&gt;Last month &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/97Qhj299zRM?t=1644"&gt;during its virtual GDC presentation&lt;/a&gt; Intel announced &lt;a href="https://devmesh.intel.com/projects/bleep#about-section"&gt;Bleep&lt;/a&gt;, a new AI-powered tool that it hopes will cut down on the amount of toxicity gamers have to experience in voice chat. According to Intel, the app “uses AI to detect and redact audio based on user preferences.” The filter works on incoming audio, acting as an additional user-controlled layer of moderation on top of what a platform or service already offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEHhCk"&gt;It’s a noble effort, but there’s something bleakly funny about Bleep’s interface, which lists in minute detail all of the different categories of abuse that people might encounter online, paired with sliders to control the quantity of mistreatment users want to hear. Categories range anywhere from “Aggression” to “LGBTQ+ Hate,” “Misogyny,” “Racism and Xenophobia,” and “White nationalism.” There’s even a toggle for the N-word. &lt;a href="https://devmesh.intel.com/projects/bleep#about-section"&gt;Bleep’s page&lt;/a&gt; notes that it’s yet to enter public beta, so all of this is subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YhER0lJ2LKfbpFL5SSF9BeDj5Fw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429051/msedge_ophDP9qyMx.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Credit: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://youtu.be/97Qhj299zRM?t=1644" target="_blank"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Filters include “Aggression,” “Misogyny” ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wHopaekTjH1DkWP6EekTltegSRE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429058/msedge_oBvZK8eSRw.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://youtu.be/97Qhj299zRM?t=1644" target="_blank"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;... and a toggle for the “N-word.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8E9euJ"&gt;With the majority of these categories, Bleep appears to give users a choice: would you like none, some, most, or all of this offensive language to be filtered out? Like choosing from a buffet of toxic internet slurry, Intel’s interface gives players the option of sprinkling in a light serving of aggression or name-calling into their online gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnFT2p"&gt;Bleep has been in the works for a couple of years now — &lt;a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/old-news/120177/intel-levels-up-ai-to-battle-toxicity-in-online-games"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that Intel talked about this initiative way back at GDC 2019 — and it’s working with AI moderation specialists &lt;a href="https://www.spiritai.com/"&gt;Spirit AI&lt;/a&gt; on the software. But moderating online spaces using artificial intelligence &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/27/18242724/facebook-moderation-ai-artificial-intelligence-platforms"&gt;is no easy feat&lt;/a&gt; as platforms like Facebook and YouTube have shown. Although automated systems can identify straightforwardly offensive words, they often fail to consider the context and nuance of certain insults and threats. Online toxicity comes in many, constantly evolving forms that can be difficult for even the most advanced AI moderation systems to spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bB9Y78"&gt;“While we recognize that solutions like Bleep don’t erase the problem, we believe it’s a step in the right direction, giving gamers a tool to control their experience,” Intel’s Roger Chandler said during its GDC demonstration. Intel says it hopes to release Bleep later this year, and adds that the technology relies on its hardware accelerated AI speech detection, suggesting that the software may rely on Intel hardware to run. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook hopes tiny labels on posts will stop users confusing satire with reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wsvt337l-lvq2ewNU4Okrs8dI2w=/0x107:3800x2640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69093953/facebook_satire_pages.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Satire pages will now be labelled as such, along with public officials, fan pages, and government news outlets. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LQzkML"&gt;Facebook is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1379887135998763014?s=20"&gt;adding&lt;/a&gt; additional labels to posts from Pages that appear in users’ News Feeds in a bid to reduce confusion about their origin. These labels will include “public official,” “fan page,” and “satire page.” The company says it’s already started testing the deployment of these labels in the US, and will gradually add them to more posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etyjIU"&gt;Facebook hasn’t offered any explanation as to why it’s adding these labels, but identifying satire seems particularly important. Take a look at the social shares for any news articles written by well-known satirical sites like &lt;em&gt;The Onion&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Babylon Bee&lt;/em&gt; and you’ll find plenty of people taking these stories at face value. In such a context these posts are essentially a type of misinformation, even if their creators did not intend this. Even high profile figures like former president Donald Trump have &lt;a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/16/donald-trump-tweets-babylon-bees-satirical-news-story-joe-biden/3676071001/"&gt;mistaken these stories&lt;/a&gt; for real reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RGADcf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting today in the US, we’re testing a way to give people more context about the Pages they see. We’ll gradually start applying labels including 'public official,' 'fan page' or 'satire page' to posts in News Feed, so people can better understand who they’re coming from. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Bloc3b2ycb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Bloc3b2ycb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Facebook Newsroom (@fbnewsroom) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1379887135998763014?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YLFAzJ"&gt;This isn’t the first time the social network giant has tried to make the context of posts in the News Feed clearer. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280542/facebook-state-controlled-media-account-post-label-election-interference-ads-rt"&gt;June last year&lt;/a&gt; it began labeling media outlets which are “wholly or partially under the editorial control of their government.” Such outlets need labels, argued Facebook, because “they combine the influence of a media organization with the strategic backing of a state, and we believe people should know if the news they read is coming from a publication that may be under the influence of a government.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Global chip shortage hits iPad and MacBook production, says report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-mmOHzE302gzu7oYjA3qcwZvYk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69093923/DSC01948.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LWGPCr"&gt;Apple has not been spared the effects of the ongoing global component shortage, according to a &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/MacBook-and-iPad-production-delayed-as-supply-crunch-hits-Apple"&gt;new report in &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The publication says that some production of MacBooks and iPads has been delayed, with “a portion of component orders” pushed back to the second half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORd6Hb"&gt;The issue with MacBooks is said to be related to the ability to mount certain components on circuit boards ahead of the device’s assembly. Delayed iPad production, meanwhile, is apparently because of a shortage of displays and display components. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-05/why-shortages-of-a-1-chip-sparked-crisis-in-the-global-economy"&gt;Bloomberg reported earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; on how the squeezed supply of display drivers is causing a bottleneck across the entire tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lgUF4D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"When will the global chip shortage end so you can finally buy a PS5?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Msa7vE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; didn’t state which MacBook or iPad models would be affected, nor whether the postponed production was for existing devices or yet-to-be-announced updates. Apple is widely expected to launch new versions of the iPad Pro this year, as well as continuing the transition to deploying its own processors across the entire Mac line. Analyst Ming-chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-12-9-inch-mini-led-ipad-pro-production/"&gt;recently said&lt;/a&gt; that a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a Mini LED display would go into mass production this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O13ILA"&gt;iPhone production is said to be unaffected so far, though two sources described component supply as “quite tight.” Nikkei says the shortage “remains a supply chain issue for Apple and has not yet had an impact on product availability.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG promises three years of Android updates despite exiting phone business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xg_9SXZAeVD1MDVg6yYwvs584nY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69093401/cwelch_200218_3910_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wWVwYo"&gt;LG has &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/04/lg-announces-three-year-pledge-for-os-updates/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a pledge to issue future Android OS updates to many of its smartphones despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;confirming&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that it’ll be leaving the phone business altogether. The Velvet, Wing, and G- and V- series phones from 2019 or later should be getting three Android updates from their year of release, and “certain 2020 models such as LG Stylo and K series” will get two updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="smp96y"&gt;For example, the Velvet came out last year with Android 10, and its Android 11 rollout is currently in progress. That means that it should also be getting Android 12 and 13 at some point, assuming Google continues its yearly cadence. LG variously describes this announcement as a “three-year pledge” and a “three-OS-update guarantee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="V57Clk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"LG had few smartphone hits, but it’ll still be missed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22367903/lg-smartphone-retrospective-hits-misses"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ivrwNz"&gt;The announcement is a little surprising because LG phones generally wouldn’t have been expected to get that many updates even while LG was actually in the phone business. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/12/17228306/lg-android-software-upgrade-center-research-development"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a dedicated “Software Upgrade Center” in 2018, but little to nothing changed about its Android update situation. Most of its latest premium phones aren’t scheduled to receive Android 11 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327144/lg-android-11-software-update-wing-phones-mobile-q4-2021"&gt;until the end of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7CexS"&gt;Earlier this week, LG’s Korean website &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368129/lg-phones-android-12-update-security"&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt; that some selected models would also get an Android 12 update.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook isn’t planning to tell you if you’re one of the 533 million people whose data leaked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3SHg10IOxJm9wFwO4um11C8cUMQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69093247/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ScdLmq"&gt;Facebook is responding to the recent news that data from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366822/facebook-personal-data-533-million-leaks-online-email-phone-numbers"&gt;533 million accounts leaked online for free&lt;/a&gt;, but perhaps not in the way users might have hoped: the company doesn’t plan to notify the users whose data was exposed online, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-data-leak-idUSKBN2BU2ZY"&gt;a Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtrngL"&gt;In the dataset, there’s apparently a lot of information that you might not want floating around the internet — including birthdays, locations, full names, and phone numbers — so it’s disappointing to hear that Facebook doesn’t plan to notify users that might be affected. The company cited two reasons to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; as to why it’s not telling users proactively: it says it’s not confident it would know which users would need to be notified, and that users wouldn’t be able to do anything about the data being online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qgEHy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/facts-on-news-reports-about-facebook-data/"&gt;On Tuesday Facebook wrote on its blog&lt;/a&gt; that it “believes” the data was scraped via its contact importer sometime before September 2019, a method that’s in violation of the company’s policies. But as &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; reporter Ryan Mac points out, this doesn’t quite mesh with the fact that the company hasn't spoken out or filed lawsuits against &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223349/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-law-enforcement-capitol-rioters"&gt;controversial surveillance company Clearview AI&lt;/a&gt; for scraping photos from Instagram and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TEb8xg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Over the last year, I have asked Facebook more than a dozen times if it will take legal action against Clearview AI for scraping what is likely millions of photos from Instagram and Facebook. No lawsuits have been filed and FB has said nothing on record.&lt;a href="https://t.co/htkKCD5bT0"&gt;https://t.co/htkKCD5bT0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Mac  (@RMac18) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1379921359858364416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4PGuC2"&gt;Facebook says it has “made changes to the contact importer” to stop the scraping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s6RfIj"&gt;If you’re concerned about whether or not your data was included in the data dump, and don't want to wait to see if Facebook will change its mind about notifying users, you can take a look at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22367727/facebook-data-breach-haveibeenpwned"&gt;our guide on how to see if you were affected&lt;/a&gt;. And for more about the data set and Facebook‘s lack of transparency around it, you should &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-data-leak-500-million-users-phone-numbers/"&gt;read &lt;em&gt;Wired’s&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; about the company’s inconsistent messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lTVJn"&gt;Facebook has not responded to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD inexplicably threw scalpers a bone with limited-edition Radeon RX 6800 XT  ‘Midnight Black’ GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fqREG8F_kfkoUMfhY6XRZS1FapI=/98x0:1162x709/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69092745/762922_amd_radeon_rx_6800xt_black_box_1260x709.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K8DRQa"&gt;Because the world desperately needed another GPU people can’t actually buy, AMD decided to release &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/5496921500/us"&gt;a limited-edition “Midnight Black” version&lt;/a&gt; of its Radeon RX 6800 XT early Wednesday morning, where it sold out before most people even saw the card was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3r2ZJo"&gt;You might be thinking: “Why would you release a limited-edition version of something that’s practically a collector’s piece even without a new coat of paint?” (AMD’s recent GPUs are even rarer than Nvidia’s, though both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;currently command two to three times their retail price on eBay&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4jny1"&gt;Or you might be thinking: “When, exactly, did AMD announce a new GPU? I don’t remember that.” That’s because the company didn’t formally announce it: &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-to-launch-radeon-rx-6800-xt-midnight-black-today"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;VideoCardz&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; AMD quietly told its “AMD Red Team community” fanbase by email at around midnight that they should watch for the card at 6AM PT, an announcement that did not stay under wraps, to put it mildly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rAm3rPDSFMR2uJ6ewq7msFeOPg4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22428246/amd_midnight_black_rx_6800_xt_radeon_gpu.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AAEcTL"&gt;Personally, I’m just wondering: If AMD actually wanted to put video cards in the hands of its fans, why not verify their emails, or email out unique, non-transferrable passwords, or raffle them off, or do basically anything other than put them on &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/us"&gt;the same website&lt;/a&gt; where bots, scalpers, and everyone else already knows to look — a website that some people have their browser set to refresh all day long? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DD9cGJ"&gt;There does seem to have been a special “Red Team link,” but a bunch of would-be buyers reported it didn’t work — while a few others claimed they were able to buy one on the main store page by hammering the refresh button or by using a Javascript shortcut to trick the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wdDdvB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GameOnAMD?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GameOnAMD&lt;/a&gt; Sums up the experience. Red Team link was to a page you can't buy from, only way I saw was from main store, and add to cart never worked. Cool. I feel so included in this exclusive offer. &lt;a href="https://t.co/YomensLwQY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YomensLwQY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jon VR Viking (@Bounty_V) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bounty_V/status/1379794620628996100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xPCP93"&gt;There are potential solutions to these issues, but the gaming industry &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;does not seem to be terribly interested in finding them&lt;/a&gt;. Still, gotta give credit to AMD for selling it at the original retail price of $649 instead of charging more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BWDCxZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The gaming industry keeps failing miserably at selling its most important products","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mkJ5e0"&gt;It’s not clear how many Midnight Black cards were produced; at press time, two buyers were &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2380057.m570.l1313%26_nkw%3Dmdnight%2Bblack%2B6800%26_sacat%3D0&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F7%2F22372721%2Famd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-midnight-black-ebay-scalpers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;trying to hawk their confirmed orders on eBay&lt;/a&gt;, while a third had pulled their listing due to an unspecified error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bne4L4"&gt;AMD tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;it’s “continuing to focus on delivering the latest Radeon graphics cards to as many gamers as possible at SEP,” and counts the brief appearance of the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT Midnight Black as part of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lm3fGi"&gt;“We continue to make reference cards available on AMD.com and will continue to replenish supply for the foreseeable future,” the company says, something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/3/17/22334662/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review-gpu-graphics-card"&gt;it had not managed to do the last time I wrote about a similar claim.&lt;/a&gt; Since then, however, AMD has (very briefly) delivered supplies of GPUs at least three times that I’m aware of. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valkyrae and CouRage are now co-owners of 100 Thieves</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rq2duVlJsdWxMVQsYVfaxAWxVXM=/0x96:7175x4879/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69092586/odWuZrk_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: 100 Thieves&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eeUSpN"&gt;100 Thieves, a popular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20849569/100-thieves-nadeshot-esports-supreme-drake"&gt;esports organization and lifestyle brand&lt;/a&gt;, announced that two of its biggest content creators, Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter and Jack “CouRage” Dunlop, will now be co-owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEq4Vs"&gt;“As a streamer and former pro-player myself, I always wanted 100 Thieves to be an organization guided by and built to be a platform for content creators,” Haag said in a statement. “Rae and Jack have been with us since 2018 and 2019, respectively, and are significant contributors to 100 Thieves. They deserve recognition for what they’ve done for the company to date - and we want their strategic input on what we can all do together in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfw4co"&gt;Hofstetter and Dunlop join 100 Thieves founder and CEO Matthew “Nadeshot” Haag, rapper Drake, music industry talent manager Scooter Braun, and Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert in the ownership group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SLKowN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fv8EP7pTk0w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3A4FVB"&gt;Hofstetter joined 100 Thieves in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMABPt6RlG8"&gt;October 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and has become a fixture in 100 Thieves’ content and on YouTube, where she has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWxlUwW9BgGISaakjGM37aw"&gt;3.3 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. She left Twitch to exclusively stream on the Google-owned video platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063683/valkyrae-twitch-youtube-100-thieves"&gt;in January 2020&lt;/a&gt; (though appeared on Twitch as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370078/jimmy-fallon-twitch-stream-among-us-stranger-things"&gt;Jimmy Fallon’s debut stream&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K7936c"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Happy to announce that I am officially a co-owner of 100 Thieves!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its been almost 3 years since I joined the team and I would have never expected this path to lead to this..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m proud to be one of the first women co-owners in esports and beyond excited for our future together! &lt;a href="https://t.co/hb5uxI8rea"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hb5uxI8rea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— rae ☀️ (@Valkyrae) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Valkyrae/status/1379883273506091008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="daa1JB"&gt;Dunlop became a part of 100 Thieves &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/f-vWpXV7J50"&gt;in May 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and like Hofstetter, has become one of the most recognizable faces of the organization. He also defected from Twitch to exclusively stream on YouTube, and did so even sooner than Hofstetter, making the move in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948315/twitch-jack-courage-dunlop-youtube-live-exclusive-deal-fortnite-100-thieves"&gt;November 2019&lt;/a&gt;. He has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CouRageTheGamer"&gt;3.27 million followers&lt;/a&gt; on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7z5j3f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It is my great honor to announce I’m officially a co-owner of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/100Thieves?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@100Thieves&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nadeshot?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Nadeshot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Valkyrae?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Valkyrae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Drake?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Drake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/scooterbraun?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@scooterbraun&lt;/a&gt;, and Dan Gilbert.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love this organization with all of my heart and I can’t wait for more great years to come.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100T?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#100T&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jabIS8CdLg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jabIS8CdLg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jack “CouRage” Dunlop (@CouRageJD) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CouRageJD/status/1379883344846934016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PgJAmc"&gt;Hofstetter and Dunlop will both receive equity in 100 Thieves, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/style/valkyrae-rachel-hofstetter-100-Thieves-Among-Us.html"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In their new roles, they’ll be more involved in 100 Thieves’ business strategy, including “helping identify and bring on new talent, building new programs and other initiatives,” according to a press release. They’ll both continue to make content as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Text messages sent to Google Fi users with Hangouts went missing last week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jRW9YUGdVb_9LAGEBKxFyGe8gqg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69092218/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pwlPyW"&gt;A Google Fi user in Hawaii received a couple text messages Monday night wishing him a happy Easter. The problem is, those messages had been sent on Easter Sunday, but only made it through more than a day later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSQ6XV"&gt;Google is now informing Fi users who receive text messages through Hangouts that messages sent to them may have gone missing between March 31st and April 5th. The company said there was a service “interruption” that impacted “a small number of people.” Google says it has now resolved the issue and is sending through the delayed messages. Missing messages should appear in Hangouts by the end of today, April 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hdcy2S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has now disabled texting from Hangouts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="20M2IH"&gt;Fi users have for years been able to send and receive calls and messages through Hangouts, but Google announced plans years ago to strip those features out as it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18193303/google-hangouts-end-transition-october-gsuite-chat-meet"&gt;transitioned Hangouts&lt;/a&gt; into yet another Google communications app. The features appear to have been disabled within the last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrVcU1"&gt;But the interruption occurred before the service was fully shut down, and so Google is still working to patch the delayed messages through to Hangouts. A Google spokesperson confirmed the service interruption to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and said affected users are being contacted. SMS messages will be delivered to Messages by Google or another default messaging app &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/fi/answer/9984024?hl=en#zippy=%2Cstep-transfer-or-sync-your-text-messages%2Cif-you-used-hangouts-for-your-text-messages"&gt;going forward&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcLjzZ"&gt;Delayed messages can cause real problems for senders and receivers. In November 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20955771/delayed-text-messages-valentines-day-syniverse-total-number-growth-carriers"&gt;more than 168,000 messages&lt;/a&gt; were delivered that had originally been sent on Valentine’s Day 2019, nine months earlier. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953422/text-messages-delayed-received-overnight-valentines-day-delay"&gt;People received confusing, context-free messages&lt;/a&gt; — in some cases, messages came through from people who had died in the months between. The issue was caused by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974692/valentines-day-text-message-delay-explanation-sms-syniverse-carriers"&gt;a server failure at Syniverse&lt;/a&gt;, a firm that routes text messages between carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEpXKN"&gt;Google has been in the process of shutting down Hangouts for years, so it’s possible there weren’t many users left using the service in conjunction with Fi. Even the Fi user in Hawaii — who, full disclosure, is a friend of mine — said they knew they should have switched a while ago and decided not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QRDP0"&gt;“I intentionally put myself in this spot,” Jason Bennett, who received the delayed Easter messages, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; “&lt;/em&gt;I wanted to see what happened when it went offline.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Lil Nas X’s ‘Twerk Hero’ is a real game where you shake a virtual butt to Montero</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Q8wSKzrjUr0jT_wQ09vL-Aa09E=/0x2:1445x965/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69092064/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_3.13.05_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5yBtLm"&gt;Rapper Lil Nas X has just released a free rhythm game that has you twerking to his new song “Montero (Call Me By Your Name).” Yes, the main mechanic is twerking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWeuza"&gt;It’s a free browser game, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.monterocallmebyyour.name"&gt;play it right now at this link&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to get an idea of how the game works, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1379913998695419905"&gt;check out this video he tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. Or just use your imagination. It’s exactly what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MoSnst"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;PLAY HERE: &lt;a href="https://t.co/pUlUJYhY3O"&gt;https://t.co/pUlUJYhY3O&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/I660hJr9du"&gt;pic.twitter.com/I660hJr9du&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nope   (@LilNasX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1379914189125218305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj5Fv4"&gt;I tried it briefly before writing this post, and I have to admit that I had a hard time lining up my twerks with the on-screen arrows. (What a sentence. Also hi Dad, who gets email notifications whenever I publish a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; story.) But the game says I somehow got 43 of the 50 arrows, and a rating of two and a half stars out of three. I’ll take it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QqZSD"&gt;The new game is Lil Nas X’s latest internet-savvy stunt to help promote the new song. He also collaborated with internet collective MSCHF to release the “Satan Shoes,” which were custom Nikes that supposedly have a drop of blood in them. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357225/nike-sues-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-mschf"&gt;Nike sued MSCHF&lt;/a&gt; over the shoes, seeking a temporary restraining order, but MSCHF said it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22361961/mschf-nike-unauthorized-satan-shoe-lawsuit-response-restraining-order"&gt;no intention&lt;/a&gt; of shipping the 666th pair.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o2Z0yp"&gt;A number of OnePlus 9 Pro owners say they’re getting persistent overheating warnings, often with use of the camera app. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/07/oneplus-9-pros-are-overheating-but-a-fix-is-planned/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; spotted the mounting number of reports, many of which are collected in &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/unified-oneplus-9-pro-battery-heating-and-charging-feedback-thread.1412143/"&gt;a thread on OnePlus’ support forum&lt;/a&gt; and often mention use of the camera app in connection with the warnings. OnePlus tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;this is a known issue and that a fix will be coming via software updates “over the next few weeks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7luEV"&gt;Some 9 Pro owners reporting the problem say that the warning appears even with light use of the phone’s still photo or video recording capabilities, and in some cases the phone will prohibit any more photo taking until it cools back down. Others mention the problem arising around or soon after initial setup. We didn’t encounter the issue while testing the OnePlus 9 Pro for our review, and we haven’t seen it crop up with use since then either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sLBHmo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="erWQ7N"&gt;OnePlus gave a lot of thought to heat dissipation in the 9 Pro’s design, which is an especially important consideration for the phone’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22335032/oneplus-9-pro-fast-wireless-charging"&gt;fast wireless charging feature&lt;/a&gt;. To ensure that the phone remains a safe temperature during wireless charging, the 9 Pro includes thicker copper and a larger heat sink than its predecessor. It’s also equipped with two 25W battery cells, which helps control heat in addition to improving charging times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDgpI1"&gt;While it seems the phone is well equipped to deal with heat on the hardware side, users’ description of the problem and the response from OnePlus indicate something might be wrong on the software side. Until that fix arrives, the company encourages 9 Pro owners experiencing problems to &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/feedback"&gt;submit a bug report through its forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
