    <title>AT&amp;T TV will officially become DirecTV Stream next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OinA03PZVPpaBuocoQNiLrsiIA0=/154x0:1690x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750375/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_1.40.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: DirecTV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x5jZBY"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV and its defunct AT&amp;amp;T TV Now sibling will officially become DirecTV Stream, a new unified service spun out of a deal between TPG Capital and AT&amp;amp;T for the telecommunication giant’s streaming properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d221R0"&gt;DirecTV began updating AT&amp;amp;T TV and AT&amp;amp;T TV Now customers of the change on August 14th. On the welcome screens of both services’ mobile apps informing them that the change would officially take place on August 26th, a spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. DirectTV Stream rebrands AT&amp;amp;T’s services acquired in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608577/att-directv-tpg-deal-u-verse-att-tv-new-company"&gt;TPG Capital deal&lt;/a&gt;, which did not include HBO Max. (WarnerMedia, home to HBO Max, is set to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22448140/warner-bros-discovery-warnermedia-new-name-merger-att"&gt;merge with Discovery&lt;/a&gt; in mid-2022.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0NtNZ5iNptz861sh1Y1R-ioM2FM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793519/IMG_1845.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DirecTV&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AuFsLd"&gt;According to a company &lt;a href="https://www.directv.com/stream/"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;, “AT&amp;amp;T satellite, streaming or IP video customers will automatically keep their video service, any bundled wireless, internet or HBO Max services, and associated discounts with no action needed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPf9GG"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21160860/att-tv-now-available-android-tv-google-assistant-streaming"&gt;launched last year&lt;/a&gt; as the company’s premium TV streaming experience. AT&amp;amp;T TV Now, the company’s skinny streaming bundle, technically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226881/att-tv-now-streaming-skinny-bundle-cord-cutting-youtube-hulu-fubo"&gt;became AT&amp;amp;T TV&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, and new customers could no longer sign up for Now. (The company &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/at-t-tv-now-is-merging-with-at-t-tv-wait-what-1846043744"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt; that AT&amp;amp;T TV Now customers would still be able to access their accounts, however.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20dzAE"&gt;If all of this sounds needlessly confusing, it is. With any luck, this will be the last significant branding change that AT&amp;amp;T’s existing or future streaming customers see for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Epic v. Google lawsuit finally makes sense</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iYRBVuShNCOOnz3wVKL8J-JgXL8=/208x0:1828x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750286/Fortnite_20200615140742.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="55bmIs"&gt;There was never any question what Epic Games wanted when it took Apple to court: the 48-second &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367924/watch-epic-nineteen-eighty-fortnite-short-apple-app-store-ban"&gt;“Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite”&lt;/a&gt; made it clear &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423567/apple-epic-app-store-policies-fortnite-trial-day-4"&gt;App Store hypocrisy&lt;/a&gt; was the agenda. But the justification for a parallel case against Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;wasn’t as clear-cut&lt;/a&gt; until today — it’s only now we’re learning about the most damning accusations against the Android giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoZrI0"&gt;On Thursday, Judge James Donato unsealed &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21046008-epic-v-google-unredacted-complaint#document/p37"&gt;a fully unredacted version&lt;/a&gt; of Epic’s original complaint against Google (via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leah_nylen/status/1428411904381304845"&gt;Leah Nylen&lt;/a&gt;), and it alleges the company was so worried about Epic setting a precedent by abandoning the Play Store that it unleashed a broad effort to keep developers from following the company’s lead. That included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632818/google-project-hug-game-developers-play-store-millions-epic-lawsuit-complaint"&gt;straight-up paying top game developers&lt;/a&gt;, including Activision Blizzard to stick around, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632806/google-epic-premier-device-program-lg-motorola-hmd"&gt;sharing additional chunks of its revenue with phone makers&lt;/a&gt; if they agreed not to preinstall any other app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YE8IbU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Project Hug” and the “Premier Device Program”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9UborJ"&gt;Remember &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632806/google-epic-premier-device-program-lg-motorola-hmd"&gt;when Google allegedly forced OnePlus to break off a deal&lt;/a&gt; that would have seen the Fortnite Launcher preinstalled on phones? LG and Motorola reportedly struck a deal where they got 12 percent of the search revenue from their customers, and up to 6 percent of the money they spent in the Play Store, to be exclusive to Google. OnePlus sister brands Oppo and Vivo were also onboard, with owner BBK committing the vast majority of its phones to the exclusive program. Nokia phone maker HMD Global signed up too, as did Sony, Sharp, Xiaomi, and another unnamed brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynzVsv"&gt;If those tactics sound familiar, it might be because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568111/google-play-android-samsung-galaxy-store-quash-threatened-app-distribution-antitrust"&gt;36 state attorneys general alleged that Google used the exact same hush-hush deals against Samsung’s Galaxy Store&lt;/a&gt;, in the antitrust lawsuit they filed against Google in July. Google called it “Project Agave,” according to Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpKUBF"&gt;Apparently, Google viewed the so-called “Premier Device Program” as a huge success:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kuCls9"&gt;In a presentation prepared by and presented to senior Google Play executives, Google noted that in the short time since the beginning of the program, over 200 million new devices were covered. The same presentation shows that Google believed that the new RSAs successfully eliminated the “risk of app developer contagion”; noting that there was “no risk” under the “Current Premier tier”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pnq2US"&gt;Google even suggested the idea of &lt;em&gt;buying &lt;/em&gt;Epic to remove the threat — going behind Epic’s back and approaching minority owner Tencent, the Chinese tech giant that currently has a 40 percent stake in Epic. The suggestions were “to either (a) buy Epic shares from Tencent to get more control over Epic”, or “(b) join up with Tencent to buy 100% of Epic,” the unredacted complaint reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="93tFmJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not clear Google actually approached Tencent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lnUzKk"&gt;And that’s on top of the dealings Google had with Epic directly in July 2018, when Alphabet’s CFO and other senior Google executives reportedly offered up to $208 million in “special benefits” over three years to bring &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to Google Play — in what would effectively be Google taking 25 percent of the game’s revenue instead of the standard 30 percent. Google allegedly tried to convince Epic to take the deal by pointing out the “frankly abysmal” 15+ step process gamers would have to endure to sideload &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLxov6"&gt;Intriguingly, that would have been the month &lt;em&gt;before &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/3/17645982/epic-games-fortnite-android-version-bypass-google-play-store"&gt;Epic announced it would ditch the Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. That suggests Google had early access to Epic’s sideloading plans, despite CEO Tim Sweeney’s February 2018 instructions to his team to “SAY NOTHING TILL IT SHIPS”:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6YTWJSsyzdTIREOfuuhHNrU-WCw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793574/say_nothing_till_it_ships.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QSOkbv"&gt;It also suggests Google, not Epic, might have been the one originally offering special deals. A year later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21003553/google-play-store-fortnite-epic-games-30-percent-cut-dispute"&gt;Epic had to defend the idea&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; was the one asking for a “special billing exception,” a sequence of events that appears to have thwarted Epic’s original plans — if you read item #38 in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;my big story about the best emails from the Epic v. Apple trial&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see Epic was planning to spring a legal trap for Google long before Apple became the primary target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YkpqoC"&gt;Why was Google running so scared that it allegedly resorted to these tactics? Apparently, it believed billions of dollars were at stake. According to Epic’s assessment, Google thought Epic had created a “contagion risk” that would spread to other game developers too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="f4hGE1"&gt;In particular, documents that Google’s Finance Director for Platforms and Ecosystems prepared for the CFO of Alphabet around the time of Fortnite’s launch on Android showed that Google feared what it termed a “contagion risk” resulting from more and more app developers forgoing Google Play. Google feared that the “contagion” would spread in this way: first, inspired by Epic’s example, “[p]owerful developers” such as “Blizzard, Valve, Sony, Nintendo”—creators of some of the most popular and profitable entertainment—would be “able to go on their own”, bypassing Play by directly distributing their own apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6OXzz"&gt;Then, other “[m]ajor developers”, including Electronic Arts, King, Supercell and Ubisoft, will choose to “colaunch off Play”, collaborating to forego Google’s distribution services as well. And finally, Google even identified a risk that “[a]ll remaining titles [will] co-launch off Play”. Google calculated the total at-risk revenue from the threatened loss of market share in Android app distribution to be $3.6B, with the probability-weighted loss “conservative[ly]” estimated at $550M through 2021. Google also recognized that the “[r]ecent Fortnite + Samsung partnership further amplifies risk &amp;amp; urgency of problem” facing its monopoly position in Android app distribution. Google was determined not to let this happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BlWnW6"&gt;“Epic’s partnership with Samsung and determination to bypass Google Play for distribution of Fortnite struck fear into senior Google executives,” Epic wrote, adding that Google saw it stood to lose up to $6B in revenue by 2022 alone, if Samsung, Amazon and other app stores were able to peel off the games developers who used Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Google presentation looking back at 2018 mentions “Hug” incentives for game developers to keep them from “going it alone”." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D13nRLOKrrBTyDTqOCPgg5bEcHI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793540/epic_google_hug.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A Google presentation looking back at 2018 mentions “Hug” incentives for game developers to keep them from “going it alone”.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6pfH35"&gt;Epic’s unredacted complaint might explain some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;other tidbits we spotted in filings too&lt;/a&gt;, like Epic CEO Tim Sweeney’s cryptic assurance to Samsung’s DJ Koh that “You have my assurance Epic will support Samsung 100% in any battle with Google” (#32), or the reason Epic included &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21046076-google-struggling-in-gaming-2019-dx-5326_redacted"&gt;an entire presentation in evidence&lt;/a&gt; about how Google felt it might be struggling in gaming. You can see a very relevant slide from that above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFUupB"&gt;It’s not clear Epic was ever going to succeed with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on phones the way it succeeded with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on consoles: as I discuss in the final section of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;the Epic v. Apple emails story&lt;/a&gt;, mobile is a tiny fraction of the company’s business and likely not the preferred place to play — more of a gateway drug than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDu4RU"&gt;But it sounds like Google certainly didn’t help Epic’s chances there, and it’s impossible to say how much more popular &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Mobile&lt;/em&gt; might have been if Epic never challenged the standard app store toll or had an easier time establishing its own store. The documents show &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was exceptionally anemic on Android, even while competitors like &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; were blowing up around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="qD2laT"&gt;It also shows Google trying to quietly build the kind of walled garden that Apple has explicitly aimed for from the beginning. The company was allegedly locking down phone manufacturers with elaborate contracts, directly appealing to software developers to keep them on the Play store, and treating any alternative software channel as an existential threat — all of which makes an antitrust lawsuit against the more open of the two major mobile operating systems much more plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX’s lunar lander contract on hold again pending Blue Origin’s lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Gigafactory - Elon Musk" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/du-Giw-V26KVUFL4JzpuFj3_Svc=/0x171:4978x3490/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750284/1234657348.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y2LRlq"&gt;SpaceX’s $3 billion contract to build a lunar lander for NASA was put on hold for a second time on Thursday after Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin sued over the award, according to court filings. NASA voluntarily agreed to temporarily suspend the contract until November 1st while the US Court of Federal Claims, where Blue Origin filed suit last week, adjudicates the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJeq9y"&gt;A status report jointly filed by Blue Origin, SpaceX and the government on Thursday said NASA’s “voluntary stay of performance shall expire” on November 1st. Oral arguments are set for October 14th, the judge said. SpaceX had intervened in the lawsuit earlier this week to “ensure that the court has a complete and accurate picture” of the protest, the company told the judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FEILUa"&gt;Blue Origin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22623022/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-sue-nasa-lawsuit-hls-lunar-lander"&gt;sued NASA last week&lt;/a&gt; over the agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;April decision to pick only SpaceX’s Starship&lt;/a&gt; rocket system for the agency’s first human lunar landing system since 1972. NASA had said it could pick up to two companies for the award, but opted for one after getting less funding from Congress than it requested. Blue Origin lodged a sealed complaint with the courts weeks after its initial protest was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602082/nasa-gao-spacex-blue-origin-dynetics-lunar-lander"&gt;rejected by the Government Accountability Office&lt;/a&gt;. That protest, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;filed in April&lt;/a&gt;, put SpaceX’s lunar lander contract &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412771/nasa-spacex-hls-moon-lander-blue-origin-protest"&gt;on hold&lt;/a&gt; for 95 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBxel8"&gt;The decision to give the contract to Elon Musk’s SpaceX over proposals from Blue Origin and Dynetics, unleashed a campaign from Blue Origin to publicly cast SpaceX’s Starship system as unsafe and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22457893/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-nasa-spacex-senate-competition-bill-nasa-moon-lander"&gt;lobby Congress for more NASA funding&lt;/a&gt; that could convince the agency to pick a second company. Blue Origin’s unsuccessful protest at the GAO alleged NASA ran afoul of contracting law and claimed the agency should’ve canceled or changed the terms of the program when it learned it wouldn’t have had enough money to fund two separate contracts. It also said NASA unfairly negotiated the terms of SpaceX’s proposal before making its award, without giving the same opportunities to Blue Origin and Dynetics. The GAO rejected both arguments and backed NASA’s decision as lawful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wbEb3"&gt;Despite the delays triggered by Blue Origin’s protests, SpaceX has made swift progress on its Starship system and has moved the program along using mostly private funds. The first Starship prototype bound for orbit — a key development milestone for SpaceX — should be ready for launch “in a few weeks,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1426715232475533319?s=20"&gt;Musk tweeted on August 14th.&lt;/a&gt; But the rocket can’t launch until the Federal Aviation Administration finishes a lengthy environmental review of SpaceX’s launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, the company’s central Starship hub.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Skyrim is getting a next-gen upgrade exactly 10 years after its original release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UFinbwlLxLCyRmEeKUfWENhDvuU=/308x0:1613x870/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750254/SKY10_Constellation_HERO_1920x87.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Skyrim&lt;em&gt; was first released in 2011.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bethesda&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LR8NV6"&gt;Nearly a decade after its original release, Bethesda Softworks &lt;a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/REybYU3Gy2InVlHmus4UC/skyrim-10th-anniversary-fan-celebration"&gt;is announcing&lt;/a&gt; new updates coming to its acclaimed hit &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt;. On November 11th, exactly 10 years after its original launch date, the game is getting a free next-gen upgrade that will be available to all owners of &lt;em&gt;Skyrim Special Edition&lt;/em&gt;. And that’s not all — Bethesda is going to add three free pieces of Creation Club content to the game for all &lt;em&gt;Special Edition&lt;/em&gt; owners, including the ability to go fishing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmn1NK"&gt;Bethesda is also releasing &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; edition of the game on November 11th, which is aptly named the &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition. &lt;/em&gt;This version includes everything in &lt;em&gt;Special Edition&lt;/em&gt;, the three free pieces of Creation Club content, and “over 500 pieces of unique content from Creation Club,” including quests, weapons, and more. If you already own &lt;em&gt;Special Edition &lt;/em&gt;or play the game on Xbox Game Pass, Bethesda will let you purchase an upgrade to &lt;em&gt;Anniversary Edition&lt;/em&gt;, but hasn’t detailed the price. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5S1Cygjox9J5ClF_soodfTTdTSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793624/SKY10_Anni_Edition_in_body_EN.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Skyrim Anniversary Edition&lt;em&gt; will be released on November 11th.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dQepC9"&gt;With the upcoming next-gen upgrade, &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt; will have been ported across three entire console generations. Bethesda has also released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/15/16771826/fallout-doom-skyrim-virtual-reality-reviews"&gt;VR port&lt;/a&gt; and, perhaps most famously, a port for Amazon’s Alexa assistant called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447608/bethesda-e3-2018-skyrim-alexa-key"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skyrim: Very Special Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter makes small changes to direct messages </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2WF13pHjAoE7dD5i1Ob-i_cW2TM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750176/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter is making some small updates to its direct messages | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Q2Xw4"&gt;Twitter on Thursday said it’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408769835421701?s=20"&gt;introducing several new updates &lt;/a&gt;to its direct messages, which will roll out to some users in the next few weeks. The changes include the ability to send a direct message to multiple people in separate conversations because who among us has not accidentally started a group chat that way. Now, you can share a tweet in up to 20 separate DM conversations, if the goss is hot enough to share with that many individual tweeters at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAt1D0"&gt;The feature is coming to the iOS and web versions of Twitter first, and Android “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tnfQlk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;No more (awkward) accidental group chats when you DM a Tweet to multiple people. Now you can share the same Tweet in up to 20 different DM convos, separately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rolling out on iOS and web, and soon on Android. (2/5) &lt;a href="https://t.co/oHYseF3EJE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oHYseF3EJE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408781239504898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u7ITNh"&gt;For iOS users, Twitter is tweaking DM timestamps; now instead of stamping each message within a DM conversation with the date and time, the&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408787245928453?s=20"&gt; messages will be grouped by day&lt;/a&gt;. This will reduce “timestamp clutter,” Twitter says. And, iOS users will soon be able to access the “add reaction” buttons not only by double-tapping but by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408786126057484?s=20"&gt;long-pressing on a message&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqzy3R"&gt;Android users, sorry, but you’ll be waiting to access those last two features, although you will get the ability along with iOS users to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408784981004290?s=20"&gt;quick-scroll through a DM conversation&lt;/a&gt; and return to the most recent message by pressing a down-arrow button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpiLY6"&gt;Twitter has added many new features in the past several months, including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629097/twitter-misinformation-health-covid19-reporting-feature-white-house"&gt;new process to report COVID misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, an update to its API to make it easier for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631036/twitter-spaces-developers-api-v2"&gt;other apps to point to its Spaces&lt;/a&gt; audio chats, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620438/twitter-changes-font-chirp-design-icon"&gt;change to its font&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the new DM features, on Thursday Twitter also announced it was testing a feature that would make it easier for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632414/twitter-newsletter-subscription-button-revue-profile"&gt;users to subscribe to Twitter users’ Revue newsletters &lt;/a&gt;directly from a Twitter profile. That’s rolling out to web and Android users to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzl7RT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Policy groups request Apple abandon plans to scan devices for child abuse imagery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OSXBPBTPSMgp9m4g8l2fX1ML5tw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749739/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Policy groups have asked Apple to abandon plans to scan iPhones for images of abuse | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SwiiC4"&gt;An international coalition of policy and civil rights groups published an open letter Thursday asking Apple to “abandon its recently announced plans to build surveillance capabilities into iPhones, iPads and other Apple products.” The groups include the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Access Now, Privacy International, and the Tor Project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UopXV"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;Apple announced its plans &lt;/a&gt;to use new tech within iOS to detect potential child abuse imagery with the goal of limiting the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online. Apple also announced a new “communication safety” feature, which will use on-device machine learning to identify and blur sexually explicit images received by children in its Messages app. Parents of children age 12 and younger can be notified if the child views or sends such an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Vimb"&gt;“Though these capabilities are intended to protect children and to reduce the spread of child sexual abuse material, we are concerned that they will be used to censor protected speech, threaten the privacy and security of people around the world, and have disastrous consequences for many children,” the groups wrote in &lt;a href="https://cdt.org/insights/international-coalition-calls-on-apple-to-abandon-plan-to-build-surveillance-capabilities-into-iphones-ipads-and-other-products"&gt;the letter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYhVGE"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fchild-safety%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F19%2F22632722%2Fapple-child-abuse-scan-ios-abandon-request-privacy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new “Child Safety” page&lt;/a&gt; details the plans, which call for on-device scanning before an image is backed up in iCloud. The scanning does not occur until a file is being backed up to iCloud, and Apple says it only receives data about a match if the cryptographic vouchers (uploaded to iCloud along with the image) for an account meet a threshold of matching known CSAM. Apple and other cloud email providers have used hash systems to scan for CSAM sent via email, but the new program would apply the same scans to images stored in iCloud, even if the user never shares or sends them to anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="g4EOs7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RJIEhX"&gt;In response to concerns about how the technology might be misused, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616381/apple-child-sexual-abuse-material-scanning-icloud-faq-pushback-privacy"&gt;Apple followed up by saying&lt;/a&gt; it would limit its use to detecting CSAM “and we will not accede to any government’s request to expand it,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBqYM0"&gt;Much of the pushback against the new measures has been focused on the device-scanning feature, but the civil rights and privacy groups said the plan to blur nudity in children’s iMessages could potentially put children in danger and will break iMessage’s end-to-end encryption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKP6zM"&gt;“Once this backdoor feature is built in, governments could compel Apple to extend notification to other accounts, and to detect images that are objectionable for reasons other than being sexually explicit,” the letter states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvN7IH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vine’s creator is now working on NFT blockchain video games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rj9E4jRQSEJUJa-ixyTjdaS2eZY=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749526/E9GaIKBXEAM03sE.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just try not reading it as “SuperDrive.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Supdrive on Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ejBTrP"&gt;Dom Hofmann, one of Vine’s founders and the creator of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18076362/vine-successor-byte-launch-dom-hofmann"&gt;Byte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/17/18228466/peach-social-network-microblogging-down-but-is-coming-back"&gt;Peach&lt;/a&gt;, has a new project called Supdrive. In his &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1428093313412915203?s=20"&gt;tweet announcing Supdrive&lt;/a&gt;, he calls it an “on-chain fantasy game console,” which doesn’t necessarily make it any more obvious as to what this project will look like. He’s since explained in an announcement post, which you can read below, that it’ll be a video game console that plays classic-style games (in the vein of &lt;em&gt;Pacman&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Asteroid&lt;/em&gt;), with NFTs acting as a sort of virtual cartridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGwmHD"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/supdrive/status/1428102398850093057?s=20"&gt;a Discord set up for Supdrive&lt;/a&gt;, Hofmann wrote that the games will be NFTs, running on virtual firmware. The fact that games will be released as NFTs means that there will only be so many “editions” or copies available. Hofmann also says that each copy of a given game will be unique, with players getting different color palettes, difficulty levels, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
&lt;aside id="Przsxn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Each copy of a given game will be unique in some ways&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="BX7Le5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9zwh4B"&gt;Hofmann compares Supdrive to another blockchain project, &lt;a href="https://artblocks.io/learn"&gt;Art Blocks&lt;/a&gt;, while describing it, which may give us an idea of what it’ll actually be like. The gist of Art Blocks is that it lets creators make programs to procedurally generate art, which is then stored on the blockchain. The programs will always create the same art for a given seed, but changing the seed changes what the art ends up looking like (&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; players may be familiar with this sort of system). Then, people buy NFTs for an Art Block project, which will contain a seed, letting them generate that art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfh2IS"&gt;This seems to fit well with what Hofmann is describing, where an on-chain console will play unique games. The details, though, like how exactly it will work, how many copies of each game will be available, and how much they’ll cost, are all to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mtCA4P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many details about the Supdrive are still to be announced&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0Rp7Fl"&gt;Hofmann’s post does say that the plan is to let the community develop games for the Supdrive, if the project ends up working out. He also plans on upgrading the console’s abilities, allowing for more advanced games (the initial set of games will be “old-school arcade style”). The first game, made by Hofmann, is called &lt;em&gt;Origin&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZu3nY"&gt;Supdrive also has a sort of meta game, with its users being split up into &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;-esque Red, Green, and Blue teams. Hofmann’s announcement post says that which team you’re on  could have an effect on the game you’re playing. For now, though, the different color teams are mostly memeing at each other in the Discord. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Conversation between two Discord users. User 1: When’s the release? Hofmann: Shooting for Oct, will share more details soon. Will prob have some leads activities. Should be something special (smile emoji)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n1BYqwEL72rYrm7QGXluX-X2I9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793195/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_11.30.40_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hofmann saying that the goal for Supdrive’s release is October.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ysv49z"&gt;In the Discord chat, Hofmann said he was aiming for an October launch for the project. He’s also said that he’ll be doing updates “every week or so” leading up to the launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrP8Z4"&gt;Hofmann’s post-Vine projects haven’t managed to reach the original video platform’s success — the iOS app for his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/8/10739010/peach-cool-social-network"&gt;social network, Peach&lt;/a&gt;, hasn’t been updated in three years, and the successor to Vine, Byte, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250926/clash-buys-byte-vine-successor-dom-hofmann"&gt;purchased by a TikTok competitor called Clash&lt;/a&gt; (and user App Store reviews have not been positive about the changes made). Only time will tell how Supdrive turns out, but it does seem to be an interesting idea — if you’re willing to enter the NFT market to get the games, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wG4GG"&gt;The full Supdrive announcement, posted to Discord:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="uYXbAI"&gt;SUP? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zjn0hX"&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;Update #1&lt;/strong&gt; — will do these every week or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMkEhi"&gt;This project has gotten more attention than I expected in the first 12 hours so I wanted to share a few more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pu2ELw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Supdrive?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmZGGX"&gt;Supdrive is an on-chain fantasy console where &lt;strong&gt;the games themselves are NFTs&lt;/strong&gt;. You can think of it sort of like Artblocks for games. These games all run on the Supdrive Virtual Firmware, a toolkit that allows games to be written in concise instructions that are gas friendly and ideal for on-chain storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9XtGR"&gt;Although every game will be released in fixed edition sizes, &lt;strong&gt;every edition is unique&lt;/strong&gt; — every version of the game will be different, whether it’s color palettes, difficulty, special abilities, or more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTo2W5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kinds of games?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bW2uNa"&gt;Supdrive games will be old-school arcade style games to start. Think titles like Galaga, Pacman, or Asteroid. As the firmware is upgraded, games will gradually become more sophisticated. Perhaps one day we’ll have Super Supdrive or Supdrive 64.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjgwbG"&gt;The first game is called &lt;strong&gt;Origin&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NokE9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s making the games?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZzum6"&gt;I will be developing the first few games, but if things go well the plan is to open up the platform. Artblocks is another good example here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hxi6Qr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are Red Green Blue teams?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Am7q03"&gt;Inspired by Pokemon, teams are an ongoing meta system in the Supdrive world. In the future, you will have an opportunity to commit to your team and receive a free airdrop collectible that signifies you membership in the team. Holding this collectible will have effects in certain Supdrive titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H43I96"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mint price/edition size/release date?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbNTgz"&gt;TBD and will keep you posted  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsQowc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I help?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJLS8s"&gt;For now, just hanging out in the Discord and raising awareness is cool. As we get closer to launch, there will be more things to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTgiys"&gt;— &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXtSOA"&gt;That’s it for now! See you next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SuXhhK"&gt;Apple products are often leaked because they’re immensely popular, the company is protective of its plans, and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7en78/9to5mac-writer-paid-source-dollar500-in-bitcoin-for-stolen-apple-data"&gt;people are willing to pay&lt;/a&gt; for just about any information on a new product. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aqyz8/apples-double-agent"&gt;A new must-read report from &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that not everyone selling Apple leaks is on the up-and-up, and not because of the information they’re peddling. Some leakers are working for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrmrp6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;’s Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai spoke to a double agent named Andrey Shumeyko, an Apple leaker who began offering information to the company in 2017. By the time 2020 rolled around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267590/ios-14-leaked-early-version-internet-months-vice"&gt;and iOS 14 leaked&lt;/a&gt;, Shumeyko was actively trying to become Apple’s mole, tracking leaked hardware and software and sharing it with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/20/15837522/apple-internal-presentation-leaks"&gt;Apple’s Global Security team&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of getting paid, and to “redeem himself for being part of that community.” There’s a reason why he spoke to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;in the first place, though. Apple never paid and “never took into consideration my side and me as a person,” Shumeyko tells &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Uhar0H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The mole got played&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1aYKxL"&gt;What’s interesting about Shumeyko’s story isn’t the fact that there are moles working within the communities selling Apple’s biggest secrets, it’s that Apple managed to keep Shumeyko  sharing information for almost a year. Hacking and ferreting out leaks can sometimes involve social engineering, manipulating people rather than the technical tools they use. It’s just unusual to see such a clear version of it working the other way, and not with a ton of complexity. In private messages, Apple appealed to Shumeyko’s interest in the company and his sense of guilt — and it worked, until it didn’t. Here’s what he says one Apple employee told him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QFk9b7"&gt;Please understand that our goal is to protect Apple. All our actions are guided by the premise of what is best for the company, our employees, and our customers (of which you are one). Therefore your help—and insights—in understanding possible threats to us are very important...Do the right things to protect Apple. Keep it that way, you will be proud of yourself, so will we.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="lZSPUx"&gt;You should read &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aqyz8/apples-double-agent"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;’s full piece&lt;/a&gt; to learn about all the leaks Shumeyko was involved in, and the not-so-subtle ways Apple tried to manipulate him. For all the information that still made it out, Apple remains an intimidating company to mess with.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Motorola Edge gets a 108-megapixel camera but ditches the edge display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QGvwBZN9FIO3y82ldrGugAWgMx4=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749378/edge.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b9D1ly"&gt;Motorola has a new version of its $700 Edge smartphone, bringing better cameras, a more modern processor, and an updated design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUpRAK"&gt;As with last year’s Edge, the new model doesn’t quite offer the best hardware Android has to offer, with a Snapdragon 778 5G processor, 6GB RAM and 128GB storage, or 8GB RAM / 256GB storage, but those sacrifices might be worth it for the decidedly midrange price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNbqBS"&gt;Despite that, the new Edge does feature the 108-megapixel camera that was one of the marquee features on the Edge Plus, along with a larger 5,000mAh battery and mmWave 5G — both of which were also offered on the Edge Plus but were downgraded to a 4,500mAh battery and sub-6GHz-only specs on last year’s Edge. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPL4-EVXAsWWm3hWTNZ6aLNXNqI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22791020/Motorola_edge__2021__design.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gkzgT1"&gt;The display is a 6.8-inch LCD display with a 144Hz refresh rate, but calling the new phone the Edge (with no numbering to help distinguish it from the 2020 model) is actually a bit of a misnomer, given that the 2021 model ditches the “endless edge” waterfall display that gave the original Edge and Edge Plus their names. That said, given that the curved screen was by and large a gimmick on last year’s models, it’s not much of a loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJSipX"&gt;Cameras are the aforementioned 108-megapixel main camera, along with an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide that offers Motorola’s “Macro Vision” feature, and a 2-megapixel depth camera. A 32-megapixel front-facing camera rounds out the proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlooYj"&gt;Still missing on the spec sheet is any form of wireless charging, although the new Edge does add some extremely basic IP52 water resistance (which, while better than nothing, is basically just enough to protect from the odd bit of rain). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2YQ4t2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Motorola debuts Edge 20 flagships globally with fast refresh screens and 108-megapixel cameras","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599860/motorola-edge-20-pro-lite-camera-5g-global-launch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kAPH4y"&gt;It’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the same hardware as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599860/motorola-edge-20-pro-lite-camera-5g-global-launch"&gt;trio of Edge 20 models&lt;/a&gt; that Motorola released internationally earlier this summer (which, among other differences, feature smaller 6.7-inch displays) although it most closely resembles the middle-of-the-road Edge 20 in specs. The Edge 20 does beat the North American model Edge in a few areas, however: it features an 16-megapixel ultrawide and an 8-megapixel 3x telephoto camera as its other two rear cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bytbmy"&gt;The latest version of the Edge is also definitively a successor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21347201/motorola-edge-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;last year’s regular Edge model&lt;/a&gt; — not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241919/motorola-edge-plus-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;premium flagship Edge Plus hardware&lt;/a&gt; that aimed to challenge high-end phones from Samsung and OnePlus. For now, there’s no word on Motorola as to whether it’ll be trying again at competing in the crowded high-end Android market in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="veVCeb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Another “limited time” discount&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GSXO30"&gt;Pricing for the 2021 Edge also matches last year: it’ll technically be sold for $699.99, but Motorola is once again offering a “limited-time” discount right from the start to drop the price down to a more wallet-friendly $499.99. The company isn’t saying how long that price will be offered at this time, although if it’s anything like last year, sales won’t be too hard to come by. It’ll be available in the US unlocked from sellers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola’s website, with carrier versions from Verizon and Spectrum mobile planned “in the coming months.” A release in Canada is also planned for the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces price increase for Office 365 and Microsoft 365</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JNlP0aQzKkCaMoIwB3D48bLMOb8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749355/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lLml0y"&gt;Microsoft is announcing its first price increase for its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 services in a decade. The price increases will affect commercial and business users of Microsoft’s software as a service (SaaS) offerings next year, with no changes to pricing for education or consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYkuJi"&gt;Microsoft’s updated pricing will go into effect on March 1st, 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wGyJEK"&gt;Microsoft 365 Business Basic (from $5 to $6 per user)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wi4TSv"&gt;Microsoft 365 Business Premium (from $20 to $22)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6dmdIh"&gt;Office 365 E1 (from $8 to $10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="edXloD"&gt;Office 365 E3 (from $20 to $23)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aSTq8e"&gt;Office 365 E5 (from $35 to $38)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l4MiI3"&gt;Microsoft 365 E3 (from $32 to $36)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="egueXH"&gt;Microsoft first launched Office 365 in 2011 across 40 different markets, and the company has been improving it ever since. These price changes mark “the first substantive pricing update since we launched Office 365 a decade ago,” explains Microsoft 365 chief Jared Spataro &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fblog%2F2021%2F08%2F19%2Fnew-pricing-for-microsoft-365%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a blog post today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HoXkj"&gt;They also come as Microsoft has reported a record year of revenue growth thanks to cloud services like Office 365. Microsoft has more than 300 million paid seats for Office 365, so the price changes will certainly bump Microsoft’s profits and revenue even further next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktvnEH"&gt;While larger businesses will have benefited from bulk discounts and deals over the past decade, it’s the small businesses that will feel the effects of an increase in pricing as the economy starts to recover from a pandemic. Either way, Microsoft has added more than 20 apps to Office 365 since it originally launched, including Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint, and To-Do.&lt;/p&gt;
