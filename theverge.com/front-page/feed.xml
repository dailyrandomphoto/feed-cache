    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An Amazon warehouse in Alabama could become the first to unionize in the US &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="jq4fTt"&gt;For the next seven weeks, employees at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama will vote on whether to become the first of the company’s US employees to unionize. The only other US Amazon employees to make it as far as a union election was a smaller group of maintenance workers at a Delaware warehouse in 2014. That effort failed after an aggressive &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/technology/amazon-proves-infertile-soil-for-unions-so-far.html"&gt;anti-union campaign&lt;/a&gt; from a company that has long been &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dp3yn/amazon-leaked-reports-expose-spying-warehouse-workers-labor-union-environmental-groups-social-movements"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-worker-retaliation-coronavirus"&gt;worker organizing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNeO4L"&gt;The vote in Alabama, at a warehouse outside Birmingham called BHM1, comes at a pivotal time for the company and its workers. Amazon is emerging from the pandemic in a stronger position than ever: posting &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-amzn-4q-earnings-report-2020-11612221803"&gt;record earnings&lt;/a&gt;, opening new warehouses at a rapid clip, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/pushed-by-pandemic-amazon-goes-on-a-hiring-spree-without-equal.html"&gt;hiring&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of new workers a day. Those workers, however, have become increasingly vocal about the fact that they haven’t shared in the company’s success. Last year’s wave of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216172/amazon-coronavirus-protests-response-safety-jfk8-fired-covid-19"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; and walkouts over COVID-19 safety measures and other issues won some partial &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-workers-who-petitioned-for-paid-time-off-claim"&gt;victories&lt;/a&gt;, but the Bessemer union, if it succeeds, would give workers the power to negotiate a contract that could lock in durable changes to wages and working conditions. It could also inspire other Amazon warehouses to organize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5RcSDF"&gt;Workers at BHM1 say that one of the primary issues driving the union push is Amazon’s grueling and automatically enforced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155254/automation-robots-unemployment-jobs-vs-human-google-amazon"&gt;productivity metrics&lt;/a&gt;, a complaint that has prompted demonstrations at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20696154/amazon-prime-day-2019-strike-warehouse-workers-inhumane-conditions-the-rate-productivity"&gt;other Amazon facilities&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oV8jO2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You don’t have time to step back.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xbNIUW"&gt;Darryl Richardson started working at BHM1 when it opened in March, after the automotive company he worked at closed down. At first, he thought it would be a good job, but it wasn’t long before Amazon’s productivity tracking started to grate on him. Richardson is a “picker,” which means he removes products from shelves that robots bring to his station, sometimes climbing a ladder to do so, scans them, and sends them to be packaged for shipment. Amazon tracks how many items he scans, how quickly, and how much time he spends not scanning, which it calls “time off task,” or “TOT.” Going to the bathroom counts as “TOT.” Stretching between items counts as “TOT,” and after 30 minutes of “TOT,” workers get an automated writeup, and after two hours, they get fired, Richardson says. He estimates he has to scan an item approximately every ten seconds, all day, to avoid penalties. “It’s a very consistent fast pace. You don’t have time to step back.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyHOaH"&gt;“You go get some water, you can’t pause your time, and you get docked, because you aren’t scanning,” Richardson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="df9s9O"&gt;“I mean, you come into work and need to be treated like a human being,” says another worker, a longtime Amazon employee who transferred to BHM1 when it opened. He supports the union but asked to remain anonymous because of “Amazon’s reputation for how they deal with people trying to unionize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2rFB7S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You come into work and need to be treated like a human being.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MuLU6K"&gt;By the summer, other issues had arisen. Amazon had ended the hazard pay it implemented at the beginning of the pandemic, as well as its policy of allowing workers to take unlimited time off without pay. Meanwhile, COVID cases in the South were spiking. (A filing with the National Labor Relations Board provides a snapshot of the COVID rate at BHM1, with Amazon saying 218 workers at BHM1 had tested or were presumed positive for COVID-19 in the two weeks ending January 7th.) The warehouse was also extremely hot, workers say, and schedules would change unpredictably. “They change your schedule while you sleep,” Richardson says. “If they change the schedule and you don’t know, they terminate you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9Ih8W"&gt;“I think like a bunch of these frustrations with the company trying to make every little extra dollar, at the expense of the person actually doing the work, has really frustrated people down here,” says the Amazon worker who asked to be anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPHSHK"&gt;Beth Gutelius, who studies the logistics industry at the University of Illinois Chicago Center for Urban Economic Development, sees the Bessemer union push and other Amazon protests as a symptom of tensions that have long existed in e-commerce but have been heightened by the pandemic. “We’re reaching this point where some of the contradictions that have existed uncomfortably maybe can’t hold anymore,” Gutelius says. “Companies like Amazon really benefited from fulfilling consumer demand during the pandemic, and workers are seeing that those gains have not trickled down to them. Warehouse work in particular has long been invisible to the public, and highly undervalued by firms as a supply chain function, and I think it’s possible that we’re seeing the start of a pretty big course correction on this question, with the value of warehousing being seen in a new light.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VdN2s1"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2 id="U31BKe"&gt;An atmosphere of activism &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3C88co"&gt;At Richardson’s previous job, he had been a member of the United Auto Workers, and he felt employees there had been treated with more “respect.” There had been a procedure for addressing workers’ grievances and rules that made firings less arbitrary. Meanwhile, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union had been waging a public battle for better COVID-19 protections at nearby poultry plants. Richardson and other BHM1 employees decided to reach out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oopw4z"&gt;The campaign came together quickly, a fact that employees attribute to a confluence of factors. Frustration with Amazon — with the grueling work, dehumanizing management approach, and the company’s rocketing profits — was intense and widespread. This frustration coincided with a rising tide of activism at the facility. The majority of BHM1 workers are Black and many had been galvanized by the summer’s Black Lives Matter protests following the killing of George Floyd. “I think it also correlated with the recent racial justice movement,” says the anonymous employee. “There’s a lot of support for the movement in that building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWlhDZ"&gt;Joshua Brewer, the lead RWDSU organizer on the campaign, agrees with the role the movement played. “A lot of these workers are involved in that, especially a lot of these activists that have really worked hard to get their co-workers on board,” he says. “You feel that kind of spirit throughout the campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eW2ZGk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You feel that kind of spirit throughout the campaign.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Om7hos"&gt;He also attributes the campaign’s success to Bessemer’s deep union roots. “It’s a union town, so they go home to their families, and they hear from their aunts and uncles and dads and grandparents that worked in the steel industries or in the mines, and they say unions are good, you need to sign that card and get involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZBzo5"&gt;After several months of workers talking privately to other workers, Brewer says they decided it was time to go public. On October 20th, RWDSU members from nearby poultry plants and warehouses came to the BHM1 gates and started talking to employees. A month later, they had collected enough signatures supporting an election to feel confident filing a petition with the National Labor Relations Board. Brewer says over 3,000 employees, more than half the workers Amazon says work at the facility, have now signed cards in favor of an election. (Organizers need 30 percent of workers to show interest in an election to begin the election process, and more than half of workers who vote to win the election and certify the union.) On January 15th, the NLRB &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/15/amazon-union-alabama-vote/"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that the election could go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUk6kv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o2uzNW"&gt;Amazon goes on the offensive &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Zv5Zyi"&gt;By then, Amazon’s anti-union campaign was underway. In late December, it had launched a &lt;a href="https://www.doitwithoutdues.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; with the tagline #doitwithoutdues, with warnings that signing cards in support of a union election could legally obligate workers to pay dues. (This is misleading: dues wouldn’t start unless workers voted to approve a union contract, and even then, Alabama is a right-to-work state, so dues would be voluntary.) The site also featured photos of happy Amazon employees and an animated cartoon dog that was, inexplicably, also a DJ. Managers started pulling workers aside for anti-union presentations — so called “captive audience” meetings — where they made similar arguments about dues, workers say, and gave out anti-union pins to wear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7nzxS"&gt;Richardson and the other BHM1 employee say some of these meetings were conducted by people who don’t work at the warehouse. It’s common for companies to hire anti-union consultants who specialize in dissuading employees from organizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRHycH"&gt;Amazon did not provide comment at the time of publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjGrJF"&gt;Workers now get near-daily text messages from Amazon telling them to vote no, that “a union is a business that takes money out of your paycheck to fund itself,” and other anti-union messages, according to screenshots viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. On Facebook and Instagram, employees are targeted with anti-union ads linking to Amazon’s #doitwithoutdues website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ujh27x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even in the bathrooms, Amazon’s anti-union campaign inescapable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="moZKxj"&gt;“I have never seen Amazon fight for something like this. I have never seen them try to push for something this hard before,” says the longtime Amazon employee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WINSOM"&gt;Anti-union banners and signs have gone up across the warehouse. Even in the bathrooms, Amazon’s anti-union campaign inescapable: signs have been posted on stall doors and at eye level above the urinals warning workers about union dues and telling them to “remember everything you already have without giving any of your hard earned money to the RWDSU,” one poster reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2fmas"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qoiSalYN-kx6GK5tGYpflExSfv8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22289064/Screen_Shot_2021_02_08_at_9.25.32_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ce-U4MS7_ncJ93oeC7ezq9eI-8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22289066/Screen_Shot_2021_02_08_at_9.24.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-union signs in the BHM1 bathrooms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8pdmdw"&gt;“It’s right in your face, like when you walk up to it, so you have something to read. It’s a pretty great way to get the info out there, but come on,” says the worker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEnyEC"&gt;At the NLRB, Amazon tried to delay the election and have it be conducted in person, rather than by mail. Since the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-establishes-standards-for-mail-and-manual-ballot-representation#:~:text=Since%20March%2C%20approximately%2090%20percent,concerns%20raised%20by%20the%20pandemic."&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of union elections have been by mail, but Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244413/amazon-union-vote-decision-appeal-alabama-us-labor-board"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that mail-in voting would decrease turnout, and that, in an argument that echoed misinformation about the presidential election, it would have a greater risk of “party fraud and coercion.” Instead, Amazon proposed setting up a tent in the warehouse parking lot, testing all participants for COVID, conducting temperature screening, and monitoring the line for social distancing, either using a “digital assistant” or with human teams. Amazon also proposed renting a floor of a local hotel for NLRB election agents and providing them with chauffeurs and food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cw8oCj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I have never seen Amazon fight for something like this.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LCw3bs"&gt;On Friday, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22268280/amazon-nlrb-denied-union-election-alabama-warehouse"&gt;NLRB denied&lt;/a&gt; Amazon’s appeal, reaffirming its position that mail voting is safer, and that letting Amazon rent out hotels and monitor voting lines would create an impression of bias and surveillance. Ballots will be sent out February 8th and need to be returned by March 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="FOHr0O"&gt;Amazon will undoubtedly continue its anti-union campaign, though it can no longer hold mandatory meetings on company time now that ballots have been sent out. But the BHM1 organizers are optimistic about their chances and about what a victory will mean for Amazon workers elsewhere. “I hope they’re watching what’s going on,” says Richardson. “And that they stand strong, they stick together, and do what they need to do to try to make it better there, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PIH6j"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>E3 2021 may be digital as ESA says it’s ‘transforming’ the gaming showcase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WVURhht5P1Ja8MDkQkKcbpnKKbk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787987/acastro_190531_1777_e3_lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="syw46E"&gt;The Entertainment Software Association has announced that E3 2021 is happening this year, and it could be going digital, &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/e3-pushes-forward-with-plans-for-a-digital-2021-event/amp/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Video Games Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The event will be held from June 15th through June 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KljMd9"&gt;“We can confirm that we are transforming the E3 experience for 2021,” an ESA spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And will soon share exact details on how we’re bringing the global video game community together.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfs37P"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Video Games Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;, the ESA has outlined its plans for E3 2021, with intentions to hold multiple two-hour keynote sessions from games partners, an awards show, a preview night on June 14th, plus some small streams from various game publishers, influencers, and media partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84udVn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video Games Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; also notes that the ESA’s outline proposes that the broadcast event would be supplemented by media previews the week before, and game demos slated to appear at the event would be released on consumer platforms. The ESA would also allow partner companies to remotely stream playable game demos to the media across “thousands” of scheduled meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5N3xQL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can confirm that we are transforming the E3 experience for 2021”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qOZUes"&gt;While the entire plan sounds ambitious, it still requires approval from ESA’s membership, which is made up of some of the industry's biggest companies, which also hold significant influence over the structure of the event. Traditionally, E3 has been one of the biggest weeks in the gaming industry, with the event showcasing some of the year's largest announcements. However, in recent years, the ESA has faced pressure with redefining E3 as major publishers, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063737/sony-ps5-e3-2020-skip-again-launch-new-console-generation"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;, have opted to skip the event entirely in favor of hosting its own events around the week E3 is normally held. Following E3’s cancellation, many digital events were held to fill the void, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21243981/summer-game-fest-news-events-geoff-keighley-sony-microsoft"&gt;Summer Games Fest&lt;/a&gt; hosted by industry veteran Geoff Keighley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21OcVK"&gt;This is the first time the ESA is holding E3 after the organization &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21163570/e3-canceled-coronavirus-outbreak-xbox-nintendo"&gt;canceled E3 2020&lt;/a&gt; due to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. But E3 is not the only event that plans to go digital this year due to the pandemic; Activision Blizzard plans to host an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449517/blizzconline-blizzcon-blizzard-entertainment-event-convention-19-20-date"&gt;online-only BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; from February 19th through February 20th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Kaitlin Hatton?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_nva1kx3i753k7aqG9zbj0FbAWY=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67375083/khatton_200826_4171_0010_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘Is meatball an fruit?’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6bAL14"&gt;Like many businesses, the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has largely decamped to our homes. Starting in early March, we packed up our laptops and headphones, and we are now working from home offices, dining room tables, desks set up in the corners of bedrooms, or living room sofas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAMMnn"&gt;We thought it would be fun to find out, six months later, what adjustments the staff has made to their various living quarters in order to be able to turn out the same journalism that was formerly produced in an office setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGoGYf"&gt;For this article, we talked to &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; social media manager Kaitlin Hatton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqAnWw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaitlin, what does a social media manager do, actually?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="em4NoD"&gt;I handle everything from analytics to posting across all of our platforms, with a bunch of responsibilities in between. I tend to focus on our &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/verge/"&gt;Instagram accounts&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VergeDeals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; Deals&lt;/a&gt; Twitter account, so if you’ve ever wondered who is behind the screen for those profiles, that would be me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCB0ab"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking at the photos of your desk, I have to tell you that’s a great space. Was that an existing setup or did you put it together once you knew you’d be working at home?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8zi4t"&gt;Thank you! The situation around my setup is unique in that it came about when I switched from being in Vox Media’s office full-time while I lived in New York City to going entirely remote and moving to Ohio. I had always envisioned what I wanted my workspace to look like at home, but I wasn’t able to actually act on it until I moved. So everything from the setup to relocating was a fresh start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSV8UG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love the view out your window.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmIrdy"&gt;The large windows are my favorite part of the apartment — especially since I’m home all the time now. I spend a lot of time at my desk, and the natural light is a lifesaver.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQMjXEYG4cE67w7srpFGBqOfDJU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21845696/khatton_200826_4171_0017.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m66sGx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joERzR"&gt;Believe it or not, the desk is actually a Facebook Marketplace find. I was on a tight budget from moving and trying to be eco-conscious with some of my furniture choices. I made a pact with myself that I would try to find something that fits my needs and aesthetic secondhand first before buying new. I ended up really lucking out on this desk because it was $25, is incredibly spacious, and it’s been super sturdy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wT8hjE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What Are the Best Office and Desk Chairs Under $250?","url":"https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-desk-office-chairs-under-250.html"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8cKn9k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s great. It’s hard to find something that useful secondhand. Is the chair secondhand as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk7Jzc"&gt;It’s not! It’s from a set of dining chairs that I purchased new. I decided it was more comfortable than my previous desk chair so I swapped them out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bez4dZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think you’ll be looking around for a “real” desk chair? Or is this one comfortable enough to last you for a while?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5j2rX"&gt;It’s actually pretty comfortable so I’m going to keep it around for a while!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxg1xa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, can you tell me about your tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hW1hTW"&gt;Yes! The most crucial items that I need for work are my 2017 MacBook Pro, my external Dell monitor, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OWC-Thunderbolt-3-Pro-Dock/dp/B081K9J5FV/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OWC Thunderbolt 3 dock&lt;/a&gt; that I use to connect them. As a social media manager, I have to keep a lot of different websites and platforms up at all times so I’d be lost without a second screen. Unfortunately, my laptop is about to be sent off for repair because it’s missing the H key. It just popped off one day! As a solution, I’m using another Apple keyboard and mouse so my desk is a little crowded at the moment. (&lt;em&gt;Note: since this was written, Kaitlin reports that her H key has been fixed&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3tm1m"&gt;I also keep my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/ref=sr_1_3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DPMXZZ7/ref=s9_acsd_al_bw_c2_x_5_i?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt; within close reach so I can just grab them as I move around the apartment throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pv1kPh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s interesting that you grab for your Kindle rather than your phone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xvDF3"&gt;I wear an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-watch-series-3%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21409065%2Fremote-work-desk-setup-from-home-office-tech#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; nearly every day, so unless I need to post to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Instagram accounts, I tend to just leave my phone around since I’ll see texts coming in anyway. I’m always reading books so I like to make sure my Kindle is around me in case I have some spare time to use it. It’s ancient; I’ve had it for years, but it’s still chugging along just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1fs19j"&gt;

&lt;p id="yHuwAX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And you knew I was going to ask: “Is meatball an fruit?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JanYp"&gt;Honestly, it’s one of the best things I own! I’m a major &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406041/post-malone-envy-gaming-dallas-empire-fuel"&gt;Post Malone&lt;/a&gt; fan, for starters. Then several acquaintances of mine in the social media management sphere were getting these plaques with their favorite inspirational tweets on them. The only tweet I could think of that I wanted to look at every day was this one. It’s truly iconic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mAuXI9"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x2TKI1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a beautiful decoration on the back of your monitor. What is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUB7kl"&gt;Thanks! It’s an embroidered coffin! Halloween is my favorite holiday, and I refuse to limit my celebration of it to just October. So I keep little, subtle holiday decorations up year-round. I got this one from a local artist at an art fair last year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zVAYK9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s lovely. Okay, just two more questions. First: is your desk always this neat? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndGP5F"&gt;Ha! Yes! I like to call myself an accidental minimalist. I unintentionally own relatively few things, so it’s easy for me to stay tidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbkLsR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second: is there anything you’d like to change or add to the current setup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJtSlM"&gt;I’ve actually been thinking about that a lot recently. I think I’d like to add some LED strip lights to my desk in some way so I can light up the rest of my living room with a pretty color. I’d also like to find a cable box to hide my mess of cords that are currently tucked in the corner behind me. I’ve never been one for cable management until I put my desk out in the open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huPnmQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 8th, 2021, 11AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on September 9th, 2020.

    <title>This $300 Meowth turns a meme into a five-foot-tall plushie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SB9TJPBgxmldZvI1n5Ggd78xLwo=/0x342:1500x1342/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787975/P6480_701_06559_06.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lvQsEQ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/701-06559/gigantamax-meowth-poke-plush-65-in"&gt;Pokémon Center&lt;/a&gt; is selling a Gigantamax Meowth that, while not true to size, is still pretty damn big. This Long Meowth measures 65 inches, which is just over five feet, and has a “dangerous smile.” A bad boy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jJt9j"&gt;Gigantamax Meowth is a 1:20 scale version of its &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Sword&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shield &lt;/em&gt;counterpart, and it costs $299.99 for the pleasure of its company. Now the bad news: it’s currently sold out. Will it restock? I have no idea, but kudos to the unknown number of people who dropped $300 for a 5-foot-something body pillow. If this isn’t love, I don’t know what is:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pcU29eTHYf5FbTF-qFbV3wH_J14=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22289982/P6480_701_06559_05.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cQQeo0"&gt;I’m not thrilled that there is no light in Meowth’s eyes, but who can blame him. At least it’s better than &lt;a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/yeah-this-is-the-week-for-a-centipikachu-plush-1845990716"&gt;Pikachu centipede&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Section 230 turns 25 today, and it’s never been more important</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GiO1ERgV20OQzhAj_L2az-7MMKE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787967/VRG_ILLO_4341_American_Ethernet.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The real questions behind Section 230 reform&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="EtZZM2"&gt;On February 8th, 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Communications Decency Act, a sweeping regulatory framework for the internet. Almost all of the CDA was found unconstitutional, but what remained allowed the nascent web to flourish. It’s called Section 230 — and for the past quarter-century, it’s shaped the internet for better and worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bdbk2G"&gt;Section 230 protects any owner or user of an “interactive computer service” — typically an app or website — from liability for content that someone else posted. Over the past few years, it’s drawn the ire of conservative politicians who want to punish “Big Tech” for banning users, but also lawmakers and activists who say it lets web services knowingly allow harassment, nonconsensual sexual imagery, and other illegal material. Congress has introduced several major reform proposals, and at least one will likely advance in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGnDyV"&gt;The debate over Section 230, though, is a lot more complicated than one law or a few giant social networks. In the coming weeks, &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/thevergelive/thevergearticle"&gt;we’ll be hosting a live event&lt;/a&gt; with some of the people that Congress’ fight over Big Tech has left out — trying to reset the conversation to be less about Facebook and YouTube and more about the internet at large. But for now, on the 25th anniversary of Section 230 becoming law, I want to look at a few of the big questions that any proposal will have to grapple with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="d2TT7z"&gt;Section 230 versus the First Amendment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NwLtAA"&gt;One of the pithiest tech policy commentaries is a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/pageoneplus/corrections-august-7-2019.html"&gt;2019 correction in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. On August 6th, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/technology/section-230-hate-speech.html"&gt;published a long article&lt;/a&gt; about “why hate speech on the internet is a never-ending problem,” &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190806/20524742733/ny-times-joins-lots-other-media-sites-totally-completely-misrepresenting-section-230.shtml"&gt;explaining in a subheader&lt;/a&gt; that it was “because [Section 230] protects it.” The next day, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; soberly noted that hate speech is actually shielded by a different law: the First Amendment. It’s a fact that gets &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201030/09165945621/your-problem-is-not-with-section-230-1st-amendment.shtml"&gt;frequently, bizarrely glossed over&lt;/a&gt; in Section 230 debates — but is unavoidable in any debate about dangerous content online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84oz55"&gt;Section 230 shields sites from liability for illegal content, but a lot of bad speech simply &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; illegal under current laws. It’s legal to claim COVID-19 is a hoax or the election was stolen, unless that claim involves something like selling a scam cure or libeling a voting machine company. It’s legal to leave a racist Facebook comment or wish cancer on somebody in an email, unless you’ve been persistently harassing them. And it’s legal to ban users from a website for doing any of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lOP7OQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lots of online abuse is harmful but still legal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tXurlo"&gt;This doesn’t make online abuse or disinformation less potentially harmful, especially when it’s happening at a huge scale. But courts have interpreted the First Amendment as a broad shield against the government banning or punishing speech. Section 230 can’t overrule those protections to make companies remove offensive but legal content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40Yw72"&gt;Some critics explicitly acknowledge this fact. That includes legal scholar Mary Anne Franks, who has called for a &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90365443/mary-anne-franks-cult-constitution-free-speech"&gt;narrower interpretation of the First Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Tim Wu, who has argued that current speech law doesn’t account for &lt;a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/tim-wu-first-amendment-obsolete"&gt;how modern censorship works online&lt;/a&gt;. Many politicians haven’t, though — including President Joe Biden, who wants to repeal Section 230 to stop Facebook disinformation, or his deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed, who &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/why-section-230-hurts-kids"&gt;appears to think&lt;/a&gt; repeal will make YouTube axe &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/culture/2017/11/21/16685874/kids-youtube-video-elsagate-creepiness-psychology"&gt;creepy &lt;em&gt;Peppa Pig&lt;/em&gt; parodies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4Yqsb"&gt;Changing Section 230 would affect (for better or worse) how sites handle potential libel, child sexual abuse material, or &lt;a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2020/01/armslist-unlicensed-gun-sales-engaged-in-the-business/"&gt;illegal gun sales&lt;/a&gt;. But for hateful content, disinformation, and tough-to-define offenses like inciting violence, the question isn’t when people can sue Facebook. It’s whether the American conception of free speech itself needs to change. And that’s a much riskier, more complicated proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7Zx7BX"&gt;Big Tech versus Dark Corners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="w1cm1s"&gt;To repurpose a couple of massively overused buzzwords, bad content online is concentrated in a couple of places: “Big Tech” and “the dark corners of the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K59qUM"&gt;Big web services — particularly giants like Facebook and YouTube, but also midsized platforms like Grindr and Tripadvisor — have a specific set of problems. While most of their content is innocuous, they’re too big to moderate perfectly, granting a megaphone to a fraction of abusive, dangerous users. They’re often highly automated and include recommendation and sorting features that shape what people see online, sometimes in unpredictably negative ways. And being banned from the biggest networks can seriously impact your ability to connect with friends, family members, and businesses. At worst, the platforms are confusingly moderated and unresponsive to complaints about harassment or illegal material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZfH7om"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Indifference and hostility are different problems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CLqXNo"&gt;Small, toxic sites pose different issues. These might be neo-Nazi forums that encourage racist abuse, niche communities that solicit nonconsensual pornography, or blogs devoted to abusive and libelous rumors. They’re openly hostile to content moderation and host small but devotedly vicious communities. Most people will never visit these sites, but their actions bleed across the web through defamatory search results, organized harassment campaigns, or the swapping of “revenge porn” and child sexual abuse material. Sometimes Big Tech and the Dark Corners collide — as with the violent conspiracy movement QAnon, which launched on 4chan but gained mainstream reach through Facebook. (Again, as discussed above, not all this content is illegal.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SV5jo8"&gt;Lawmakers have framed Section 230 as almost exclusively a “Big Tech” issue so far, introducing bills clearly aimed at fixing specific problems with Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. Section 230 supporters have validly argued that this could hurt smaller, well-meaning businesses. But this framing is also bad for people who support &lt;em&gt;changing&lt;/em&gt; the law because it ignores an important piece of the online ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dmqxmw"&gt;“Lock it up” versus “burn it down”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oZxKUu"&gt;If Congress successfully changes Section 230 so websites are held liable for harmful content posted by users, there are two very broad possible outcomes for the internet. In one case, our current online giants get more power and tighter restrictions; in the other, Silicon Valley’s basic business model no longer works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBjZYN"&gt;The first is a world even more dominated by a few big, familiar sites and apps. Amazon, Facebook, and Google will have the resources to hire giant moderation teams and run complicated automated takedown systems or to fight lawsuits over their content. If Facebook or another company comes up with a functional system, it could offer it as a service to smaller sites — which could either adopt that (likely strict) framework or simply shut down their forums and comment sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QOW2Mi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lots of people like social media&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WJ5Inn"&gt;That’s a double-edged sword. Twitter might be more likely to act on borderline threats or harassment, for instance, but movements like #MeToo would be nearly impossible if abusers could silence accusations with a simple complaint form. (Pirated content gets limited Section 230 protections already, and the result has been an unwieldy and exploitable automated takedown system.) Sites that thrive on unverified gossip could be shut down, but so could legitimate venues for consumer complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYFvqg"&gt;Despite plenty of often deserved criticism, people still have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21144680/verge-tech-survey-2020-trust-privacy-security-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;overwhelmingly favorable opinions&lt;/a&gt; of major social media companies. And a more buttoned-up online landscape would almost certainly mean a lot more content getting taken down by accident — almost inevitably including a lot of silly but joyful stuff like &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2021/1/19/22233525/sea-shanty-tiktok-wellerman-song"&gt;sea shanties&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166215/ratatouille-the-tiktok-musical-broadway-show-todaytix-streaming-one-night-date-viral-disney"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; musical&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juB1Au"&gt;In the end, though, it would look roughly like the internet we know today. But there’s a second, much weirder option, even if Silicon Valley’s lobbying power makes it unlikely. Legal scholar Jeff Kosseff has called Section 230 “the 26 words that created the internet,” and it’s an apt description. Section 230 created a web where sites (both commercial &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;nonprofit) can rapidly scale based on user-generated content, drawing millions or billions of users, then fleshing out a moderation policy and enforcement team as they grow. If mega-services are deemed essentially “unsafe at any speed,” that changes some basic assumptions about how you launch and grow a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="B4r83f"&gt;Whether you think that’s good or bad, it’s the kind of stakes that changing Section 230 deals in — and Congress needs to spend more time talking about what that means.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Forza Horizon 4 is coming to Steam on March 9th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OzVV1ODknHgMCMJ_3KhWWMFXDfE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787867/FH4_Steam_Hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gAic9I"&gt;Microsoft is bringing &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4&lt;/em&gt; to Steam on March 9th. It marks the first time the &lt;em&gt;Forza&lt;/em&gt; franchise has been available on Steam, and it will include crossplay with players on Xbox consoles, the regular Windows 10 version, and those streaming &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4 &lt;/em&gt;through xCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gaj0bA"&gt;Playground Games has been gradually improving &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4 &lt;/em&gt;with expansions and a battle royale-like mode. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17763904/forza-horizon-4-halo-experience-warthog-cortana-master-chief"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; driving experience&lt;/a&gt; even appeared in the game a few years ago, and the &lt;em&gt;Lego Speed Champions&lt;/em&gt; expansion includes brick cars and scenery. A new Hot Wheels car pack is also coming soon, which will include a number of new cars for $10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VW760s"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;em&gt;Forza &lt;/em&gt;embrace of Steam comes after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645250/microsoft-xbox-game-studios-publishing-valve-steam-32-bit-windows"&gt;reversed course nearly three years ago&lt;/a&gt;, promising to distribute more Xbox titles through Steam. &lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18261723/halo-the-master-chief-collection-pc-release-steam-halo-reach"&gt;arrived on Steam&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, followed by &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21266626/sea-of-thieves-steam-release-date-pc-microsoft"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, all three titles are now regularly found in the &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=topsellers"&gt;top sellers list on Steam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s former hardware leader reportedly now overseeing AR and VR devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/klMt9jF_kf-_Tow_QGka1g6QJgg=/0x0:1960x1307/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787831/Apple_dan_riccio_begins_a_new_chapter_at_apple_01252020_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5zoIYV"&gt;Apple’s former hardware leader, Dan Riccio, is now overseeing the company’s still-secretive work on augmented and virtual reality products, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/apple-s-riccio-shifts-from-hardware-chief-to-ar-vr-headsets"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Riccio &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249393/apple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new"&gt;stepped back from Apple last month&lt;/a&gt;, after serving as senior vice president of hardware engineering since 2012. At the time, Riccio said he would remain at the company with a focus on “creating something new,” but he didn’t say what that would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DSeCo"&gt;Mike Rockwell, who &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-19/apple-team-working-on-vr-and-ar-headset-and-ar-glasses"&gt;runs Apple’s AR / VR group&lt;/a&gt;, is still responsible for day-to-day development of these upcoming products, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. But Riccio reportedly has “ultimate oversight” of Apple’s first hardware to enter the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5n4AV"&gt;There have been reports for years indicating that Apple is working on AR and VR hardware. That’s been buoyed by Apple’s continued investments in AR on its iPhones and iPads, plus some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/10/14581428/apple-tim-cook-ar-vr-product-reveal-interview"&gt;coy remarks&lt;/a&gt; from CEO Tim Cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e22N1o"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;latest reports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242131/apple-vr-headset-2022-fabric-design-fan-price-details-rumors"&gt;suggest that&lt;/a&gt; Apple plans to first debut an expensive virtual reality headset as a stepping stone on the path toward a more impressive augmented reality device. &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt; that the VR device could sell for $3,000 and launch in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok secures music from Universal’s ‘full catalog’ of artists</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7CZodYL-_VqjvlachUKZ8oLrr4o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787499/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gFbh0S"&gt;Today, TikTok and Universal Music Group (UMG) &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-and-universal-music-group-announce-expanded-global-alliance"&gt;have announced&lt;/a&gt; the formation of what they’re calling an “expanded global alliance.” It’s a continuation and deepening of the agreement that allows TikTok’s massive user base to use songs from UMG artists. “The companies have additionally pledged to experiment with exciting new features,” the companies write in &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-and-universal-music-group-announce-expanded-global-alliance"&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “TikTok users will now be able to incorporate clips from UMG’s full catalog of music, spanning the company’s iconic labels, songwriters and global territories.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZjeQF"&gt;It’s a smart move. TikTokers get to use more of the music they love as the soundtrack for their videos, the artists behind the works get paid, and UMG gets greater access to a proven viral hit-making machine. For better or for worse, TikTok is one of the biggest drivers of breakout hits online; if a song blows up on the app, it feels like it’s basically guaranteed a spot on the charts. (Though, of course, that’s not always true.) It’s also a sign that the music industry is recognizing that online influencers matter to their bottom lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSToGG"&gt;The UMG deal follows other deals with major sectors of the music industry. In the last year, TikTok has forged similar partnerships with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21546323/tiktok-sony-music-licensing-deal-labels-app"&gt;Sony Music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21077363/tiktok-licensing-deal-merlin-digital-rights-indie-music-selection-access"&gt;Merlin&lt;/a&gt; (which represents a large portion of indie labels), and &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9508010/deals-tik-tok-warner-music-melodyvr-napster/"&gt;Warner Music Group&lt;/a&gt; — and it means that TikTok now has deals with the companies that represent just about all of popular music. Which is all to say that to the music business, TikTok has become too important to fail. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.5 lets you set Spotify and others as Siri’s default music service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T6IeGHeKTTljO-afekPg5RDNRFY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787430/acastro_180510_1777_siri_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1bFUT2"&gt;iOS 14.5 looks like it will be packed with features, including the ability to use your Apple Watch to unlock an iPhone with Face ID &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260639/apple-watch-iphone-unlocked-ios-14-5-app-tracking"&gt;while you’re wearing a mask&lt;/a&gt; and support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260671/ios-14-5-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support"&gt;next-gen console controllers&lt;/a&gt;. But users who have already installed the beta discovered another great feature: you’ll be able to select a third-party default music service when you ask to play a song using Siri — including Spotify (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/ios-14-5-beta-siri-default-music-service/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGyfC3"&gt;When you ask Siri to play a song on iOS 14.5, you may be prompted to select which app you want to use to play it, according to a screenshot shared &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/ldzar3/siri_asking_which_music_service_to_use_afterwards/"&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zfQAOhlEGHRcytTJd0XDUegcND8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22289406/k04jlih7hvf61__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/ldzar3/siri_asking_which_music_service_to_use_afterwards/" target="_blank"&gt;u/matejamm1 on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The menu to select an app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q5dm3P"&gt;I’m on the iOS 14.5 beta, but interestingly, the feature worked a bit differently for me. I asked Siri to play some Tame Impala, and I wasn’t presented with a list of apps to choose from, like in the screenshot above. Instead, I was shown a prompt asking for access to my Spotify data, which I allowed. After that, requests for songs went through Spotify without any prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVr5dy"&gt;Other users on Reddit have reported some differences in the feature’s behavior as well, so there may still be some kinks for Apple to iron out ahead of iOS 14.5’s public release. Because this feature is still in beta, there’s always a chance it could be changed or removed before iOS 14.5 comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIcQN6"&gt;The ability to set a default music app follows Apple’s welcome move to let users set their default mail or browser clients &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299342/apple-ipados14-default-apps-email-browser-choice-features-wwdc-2020"&gt;starting with iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;. You’re able to set default mail or browser apps in settings, but I haven’t found a way to set a default music app in settings. Maybe Apple will add that down the line. Still, having the option to set a default music player for Siri requests in this beta is a nice step forward. Here’s hoping Apple lets users set more defaults in future updates.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Terraria co-creator says Stadia version is canceled after losing access to Google accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="terraria" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-_fp59WvR9A5N77hcaEZfzI5R8U=/65x0:736x447/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787394/RomTerraria__800px.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SnG3uk"&gt;Andrew Spinks, the co-creator of &lt;em&gt;Terraria,&lt;/em&gt; announced that his studio would no longer be working on a Google Stadia port of the game, he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Demilogic/status/1358661840402845696?s=20"&gt;announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. The reason: his studio, Re-Logic, has been locked out of its associated Google and YouTube accounts for “over three weeks” without any explanation and with little recourse from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYe9n1"&gt;Early Monday, Spinks tweeted that he had “not done anything to violate your terms of service, so I can take this no other way than you deciding to burn this bridge.” In the thread, Spinks says the lockout has cost him access to “thousands of dollars of apps” he purchased, and his Gmail account, which he used for more than 15 years, is gone, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l3Veaq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I absolutely have not done anything to violate your terms of service, so I can take this no other way than you deciding to burn this bridge. Consider it burned. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Terraria?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Terraria&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleStadia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GoogleStadia&lt;/a&gt; is canceled. My company will no longer support any of your platforms moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;— Andrew Spinks (@Demilogic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Demilogic/status/1358661842147692549?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D2XAGo"&gt;According to Spinks, he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Terraria_Logic/status/1354261817904816128"&gt;first flagged&lt;/a&gt; that he lost access to his accounts on or around January 16th and even used the game’s official Twitter account to call on YouTube to provide additional information, but to no avail. The official &lt;em&gt;Terraria &lt;/em&gt;account did have a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1354207808460357641?s=20"&gt;perplexing back-and-forth with the @TeamYouTube account&lt;/a&gt; on January 26th, but there appears to have been little help offered beyond the suggestion that the team follow standard account recovery guides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSzxy4"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o42KTO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terraria&lt;/em&gt; is a side-scrolling action-adventure sandbox game that was initially released in 2011 on PC. Despite the game being almost 10 years old, it still receives updates and has been ported to multiple platforms, with the most recent being in 2019 on the Nintendo Switch. The game is also available on Android devices and is one of the many games available on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20878843/google-play-pass-bundles-350-android-games-and-apps-for-4-99-per-month"&gt;Google’s Apple Arcade competitor, Play Pass&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVcxqf"&gt;The cancellation of a Stadia port for &lt;em&gt;Terraria&lt;/em&gt; comes at a challenging time for Google Stadia: last week, the company announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;closing its in-house development studio&lt;/a&gt; and said it would rely instead solely on third-party developers. The cloud gaming service is also losing one of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254897/stadia-timed-exclusive-crayta-pc-port-state-share-beta"&gt;biggest exclusives, &lt;em&gt;Crayta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as its timed exclusivity deal is slated to end soon. &lt;/p&gt;
