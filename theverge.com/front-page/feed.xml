    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDk8Qx"&gt;When Infosys announced construction on its &lt;a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/27/mike-pence-infosys-jobs-indianapolis-campus/556359002/"&gt;planned headquarters in Indianapolis&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, it was a coup for the Trump administration. Although few have heard of the company today, Infosys is an IT firm best known for outsourcing jobs from the US to India in the ’80s and ’90s, the same sort of company Trump targeted &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/us/politics/transcript-trump-immigration-speech.html"&gt;during his campaign&lt;/a&gt; and through &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/04/trumps-executive-order-wont-give-tech-clarity-h-1b-visas/"&gt;executive orders&lt;/a&gt; as president. Good American jobs were being moved overseas by firms like Infosys, according to Trump. Now, they would be bringing &lt;a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/money/2018/04/26/infosys-campus-jobs-indianapolis-mike-pence-eric-holcomb-joe-hogsett/550067002/"&gt;3,000&lt;/a&gt; jobs to Indiana and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/business/infosys-hire-10000-american-workers.html"&gt;10,000 jobs&lt;/a&gt; nationwide — well-paying tech jobs at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwyCKK"&gt;For Infosys’ president, Ravi Kumar, the new headquarters was just one part of a larger project to revitalize the American dream. “The American dream is all about, ‘I could start anywhere, but I could be a CEO of a company or I could literally reach the top of the ladder as long as I have the capability and potential,’” Kumar told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. He outlined an ambitious plan to not just hire entry-level workers but &lt;a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/biz-tech/2018/04/27/infosys-announces-new-training-center-in-indianapolis-to-create-ik-additional-jobs.html"&gt;train them, too&lt;/a&gt;, in partnership with Indiana’s Purdue University, as well as colleges across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2YSq8"&gt;One of Infosys’ many recruits was Josh, who joined the company at the height of the pandemic after graduating college. (The names of the Infosys employees quoted in this article have been changed to protect their anonymity, out of fear of retaliation.) But although Infosys hired Josh and paid for his salary, it’s difficult to say that Josh &lt;em&gt;worked&lt;/em&gt; for the company. Instead, he spent much of his time at Infosys on what the company referred to as the Bench. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKmUwx"&gt;Infosys is a consulting firm and assigns employees to specific clients. When Infosys has more employees than it needs for its clients, those spare employees end up on the Bench, where they are, in effect, paid to do nothing. And as Infosys has ramped up its hiring of American workers, many of those workers found themselves getting paid to not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ebpP0d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It feels like I am being wasted, I could be doing more, and I’m not”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p id="mCtkIe"&gt;At first, being on the Bench had its perks, particularly for Josh, who worked remotely due to the pandemic. “I ended up playing a lot of video games,” he said. But his time on the Bench began to wear on him for reasons he found difficult to describe to his family and friends. “It was really hard to explain to them why I felt like it was a bad thing,” Josh said. “They were just like… ‘Well, you’re getting paid to do nothing, how could that be bad? That sounds like a dream job.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEh2N4"&gt;Far from a dream job, Josh found his time on the Bench to be quite stressful. Infosys said that the company would place him on a client project, but Josh didn’t know when that would happen or whether the project would involve the software engineering skills he learned in college. “They don’t keep you up to date on a daily basis,” Josh said. “Sometimes, you can go for a week without hearing them, so you have no sense if any progress is being made toward getting you on a project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2Hph7"&gt;Josh spent a total of six months on the Bench, during which he constantly checked his computer to see if he had been assigned a project. “While you’re on the Bench, your one job is to respond when people try and contact you,” Josh said. “Days can go by where there’s nothing coming from the laptop or the phone that you need to respond to, and yet you feel kind of chained to it. There’s a good chance that you could be called or sent an email that says you have an interview in four hours. That was what happened to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryKElg"&gt;Josh was relatively lucky. He was eventually placed on a project, and although the work was what he described as “bottom-rung type of labor,” it was at least a software development project, meaning he got to stick with what he studied in college. Not everyone who worked at Infosys could say the same. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; interviewed 15 current and former Infosys workers, who all asked to remain anonymous due to fear of retaliation from their employers. The experiences they described were varied, in part due to opaque Infosys policies that were applied inconsistently for different employees. Some described moving across the country in search of assignments, while others were put on projects that were completely unrelated to the skillsets they had been hired for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIs5vM"&gt;But one common experience for many Infosys employees is the Bench. And while the Bench might have benefits in the short term, the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZpvJibVZSY"&gt;Infoscions&lt;/a&gt;, as the company’s employees are called, are keenly aware that spending too long on the Bench might damage their career prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s6YFOQ"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TG4wBO"&gt;“Whether or not you like sitting around and doing nothing and collecting a paycheck, at some point, it’s going to end, and when that ends, somebody is going to ask you what you did during that period of employment,” Josh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQLYwC"&gt;By most accounts, Infosys’ pivot to hiring American workers has been a success. In 2020, Infosys announced that it had exceeded its initial goal and had &lt;a href="https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/2020/american-jobs-commitment.html"&gt;hired 13,000 employees&lt;/a&gt; nationwide. Then, in the midst of a pandemic at the time, Infosys made a commitment to hiring an &lt;a href="https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/2020/american-jobs-commitment.html"&gt;additional 12,000 employees&lt;/a&gt; to bring the total to 25,000. Unlike other tech companies, the hires weren’t experienced programmers but were typically recent college graduates or workers for whom Infosys would be their first tech job. “We strongly believed that we could train anybody who has the potential, aptitude, and the attitude,” Kumar said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDb3A5"&gt;But for the new hires, many of whom had recently graduated from an education system that teaches young people to tie their self-worth to their job, it was hard to see Infosys as a reincarnation of the American dream. Entering the workplace but not working felt infantilizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0En2K1"&gt;To Josh, working at Infosys felt “almost like I never really graduated.” Like the practice assignments he had done in school, his time on the Bench felt devoid of the responsibility he thought would come with a full-time job. “It does really mess with your sense of being an adult,” Josh said. “The money isn’t really the main part of it that felt weird to me. It’s just the lack of responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BveMLp"&gt;The Bench was taking an emotional, almost existential toll on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mygfn0"&gt;“It feels like I am being wasted, I could be doing more, and I’m not,” Josh said. “That’s the part that feels bad. I want to do things, but I can’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwwP1H"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f3CjsMLLdnyY8HENXLwezm5gBGk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067492/CHAIN_SPOT.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="9spM5B"&gt;Founded in &lt;a href="https://www.infosys.com/about/history.html"&gt;1981&lt;/a&gt; and headquartered in Bangalore, India, Infosys has become &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/magazine/its-a-flat-world-after-all.html"&gt;synonymous with globalization&lt;/a&gt;. The company allowed corporations in the US to employ lower-cost workers remotely, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080506084241/http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1652689_1652372_1652367,00.html"&gt;pioneering &lt;/a&gt;a business model &lt;a href="https://story.californiasunday.com/infosys-india-tech/"&gt;known as&lt;/a&gt; the “global delivery model” or, more informally, “your mess for less.” The model split the tech industry in two: the more complex jobs would be done in the US by highly skilled and highly paid engineers, while the jobs companies didn’t care about went overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40xeqU"&gt;The key to Infosys’ success in India was its ability to hire entry-level workers and train them for software engineering jobs. “Even today, no company has training like we have at Infosys,” said company founder Narayana Murthy in &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=8GstDwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PT55&amp;amp;lpg=PT55&amp;amp;dq=%22Even+today,+no+company+has+training+like+we+had+at+Infosys.+We+take+people+through+eight+months+of+training.+We+have+the+world%27s+largest+training+facility%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=VkHzcYn8OU&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U3VIzMcnotmt6G2cuAZHSJbQ-Tpmg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiK1PzL3qbyAhUtn-AKHbXBDl4Q6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22Even%20today%2C%20no%20company%20has%20training%20like%20we%20had%20at%20Infosys.%20We%20take%20people%20through%20eight%20months%20of%20training.%20We%20have%20the%20world's%20largest%20training%20facility%22&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;a history of innovation in India&lt;/a&gt;. “We have the world’s largest training facility; nobody else in the world has anything like this.” (Infosys’ record &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/saritharai/2014/01/08/indias-top-outsourcing-firm-tcs-building-worlds-largest-corporate-training-facility/?sh=6e79614032d3"&gt;has since been taken by TCS&lt;/a&gt;, a different Indian outsourcing company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q04K2J"&gt;The emphasis on training made sense because many of the jobs companies were outsourcing were jobs that previously would have been given to entry-level employees. “One of the funny things is that we, as a country, essentially fueled the technology rise of India, of China, of Eastern Europe,” said Jacob Hsu, the CEO of the US-based staffing firm Catalyte who previously was the CEO of the international staffing firm Symbio. “A lot of that was driven because we sent a lot of the entry-level work overseas.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ao3JF"&gt;Another key to the model: salaries in India were much lower than they were in the United States. But wages in countries like India have been &lt;a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/rising-salaries-may-dent-it-rd-offshoring-to-india/articleshow/3337964.cms"&gt;gradually&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://supplychaindigital.com/supply-chain-2/india-no-longer-cheapest-outsourcing-location"&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt;, and the math of the “labor arbitrage” that previously made moving to India a no-brainer is slowly making less and less sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8bAUl"&gt;But even if labor costs no longer give offshoring the same advantages it had decades ago, the model of “your mess for less,” or of giving undesirable tasks to other companies, still holds sway in corporate America. It’s just that today, that mess for less can be done with American labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TTHf2"&gt;Previously, Infosys preferred not to hire Americans at all. The company was a frequent sponsor of the H-1B visa, which allowed the company to bring its Indian employees to the US. The visa came with a number of conditions: companies needed to pay their employees a &lt;a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/h-1b-visas-and-prevailing-wage-levels/"&gt;prevailing wage&lt;/a&gt;, and employees needed to meet &lt;a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/h-1b-specialty-occupations"&gt;minimum educational requirements&lt;/a&gt;. In 2020, Infosys’ 3,528 H-1B visas placed it second on the &lt;a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/the-h-1b-visa-program-remains-the-outsourcing-visa-more-than-half-of-the-top-30-h-1b-employers-were-outsourcing-firms/"&gt;list of the companies&lt;/a&gt; that had the most H-1B visas approved. The company in first place, Amazon, is an American tech company, but “more than half” of the top 30 H-1B sponsors were outsourcing firms that competed with Infosys, &lt;a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/the-h-1b-visa-program-remains-the-outsourcing-visa-more-than-half-of-the-top-30-h-1b-employers-were-outsourcing-firms/"&gt;according to one report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSSw3c"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxiE1q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cJdJ4h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are continuing to do what we are doing in spite of the fact that there is a new administration in the US”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p id="ECfqdr"&gt;It’s unclear whether staffing firms like Infosys are using the H-1B visa for the reasons it was originally intended for. The H-1B visa was created in 1990 to “bring in high-skilled workers who could complement the skills of US workers,” said Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. “The sense at the time was that there were growing industries in the United States in areas that the US wanted to develop to be globally competitive, but there weren’t necessarily enough US workers who [were] qualified and ready to fill those jobs.” Whether the work that companies outsource to firms like Infosys is aligned with the original intention of the H-1B visa program is somewhat up for debate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i38ZZh"&gt;On one hand, the jobs often require college degrees and some technical knowledge; on the other, many of the Infosys employees interviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; saw the positions as menial and certainly entry-level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nW19ZJ"&gt;Infosys has run into trouble with visa rules. In 2013, the company &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edtx/pr/indian-corporation-pays-record-amount-settle-allegations-systemic-visa-fraud-and-abuse"&gt;settled a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; with the US Department of Justice, which alleged that Infosys had obtained visas for its foreign workers through “systematic fraud,” specifically by bringing workers to the US under a B-1 visa instead of an H-1B visa. The distinction matters because while B-1 visa holders are allowed to enter the country and attend meetings, they &lt;a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/indian-corporation-pays-record-34-million-fine-settle-allegations-systemic-visa-fraud"&gt;aren’t actually allowed to perform work&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESWZPZ"&gt;But Infosys’ three-decade reliance on the H-1B visas came under siege during the Trump administration, which instituted &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/politics/trump-h1b-work-visas.html"&gt;new rules&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 targeting the visa program. And while those rules were &lt;a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1422263/calif-federal-court-strikes-down-trump-era-h-1b-lottery-rule"&gt;struck down by the courts&lt;/a&gt;, the Trump administration did drag their feet when it came to approving new visas for Infosys and other competitors, a trend that &lt;a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/business/business-news/h1b-visa-approval-rates-for-infosys-staff-has-risen-significantly-says-coo-999323.html"&gt;only reversed&lt;/a&gt; when Biden took office. “There certainly was a lot more scrutiny being applied to H-1B applications, and that was particularly true of some of the outsourcing firms,” said Gelatt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B90JaQ"&gt;According to Infosys, the Trump era visa restrictions were tangential to the company’s expansion in the US. “We are continuing to do what we are doing in spite of the fact that there is a new administration in the US,” Kumar told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, Kumar said, the change was driven by Infosys’ clients, who wanted their contractors to be closer to home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XSSw3c"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cQvPMv"&gt;To meet their aggressive hiring goals, rather than hiring expensive experienced engineers, Infosys returned to their roots and invested in training. “Since 2017, we’ve been very aggressively growing as a company, so we need talent,” Kumar said. “The only way you can get talent is to build it if there is not enough available in the market.” The training isn’t cheap; Infosys spends $25,830 on every employee they hire from college, Kumar told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which funds a formal two-month training program, as well as project-based training for an additional three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8XTkg"&gt;Once employees join the company, they then enter a corporate environment where moving up the ladder is not only allowed but encouraged. As an example, Kumar cited more lucrative consulting positions, which he said were often filled internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UlpCYk"&gt;This flexibility, according to Kumar, is part of what allows the outsourcing firm to embody the American dream. “If we want to create social upward mobility in jobs, we will have to create these reskilling bridges, so people can start at the bottom, but they can transition to high potential jobs,” Kumar said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBtWO8"&gt;The very same flexibility, Infosys employees say, is part of what makes the company a challenging and, in some cases, disappointing place to work for. One employee, Stuart, was hired by the company to be a business analyst, and Infosys even paid him to attend a short-term training program to learn how to be one. “It was very hands-on. It was enjoyable,” Stuart said of the training. “I learned a lot. I felt excited to become a business analyst.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MD9jPG"&gt;But that enthusiasm faded when Stuart finished his training and was promptly put on the Bench. “Eventually, you see people bringing in a deck of cards to work,” Stuart said. “There’s no supervision; there’s nothing to do; there’s no projects to get on, but we’re required to be there.” So when a position finally opened up, Stuart took it, even though it wasn’t the business analyst role he had trained for. It was an IT support desk project, a position he described as “being a call center employee.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dxiE1q"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uq1bqi"&gt;The project gave him steady work, but paradoxically, Stuart found that the new project made it harder to look for a job other than at Infosys. “I now have nominally two years of experience in IT, but I definitely don’t have two years of business analyst experience,” Stuart said. “People don’t view me as having enough experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WirhNX"&gt;Ultimately, Stuart and other Infosys employees questioned whether the flexibility Infosys offered was actually a good thing. “People sometimes talk about a job versus a career, and right now, I have a job,” Stuart said. “A career is: ‘I have a vision of this leads to that leads to that, and it’s something that I want to do for the next 40 years.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpmX0L"&gt;For some, rather than revitalizing the American dream, Infosys might instead be strangling it. Kumar acknowledged that Infosys’ model of a career might look different from a career where workers could expect job stability but said that this shift was an inevitable consequence of technological innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXKBd3"&gt;“We are out of this era where for the first 20-plus years, we went to school, and the next 50 years or so, we went to a corporate job, and we recycle everything we did in the first 20 years for the next 50 years,” Kumar told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “In the digital age, when skills are so short-lived, you should be on a lifelong learning continuum all your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLj1c5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N4KviRFYw4HbiySCb93HA713Nus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069885/Divider_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="ZdxDb7"&gt;Infosys’ career flexibility assumes that Infosys’ employees can find work to do in the first place. But as Infosys has ramped up its hiring in the US, some of its employees have found themselves on the Bench for an extended period of time. They are, in effect, paid to do nothing while Infosys attempts to put them on a project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YcT1vh"&gt;Adding to the uncertainty around the Bench was a perceived lack of communication about how the Bench even worked. “It felt like none of us really had a good grasp on what was going on,” said Josh. “There wasn’t a whole lot of communication about it, and if we asked about it, then we didn’t really get very many details.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSVsyx"&gt;For those familiar with how consulting firms work, the Bench is not a new concept, and companies like Infosys report their efficiency metrics in their quarterly reports. “Our utilization rates are one of the highest in the industry,” Kumar said. He explained reasons why a worker might be on the Bench for an extended period of time but ultimately conceded: “In some ways, it’s our responsibility to get them on to projects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yEEOCw"&gt;One employee described the Bench as a convenient way to get &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; projects. George, who joined the company after graduating college, saw getting put on the Bench as “kind of awesome.” Unlike many other Infosys employees, George was quickly assigned to a project, but he found the work unpleasant. “They assign you completely menial, completely trivial stuff for you to do,” he said, describing assignments where he translated code from one programming language to another. “There’s not really much to learn.” One day, George decided not to show up to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATGqj4"&gt;“No one noticed for almost an entire month,” he said. “I was just at home literally doing nothing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bgklC"&gt;Eventually, the Infosys managers caught on and called George into the office to explain himself. After a contentious discussion about the importance of George’s job — “I was gone for an entire month, and nobody noticed at all, so you can’t really tell me what I was doing mattered,” he recalled saying — George asked them to put him on the Bench. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27mvro"&gt;“I heard stories of the Bench, and it was just a limbo place you could be in between assigned roles at Infosys where they paid you, and you didn’t have to do anything,” he said. “Honestly, it sounded wonderful. It sounded like what I was already doing for the past month.” The managers agreed and put him on the Bench, asking him not to show up to the office. George rode out his Bench time from home, which he did, for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T0Hr3a"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oJXXWQ"&gt;George used his free time to prepare for job interviews. He was eventually terminated by Infosys, but within a few months, he landed a position at “great company,” one where he could do meaningful work and that paid him enough for him to “achieve the lifestyle that I wanted, that I was told a software engineer was supposed to have.” But finding the time to prepare for these positions meant standing strong when Infosys asked him to relocate to client projects in different states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lrSmq"&gt;“I was in a unique position in that I was willing to put my foot down despite the threat of termination,” George said. “For others that I had met that were not willing to go that far, they were basically forced to go wherever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TxqAHA"&gt;One of the unusual elements of a job at Infosys is that employees were sometimes encouraged to relocate to a different state if they are unable to be assigned to a project. In some cases, this encouragement can involve the threat of termination. According to an email obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, employees on the Bench were told that “[l]ocation preference requests cannot be guaranteed as described in your Employment letter” and that “[r]efusal to take assignments during Bench will be reviewed for appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEMQZW"&gt;Although Infosys did not appear to have a consistent policy around terminating people for being on the Bench for too long, it is a real threat. In the same email, employees were told that “[y]our time on Bench will be tracked (also referred to as ‘Bench aging’) and therefore it is essential that you make efforts to find a billable position and come off Bench as soon as possible.” While not every employee interviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; seemed to have been affected by Bench aging, two workers were fired for that very reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LICvpa"&gt;For some, Infosys’ flexibility around which office employees could work from was a positive. Infosys has various offices, or Hubs, all across the country. “I know of cases where we have hired, trained, moved them to Indianapolis, and then they come back and say, ‘OK, our parents live in Chicago, we want to go back and work out of Chicago,’” Kumar said. “So we are actually being very flexible.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dJBAnduw6Vip6E3BO78SzBksTD0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067494/HAND_SPOT.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="EYTmgk"&gt;But for others, that flexibility is just another aspect of the uncertainty and stress of trying to start a career at Infosys. David is one of the employees who switched locations during his tenure at Infosys, having relocated twice while working for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tH7mim"&gt;When David joined the company for what he thought was a software development position, he was first asked to relocate to a large city. At the time, he was enthusiastic about getting his start in software development, having “always liked technology.” But the first project he was assigned to had nothing to do with software development. It was a customer support job. Later that year, he was removed from the project, and David, like George, spent his time on the Bench at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgdCuw"&gt;After a few months, David interviewed for a new project, this time in a more suburban location. David got the job, but it came with a catch: Infosys only gave him a week to move, a request David was “not happy with.” But despite the short timeframe, the opportunity to leave a city that “was definitely a bigger city than what I was used to” was enticing, he said. The suburbs offered a quieter lifestyle. (“I liked being able to go on hikes.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="521k7w"&gt;David made the move, which involved renting a U-Haul and breaking his lease. But when he got to the new location and arrived for his first day of work, no one was ready for him — or for the other new employees. “We just sat in the office during the day,” David said, describing how it took a week before he and the other new employees received the company-issued laptops they needed to start work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bs4V7V"&gt;He did eventually get put on a project at the second location, which this time involved development work. “I was so excited after a year of waiting for it to finally happen,” David said of the prospect of finally getting to gain experience in his chosen career. But that project was again short-lived, and he was dropped after a few months. “I was a little bummed out,” said David. “I was worried that maybe I wouldn’t get any real opportunity to work on development stuff at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EqRZxT"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qyZadW"&gt;After a second time on the Bench, David was brought back on to the same client, but his experience was a bit different. Although he spent about a month developing a testing framework for the client, during the rest of the time, David didn’t have any other work to do. Sometimes, the more experienced Infosys employees would give him practice assignments designed to give him experience with a new technology. But mostly, he spent the rest of his time in the office trying to “look busy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpS2D8"&gt;“They saw me sitting at my desk, reading something — sometimes it was code-related, sometimes it wasn’t. But unless they actually stopped for a few seconds to read over my shoulder, they wouldn’t know the difference,” David said. “I actually spent a lot of time researching hobbies that I wanted to get into.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWxQvo"&gt;David’s third and final stint on the Bench began unceremoniously: he tried to get to the client’s office only to find that his badge didn’t work. “We were on our way in to do more busy work as usual, and the badges wouldn’t let us swipe in anymore,” David said. But even then, he didn’t get fired. His time at Infosys ended when he finally landed a new job at a different firm that, unlike Infosys, gave him consistent software development work and allowed him to finally progress in his career as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLR991"&gt;Now, David looks back at his time at Infosys with a mixture of bemusement and frustration. “I don’t think most people are going to complain about getting paid to do pretty much nothing,” he said. But at the same time, working at Infosys did delay his career for two years and, worse, gave him a nominal two years of experience that made it difficult for him to be considered entry-level. “It’s basically like Infosys was paying me less than I could have made to do next to nothing while also crippling my ability to get better jobs or better work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxrQFp"&gt;Then there was the guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iL6zxO"&gt;“Even though knowing that it was outside of my control, at the same time, I’m sitting there getting paid more than someone who is a housemaid... or who is a plumber, or who is a construction worker,” he said. “Thinking about it that way, it’s like, ‘Wow, I know this isn’t really in my control, but it still does feel a little bad to know that I’m living what some people would call the dream, getting paid for doing nothing.’”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N4KviRFYw4HbiySCb93HA713Nus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069885/Divider_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="b8C015"&gt;As Infosys has expanded across the US, politicians have showered the company with tax breaks. In Indiana, Infosys’ planned headquarters granted it &lt;a href="https://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/subsidy-tracker/in-infosys"&gt;$101.8 million in subsidies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/prog.php?parent=&amp;amp;statesum=IN&amp;amp;fedsum=&amp;amp;major_industry_sum=&amp;amp;hq_id_sum=&amp;amp;company_op=starts&amp;amp;company=&amp;amp;major_industry%5B%5D=&amp;amp;hq_id=&amp;amp;free_text=&amp;amp;subsidy_level=&amp;amp;subsidy_op=%3E&amp;amp;subsidy=&amp;amp;face_loan_op=%3E&amp;amp;face_loan=&amp;amp;subsidy_type%5B%5D=&amp;amp;sub_year%5B%5D=&amp;amp;state=&amp;amp;federal="&gt;one of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/02/indiana-gives-infosys-largest-state-incentive-package-ever/101194224/"&gt;the largest&lt;/a&gt; incentive packages in the state’s history. And in Connecticut, a proposed smaller 1,000-person headquarters gained the company up to &lt;a href="https://ctmirror.org/2018/04/13/bond-commission-approves-14m-bring-infosys-1000-tech-jobs-hartford/"&gt;$14 million in subsidies&lt;/a&gt;, with the final amount conditional on hiring all 1,000 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I1Nvqx"&gt;Other companies have taken notice. Tata Consultancy Services, an Infosys competitor also based in India, announced that it would &lt;a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/tcs-to-recruit-10-000-staff-in-us-by-2022-2"&gt;hire 10,000 workers&lt;/a&gt; by 2022, having previously hired 21,500 workers between 2015 and 2020. But Infosys’ fiercest competition might come from American staffing firms, which see Infosys’ lifelong learning model as a way to adapt to the future of work. Some of those competitors are funded by Achieve Partners, which raised &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1772162/000177216219000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml"&gt;$80 million&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 for a “putting America back to work fund” to invest in staffing firms in industries with labor shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxCWZL"&gt;Achieve Partners was founded by Ryan Craig, a venture capitalist who typically invests in education companies. But Craig had become &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryancraig/2021/05/28/lambada-school-the-forbidden-coding-bootcamp/"&gt;increasingly skeptical&lt;/a&gt; of models where students pay education companies directly, particularly in light of the rising costs of college tuition. “For at least the past decade it’s been clear that apprenticeships – earning while learning – are more powerful and lower risk pathways for socioeconomic mobility than the tuition-based colleges and universities,” Craig told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a written statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpsUCi"&gt;Achieve Partners was a way to bypass the higher education system entirely. According to investment documents reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Achieve Partners’ business model involves acquiring staffing firms and then adding a “last-mile training” component to the business, wherein the firm hires recent university graduates and trains them to specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5wu6vn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Was Infosys terrible? Yes. Would I ever go back? Absolutely not.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p id="1jS6YS"&gt;The documents also show that their investments are expected to be profitable. Achieve Partners expects to make an average of $100,000 per worker, according to the documents, with a gross margin of 40 percent. The documents don’t say how long each worker will be employed by the staffing firms, but theoretically, with Achieve Partners taking a 40 percent cut, workers would be left with a salary of $60,000, less expenses (such as the cost of training) paid by the employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWHNF6"&gt;Dave DeSario, a director at Temp Worker Justice who reviewed the investment documents, described Achieve Partner’s 40 percent markup as “pretty typical in the industry.” DeSario added that companies typically keep their markup data private from their employees. “Workers have no right to know or to see what the markup is on their wages,” DeSario said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Gt3MR"&gt;As companies like Infosys have expanded across the US, they’ve been quick to portray themselves as job creators, in large part because of their willingness to hire and train entry-level talent. But critics caution there is little evidence that staffing firms actually create new jobs that wouldn’t exist otherwise because, by design, they make money by winning contracts to supply companies with workers. Presumably, if a company doesn’t sign a contract with a staffing firm, they would hire the employees themselves in-house, and the employees would have higher wages because there wouldn’t be a staffing firm to take a markup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOLL0o"&gt;“There’s no evidence to suggest that giving state or federal money to temp agencies creates actual long-term, good jobs,” DeSario said, citing a &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02690940600808230?needAccess=true&amp;amp;"&gt;2006 study on the topic&lt;/a&gt;. “All the evidence is actually to the contrary that when states or the federal government gives money to develop jobs through temp agencies, it only produces short-term jobs, which don’t have a positive impact for those workers, or it produces the very limited hiring of the top tier candidates who would have gotten hired anyway through other means.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Hd2iQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_7ePhGIkiovgJtSRq-5WY5QLd0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067490/CARDS_SPOT.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="NQZioz"&gt;(For his part, Kumar said that comparisons between Infosys and other staffing firms were misguided. “We don’t do staffing or staff augmentation at all,” Kumar said. “We run projects and programs for large enterprises. A lot of our business is fixed price.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aF6ewk"&gt;At first glance, Infosys seems like an exception. For the Trump administration, Infosys’ hiring spree is a vindication of its protectionist policies targeting H-1B visas. And for local politicians, Infosys’ job numbers help justify the tax breaks foisted upon the company. The carrot and stick approach seems to have worked — no small thing for a country still recovering from a pandemic-driven recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HFFuq"&gt;But for the Infosys employees, whether or not they were actually employed was a complicated question. For some, while the job was not ideal, it was a job nonetheless. “I would say a paying position is better than no pay, no position,” George said. “Was Infosys terrible? Yes. Would I ever go back? Absolutely not. But if I could do it all over again, and I was in the same situation, and I had absolutely nothing else going for me, it was better than nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcbzil"&gt;And yet, although models like Infosys are supposed to help new workers get a foot in the door, it’s unclear if these sorts of contracting jobs are good environments to start a career. These models continue to proliferate because of the profitability of their markups, but if the companies can’t get their employees real-world experience, there’s a risk that employees may become stuck in less stable positions that don’t pay as well as permanent roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzTDGq"&gt;Ultimately, other Infosys employees found it difficult to see their position as a real job at all. “I have other friends who got actual jobs at Allstate or Caterpillar or stuff like that,” Josh said. “They’re actually doing things, and I’m just sitting here.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uncharted’s remastered Legacy of Thieves Collection is coming to PS5 on January 28th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RbmiSyXL7UqRQPXPqxD4AHu7eJ4=/245x0:2873x1752/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239425/Screen_Shot_2021_12_07_at_9.44.36_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LamB88"&gt;Sony has officially announced a release date for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22661816/sony-playstation-showcase-uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection-ps5-pc"&gt;remastered &lt;em&gt;Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for PlayStation 5: it’ll be out on Janaury 28th. That release date is only for the PS5 version, though. Sony still hasn’t put a date on the PC port beyond the same vague “2022” date it had originally announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhcOFA"&gt;Sony also added that existing owners of either &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Uncharted: The Lost Legacy&lt;/em&gt;, or the digital two-pack PS4 bundle of both will be able to upgrade to the remastered &lt;em&gt;Legacy of Thieves Collection&lt;/em&gt; on PS5 for $10, rather than buying the new collection again for the full $49.99. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tee-XnRhlQCfVtNLS61zxha1ICQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069957/51728813547_009dd31431_h.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IjybOx"&gt;There are a few caveats with the new collection, though. Players who got a copy of &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End&lt;/em&gt; for free through PlayStation Plus won’t be eligible for the free $10 upgrade. And the multiplayer modes from both titles included in the collection won’t be included in the new remasters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQk3Hs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection&lt;/em&gt; will offer three different options for the PS5 port: Fidelity Mode, for 4K / 30fps gameplay; Performance Mode, which targets a 60fps frame rate; and Performance Plus Mode, which drops resolution down to 1080p but offers a 120fps frame rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Y4wnr"&gt;The remastered collection will also leverage the PS5’s usual hardware improvements, including the DualSense controller’s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, 3D audio, and faster load times thanks to the PS5’s speedy SSD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpbLfn"&gt;Lastly, Sony is sweetening the pot for anyone who buys &lt;em&gt;Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection&lt;/em&gt; between now and February 3rd by offering a free movie ticket to see the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738187/uncharted-movie-trailer-tom-holland-nathan-drake-mark-wahlberg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; film adaptation starring Tom Holland&lt;/a&gt;. The deal is good both for customers paying the full $50 price tag, as well as anyone taking advantage of the $10 upgrade, although it’s limited to the US, UK, Australia, and New Zealand. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos now supports Amazon Music’s Ultra HD and Dolby Atmos tracks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CSUW6QRJFpi9kk-ieFikmas7Zt0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239360/acastro_180529_sonos_1777_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DPILlp"&gt;As it previously promised, Sonos is today rolling out support for Ultra HD and Dolby Atmos tracks from Amazon Music Unlimited. After downloading the latest system update for their Sonos speakers, Amazon Music subscribers will see new badges on the Now Playing screen that clearly identify the quality of whatever music you’re playing. Sonos already supported CD-quality HD tracks on Amazon Music, as it does for other services as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfeZuH"&gt;These new badges will show either HD (lossless 16-bit stream), Ultra HD (lossless 24-bit stream), or Dolby Atmos. Sonos notes that for lossless music, the maximum sample rate supported is 48kHz. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GM2tXxsXHqydLT6rMCrSXgZr3x8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069922/Screen_Shot_2021_12_07_at_9.21.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll see badges on the Now Playing screen to indicate music quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6nHFmu"&gt;The company has also put together its own pretty thorough guide on &lt;a href="https://blog.sonos.com/en-us/hi-res-audio-guide"&gt;understanding high-resolution audio&lt;/a&gt;, saying that “while some aspects of what constitutes hi-res audio are clearly defined, some are not. And as the industry evolves, streaming services are applying their own terms to brand their higher-resolution tiers.” Give it a look if you’re new to lossless streaming, honestly — it’s quite good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4ozYm"&gt;Dolby Atmos music is only supported on Sonos’ Atmos-enabled soundbars, the Arc and second-gen Beam. But Ultra HD tracks can be played across a much wider selection of Sonos devices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="HJFGsn"&gt;In its blog post / explainer, Sonos hints that it plans to enable hi-res audio for other streaming services — Apple Music, hopefully — in the future. I’ll again take this opportunity to point out that Spotify has yet to launch its long-awaited HiFi tier after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;announcing it nearly 10 months ago&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s still time for the company to make good on its “later this year” promise, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best floodlight camera to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lFwEZ-JVDdUwN2mLCZ9OsuxxM3c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239338/jtuohy_211011_4898_0003_resize.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;These security cameras will shed some light on your smart home&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="X5Ijoo"&gt;When something goes bump in the night in your backyard, you probably want to know about it. While security cameras with night vision can show you what’s out there, a floodlight camera can both show and tell that rascal or raccoon to get off your lawn, scaring them away with some powerful lumens and possibly a blaring siren. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiHVPz"&gt;While there’s mixed research on whether outdoor lighting is a significant deterrent to crime or just potentially annoying for your neighbors, there are plenty of benefits to lighting up your property from both a safety and security perspective. With smart floodlight cameras you get the added value of better lighting in addition to a way to keep an eye on your home. Thanks to sensors, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, smart floodlight cameras can be set to only light up when there’s someone there, instead of just when a gust of wind sends a plastic bag through your yard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8NHsV"&gt;I put six of the best floodlight cameras to the test to help you decide which is the right choice for your smart home. My top pick is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Security-Floodlight-360-Degree-Weatherproof/dp/B0967TSRBM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eufy Floodlight Cam 2 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to its innovative features; an impressive 360 field-of-view; super bright, tunable LED floodlights; and lack of monthly fees. I also like the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf8d2S4YhfB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight&lt;/a&gt; for its excellent video quality, wide compatibility with smart home platforms (yes, even Apple HomeKit), and more svelte design, but you need to pay monthly for the best features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVxRgq"&gt;For those on a budget, the &lt;a href="https://homedepot.sjv.io/c/482924/456723/8154?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FWYZE-Wired-Outdoor-Wi-Fi-Floodlight-Home-Security-Camera-WYZECFL%2F317038240&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestFloodlightCameras12321" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wyze Cam Floodlight&lt;/a&gt; is a solid choice with just a few concessions for a much lower price. Plus, it’s the only camera we tested that also lights up for any suspicious sound, not just motion. Read on to learn more, including which is the best option for an Alexa or Google Home smart home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="0uHpCS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10901099"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="imYLkd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10901124"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xOGAe5"&gt;Why to buy a floodlight security camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zJH1kv"&gt;Anyone considering installing security cameras outside their home should look at a floodlight camera first. These devices combine lights, a camera, and (in most cases) continuous power in one easy package. The motion-activated lights also provide a valuable safety feature, helping make sure you don’t trip on that package left in your driveway. Plus, most have built-in sirens you can activate as a deterrent to anyone creeping around your property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JQ1md"&gt;Floodlight security cameras are predominantly wired, which means they are hardwired to your electrical system, like a light fixture. They still operate wirelessly to transmit video using your home’s Wi-Fi. Some have a backup battery built-in, and one I tested (the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight camera) can be completely wireless, working just off battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUI6pX"&gt;The advantage of the hardwired option is there are no battery-charging woes. And, unlike with a plug-in camera, you don’t need to worry about drilling through your walls to access an indoor plug or putting the camera near an outdoor receptacle while snaking wiring down the side of your house. If you already have some sort of outdoor lighting, it’s a relatively easy swap to get a hardwired, always-on security camera plus light set up on the side of your house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV0OA0"&gt;Floodlight cameras cost between $99 and $350 and, in general, come with the same camera technology as standard outdoor cameras. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776184/google-nest-cam-floodlight-review-smart-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Cam with Floodlight&lt;/a&gt;, the Wyze Cam Floodlight, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight, and the Ring Floodlight Cam Pro all essentially take the companies’ flagship cameras and stick 2,000 to 3,000 lumens of motion-activated light on them. The camera is controlled in the same way and with the same features as the regular outdoor camera, but you get the added option of light control, which is what makes this an excellent upgrade to standard motion-activated lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLGWbv"&gt;That lighting control includes adjusting the brightness (handy if you have sensitive neighbors), length of time the lights stay on, what activates them, the option to have lights come on automatically at sunset and turn off at sunrise, and even integrate into smart home routines. Some models have lights that can be controlled individually with voice assistants such as Alexa, Google, and Siri, using their respective platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jrmkmQ"&gt;Why not to buy a floodlight security camera &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zurTsR"&gt;The downside to floodlight cameras is they’re significantly more expensive than their non-shiny siblings, generally $100 or so more. They’re also more limited in where you can place them; most need to be up high and where there is existing wiring for lighting (unless you are ready to spend a few extra hundred dollars on an electrician’s services). But that wiring provides continuous power, so once they’re up, you don’t have to mess with them. The same can’t always be said for battery-powered options.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gaZKZa"&gt;Another consideration is that most floodlight cameras use non-replaceable LED lighting, so if the lights go bad, you’re left with a camera in the dark. A couple of models — Nest and Wyze have removable cameras — so if the lights do go out, you still have a camera you can use elsewhere. All of the models we tested have lights that should last between 50,000 and over 100,000 hours of use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yM5rMn"&gt;How to install a floodlight security camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TRFNTV"&gt;Wiring for a floodlight camera is similar to any lighting fixture, with the addition of an outdoor junction box in some cases. I highly recommend employing an electrician, especially if you are at all uncomfortable fiddling with wiring anything while on the top of a ladder. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4d2lBMnTI3ma1P3ODGcvuU08b2I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055512/jtuohy_211011_4898_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Installing a floodlight camera involves wiring and a ladder. While it can be a DIY project, it’s likely best suited to a licensed electrician.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Iyovlb"&gt;The ideal place to install a floodlight camera is facing a yard, path, or driveway, placed up high — at least 6 to 10 feet — so the lights cover an ample space, and the camera has a good view. Make sure you have decent Wi-Fi in the area you want to install; if not, consider extending your Wi-Fi or upgrading to a mesh router. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QszYBu"&gt;Before installing, download the manufacturer’s app and check the instructions. Some cameras need to be paired to the app before mounting them, which helps avoid too many trips up a ladder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOW0H2"&gt;Another thing to be aware of is which light switch in your home controls the camera. If you install it where there was previously a light, it will be controlled by a switch somewhere in your home. Handily, Wyze provides a bright purple sticker with its camera that you can affix to the switch, warning people not to turn it off. I wouldn’t recommend covering it with a flat plate or disabling it because it’s a helpful troubleshooting tool if you do run into any issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Dd6OTc"&gt;The best floodlight cameras for 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id="ioV0Op"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10901075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="USAM6U"&gt;1. Eufy Floodlight Cam 2 Pro &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="liPByI"&gt;The best floodlight security camera for most people (if you can cope with that design)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="9cOJvp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10901051" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8CWGsd"&gt;Eufy has gone for function over form with its beast of a floodlight camera that boasts a camera with a 360-degree field of view that pans and tilts to cover a vast area. This feature — plus its three adjustable, tunable lighting panels, individually addressable PIR motion sensors, and local storage — makes the Eufy Floodlight Cam 2 Pro our top pick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGiGU3"&gt;However, there are a few flaws, primarily how ugly it is. Then there’s the outdated push-to-talk two-way audio (we’d love some full-duplex here), a limited zoom, and no option for continuous video recording. Plus, smart alerts are limited to just people (no animals, vehicles, or packages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E50t4C"&gt;But if you want a hardwired camera that can see everything and lighting you can adjust to suit your needs, the Eufy is the best choice. Its 360-degree pan and tilt feature is well-thought-out, with subject lock and tracking that follows a person as they walk through your property. While you set the camera to a fixed point, it can detect motion outside of its view, thanks to PIR motion sensors in each floodlight panel, and will swivel the camera to catch it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/40F2rb0_MLDAf2pYuvPWGV2Up-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055514/jtuohy_211011_4898_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eufy Floodlight Camera looks and works best when it’s tucked way up high, out of your line of sight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KI8fx7"&gt;The lack of smart alerts for animals, vehicles, and packages is annoying, but you can adjust the sensitivity of each motion sensor and set up activity zones to limit false alerts. Rich Notifications, which show a preview of the captured clip right in your phone’s notification tray, also helps cut down on how often you have to open the app to check in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7rKyH"&gt;A helpful auto-cruise feature lets you set four preset positions and have the camera auto-rotate through them on a set schedule or on demand. A Look Around button on the main page sends the camera into a surveillance spin for a quick check on your property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FnN88"&gt;The other neat feature is three lighting panels that deliver a blinding 3,000 lumens of light at up to 5,700 Kelvins — both of which are much higher than any competitor. At full brightness, it resembles the lighting of a prison yard, which is not great for most people. Thankfully, you can change the brightness and the color temperature from cool to warm. I set it to warm and 20 percent brightness, and it was more than bright enough without being harsh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Et7CQ"&gt;The 2K video quality is excellent, although the digital zoom is lacking (surprising with this image quality). The camera works over 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, has a weather rating of IP65, includes standard and color night vision, and doesn’t require a Eufy hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5S1a7"&gt;There is 4GB of non-removable onboard storage (which gets you about 14 days’ worth of recordings with 45 activations a day). Or you can opt for a Network Attached Storage setup or use Eufy’s cloud service for $3 a month per camera. There is no 24/7 continuous video recording, and it works with Google Home and Alexa to stream footage on smart displays and control the camera’s lights in the app. You can’t stream footage in either Google or Amazon’s smartphone apps, however; you need to use the Eufy app for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DaRdyV"&gt;2. Arlo Pro 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mQxJXY"&gt;The best floodlight security camera for any smart home platform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="n7EorW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10901099" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HkoKMR"&gt;If you can’t get past the “mall surveillance” look of the Eufy, or you want something with a strong zoom, motion-activated siren, and better smart alerts, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight camera ($250) is my next favorite pick. It has by far the best video quality of any camera I tested and offers HDR imaging with its 2K resolution, which the Eufy doesn’t. The 12x digital zoom lets you get up close and personal with that rascally raccoon, and it has the option to auto-track and zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zx5R7F"&gt;You have to pay for zoom and track, however. In general, with Arlo, you need to subscribe to its Arlo Secure service (starting at $3 a month) to get any functionally out of its cameras. (I couldn’t even snooze motion alerts without a subscription plan.) But if you do pay, you get people, animal, vehicle, and package alerts, the option of continuous 24/7 recording (for an additional fee), and rich notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIXXGz"&gt;The Arlo is also the least obtrusive-looking floodlight camera — I will not go so far as to say it looks nice — but it’s not as large nor as prominent-looking as the rest (with the exception of the Netatmo Smart Outdoor Camera). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GcgpLA"&gt;As the Arlo can be battery-powered, you can mount it anywhere you need to (and add a solar panel for $60 to keep it juiced). But that does away with one of my favorite features of floodlight cams: reliable, continuous power. Arlo has the option of continuous power, but you need a nearby outlet and an additional purchase of a power cord (for $50). It does not mount to a standard outdoor junction box and isn’t a great drop-in upgrade for an existing non-camera floodlight. I’ve been testing the Arlo for six months on battery power, and I’ve had to charge it every two months. (It’s in a very busy location.) I would always opt for hardwired where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djwKa6"&gt;Despite the camera’s smaller size, the light is very bright and more than enough to light up my entire back patio. It’s one of only two cameras I tested that has the option to pulse its light to scare off intruders, and you can set its 80dB siren to go off on motion. (Be careful with this feature if you don’t want your neighbors to come knocking.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MM5pBn"&gt;One issue I ran into in my testing was that some water got into the floodlight after a heavy rainstorm. I was able to dry it out, and it’s been working fine since then, but I would recommend installing this, and any floodlight camera, under an eave or some covering where possible to extend the life. The Arlo app also took too long to pull up a live view at times, despite the camera being situated just a few yards from my internet router. In comparison, I didn’t have the same issues with the Eufy app — despite the camera being installed way out past my garage, hanging off the roof of my second story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L05PkB"&gt;Unlike some Arlo cameras, the Pro 3 Floodlight Camera doesn’t require an Arlo Hub, but it can be used with one to help with range and extend battery life. If you want the HomeKit compatibility it offers (one of only two cameras we tested that does), you will need that Hub, which costs $100. Unfortunately, it doesn’t provide HomeKit Secure Video or the option of local storage on the Hub. There is just no way around that Arlo subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjER4Y"&gt;The Arlo Pro 3 does work with Google Home, and you can stream video in the app and on Nest smart displays. It also works with Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, and IFTTT, and you can control the light separately from the camera, which is handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="M7mB2Q"&gt;3. Wyze Cam Floodlight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="O2KiZL"&gt;The best cheap floodlight security camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="Jw7Qjq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10901124" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R2Zr4Q"&gt;Wyze has come storming out of the gates with a superb floodlight camera that’s under half the price of the competition. This 2600 lumen blaster lit up the side of my house like an airport runway (it’s a harsh white, however). Moreover, unlike all the competition, the Wyze Cam Floodlight offers sound detection (Nest has it but only for smoke and CO alarms), very useful to highlight anyone trying to creep through the bushes while potentially out of range of any motion sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hllbBI"&gt;As with most of the cameras I tested, Wyze uses both a PIR and a camera-based motion sensor — which means the camera doesn’t have to be in the range of the motion for the lights to turn on. Wyze offers 270 degrees of motion sensing, which, along with Ring and Eufy, is the widest range of motion sensing on offer. The cherry on the top is that Wyze built an extra USB port into the device, so you can power a second Wyze Cam v3 (sold separately) and put it around the corner for an additional angle. This doesn’t get you quite the surveillance power of the Eufy, however, and does look a bit … cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-QRGlp5S5YC3SUsEJW3bcB2QrgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055526/jtuohy_211130_4898_0021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two cameras are better than one. With Wyze Floodlight Camera, you can connect a second Wyze Cam and leach off the power supply.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W09KF1"&gt;Despite the low price, you’ll want to factor in paying for a Wyze CamPlus subscription plan (from $2 a month), as that’s how you’ll get smart alerts for people, packages, vehicles, and animals. Although 12 seconds of motion-recorded clips are free, there’s a 5-minute cooldown period between them where the camera won’t record anything, so unless you pay up for the unlimited length clips and no cooldown included in CamPlus, you could miss some vital action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrP97s"&gt;Zoom on the 1080p resolution Wyze is nowhere near as good as the Arlo’s, but the starlight sensor-powered night vision is superb. This uses any available light to illuminate a dark scene in color, and I could see more in that mode than with the floodlights turned on. The Wyze cam also has a louder siren than the Arlo, but both cameras can pulse the lights to scare off anything creeping around. As an added bonus, there’s the option of local storage by adding an SD card, which enables free, 24/7 continuous video recording — the only camera I tested that does this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ea7NyN"&gt;As with all Wyze gear, smart home integration outside the Wyze ecosystem is limited. You can stream footage to Google and Alexa smart displays and have Alexa announce if motion is detected, but you can’t control the lights with either voice assistant, and you don’t get individual control of the floodlights outside of the Wyze app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2RQz7P"&gt;4. Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nwyAvH"&gt;The best floodlight camera that works with Amazon Alexa&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="c6kk3E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10901138" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="45MQw7"&gt;Ring’s latest floodlight camera is essentially a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359973/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ring Pro 2 video doorbell&lt;/a&gt; camera mounted below high-powered, 2000-lumen adjustable lights. This is a good thing as the Ring Pro 2 is arguably Ring’s best camera yet. And while the Bird’s Eye View and 3D Motion Detection features that come with the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Pro had limited value in my testing, the quality of the 1080p resolution camera and its horizontal and vertical field of view means you get a really good vantage over your property. It’s much better coverage than the previous version making this worth the $70 price premium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTWVzb"&gt;Ring’s digital zoom is also excellent, and the bumped-up siren is the loudest one we tested (at 110 dB). You can’t trigger the siren on motion, but there is the unique-to-Ring option to add an audible motion warning that tells prowlers they’re on camera — less offensive to the neighbors than a motion-triggered siren. I also like that this camera can be powered by a wall plug or traditional junction box wiring (a separate plug-in version is offered for $20 more), but I would always recommend hardwiring if you can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqpaPH"&gt;This floodlight cam is one of only two cameras we tested that has the option of 5 GHz Wi-Fi, and it comes in black if you prefer (as does the Arlo). There is no local storage, although Ring has said this camera will get compatibility with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22798830/ring-alarm-pro-review-smart-home-security-alexa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new Ring Alarm Pro that has a local storage option&lt;/a&gt;; however, you need to pay for a Ring Protect Plus plan to use that. Paying for a Ring plan (starting at $3 a month) adds person detection (no other smart alerts) and recorded videos — without it, it’s livestream only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKhG3F"&gt;While this is my top pick for Alexa users, because Ring as a whole integrates so well with its parent company’s smart home ecosystem, bizarrely, you can’t control the Ring’s floodlights through Alexa, either with voice or in Routines. You can view a live feed on Alexa-enabled displays, but you have to use the Ring app for all light control. Here, you can adjust three motion zones for the lights — handy so that your neighbor walking in his yard doesn’t turn them on. You can also put the lights on a schedule, adjust the brightness, and link Ring devices so that if a Ring camera on one side of the house detects motion it can turn on the floodlights on the other side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lt01vh"&gt;If you use a different smart home system from Alexa, give the Ring a pass, as it only works with Alexa. However, if you are just starting on your smart home journey, the Ring app is fast becoming a smart home platform of its own, especially if you add a Ring Alarm or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22798830/ring-alarm-pro-review-smart-home-security-alexa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ring Alarm Pro&lt;/a&gt; to your setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XlasdN"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776184/google-nest-cam-floodlight-review-smart-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Cam with Floodlight&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Z8OqfS"&gt;The best floodlight camera that works with Google Home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="D9ARDZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10901148" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gvYXJK"&gt;There is a lot to like about Google’s new Nest Cam with floodlight. It has built-in battery backup for when the power goes out, free on-device recording (up to three hours), free smart alerts for people, animals, and vehicles, and the option of 24/7 recording (for a fee). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ku0Qrh"&gt;It’s also the only floodlight camera to offer facial recognition as part of Nest’s Familiar Faces feature. This means you can get an alert that says, “‘Sarah the Gardener’ is in the backyard” rather than the scarier “There’s a person in the backyard.” You need to pay for Nest Secure subscription service for this, which starts at $6 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hejhL"&gt;All these features are part of the camera that magnetically attaches to the two floodlights (a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710545/nest-doorbell-battery-cam-battery-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Cam&lt;/a&gt; that you can swap out if you like). But the lights also add some good options, including adjustable arms to angle your lighting, app and voice control in the Google Home app, ambient light activation, and the option to dim the beams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FvjUJ"&gt;But there is no built-in siren — the only camera in our roundup without the option of one — making it a poor choice for a dedicated security device. It does offer 5 GHz Wi-Fi, and the on-device machine learning makes for speedier notifications than most of the cameras we tested. Motion sensors in the floodlights provide a wide, 180-degree sensing range, ensuring the lights turn on when anything gets nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70kWEE"&gt;Sadly, as with all the new Nest devices, the camera only works with Google Home (and not even with the old Nest app), so skip it if you are in an Alexa, HomeKit, or SmartThings home. It also doesn’t fit well for an under-the-eave installation. I would only consider it if you can install it on the side of your house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wL9mok"&gt;6. Netatmo Smart Outdoor Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sgWcjC"&gt;The best floodlight security camera that works with Apple HomeKit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="G88AG2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10901161" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cl2zap"&gt;For those with privacy in mind when it comes to installing cameras in and around their home, the Netatmo Smart Outdoor Camera is your best choice. Not only is there no cloud component at all — video is recorded locally, and all smart alerts are processed on the device — but you can also opt to store recordings on your personal FTP or Dropbox service. It is the only camera in our roundup that works with both Apple HomeKit and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646453/apple-homekit-support-smart-home-security-routers-wwdc-2019" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HomeKit Secure Video&lt;/a&gt;, and there are no monthly fees charged by Netatmo, which makes up a little bit for that eye-wateringly high price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UrJ8k"&gt;This is also a very stylish-looking floodlight camera, made out of aluminum instead of plastic, with a high-end feel that doesn’t look out of place on the side of more modern homes. However, it won’t install horizontally under an eave and needs to be mounted vertically to the side of a house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhdUUH"&gt;In addition to free local storage, Netatmo offers free smart alerts for animals, people, and vehicles and the ability to control the light and camera in HomeKit, Google Home, or Amazon Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlB03j"&gt;A built-in siren is an ear-splitting 105 dB, and the camera sends rich notifications with a zoomed-in clip of what it spotted that also appears on the well-laid-out timeline view in the Netatmo Security app. There is a non-siren version that is less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkdnHt"&gt;However, the video quality of the Netatmo Smart Outdoor Camera is just nowhere near as good as the competition. This is an older camera, and while it offers 1080p video, there is no HDR imaging or seemingly any other digital trickery more modern cameras use to produce a more vibrant image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Yfa3nk"&gt;The digital zoom is also limited, and bizarrely, there is no two-way audio. You can hear someone through the app, but you can’t speak to them. The light is also only rated for 1100 lumens, the lowest by far, but it feels plenty bright in use. I also like that you can choose specific types of motion to trigger the lights, so have it just come on for people or animals if you prefer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Springboard: The Secret History of the First Real Smartphone is out now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/64E5gTYOD_9PcpCWYE_Gf49CTQw=/148x0:1771x1082/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963739/Screen_Shot_2021_10_06_at_4.28.55_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How the early pioneers of the smartphone almost made it big&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="uAR9g2"&gt;A decade before Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, a tiny team of renegades imagined and tried to build the modern smartphone. Nearly forgotten by history, a little startup called Handspring tried to make the future before it was ready. In &lt;em&gt;Springboard: the secret history of the first real smartphone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn talks to the visionaries at Handspring and dives into their early successes and eventual failures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80clsG"&gt;It’s a half-hour-long documentary featuring the key players at Palm and Handspring: Donna Dubinsky, Jeff Hawkins, Ed Colligan, and more. It’s one of our most ambitious video projects to date, and we can’t wait to show it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CO8iuz"&gt;Handspring may no longer be a household name, but it was briefly one of the fastest growing businesses in American history, selling Visor personal digital assistants. But the company had bigger aspirations: it saw a mobile future and took the first steps toward what would become the modern smartphone — even as it faced skepticism from the entire industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGlhgO"&gt;The dream of the Handspring Treo turned out to be too far ahead of its time — before either the technology inside smartphones or the industry that sold them was ready for it. And a number of bad internal decisions and outside disasters would stall Handspring long enough that Apple would go on to do what Handspring couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6Bphu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; is also a look at an earlier time in tech — when the dot com bubble was bursting, but big tech hadn’t coalesced into five or six titanic monoliths. It was a time when many futures seemed possible, even one where a tiny startup could win the coming smartphone wars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Myh7cb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; is now streaming worldwide. You can watch it on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9_Vh9h3Ohw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; or our new app on Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, or Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNeXhn"&gt;To watch on your TV, visit your preferred streaming device’s app store and search for “The Verge,” or follow the instructions for each of the streaming devices you can use:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to recover when your Facebook account is hacked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zk3QDRHisMc3jWvNCBUpnZauZII=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239182/VRG_Illo_4902_Security_Facebook.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ori Toor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There’s only so much you can do&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PWBibb"&gt;Hopefully, the day will never come when you find your Facebook account has been hacked or taken over. It is an awful feeling, and I feel for you, for the world of hurt that you will experience in time and perhaps money to return your account to your rightful control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjhmyh"&gt;Let me take you through the recovery process. Afterward, I’ll provide some proactive security pointers you can follow to prevent this awful moment from happening, or at least reduce the chances that it will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eVRnjo"&gt;Three ways you can lose control of your Facebook account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GBAeoM"&gt;There are actually three different possible scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2jVE1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 1. You let a family member or friend “borrow” your Facebook account on your computer or phone.&lt;/strong&gt; They proceed to consume content, post messages as you, or befriend random people. This happened to a friend of mine, who had a grandchild staying at her home for a week. The girl left town and left a mess behind on my friend’s Facebook account. “She didn’t post anything to my account, but I had odd friend requests that I had to clean up. I decided to just quit using my account.” This is more of a nuisance than a hack, but still annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQZsDF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remedy&lt;/strong&gt;: First, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security"&gt;use Facebook’s security page&lt;/a&gt; to check and see where else your account is already logged in. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eLx2naH9z_jZZi9yzo-U80laEGA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019983/fb_where_you_are_logged_in.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pL2kpo"&gt;This list should also remind you of all of the devices that you have used Facebook on in the past. I took this screenshot after I found (and then removed) an older Windows laptop that I hadn’t used in years on the list. You’ll also see an entry for my iPhone that is located somewhere in Indiana. I haven’t visited that state in years, so sometimes the geo-location algorithms are a bit wonky. Even if your account isn’t hacked, it is helpful to routinely check this screen to make sure you haven’t enabled a login by mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vT5WEq"&gt;If you don’t recognize (or don’t use) any of the devices on this list, click on the three vertical dots on the right and force those machines to log out of your account. Next, change your password to something unique. Also, remember in the future to sign out of Facebook (and Messenger) before you loan your device to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2gwTh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 2. Someone uses your photo and name and sets up a new account.&lt;/strong&gt; Then they proceed to try to recruit your FB friends to their account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48obpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remedy&lt;/strong&gt;: There isn’t much you can do about it, other than tell people you are still you and to ignore the imposter. This should be a warning when you receive a friend request from someone you think you have already befriended, or someone you haven’t communicated with in years. A word to the wise: send them an email or text asking if the request is genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uxi5jE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 3. The doomsday scenario&lt;/strong&gt;. Someone guesses your account password and proceeds to lock you out of your account. This situation is the most dire, and fixing this will depend on what else you have linked to your Facebook account and how determined you are to get it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bteWhT"&gt;This happened to Elizabeth, a book author. She ended up working with two different friends who were IT professionals and a lawyer over the course of four months. She had two complicating factors that made recovering her account difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6T3Ljz"&gt;First, she used Facebook ads to promote her books, so she had connected her login to her credit cards. This resulted in the hacker charging her card with their own ads to try to lure other victims to compromise themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkROHQ"&gt;The second complication was that she was using her pen name and a random birthday date for her account. During the recovery process, Facebook asks that you scan your ID to verify who you are. When she told me this, I became concerned for myself. For years I prided myself on using January 1 as my Facebook “birthday.” Now she was telling me that I was setting myself up for trouble if someone hacked my account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydEidC"&gt;She eventually got her password reset, but almost immediately the hacker reset and took over her account again. “I tried to get someone at Facebook to help me, but I couldn’t get anyone on the phone,” she told me. Before the pandemic, the company had a special phone hotline for industry insiders, “but this was discontinued,” she said. She had more success blocking the credit card charges by phoning her bank. “I was trying to be a step ahead of the hacker, and losing sleep. My whole life was put on hold as I tried to deal with the situation. I got no work done for months. I ended up changing my passwords on more than 30 different accounts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgc7nN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible remedies:&lt;/strong&gt; if you find yourself in this last situation, you have three basic choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkVZ3A"&gt;1.	&lt;strong&gt;Now would be a good time to leave Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;. The trouble is, you have someone who is pretending to be you, and could leverage your identity into criminal and uncomfortable situations. Not to mention that they could try to leverage bank accounts that are linked to your account or open up credit cards in your name. (More on that in a moment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nv9Q2m"&gt;2.	&lt;strong&gt;Try to reinstate your account on your own&lt;/strong&gt;, using &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/hacked"&gt;Facebook’s own obscure and oftentimes contradictory steps&lt;/a&gt;. That is the way most people I know have tried. However, you will find out very quickly that there is no easy way to do this. You have to communicate with Facebook support through someone else’s account, which seems somewhat contradictory, so hopefully your spouse or friend is willing to lend a hand. (Don’t be tempted to set up a second account, because that could result in both of your accounts eventually being canceled.) Then you have to choose one of several options (finding an unauthorized post, an account that uses your own name and/or photos) and enter the rabbit hole to recover your account. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/raqrV2c5X7uVRgjgsCgiJfzrzOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019990/Screen_Shot_2021_11_16_at_4.53.54_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AYVu97"&gt;If you use Facebook as a means to log into other internet services, you will have to disconnect these links — otherwise a hacker can then compromise these other accounts. If, like Elizabeth, you have connected your credit card or other financial accounts, you will have to contact these institutions and get these charges rescinded. Start by trying to use Facebook from other devices you have previously used: perhaps the hacker hasn’t automatically logged you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ve07ny"&gt;3.	&lt;strong&gt;Use a third-party recovery service&lt;/strong&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://hacked.com/how-to-recover-a-hacked-facebook-account/"&gt;Hacked.com&lt;/a&gt;. This will cost you $249, but the company will be persistent and if they can’t help you, they will refund your fee. You also get a year’s digital protection plan included that normally sells separately for $99. If you have a complex situation like Elizabeth (connected finances, non-matching birthday), I recommend using this path. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJ7kCl"&gt;But make sure you aren’t employing some random hacker who might be taking your money and doing nothing else. I spoke to Hacked.com founder Jonas Borchgrevink, who outlined the various sequences of steps that his staffers try in a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/29/hacked-social-media-account/"&gt;recent Washington Post article&lt;/a&gt;. And he confirmed that if you are using a different name from what is shown on your ID, it is almost impossible to recover your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="74SQYZ"&gt;Proactive security measures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v8I9Cs"&gt;If you haven’t been hacked (yet) and are getting somewhat uncomfortable reading this, here are some steps to take to secure your Facebook account, or to at least reduce your pain points if it does happen. Start by doing at least one of them today, and make sure you take care of all of the items as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gIJ8bZ"&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Set up additional login security on your Facebook account. &lt;/strong&gt;Facebook offers you a set of confusing choices, but the one that I recommend is to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22215571/factor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to"&gt;use a two-factor authenticator app&lt;/a&gt; such as Google Authenticator. (You can start at &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/security/2fac/settings"&gt;this Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DyFJcTtcM2PBLLmfvxpsX54rWwQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019987/fb_mfa.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MHicWa"&gt;Two-factor authentication (also known as 2FA) uses an Android or iOS smartphone app as part of the login process. After you supply your username and password, Facebook asks you to type in a series of six numbers that are generated by the app. These numbers change every minute, so you need your phone nearby when you log in. If you want extra credit, take the time to enable this second factor method on your other accounts, including any banks and credit card companies that support this method (sadly, too few do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEsubv"&gt;Elizabeth was using a less secure method for her second factor: sending the six numbers as a text message to her phone. You can read more about &lt;a href="https://blog.strom.com/wp/?p=5572"&gt;why this isn’t my preference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHT0zs"&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Check to see if you have any payment methods configured on Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt; While preparing for this article, I was surprised to find my PayPal address linked to my Facebook account — and I thought I was being careful about my Facebook security. There are two places to check. First, there is the page that shows if you have &lt;a href="https://secure.facebook.com/facebook_pay/?referrer=settings"&gt;set up any credit cards to make direct payments&lt;/a&gt; to individuals or causes, called Facebook Pay. Go to this other link to &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager/account_settings/account_billing/?act=46577174&amp;amp;pid=p1&amp;amp;page=account_settings&amp;amp;tab=account_billing_settings"&gt;remove any ad payment methods&lt;/a&gt;. If you are running any ad campaigns on your business, you will have to stop them first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rwb45o"&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Remove connected apps and websites. &lt;/strong&gt;If you have signed on to third-party apps using your Facebook credentials, now is the time to review and remove them (you can &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications&amp;amp;ref=settings"&gt;find the appropriate page here&lt;/a&gt;). The same is true with removing any &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=business_tools&amp;amp;ref=settings"&gt;business integrations&lt;/a&gt;. You take a small hit in not being able to automatically log into these other services, but you also protect yourself if your account has been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s6xj2k"&gt;If you have a Facebook business page, you should have at least two people who have admin rights to this page. (Go to Page Settings &amp;gt; Page Roles.) If your business account is hacked and you are the sole admin, it will be next to impossible to get it recovered. This contact should also have second factor authentication turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VD2su1"&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Check your account’s email contacts &lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=account&amp;amp;section=email&amp;amp;view"&gt;using this Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;). You should have at least a second contact email (or more) that Facebook can use to send you notifications in case your main email address becomes compromised. Of course, use different passwords with these different email accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuL6uM"&gt;I know, this seems like a lot of work, and there are a lot of places in the Facebook settings pages that you will have to visit and pay attention to. And chances are, the links provided above might not work in the future, as Facebook likes to make changes to its settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dp6qpn"&gt;If these activities to make yourself more secure haven’t gotten you frustrated, you might want to continue improving your security. I recommend either the &lt;a href="https://www.withjumbo.com/"&gt;Jumbo smartphone app&lt;/a&gt; for iOS and Android, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avast.com%2Fen-us%2Favast-one&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22785819%2Ffacebook-hacked-security-privacy-recover" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Avast One&lt;/a&gt; (available on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android). Either can help walk you through the numerous steps to secure your Google, Twitter, and other accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cGBnJb"&gt;Parting words of wisdom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="itEKXv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think before you click.&lt;/strong&gt; If you get a message from what looks like a social media company saying that your account has been compromised, don’t follow any links or call any phone numbers in the message. This could be a lure from a hacker. Instead, navigate to the site or use its own app directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0CtFB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be aware of things that seem unusual&lt;/strong&gt;. Keep an eye out for messages you didn’t send, posts you didn’t create, or purchases you didn’t make. These could be tells that someone has guessed your password or compromised your account. If you are lucky, it might be an errant teen using one of your computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="t7TLgE"&gt;As Elizabeth told me, “Being hacked is like getting a digital tattoo — everyone can see the after-effects of your poor choices.”  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Springboard: the secret history of the first real smartphone is now available on YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Springboard" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BwiEZ119sIizjxW6rSlE1xcoWew=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239202/Springboard_Thumb.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="znkkjV"&gt;In 1998, Donna Dubinsky and Jeff Hawkins quit Palm, a company they’d founded, to begin a new one: Handspring. They had a simple goal in mind: to eventually create the smartphone. Years before any of the technology was actually ready, their tiny startup began laying the necessary groundwork for what would become the Treo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zuyx7m"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Springboard: the secret history of the first real smartphone&lt;/em&gt;, we document the history of Handspring, from its dramatic beginnings to its tragic end. Along the way, we hear from five of the key players who tried to invent the modern smartphone years before the technology world was ready for it. It’s a story that interweaves the dotcom crash, technological innovations, wireless carrier resistance, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5i267F"&gt;You can watch &lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s smart TV apps on Roku, Fire TV, Android TV, and Apple TV. And now it’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9_Vh9h3Ohw"&gt;also available on our YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RY6PV4"&gt;Alongside today’s YouTube release, we’re also publishing a special episode of The Vergecast, the discussion we recorded after the premiere of &lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; at our 10-year anniversary party in New York last October. In it, Nilay Patel and I talk through some of the stories that were left on the cutting room floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="I5v29y"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP7469173203&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qPiwth"&gt;I’d like to share a couple of them here, too. Both fall outside the scope of the documentary’s timeline, which was focused strictly on Handspring and not the eras of Palm that preceded and followed it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGhQfp"&gt;The first comes from Jeff Hawkins during the early days of Palm. His company had captured the lion’s share of the Personal Digital Assistant Market with the PalmPilot and some of its successors, which meant that Microsoft was going to take another run at them. Given Microsoft’s dominance, it was an existential threat. Here’s how Jeff, one of the great product executives in tech history, described his approach to handling that threat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rHHbaz"&gt;Our first big run in competition was with the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_V"&gt;Palm V.&lt;/a&gt; That was with Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jR3G8n"&gt;We had been having a lot of success with the PalmPilot, and Microsoft said, literally, Steve Ballmer got in front of their annual conference, and they had a picture of Palm in a target, and it was like, “We’re gonna kill these guys,” you know? “We’re gonna crush them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjhIzb"&gt;I had engineers writing their resumes. I mean there were people saying, “Oh, man, it was a good run, sorry,” you know? The conventional wisdom was you can’t compete against Microsoft, and I said, “No, we can compete.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1Kftx"&gt;And I came up with a strategy for it. I said we’re gonna build hardware and the software. They’re only building the software, and they’re relying on other people to build the hardware. So what we oughta do on our next product is create the most beautiful piece of hardware we can create, which they’re not gonna do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDTXFy"&gt;This was the controversial idea; they were adding all these features to their software, tons of features to their software. And I said, “We’re not gonna add any new features to our software,” because if we add new features to our software, people are going to compare our new software features to Microsoft’s new software features, and we’re gonna be behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jj1sPT"&gt;If we come out with a beautiful product, they won’t talk about our new software features. All they’ll do is talk about the new, beautiful product. And then they’ll say, “This product is more beautiful than anything that they got going on,” right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C85Xvs"&gt;So this was a controversial strategy of mine; we’re not going to add new features when the Palm V came out. There’s going to be &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; new software features. We could have had a whole list of things we could put in, but I said that’s not going to help us. And it worked beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRATR9"&gt;The Palm V came out, and we just crushed Microsoft. They just, you know, they just couldn’t compete at all. And they were blown away that we blew ‘em away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0Psb9f"&gt;The second story is a little different — and it’s also addressed in our Vergecast episode today, with some of the relevant audio. After Handspring merged back with Palm, Ed Colligan was running things, and eventually, all eyes were on Apple, which was widely expected to release a smartphone. A few weeks before the iPhone was first announced, Colligan sat for an interview with &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reporter John Markoff at the Churchill Club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJeC8k"&gt;Back in 2006, nothing had actually leaked about the iPhone, and so Markoff and Colligan speculated a bit on what Apple might be doing. Then the conversation turned to discussing competition in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EcXZR"&gt;All of this context is in service to correcting the record on one of Colligan’s responses. Somewhat famously, a line of his has been quoted over and over — most often by John Gruber at Daring Fireball in a post titled “&lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2006/11/colligan_head_stuck"&gt;Palm CEO Ed Colligan’s Head Seems to be Stuck Somewhere&lt;/a&gt;.” He quotes the following real-time transcription — which, as it turns out, is inaccurate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="uoIY7U"&gt;Responding to questions from &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; correspondent John Markoff at a Churchill Club breakfast gathering Thursday morning, Colligan laughed off the idea that any company — including the wildly popular Apple Computer — could easily win customers in the finicky smartphone sector.&lt;br&gt;“We’ve learned and struggled for a few years here figuring out how to make a decent phone,” he said. “PC guys are not going to just figure this out. They’re not going to just walk in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="w697Ht"&gt;We’ve gotten the original recording of the interview — our thanks to the &lt;a href="https://computerhistory.org/"&gt;Computer History Museum&lt;/a&gt;, which has received the Churchill Club’s archives after it sadly had to shut down. Here’s the actual exchange, which begins after the Apple speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Gkm2Th"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Markoff&lt;/strong&gt;: But what will it look like in 2007? Apple does get in. Eric’s [Schmidt, then CEO of Google] wandering around talking about free phones. He’s got Andy Rubin, who was the founder of Danger doing something inside. He bought Andy’s startup. The phone market could look, I mean, it looks crowded now. It could look intensely crowded next year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed Colligan:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s intensely big. We just have to get our fair share of the pie. And let me tell you this, it’s not as easy as it looks. You’ve seen Motorola, one of the biggest phone companies in the world enter with a device that was going to take over the world, and it’s had enormous issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markoff&lt;/strong&gt;: The Q? You’re talking about the Q. [The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Q"&gt;Motorola Q&lt;/a&gt;, a hyped up Windows Mobile smartphone that struggled with technical problems and slow sales]&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colligan&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. And so I just would caution people that think they’re going to walk in here and just and do these. We’ve struggled for a few years here, figuring out how to make a decent phone. The PC guys are not going to just, you know, knock this out. I guarantee it. So, look, welcome, let’s go for it. We can’t stop all that. It’s going to happen, but it’s going to be, I don’t think it’ll be so easy for everybody, as everybody thinks to enter it. It’s a tough space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markoff:&lt;/strong&gt; You’ve been around this industry long enough, and you probably remember, maybe you don’t actually, the famous Wall Street Journal ad that Apple took out in 1981. “&lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/37-years-ago-steve-jobs-ran-apples-most-amazing-ad-heres-story-its-almost-been-forgotten.html"&gt;Welcome IBM. Seriously&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colligan:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly. Well, look, you know, I’m not trying to be cocky about it. It is a tough, it’s a tough business. We’ve really struggled through that in the sense of making world class radios that perform on global networks consistently with all the applications that we deliver and…&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markoff: &lt;/strong&gt;Is radio expertise, something you have to have internally, is that...&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colligan: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markoff: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah. That’s a black art, still.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colligan: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sptpOD"&gt;The conversation moves on from there. Colligan clearly saw the competition coming was was likely worried and needed to put a brave face on it, but it’s notable that the more immediate prompt was Google and Motorola. And beyond the specifics of the wording, the overall tone and affect of Colligan’s response (which you can hear about in The Vergecast episode, starting around the 11 minute mark) is also relevant. It wasn’t a prediction that Apple would fail — it was more of an admission that smartphones were hard. And it wasn’t simply about Apple, but also Google and the new entrants running Windows Mobile (which Palm also used on its Treos at the time). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkm6mC"&gt;Weeks later, the iPhone was announced and it was, of course, more popular than any Treo. However, it was Android that ended up walking in, becoming the fatal competition for Palm and its subsequent webOS phones. Verizon ultimately chose Google’s operating system and the Motorola Droid instead of the Palm Pre to compete with the then-AT&amp;amp;T-exclusive iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERCB4W"&gt;The Motorola Droid was spearheaded by Rick Osterloh — who got his start making SoundsGood MP3 Springboard modules for Handspring Visors before his company was acquired by Motorola. Palm held on for a little while longer and was acquired by HP, but the Droid was the beginning of the end. Osterloh now runs hardware at Google, and his Pixel phones face competition every bit as daunting as anything Palm once dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bresf2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32Yg7O"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="eXCJTK"&gt;Here I am. Back again in your inbox on a Tuesday, in the final weeks before Christmas, New Year’s, and, for you business folks, the end of the quarter. For today’s Hot Pod, I interviewed the Media Matters researcher who listened to over 350 hours of &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; this year and reported back on what we’re all missing. He says the show, for those of us who aren’t spending our time there, is currently best described as a “cesspool of toxic masculinity that discusses elk hunting, mixed martial arts, anti-trans views, and harmful health information about the coronavirus pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dv2tLr"&gt;We’ll also discuss separate — but, in some cases, related — Spotify situations and more “greenwashing” in podcast ads. More, more, more, just in time for the season of giving. Let’s get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ocdsuc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCLUSIVE: Meet the reporter dedicated to cataloging Joe Rogan’s bonkers claims&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6dhxqO"&gt;As you all well know, Joe Rogan is the most popular podcaster in the US and, likely, the world. He made his name interviewing major guests and for his off-the-cuff, at times controversial, takes on the world. Spotify reportedly paid him $100 million to bring his show to the platform exclusively, which resulted in it distributing a popular but contentious program. The platform keeps getting flack over what its star podcaster says, mostly because it’s spending so much money to keep him there and specifically courted this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmXXOD"&gt;Many of us who know this context might be curious to hear what Rogan is really up to on his podcast, only to then see his episodes can span hours and post multiple times per week. So enter Alex Paterson, a researcher at Media Matters whose beat as of the past year or so has included listening to Rogan and reporting back on everything he’s hearing. That work culminated in a story last week called: &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/joe-rogan-experience/joe-rogan-wrapped-year-covid-19-misinformation-right-wing-myths-and-anti-trans"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joe Rogan Wrapped: A year of COVID-19 misinformation, right-wing myths, and anti-trans rhetoric&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJeTW6"&gt;I caught up with Paterson the day after the story ran and chatted with him to get a better sense of what he’s seeing. He tells me he listens to the episodes as soon as they come out, on 2X speed, to catch everything Rogan says. How are all those hours of Rogan listening going? Does Spotify seem to have taken any action?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="FTDX4D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eOHExM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpKCL2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking the time to chat. My first, obvious question: why are you so interested in Joe Rogan specifically? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGzdeR"&gt;Alex Paterson, researcher at Media Matters: I started regularly monitoring Joe Rogan’s podcast beginning last year in 2020 when he had Abigail Shrier on to push anti-trans rhetoric. She’s an anti-trans journalist who used to work at &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, and during that podcast, they compared being trans to joining a cult or cutting yourself through self-harm. After that, knowing that Joe Rogan’s podcast is one of the most popular — if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; most popular — podcasts in the world, I wanted to track the rhetoric he’s pushing on his show to help document how harmful it is to our society at large. Particularly in this new year, and as the pandemic has begun, Rogan has taken a clear lurch to the right and become a serial misinformer when it comes to COVID-19 misinformation, and we’ve been trying to document and limit the harms that he’s trying to push into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHN4XU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You said you’ve been tracking him since 2020. How have you seen Rogan’s rhetoric change in that time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaoyXd"&gt;I believe he’s become more emboldened to push baseless conspiracy theories and right-wing lies over the past year. Since I started reporting on Rogan’s podcast, he’s broken into mainstream coverage fairly often: first, with his lie about left-wing people starting wildfires in Oregon, and then again really prominently, [saying] he would encourage healthy, young people not to get vaccinated. And throughout all of that reporting, at least from my view, he hasn’t faced any real punishment from Spotify. And I think that’s emboldened him to continue pushing hate and lies on his podcast. Just from listening to him every day, he’s by no means remitting conspiracy theories and false rhetoric on his show. If anything, he’s leaning into it more. He’s celebrated in conservative spaces for it. He’s a darling of the conservative right in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bptI1y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know you and Media Matters more broadly cover the wider world of the right, so places like Fox and OAN. Do you see any parallels between that world and Rogan’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eApjT"&gt;Yeah, I completely see it as related. Rogan is someone who celebrates himself as being a so-called independent thinker who has both conservative and progressive values, and I think that perfectly illustrates our general media landscape’s bend towards right-wing views and over accommodating ring-wing views and not challenging right-wing misinformation. So I think he plays a pretty central role in that landscape, and he’s also deeply connected to the network of conservative media. He hosts Ben Shapiro. He hosts Alex Jones. He’s a huge supporter of Tucker Carlson, who we know is Fox News’ hate-mongerer-in-chief. I think he plays a central role in the right-wing misinformation system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xe0GOX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Much of us in the podcast world are interested in how Spotify treats Rogan. Have you gotten any sense that it’s taking action to moderate his content?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcoKXR"&gt;Rogan has stated numerous times that Spotify has never spoken to him about the hate that he pushes on his podcast or taken any steps to try to curt him from doing so. You’re hearing it from his mouth, and then when we look at Spotify’s year-end summary for their Wrapped, he’s the star of their podcasting, which is an empire Spotify is very clearly trying to grow. On YouTube, which I would say has stronger enforcement around COVID misinformation, though it’s far from great, his show would often be demonetized and occasionally removed. I think he views Spotify as a place where he could spread his specific kind of bigotry and vile without any real consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFnqqI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you seen any specific moments where you think YouTube would have moderated his content, but Spotify doesn’t?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4uMBw"&gt;Oh, yeah, absolutely. We do a lot of work at Media Matters around tech accountability and terms of service, and generally, I would say social media companies are failing to regulate right-wing extremism on the internet. And Spotify has some of the least, almost non-existent, terms of service to protect users and the general public from hatred and targeted violence. Joe Rogan has misgendered and denigrated trans youth on his podcast and never faced any consequences. We have seen YouTube take some steps to remove content that’s similar to that, and YouTube has a policy against promoting COVID-19 misinformation. That’s become the central core of Rogan’s podcast, and Spotify, including CEO Daniel Ek, has refused to take any action against Joe Rogan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvemzN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don’t rely on transcripts to monitor the show, and I’m looking slightly ahead, but I do wonder how much that speaks to the broader issues platforms might have moderating shows. Transcripts don’t catch everything, especially with speech nuances. So I wonder if you or the team have proposed solutions to help platforms solve these issues?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHxjr1"&gt;The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Spotify and Joe Rogan and moderation, like how we could moderate extremism online, is that Spotify isn’t even at that table. That would appear to be something they aren’t even considering with Joe Rogan. So to imagine a world in which Spotify might monitor his transcript is so far from reality that we’re just asking them to, at a very baseline, stop their most prominent podcast host from increasing vaccine hesitancy and harming our nation’s public response to the pandemic overall. Joe Rogan has shown really clearly that he will use his podcast to spread conspiracy theories, right-wing lies, [and] racist rhetoric in order to sort of promote himself. And yes, Spotify, their CEO, and their comms team has gone on the record time and time again saying that he hasn’t violated their terms. At this point, it’s like, what would it take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnzBj1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, I appreciate you doing this work and taking the time. Is there anything else you think people should know about Rogan that they might not be considering?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fSt2V"&gt;One thing we’ve done at Media Matters is try to document how social media algorithms and far-right online communities can radicalize everyday people fairly easily. I think Rogan is a good example of that. Let’s say you’re a young man listening to &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt;, and you want to get tips on bodybuilding or how to eat healthfully, and then Rogan starts discussing that vaccines are a form of gene therapy with Ben Shapiro, and then perhaps you go to Ben Shapiro’s website, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Wire&lt;/em&gt;, and there, you fall into a cesspool of hatred and bigotry, and once you click on a &lt;em&gt;Daily Wire&lt;/em&gt; article, if you share it on Facebook, you’re just going to be led further and further down the far-right rabbit hole. That can take someone from being an everyday person [to] suddenly being fed news and misinformation about QAnon and other right-wing lies. I think it’s important to keep in mind that Joe Rogan spreading this misinformation has real-world consequences that can have really dire effects for marginalized people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rkAvQz"&gt;
&lt;p id="oDvXiM"&gt;For what it’s worth, I reported on Rogan telling young adults &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406315/joe-rogan-vaccine-spotify-podcast-covid-19"&gt;not to get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; and pointed out that Spotify had specifically removed music and podcasts that claimed vaccines not only kill people but also have microchips in them. (Both of which are not true.) At the time, Spotify said it “prohibits content on the platform which promotes dangerous false, deceptive, or misleading content about COVID-19 that may cause offline harm and/or pose a direct threat to public health.” I’d encourage you to check out Paterson’s &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/joe-rogan-experience/joe-rogan-wrapped-year-covid-19-misinformation-right-wing-myths-and-anti-trans"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; for a better sense of what Rogan is saying and decide for yourself whether it falls within those bounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hu64r5"&gt;And if you’re wondering how influential Rogan really is, take a peek at &lt;a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2021/12/4/22817972/dana-white-announces-hes-covid-free-thanks-dr-joe-rogan"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt;, which discusses “Dr. Joe Rogan’s” influence on various people’s COVID treatment plans, namely UFC president Dana White and his family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6grQZL"&gt;I reached out to Spotify to see if the team wanted to comment on the above interview. A spokesperson, who asked to remain anonymous because of the “sensitivity of the subject matter,” sent the same comment as above back but with this tacked onto the end: “When content is flagged for possible violations of our policies, it is thoroughly reviewed by our in-house team and outside experts, if necessary. If that content is found to be in violation of our policies, the appropriate enforcement action is taken.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7iF5f"&gt;Meanwhile, in separate Spotify moderation news…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ilimO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Racist, antisemitic, hateful podcasts live on Spotify and Google Podcasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29QSqq"&gt;Sky News &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/antisemitism-racism-and-white-supremacist-material-in-podcasts-on-spotify-investigation-finds-12484728"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; an investigation on Friday into extremist podcasts and found “several days’ worth” of content promoting “extreme views such as scientific racism, Holocaust denial and far-right antisemitic conspiracy theories.” Reporter Victoria Elms says explicit slurs can be heard, as well as direct calls to violence against Jewish people. She also notes that these podcasters are using the episode description box to promote hateful videos hosted on other platforms, including one about “Dylann Roof’s insightful manifesto.” Spotify removed the content after Sky News’ reachout, but they remain live on Google Podcasts. Pertinent to us is Elms’ note about the black box that is these platforms’ moderation efforts. I wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22273071/podcast-moderation-apple-spotify-podbean-steve-bannon"&gt;this in February&lt;/a&gt; — particularly how difficult it will be to catch and take down infringing content — and continue to think about how dire this might become when every platform includes an audio component, the feature du jour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3g4Da3"&gt;I hate to keep hammering y’all with bad Spotify things, but we’re going to keep going. It’s the winter energy, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9xLtJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify takes down comedians’ albums over royalty dispute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3Qdf7"&gt;This is tangential for us but interesting, as it relates to spoken word content. Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-removes-some-comedians-work-from-streaming-service-11638626401"&gt;has removed&lt;/a&gt; “hundreds of comedians’” work from its platform over a new royalties fight. Summed up as simply as I can: comedians are compensated as performers through their label or distributor, but they want to now also receive writing credits, or what global rights administration company Spoken Giants calls their literary rights. (This parallels the royalties in the music industry — a songwriting credit pays different royalties, which can be more lucrative. I recommend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22672704/olivia-rodrigo-switched-on-pop-charlie-harding-music-copyright"&gt;listening to or reading&lt;/a&gt; my boss’s podcast,&lt;em&gt; Decoder&lt;/em&gt;, with Charlie Harding of &lt;em&gt;Switched on Pop&lt;/em&gt; for more on how this works in music land.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KU6Ci6"&gt;Spoken Giants is leading the charge here, trying to negotiate for these comics to receive the writing credits and subsequent royalty payouts, but the comics are in the lurch right now, unable to have their content streamed at all on one of the world’s biggest platforms. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; notes that Spoken Giants “started by representing writers of comedy bits and jokes, with plans to expand across podcasts, speeches and lectures.” The podcast writing credit royalty system, could it happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmUVyb"&gt;Now, let’s close the loop on the ExxonMobil &lt;em&gt;Daily&lt;/em&gt; ad, for now at least...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="1A7LnR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FnpL4S"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Podcast ads make up oil companies’ “greenwashing” strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6Ul7C"&gt;A few weeks ago, I covered the debacle over an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22797808/podcast-app-acquire-radiopublic-acast-rss-feed-hot-pod"&gt;ExxonMobil ad that appeared on &lt;em&gt;The Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The ad, climate change reporter Emily Atkin wrote, was misleading and not wholly indicative of what Exxon is actually doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eiwHoj"&gt;Yesterday, &lt;em&gt;Drilled&lt;/em&gt; podcast host and journalist Amy Westervelt &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/04/exxon-podasts-oil-company-ads-climate-crisis"&gt;published a bigger piece&lt;/a&gt; on the growing trend of oil companies’ ads showing up in podcasts. She writes that podcast publishers have to “develop their own guidelines and fact-checking processes” around the climate-friendly claims they make because the Federal Trade Commission mostly only cares about claims around products, which the oil companies don’t advertise. The piece culminates in the concluding thought, “What’s in place now for identifying misinformation in ads is not really a framework for identifying greenwashing,” says John Cook, research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub. So even if the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; and others implement fact-checking for ads, which they say they already do, squishy language from oil companies could pass that test and seemingly already has. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoBLhk"&gt;Broadly, all of today’s stories add up to a bigger conversation around the new world that podcasting inhabits. The industry’s receiving more attention than ever before from outlets like &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; but also bigger publications who spot strange and bad things happening. The industry’s growing and now faces the same problems massive social platforms, like Facebook and YouTube, contend with regularly. Cook, from Westervelt’s story, advises Facebook on climate disinformation, just so you can get a sense of how much expertise is needed at the platforms. The expectations are higher for podcasts, and this tension between stepping up and meeting them versus punting until podcasting has more resources will only continue moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rF2qyU"&gt;I love a lil year-end tease. If you want more audio and podcasting industry analysis, you can subscribe for two additional issues &lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/subscribe/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, I’ll catch you next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulTSXa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjpLzh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Alexa’s new elder care service launches today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zsDs73R5qqr-BUhLHHbAIC1sCjc=/625x0:7375x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239220/Alexa_Together_app.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Alexa Together launches today.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cH5itQ"&gt;First announced at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22686948/alexa-together-caregiving-amazon-echo-subscription"&gt;Amazon’s fall hardware event, Alexa Together&lt;/a&gt; is officially launching today, Tuesday, December 7th. A new subscription service that expands on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21560891/amazon-alexa-care-hub-how-to-use-setup"&gt;existing Alexa Care Hub&lt;/a&gt;, Alexa Together is designed to offer a minimally invasive way to use Amazon’s voice assistant and associated Echo speakers to both assist and keep tabs on an elderly loved one or other person who requires a caregiver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxOf1j"&gt;Almost since Alexa launched, industrious families have found ways to make the artificially intelligent assistant help them when it comes to looking after a remote loved one. Electronically “dropping in” on an elderly family member to check on them and sharing Alexa accounts so that they can see their activity have been simple — if inelegant — ways to know that your family member is okay; especially helpful if they aren’t always good at answering a phone call. But the system wasn’t designed for that use case, making it somewhat invasive for the person who’s being “monitored.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOU8ls"&gt;First with Care Hub and now with Alexa Together, Amazon has developed new features based on how its customers shoe-horned the Alexa assistant into these use cases. The result is a product that could make the process of remotely caring for an elderly loved one easier and ultimately more helpful. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/stLW2rtDA8Eu4gsiLYJnrgUV3X8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069699/Alexa_Together_Routines.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alexa Together notifies caregivers about their loved ones’ activities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ca67S"&gt;The new service costs $19.99 a month or $199 per year, and it replaces the existing — free — Care Hub service. For that new fee, customers get a professional monitoring service and some more proactive features. There is a six-month free trial available and all Care Hub customers get a free year of Alexa Together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8JWEH"&gt;The two most notable features arriving with Alexa Together are Urgent Response and a fall detection capability. This adds 24/7 hands-free access to a professional emergency helpline, allowing the user to say “Alexa, call for help,” to an Echo speaker and be connected with an agent. The agent can then request the dispatch of police, the fire department, or an ambulance, and Alexa also sends a notification to the designated caregiver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYgcTe"&gt;Fall detection requires third-party hardware — currently it works with devices from Assistive Technology Services (ATS) and Vayyar. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/VAYYAR-Care-Touchless-Compatible-Detection/dp/B09JXV82Z6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vayyar Care&lt;/a&gt; costs $250 and is a wall-mounted device from the makers of &lt;a href="https://vayyarhome.com/"&gt;Vayyar Home&lt;/a&gt;. It’s exclusively for Alexa Together (although Vayyar makes a standalone product, too) and uses sensors and radio waves to detect falls. ATS’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SkyAngelCare-Detection-Compatible-Together-Automatically/dp/B09LGJYPY8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SkyAngelCare&lt;/a&gt; is a fall-detection pendant that communicates over Wi-Fi to Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFRO8V"&gt;Both devices can be set to alert Alexa to ask the user if they want to call Urgent Response, a more proactive approach than waiting for the user to ask for help. Unlike similar devices on the market today, there are no ongoing subscription fees to use these, beyond the Alexa Together fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgq1GC"&gt;The activity feed and alerts from Care Hub are now part of Alexa Together. This lets a caregiver know that the person is up and going about their day by providing an alert in the Alexa app once the person being monitored first interacts with Alexa. It works with other Alexa-compatible smart home devices to register activity, too, including smart lights, thermostats, and motion sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxNhNs"&gt;This is a more privacy-conscious way of monitoring someone, without using intrusive technologies, such as cameras, and without revealing exactly what they are doing. For example, the caregiver can see there was an interaction but not what it was specifically. Another feature is that Alexa Together can alert a caregiver if there has been no activity by a certain time, so they can know to check in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bOjS9F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Together is more privacy-conscious than a camera&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v3xhNU"&gt;A new Remote Assist option is also part of Alexa Together. This allows a caregiver access to a person’s Alexa account, with their permission, so they can help set up features remotely — such as setting reminders, adding contacts to be able to call or message with their voice, putting items on a shopping list, and linking music and video services. Finally, the ability to add multiple caregivers, which is coming early next year, is also a new option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1n7zV"&gt;Amazon is clearly making a big play for the aging in place market. Aging in place is defined by the CDC as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces/terminology.htm"&gt;“The ability to live in one’s own home and community safely, independently, and comfortably, regardless of age, income, or ability level.”&lt;/a&gt; This is something the smart home is a natural ally in, and a number of other Amazon products announced at the same event earlier this year have the potential to help with this in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekYyxk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22798830/ring-alarm-pro-review-smart-home-security-alexa"&gt;The Ring Alarm Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which combines a home security system and an Eero mesh Wi-Fi system in one, could make it easier to set up a smart home in a relative’s house with just one device. Experts in this space cite a security system with fire, smoke, and water leak monitoring capabilities as the most important tool to install in an elderly loved one’s home. And of course, for modern-day security systems, a strong internet connection is essential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNGUD8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448926/amazon-sidewalk-ring-echo-tile-wifi-mesh-ble-location-tracking"&gt;Sidewalk&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s little talked about (at least recently) “neighborhood network,” has two new partnerships with &lt;a href="https://www.carebandremembers.com/careband-and-amazon-sidewalk-explore-opportunities-to-enable-older-adults-living-with-dementia-to-remain-safe-and-healthy-at-home/"&gt;CareBand&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.life360.com%2Fblog%2Flife360-and-amazon-sidewalk-imagine-ways-to-keep-loved-ones-safer-and-more-connected%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F7%2F22822026%2Famazon-alexa-together-elder-care-price-features-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Life360,&lt;/a&gt; both of which make products designed to know exactly where your loved ones are. Amazon announced both companies are producing devices that will be Sidewalk-enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAQyKB"&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765217/amazon-glow-review-video-calling-projector"&gt;Amazon Glow device&lt;/a&gt; — an interactive projector that lets loved ones play games and read books with children remotely — is designed for grandparents to stay connected with their grandchildren. Voice assistants in general are helpful allies in combatting loneliness, which is associated with higher mortality rates in the elderly. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astro has been touted as one day being able to help take your blood pressure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nmXgIP"&gt;Finally, even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;Astro, Amazon’s rolling robot&lt;/a&gt;, was promoted at the event as potentially being able to deliver a blood pressure cuff to a person at regular intervals. While the robot may seem like a bit of a pointless novelty at this stage, use cases for elder care are probably the most compelling (if not fully realized). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sfsosi"&gt;Among the larger tech companies, Amazon is leading the way here, but it’s not the first to try. &lt;a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/best-buy-assured-living-lets-aging-parents-stay-at-home/"&gt;Best Buy launched Assured Living&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, offering a complete hardware and software solution for monitoring loved ones. It’s since disappeared and Best Buy now promotes various gadgets sold at its stores that help with &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhealth-wellness-solutions%2Factive-aging%2Fpcmcat1522420940237.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1522420940237&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“active aging.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64aCG8"&gt;There are many standalone devices that have attempted to make an impact on the age-tech space. The &lt;a href="https://lifepod.com/"&gt;LifePod&lt;/a&gt; is a proactive Alexa-based voice-enabled speaker that does a lot of what Alexa Together offers. The &lt;a href="https://www.grandpad.net/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw5JSLBhCxARIsAHgO2SeMWIytcXeRJAtxq-A4dawqkWSG8HVCJPI9mAAM6M5RqqX5x-6g_PUaAtwDEALw_wcB"&gt;GrandPad&lt;/a&gt; is a simplified tablet designed to make technologies like video calling easier for seniors. There are also a plethora of tools for managing medications, gadgets that can help with cooking safely, and devices that help you stay in touch with the outside world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UIbMv"&gt;To date, however, smart home tech has largely failed to capture this market. Possibly due to the piecemeal approach, likely due to the high costs of these gadgets and doubts around their long-term staying power, and definitely because of the privacy concerns of the elderly customer. Any device seen as spying on someone — whether it’s with a camera or not — has a large hurdle to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dvg3Kd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smart home tech has failed in elder care efforts before&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W5lK4T"&gt;But this is a real problem and a major moment for the smart home. The number of Americans over 65 will double from around &lt;a href="https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/Aging%20and%20Disability%20in%20America/2020ProfileOlderAmericans.Final_.pdf"&gt;50 million to nearly 100 million by 2060&lt;/a&gt;. By 2034, &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018/cb18-41-population-projections.html"&gt;seniors will outnumber children&lt;/a&gt;. Most people would prefer to stay in their homes as they age rather than spend their life savings on assisted living facilities or nursing homes. Add to that the fact that there are over &lt;a href="https://www.caregiving.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AARP-835-AARP-Caregiving-in-the-US-Infographics-vFINAL-scaled.jpg"&gt;53 million unpaid caregivers&lt;/a&gt; dedicating a large portion of their lives to caring for elderly relatives, and the math here just makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="txGF1u"&gt;Equipping an entire home with smart devices enabled by artificial intelligence, both from Amazon and others, can cost less than one year of in-home care or one month in a care home. Combined with significant advances in telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, the smart home could become a crucial part of how we look after our elderly loved ones today and, one day, ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YO3jgs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
