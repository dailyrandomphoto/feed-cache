    <title>A grueling day in Elizabeth Holmes’ trial ended with evidence that Theranos’ tests sucked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zcAxfVhyRZ5BX-aaWQySAPQrrzU=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69929323/1235435752.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A preview of arguments to come&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="a2F48p"&gt;After a tedious day of bickering, Victoria Sung appeared like manna from heaven — to tell us that Theranos’ tests sucked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ukgp8F"&gt;Sung worked at Celgene when it contracted with Theranos. Her testimony was brief and to the point: Celgene had not “comprehensively validated” Theranos technology, she said. That would have taken more work than what she did with Theranos’ tests. The work she showed the court from 2012 demonstrated Theranos performed dismally compared to standard testing — often returning results that were “out of range.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zyc1c6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sung is a teaser for a big part of US v. Elizabeth Holmes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U7DAav"&gt;We’ll get to the bickering in a minute, I promise, but Sung is a teaser for a big part of &lt;em&gt;US v. Elizabeth Holmes&lt;/em&gt; we haven’t explored much: Theranos’s relationship with pharmaceutical companies. One allegation prosecutor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663723/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-trial-opening-arguments-day-one"&gt;Robert Leach made in his opening statement&lt;/a&gt; was that Holmes had deceived Walgreens about its relationship with drug companies. During former employee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680372/elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-emails-gangakhedkar"&gt;Surekha Gangakhedkar’s testimony&lt;/a&gt; a little over a week ago, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1438927235352645637"&gt;she said&lt;/a&gt; that she didn’t think pharma company GlaxoSmithKline’s report on Theranos tech “comprehensively validated” it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ogYoGf"&gt;This phrase felt familiar, and today I realized from where: &lt;em&gt;Bad Blood&lt;/em&gt;, John Carreyrou’s book about Theranos. In the book, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Bad_Blood/CcJFDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;dq=he+first+was+the+clinical+trial+work+it+did+for+pharmaceutical+companies.+Documents+it+gave+Walgreens+stated+that+the+Theranos+system+had+been+%E2%80%9Ccomprehensively+validated+over+the+last+seven+years+by+ten+of+the+largest+fifteen+pharma+companies.%E2%80%9D&amp;amp;pg=PT98&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover"&gt;Carreyrou wrote&lt;/a&gt; that documents Theranos gave Walgreens “stated that the Theranos system had been ‘comprehensively validated over the last seven years by 10 of the largest 15 pharma companies.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdMBtO"&gt;GSK and Celgene’s acquirer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, certainly rank among the largest pharma companies. They did have contracts with Theranos; in fact, Celgene was Theranos’ largest pharma customer. But neither of the studies those two companies did count as comprehensive validation, according to Sung and Gangakhedkar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pw7xtv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At one point, the two got into a fight about whether Rosendorff had forwarded an email or replied to it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w4Pfs4"&gt;I imagine we will work through Theranos’ other pharma partners later in the trial; Sung’s testimony was brief. She was only on the stand because former lab director Adam Rosendorff had a childcare commitment at 2PM and couldn’t continue his cross-examination, which took most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vljHNp"&gt;Rosendorff had previously testified that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt;Theranos’ tests were bad&lt;/a&gt;, even saying he didn’t understand the clinical value of one test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VblPFP"&gt;Lance Wade, Holmes’ attorney, set out to undermine this testimony, and that was the source of a great deal of bickering.  Rosendorff could be persnickety about details; for instance, Wade kept mixing up “proficiency tests” with “precision tests,” and Rosendorff kept correcting him. At one point, the two got into a fight about whether Rosendorff had forwarded an email or replied to it. At least, I think that’s what they were arguing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVnJmp"&gt;We revisited the lab inspection by the California Department of Public Health, where Theranos employees got instructions not to go in or out of the “Normandy” lab, where the Edison machines were kept. In a previous inspection in New York, bulletin boards had been covered with paper so the inspector couldn’t see what was on them. Wade asked if that was to protect trade secrets. Rosendorff asked who would pin trade secrets to bulletin boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="pmNZ1S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Not as big bucks as you get paid.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RFmJ7O"&gt;But we did find out the results of the audit: some minor deficiencies, which upset Holmes and Balwani, Rosendorff testified. Later, Wade quipped that supervising quality control tests and making sure laws were followed was “why you get the big bucks, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdkx8Y"&gt;“Not as big bucks as you get paid,” Rosendorff replied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7tkUZ"&gt;While he was among the highest-paid employees at Theranos, making $240,000 a year, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/vLx6xZ7AHDQ0Kr2l6Sw4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noted that partners at Wade’s firm made an average of about $1.5 million a year. Given the problems at Theranos, as well as lawyers’ fees that stemmed from his time there, he should have been paid more, Rosendorff said. That bit of testimony was struck from the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ibjlc4"&gt;Bickering aside, Wade did make some progress. He put some of the emails Rosendorff had been asked about on direct examination in chronological order with documents Rosendorff had signed, showing that whatever reservations Rosendorff had didn’t stop him from approving tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66gC7M"&gt;Crucially, Wade got Rosendorff to revise his testimony about proficiency testing, which is required by law. Though proficiency testing wasn’t run on the Edison devices, Rosendorff said, it &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; been run on the FDA-approved machines in the lab. Wade produced documents from the American Proficiency Institute that graded Theranos “acceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NJtNcu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We have at least one more day of listening to Rosendorff and Wade squabble&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7j55dC"&gt;This is a significant narrowing of Rosendorff’s testimony from the direct examination. Unlike Wade’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699614/elizabeth-holmes-trial-steve-jobs-emails"&gt;attempted “gotcha” moment yesterday,&lt;/a&gt; this &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; make me reconsider how I felt about Rosendorff’s direct testimony on proficiency testing. It is far less damning to say that proficiency testing had been done everywhere &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; the Edison, which was used for only seven tests. Rosendorff was testifying to plans for proficiency testing on the Edison machines when he had to leave for the day. (This was when the email dispute occurred.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sU0p06"&gt;Remarks made by counsel after the jury left suggested we have at least one more day of listening to Rosendorff and Wade squabble, which I am not especially looking forward to. But Sung’s testimony &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; give me something to get excited about: What is the rest of Big Pharma going to say about Theranos?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon settles with the activists it fired</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d_xQhbdkZnFG3TGWQxLgs9mBwZc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69929129/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i98rut"&gt;Amazon has settled a dispute with two workers that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367672/amazon-employees-climate-justice-nlrb-case-wrongful-termination"&gt;National Labor Relations Board said were fired for their activism&lt;/a&gt;. In April 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220353/amazon-covid-19-criticism-protest-fired-employees-cunningham-costa-climate-change"&gt;fired Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa&lt;/a&gt; after they had organized a protest against Amazon’s work with oil and gas companies, as well as raising concerns with the company’s coronavirus measures at its warehouses. &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15kVQrpyqH_sbtOXvQ38DeXZx7lwLAn3GVsZUDb6i0e8/edit"&gt;In a joint statement&lt;/a&gt;, Costa and Cunningham said that the company would have to pay them lost wages as well as inform employees that they couldn’t be fired for organizing. They haven’t mentioned whether they would be getting their jobs as UX designers back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czFgdX"&gt;At the time of the NLRB’s ruling, Amazon said that it disagreed with the findings, and that Costa and Cunningham had been fired due to violation of internal policies. NLRB rulings don’t carry the weight of ones handed down by federal judges, but the labor relations board &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do"&gt;can argue to the legal system&lt;/a&gt; that its orders should be enforced. Often, though, &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/decide-cases"&gt;the two parties will settle&lt;/a&gt; as we saw today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3sl04B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The former employees called the settlement “a win for protecting workers rights”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GdnP1L"&gt; Amazon did not immediately respond to request for comment, but &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/29/amazon-settles-with-employees-who-said-they-were-fired-over-activism.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that it and the employees had “reached a mutual agreement that resolves the legal issues in this case and welcome the resolution of this matter.” Costa and Cunningham called the settlement “a win for protecting workers rights.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0ODCn"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/fired-interrogated-disciplined-amazon-warehouse-organizers-allege-year-retaliation-n1262367"&gt;faces many more NLRB complaints&lt;/a&gt;, and the NLRB &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;issued a preliminary assessment&lt;/a&gt; in August that the company illegally interfered with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"&gt;highly publicized warehouse union drive&lt;/a&gt; in Bessemer, Alabama. That case is &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/10-RC-269250"&gt;currently still open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZzoyG"&gt;Amazon has already been required to post notices informing workers about their labor rights because of previous settlements, so that’s not a new win for organizers or activists. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-union-labor-violations-nlrb"&gt;Some workers have argued&lt;/a&gt; that the settlements and NLRB rulings don’t carry enough consequences for Amazon to change its retaliatory behavior against its employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="d6jIEl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NLRB officer says Amazon violated US labor law","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>This is Facebook’s internal research on the mental health effects of Instagram</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BhvNkv8KRLSBKoToVPMrKwZbqtI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69929052/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hbaYAV"&gt;Facebook has shared the internal research about the impact of Instagram on teenage mental wellbeing reported on by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported that the files showed Instagram knew the social media network has a negative affect on teens’ mental health. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report"&gt;has pushed back&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;WSJ’s&lt;/em&gt; characterizations of its research, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; “it is simply not accurate that this research demonstrates Instagram is ‘toxic’ for teen girls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSTY2F"&gt;The research slide decks are available on &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/"&gt;Facebook’s newsroom here&lt;/a&gt;, split into two PDFs. We’ve also embedded the PDFs at the bottom of this story. Notably, the two PDFs have been annotated by Facebook in an effort to provide context.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7pKkt"&gt;Following Facebook’s release of the two documents, &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-documents-instagram-teens-11632953840?page=1"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; them along with four more that it said formed the basis of its Instagram story. &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reporter Jeff Horwitz &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffHorwitz/status/1443397583645249541"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Facebook ran the first two documents minutes after being given an hour’s notice of the newspaper’s plans to publish. The previously unpublished documents include research on teen girls’ body image and appearance-based social comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="M5o4Lx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“teens who have lower life satisfaction more likely to say Instagram makes their mental health... worse”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kLORH9"&gt;The release comes after significant pressure on Facebook to release the files, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22697786/why-facebook-should-release-the-facebook-files"&gt;including from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Casey Newton&lt;/a&gt;. “We know Facebook executives believe that the company has positive overall benefits for the world, and we also know that they are meticulous students of their own data,” Newton wrote on Tuesday. “It’s hard to understand why, if the data is so positive, Facebook is often so reluctant to share it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKD65L"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s report highlighted specific findings from the document as evidence of a broader mental health problem on the app — most notably the finding that “thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wj3SY8"&gt;The slides produced by Facebook do much to back up to that interpretation, even if the company disputes specific points of the interpretation. In one particular slide, Facebook clarifies that the data is better interpreted as “teens who have lower life satisfaction more likely to say Instagram makes their mental health or the way they feel about themselves worse than teens who are satisfied with their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6XVpN"&gt;The release of the research arrives the evening before a Congressional hearing on the effect of Facebook and Instagram on kids’ mental health. That hearing is scheduled &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/9/protecting-kids-online-facebook-instagram-and-mental-health-harms"&gt;for Thursday at 10:30AM ET&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo categorically denies that a 4K Switch Pro is in development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nintendo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kzndv147yiO9wZfKx_61I1fa9VI=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69929036/nintendo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f4M4eY"&gt;It is rare for a big company to come out and categorically deny an entire report, but that’s what Nintendo just did today — the Japanese corporate entity has issued a press release insisting that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-29/nintendo-switch-4k-developers-make-games-for-nonexistent-console?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s seeming revelation&lt;/a&gt; that Nintendo was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701210/nintendo-switch-4k-pro-rumors-oled"&gt;pushing developers to build 4K-resolution games&lt;/a&gt; for an upcoming but potentially canceled “Switch Pro” handheld was entirely incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNMMYO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1443366440183074819"&gt;Nintendo writes&lt;/a&gt; the report “falsely claims that Nintendo is supplying tools to drive game development for a Nintendo Switch with 4K support” and insists that it’s “not true.” Separately, it says that it has no plans for any new Nintendo Switch other than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22690483/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-oled-console-hands-on-preview"&gt;the slightly refined OLED model&lt;/a&gt; that’ll be out next week.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gvtXQt_gsnw_c91aFLwK8mp6mWA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22889057/nintendo_twitter_bloomberg_report_switch_pro.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1hUcdR"&gt;While there’s always a possibility that the language technically allows for most if not all of &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; report to be correct — that, for instance, there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a 4K Switch development kit, and that Nintendo &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; push developers to build 4K content, and that Nintendo is simply &lt;em&gt;not pushing that anymore — &lt;/em&gt;Nintendo is attempting to say that the entire report is not true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ewPtO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; appears to be standing by its report, which isn’t much of a surprise. It comes from respected game/tech industry journalists who have been extremely well-sourced in the past, and this report is no exception: it cites anonymous employees at 11 different game companies all saying they have a 4K Switch development kit. Following Nintendo’s tweet, the publication simply added an additional line about Nintendo’s denial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDB7HZ"&gt;Weighed against a Nintendo statement with even a little bit of wiggle room, I’d tend to believe 11 sources over the company, particularly when that company’s under investor pressure to have its new OLED handheld do well on launch day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zPHp6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:56PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Bloomberg has minimally updated its post to include Nintendo’s new denial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chinese companies are suing Amazon after getting banned for paid reviews</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ryiG2POo7LSFl1Qs79_hO4nXEM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69928861/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rW7Egv"&gt;Several Chinese companies have filed a class-action complaint against Amazon for banning them from the Amazon marketplace over their use of paid reviews, a new complaint filed on September 13th claims. In the last year, Amazon has cracked down on companies soliciting paid reviews on its platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680269/amazon-ban-chinese-brands-review-abuse-fraud-policy"&gt;claiming to have permanently banned 600 Chinese brands&lt;/a&gt; across 3,000 seller accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SR7iBT"&gt;The companies listed in the complaint, doing business as Sopownic, Slaouwo, Deyixun, Cstech, Recoo Direct, Angelbliss, and Tudi, are seeking “recovery of funds that are being illegally and improperly withheld by Amazon” and are filing the class action to “stop any further misappropriation and misuse of funds that are legally and rightfully due to thousands of Amazon sellers and merchants,” the complaint reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zoy3P3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Who wins when Amazon pulls brands from its store?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22570521/amazon-ravpower-choetech-aukey-mpow-brands-removed"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="R3UtCv"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/3/13155578/amazon-incentivized-reviews-ban-vine-program-product-bias"&gt;a strict policy forbidding “incentivized reviews,” which it instituted in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. The companies don’t deny that they violated Amazon’s policy. Their problem is that Amazon is withholding “several hundred dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars” of their claimed earnings. &lt;a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G1791?language=en_US"&gt;Amazon’s Services Business Solutions Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, which covers Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) businesses like the ones these Chinese companies operated, is pretty clear that Amazon reserves “sole discretion” in deciding whether or not to permanently withhold funds if a company violates its policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNpCVg"&gt;The companies’ counterargument? Amazon is in charge of distribution in an FBA arrangement, so it should’ve been aware the companies were offering gift cards to customers that left positive reviews. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has asked Amazon for comment and will update if we hear more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOS6F6"&gt;Actually trying to enforce its policies is a good thing for Amazon to do. Just because it was more relaxed before doesn’t mean it loses the right to be strict now. It’s easy to sympathize with these companies, but their experience is also the reality of building a business on a platform you don’t own — at any point the rug can be pulled out from under you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FAA clears Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo for flight after probe into July incident</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-TOURISM-BEZOS-BRANSON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1nvmjA040JFtrW1hCjOleIKM_i0=/0x0:4766x3177/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69928661/1233922997.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P7FAry"&gt;Virgin Galactic is cleared to resume flights of its SpaceShipTwo space plane, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Wednesday, after capping a safety investigation into issues that came up during the company’s July flight carrying its founder Richard Branson. During that mission, SpaceShipTwo strayed from its designated airspace on its descent from space, and Virgin Galactic didn’t tell the FAA about it when it was supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXcghp"&gt;With the investigation now closed, the FAA required Virgin Galactic to make changes “on how it communicates to the FAA during flight operations to keep the public safe,” it said in a statement. Virgin Galactic said that includes “updated calculations to expand the protected airspace for future flights” and “additional steps into the Company’s flight procedures to ensure real-time mission notifications to FAA Air Traffic Control.” Another change: “Updated calculations to expand the protected airspace for future flights,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JwJ7eo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We appreciate the FAA’s thorough review of this inquiry,” Virgin Galactic’s CEO said.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GdP1DN"&gt;The July 11th mission, called Unity 22, carried Branson and three company employees to the edge of space and back over Virgin Galactic’s Spaceport America facilities in New Mexico. The company’s SpaceShipTwo, a winged suborbital space tourism plane with two pilots, flew 53.5 miles high, executing a highly publicized demonstration mission. The company has a backlog of some 600 paying customers waiting for their chance to fly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VeF6c"&gt;The mission appeared successful until months later, on September 1st, when &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-red-warning-light-on-richard-bransons-space-flight"&gt;reported that pilots had been alerted to warning lights&lt;/a&gt; during their rocket-powered ascent to space. Those warnings indicated the spaceship wasn’t ascending vertically enough to be able to free-glide back to Earth after reaching space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5reMj"&gt;“We appreciate the FAA’s thorough review of this inquiry. Our test flight program is specifically designed to continually improve our processes and procedures,” Virgin Galactic CEO Michael Colglazier said in a statement, adding that “our entire approach to spaceflight” is focused on safety. “The updates to our airspace and real-time mission notification protocols will strengthen our preparations as we move closer to the commercial launch of our spaceflight experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ooRStY"&gt;The company’s next flight, Unity 23, is a research mission flying three members of the Italian Air Force. Virgin Galactic has said the FAA probe hasn’t affected the timeline for Unity 23, but another technical issue might push things back. Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://investors.virgingalactic.com/news/news-details/2021/Virgin-Galactic-Provides-Update-on-Unity-23-Test-Flight/default.aspx"&gt;the company said&lt;/a&gt; “a third-party supplier recently flagged a potential manufacturing defect in a component of the flight control actuation system that they supply to Virgin Galactic,” and that “the earliest the Company expects to open its flight window for Unity 23 is mid-October.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Switch Pro was real, Bloomberg reports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2v_yjzxlP_iEgCHWuSJv0hfQ5lc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69928545/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AiWjTY"&gt;Don’t get me wrong; we’re excited about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22690483/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-oled-console-hands-on-preview'"&gt;Nintendo’s new OLED Switch&lt;/a&gt; — the number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21257643/nintendo-switch-lite-how-to-buy-in-stock"&gt;preorders&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; newsroom confirms it. But what about the more powerful Switch that so many of us thought was around the corner? A new &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-29/nintendo-switch-4k-developers-make-games-for-nonexistent-console?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report suggests that the global chip shortage is why plans fell through for a “Switch Pro” with upgraded hardware from Nvidia and 4K resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ll0JLN"&gt;The outlet, which previously reported on the device, backs up those reports by saying it’s identified at least 11 developers, like Zynga, who have received 4K Nintendo Switch development kits. Specifically, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; claims employees heard from Nintendo that they should design games to target the higher resolution. In response, Nintendo told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; its reporting was “inaccurate” without specifying which parts. After we published this story, Nintendo went on to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701435/nintendo-categorically-denies-4k-switch-pro-development"&gt;categorically deny the entire report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lMCxTd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A more powerful Switch reportedly won’t go on sale before late 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qNKKtS"&gt;These reporters tend to focus on supply chain issues and identified a particular component that Nintendo needs as having supplies completely booked through 2025. That doesn’t mean that the Switch Pro dream is completely dead, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; sources say that if an upgraded model appears, it won’t go on sale before late 2022, at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNsr6b"&gt;As it is, Nintendo gave gamers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"&gt;some of the things we hoped for&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;Switch OLED&lt;/a&gt; — smaller bezels, a better stand, and that sweet screen. Plus, it just unleashed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674704/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-audio-software-update"&gt;Bluetooth headphone support via a software update&lt;/a&gt;. Is that enough to make up for the missing 4K and no apparent changes to the Joy-Cons? It will have to be since Nintendo has “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1416986988658397185"&gt;no plans&lt;/a&gt;” for launching another model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9HDdM6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Don’t count out the Nintendo Switch Pro ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565469/nintendo-switch-pro-oled-timing-chip-shortages-cpu-nvidia-tegra"},{"title":"Nintendo never needed to fix the Switch; it’s not broken","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564966/nintendo-switch-oled-display-ps5-xbox"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="roLk4Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:36PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo has now &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701435/nintendo-categorically-denies-4k-switch-pro-development"&gt;&lt;em&gt;categorically denied this report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,  a rare move, though we aren’t entirely buying it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok settles lawsuit with actress over its original text-to-speech voice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mgFXXRKe3Q3Dt39FOJEFJUgXnVo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69928467/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AfRJ4J"&gt;TikTok has agreed to settle a lawsuit with Bev Standing, the voice actress who said she was behind the app’s original text-to-speech voice. Standing sued TikTok in May, saying that the app was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22435058/tiktok-voice-sues-unauthorized-usage-text-to-speech"&gt;using her voice without permission&lt;/a&gt;. A robotic version of what sounded like Standing’s voice had been in the app for months, speaking over what felt like every other video at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onzcGh"&gt;A lawyer for Standing said the settlement was still being finalized and details around payment could not be disclosed. “They’ve reached an amicable resolution,” Robert Sciglimpaglia, who represents Standing, said in a phone call with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Sciglimpaglia said TikTok would license Standing’s voice as part of the agreement, but it’s up to TikTok whether or not to use it. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0nGsCZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Standing said her voice was meant to be used for Chinese translations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="05ik8b"&gt;It sounds as though some strange mixup led to Standing’s voice being used by TikTok in the first place. Standing said that she made recordings for a text-to-speech feature “several years ago” but that they were meant to be used for translations of Chinese texts. No one else was supposed to use them. But somehow, her voice seems to have made its way to TikTok, where it became a near-ubiquitous presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOIZSU"&gt;“No matter what I do, I believe this is going to affect my business,” Standing &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/05/09/voice-tiktok-sues-company-emotional-distress/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2Dl1x"&gt;TikTok never confirmed that it used Standing’s voice, but the feature sure sounded like her. About two weeks after the lawsuit was filed, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452815/tiktok-voice-change-text-to-speech-lawsuit"&gt;TikTok’s text-to-speech voice changed&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of Standing’s odd monotone recording, it changed to a voice that’s relentlessly upbeat. One assumes TikTok checked the copyright on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDCfVW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 29th, 6:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with comment from Standing’s lawyer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cadillac axes Escalade’s hands-free driving feature due to chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MIsXUGo-B97pTWLVIzVqO1DLbIw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69928293/cadillac_2021_escalade_0433.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XrhZig"&gt;The 2022 Escalade is heading into production, but it’ll be missing a key feature when the first customers pick up their new ride: the hands-free driving mode known as Super Cruise. It’s the latest feature to get the axe as a result of the global semiconductor shortage, which has been an especially big drain on the auto industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ImJ4Yc"&gt;The shortage is also forcing Cadillac to hold off on adding Super Cruise to the CT4 and CT5 sedans, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2022-cadillac-escalade-super-cruise-hands-free-chip-shortage/?UniqueID=A3F2E32E-2148-11EC-8A3C-BD1F16F31EAE&amp;amp;PostType=link&amp;amp;TheTime=2021-09-29T17%3A14%3A01&amp;amp;ServiceType=twitter&amp;amp;ftag=COS-05-10aaa0b"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Roadshow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; With the Bolt currently not on sale due to the massive battery recall, that means parent company General Motors’ most advanced technological feature is currently not available on any new car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwZRzI"&gt;“[W]e’re confident in our team’s ability to find creative solutions to mitigate the supply chain situation and resume offering the feature for our customers as soon as possible,” Cadillac told &lt;em&gt;Roadshow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSLwZN"&gt;Super Cruise debuted on the CT6 (which has since been discontinued). It uses a variety of sensors, software, and eye-tracking to allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel on pre-mapped roads — as long as they keep watching where the vehicle is going. Cadillac &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/6/17433810/cadillac-super-cruise-expands-2020-gm"&gt;announced in 2018&lt;/a&gt; that it would expand the feature to all cars and SUVs in its lineup and that Super Cruise would come to other GM models as well. Other automakers are working on similar features, like Ford, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383460/ford-bluecruise-hands-free-adas-f150-mustang-mache"&gt;calls its own system BlueCruise&lt;/a&gt;. (GM is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22591805/gm-cruise-lawsuit-trademark-infringement-hands-free-driving-autonomous"&gt;suing Ford over the name&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8T3D38"&gt;Automakers have had to make a number of hard choices because of the chip shortage. In some cases, they can’t get the ones they need, and in others, they have to prioritize where to use the chips they &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;get. GM has so far focused more on cutting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575836/gm-wireless-charging-cadillac-chevy-tahoe-chip-shortage"&gt;specific features from certain models&lt;/a&gt; where possible, like wireless charging, HD radio, auto stop-start, and, in some trucks, a fuel economy module. But it’s also had to briefly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654357/gm-factory-shutdown-chip-shortage-truck-suv"&gt;stop production at various plants altogether&lt;/a&gt;, like pretty much all of its peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFsuJg"&gt;Losing Super Cruise on the Escalade is particularly notable, though, because GM has spent the last few years positioning Cadillac as the brand that’s most representative of the automaker’s future. Cadillac is where GM first started rolling out Super Cruise and is also going to sell one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;the first electric vehicles built on the parent company’s new electric vehicle platform&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hG512g"&gt;The 2022 Escalade was supposed to be a flagship in this push. GM and Cadillac adorned it with a massive touchscreen and fitted it with Super Cruise. Now, though, that feature is in limbo for the luxury SUV, and with no end to the chip shortage in sight, it could be a while before buyers get the option back.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ngbeZJ"&gt;First announced at last year’s Amazon hardware event, the Ring Always Home Cam is now ready for take-off. Starting today, September 28th, you can request an invitation to be a crash-test dummy for Ring’s newest innovation. The Always Home Cam is a Ring camera attached to a drone that can fly predetermined paths in your home when triggered via a Ring Alarm sensor or from the Ring app. The camera costs $249.99; if you live in the US, you can apply for &lt;a href="https://ring.com/always-home-cam-flying-camera"&gt;an invitation to buy it&lt;/a&gt; today, and the devices will ship later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BjxoL"&gt;Designed to solve the problem of wanting to be able to see inside your home when you’re not there but not wanting to have dozens of cameras watching you when you are, the Always Home Cam only records when it’s in flight. When not in use, it sits in its charging dock that blocks its lens. It can fly to specific viewpoints on demand — such as the front door or kitchen stove — and can also tie into a Ring Alarm home security system and buzz over to any action — such as a door or window opening when the alarm is armed.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Always Home Cam sits in a charging base when not in use, where its camera is disabled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1h5aS"&gt;In the year since it announced the product, Ring has been working on refining the ambitious device and essentially making sure it won’t go on a rampage through your home. “It’s not an overstatement to say we’ve made a thousand refinements to it,” Ring founder Jamie Siminoff said in an interview ahead of the announcement. “We learned how to fly.” While they had working prototypes when they announced in 2020, it’s only now ready for regular people’s homes, says Siminoff. But not everyone’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KErIoP"&gt;Ring is rolling out the invite-only program as a sort of post-beta test flight. “I have it in my home, and it does work,” said Siminoff. “But today’s homes are so unique, so we really need to get it into more customers’ homes to make sure everything we are doing is right.” After all, it is an autonomous flying machine in your home. “With any other product, we would have probably just been shipping. With this one, we are going to take our time, make sure it’s right before we go to full, general availability.”&lt;/p&gt;

We use this as a tool to deliver the best products to customers and be transparent with them.” So, does this means if it crashes into your big screen TV, you’re just plumb out of luck?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IcaIgImKI5JHNXo3rmIT0EqVE-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882432/20210922_lifestyle_ots_backyard_fcc_rgb.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The home security drone can be controlled through the Ring app, or respond autonomously to events in your home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YNtWSn"&gt;In terms of day-to-day use and features, much of what was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453709/ring-always-home-cam-indoor-drone-security-camera-price-specs-features-amazon"&gt;announced last year&lt;/a&gt; is the same. The Always Home Cam is an indoor-only camera attached to a drone with enclosed propellers. It streams and records to the Ring app, is fully autonomous and can be commanded to fly on-demand to pre-set locations through the app or programmed to take off when Ring Alarm detects a disturbance. Ring says the resolution of the camera has increased to 1400 x 1400 HD, which is a bump up from the 1080p resolution it was when it was first announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOo7Ui"&gt;The camera only records in-flight, and the drone makes an audible noise, so it’s clear when footage is recording. It has obstacle avoidance technology, but its shrouded propellors should prevent any serious damage if there is a collision (“But you should keep it away from your Van Gogh,” joked Siminoff). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lm9eQL"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Ring Always Home Cam demo video|104113" data-volume-uuid="d5072579f" data-volume-id="104113" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-120" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s9QA7G"&gt;The Always Home Cam is designed for use on a single floor, as it can’t navigate stairs. But Siminoff says multi-floor support is something the company is exploring. It should also only fly when there is no one home. While the drone has been tested with ceiling and tabletop fans, Siminoff said it might have difficulties if a fan is blowing full speed. “But if it feels like it’s not doing the right thing, it’ll just land in a safe area and sit there,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pw3mpa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It only records in-flight, and the drone makes an audible noise, so it’s clear when footage is recording&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Eez7QZ"&gt;The battery life is short, with flight time limited to around five minutes. “The idea is it’s very like tactical; you don’t need to go see that a door’s ajar for two hours,” said Siminoff. “It’s meant to go out for a few minutes, see what you need to see, and then fly back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReOboC"&gt;A flying camera in your home does feel like a sci-fi fantasy / horror story come true. But from a practical and privacy standpoint, the concept is a solid one. You only need one camera to see an entire floor of your home, and there’s no danger of it accidentally recording without you knowing about it. Also, it’s way cool. “There’s something about watching this fly through your house on your phone; it feels like something out of Hollywood, but it’s your house,” said Siminoff. “For me, it really was a jaw-dropping experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHwD4K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 5:09PM ET, September 29th 2021: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The resolution of the Always Home Cam is 1400x1400 HD, not 1080p as an earlier version of this article stated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
