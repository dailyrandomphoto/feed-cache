    <title>Yellowjackets’ first season is a collective fever dream</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="yellowjackets" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PaXMtrjX5t4GQb0F22qpsALh6ho=/0x0:4096x2731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407754/FEAkzkcUUAISeH5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Showtime&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="porp4X"&gt;At the very start of &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt;, we meet Allie, a freshman who was meant to be on the plane when it crashed. “I’ll never forget the day I heard their plane had gone missing. I mean, that could have been me,” she says dramatically in a thick Jersey accent, cigarette and wine in hand. And yet, it wasn’t. This one throwaway line has stuck with me since the beginning of the show; the larger &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; discussion isn’t just about the parasocial adoption of others’ trauma, but the way we talk about the girls and the show and regress into a deliriously unhinged version of the ’90s that I didn’t even know I wanted, and it rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmqQMZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This essay contains spoilers for the first season of Yellowjackets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K99dKc"&gt;When it comes to &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; theories, there isn’t much to add that hasn’t already been said; I was, in the beginning, an Adam-is-Javi believer and was, until the finale, convinced that Jackie somehow made it out on her own. But, on the heels of last Sunday’s season finale, what I keep coming back to is &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;we talk about &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; and the way we project ourselves onto the imperiled teens: quietly resilient Shauna, impulsive Nat, needy Jackie, ambitious Taissa, and everyone’s favorite sociopath Misty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d5apHS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Yellowjackets has reawakened my inner Lost fan","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/15/22884153/yellowjackets-theories-season-finale-showtime"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rQK5sP"&gt;Unfettered nostalgia for the ’90s — especially among elder millennials and Gen-X folks — has been a part of our cultural consciousness for decades, and the &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; team knows it. On the surface, the ’90s setting is its most effective weapon. It was a “simpler time” full of iconic albums and movies and catchphrases and band T-shirts that remain living parts of our memories. But it was also a time when being openly queer / gay wasn’t accepted, when cloying stereotypes had a much stronger hand in shaping teen social dynamics, when things were awkward and grungy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTisTV"&gt;All of this ‘90s catnip is a rose-colored yearning for how we communicated before smartphones and TikTok, and for high school girls, a huge part of this is a violent opera of hormones and a lot of spontaneous psychic damage to the people around them. The show’s creators, Amy Lyle and Bart Nickerson, are really, really good at wielding this brand of emotional nostalgia, and as a result, the way we talk about &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; is ultimately, for me, a delightful regression back to my high-school self. It really is like riding a fucked-up bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NA4EpH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X6X2uEAbzJs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FZH8Y4"&gt;A few critics have pointed out, rightly so, that all the speculating and all the theories ultimately don’t mean anything. The real beating heart of &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; isn’t really about picking apart Jackie’s temporally questionable diary entries or the casual Hole song designed to send me straight back to puberty. That’s all set dressing and theatre. And as fun as it is pointing out when Shauna rocks a Yo La Tengo shirt, my takeaway from this whole experience is far more masochistic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evmrgk"&gt;After the finale, while waiting for a friend to respond to my wall of “lottie wtf” texts, I almost fell over shambling from the bathroom with my pants around my ankles to snatch my phone. Sure, we can blame a bit of that on pandemic life, but the mad hormonal urgency with which we need to discuss and dissect each episode every Sunday night is a time machine straight back to the delirium of high school phone sessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="m7mT3x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yellowjackets is a collective fever dream&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MonCdS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; is a collective fever dream, a streamed microdose to bring out the best and worst of our past selves. It’s a meticulously-designed mirror that reproduces the neuroses of high-school teenhood: the small, fierce insecurities; the volcanic outbursts; the shifting alliances. When we see Jackie staring daggers at Shauna getting close to other girls, I can remember just how that white-hot paranoia and jealousy feels in my bones. Shauna and Jackie’s big finale showdown is built on the social rituals and power dynamics of every archetypal popular-girl story ever told — the kind of stuff that fueled the all-girls boarding school I went to and the kind of stuff you outgrow (hopefully) and shed like a skin. In harnessing this power, &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; does something sacred and brings back all of that angst and energy to channel into its viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMNVi4"&gt;It’s not just a show about the visceral pains of teenhood (nor the limbo of adulthood) but the paper-thin membranes between trauma and PTSD and hysteria and reality. On a very basic level, the show is an exploration of figurative and literal interiors and exteriors, peppered with the sort of dark humor that shares a satirical heritage with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heathers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a simple formula: mix one part horror / suspense with gnarly gore, a sprinkling of dark jokes, and one part drama with a particularly alluring flavor of retrospection that sucks the viewer in like a force of nature. At the same time, it doesn’t take itself too seriously, which is its saving grace. It’s messy and melodramatic as hell, and if you think you were any better than this in high school, you’re a liar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sYZsY"&gt;In the finale, we come back to Allie at the Yellowjackets’ 25th high school reunion, still trying to insert herself into the narrative, riding high on her position as class chair. It’s full circle — the Yellowjackets’ story as a form of parasocial community lore, the surviving group objectified as a kind of aspirational trauma porn. It comes back to the way people talk about it all, which we replicate beautifully, almost gleefully as spectators. From a theatrical standpoint, it’s one of the most effective pseudo-participatory shows I’ve committed to in a long time, and it’s wild to think it was made in part as proof that girls can be as brutal as boys &lt;em&gt;a la&lt;/em&gt; Lord of the Flies — gender essentialism aside, high school girls are powerful cacodemons, and you can bet in 2022, they absolutely know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVHb0K"&gt;This wouldn’t be a real &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; post if I didn’t cave and name a theory to end this all on and that it’s that our human sacrifice victim was possibly Lottie (tall-ish, long dark hair, last bearer of Jackie’s necklace). We’re supposed to think Lottie is still alive at the end of the season, thanks to her name being dropped in the last 30 seconds of the finale — but &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; clearly still has surprises up its sleeve. The fact that it was initially sold as a five-season show is a little concerning; this isn’t the sort of story that benefits from being drawn out too long. Still, when it comes to the way it speaks to its audience and prompts us to dissect its bones among ourselves, &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; is doing something really special right now that I haven’t seen or felt in years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A guide to Microsoft’s Xbox game studios empire</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k0311CcOIEAopbqx5YDEg188gdk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407674/Microsoft_Activision_Blizzard.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft Corp.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tchbfi"&gt;With the impending purchase of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion dollars, Microsoft is now the third-largest video game publisher in the world by revenue. It owns several of the biggest gaming franchises of all time, including &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls&lt;/em&gt;, and now &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;. Since the early 2000s, Microsoft has slowly but steadily expanded its holdings, adding to its stable of first-party developers. An explosion of acquisitions in the late teens combined with the purchase of Bethesda last year made Microsoft a many-armed behemoth in the gaming industry, surpassed only by Sony and Tencent. Here’s a breakdown of the studios and games Microsoft could own if the deal goes through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DCmML2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/zldVsmhJ5M"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zldVsmhJ5M&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Klobrille (@klobrille) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klobrille/status/1483453730058125321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OO83X3"&gt;Though formally established as Xbox Game Studios Publishing in 2000, Microsoft has published a wealth of games dating back to the ’70s, including PC standards like &lt;em&gt;Solitaire&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Minesweeper&lt;/em&gt;. Throughout the aughts, Microsoft created several first-party studios to handle the development of its flagship series. In 2001, Microsoft founded Turn 10 studios for &lt;em&gt;Forza Motorsport&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; developer 343 Industries was created in 2007. The Coalition was born in 2010 after Microsoft bought the &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt; series from Epic Games. In 2018, The Initiative became Microsoft’s first Santa Monica-based developer that is working on a new&lt;em&gt; Perfect Dark &lt;/em&gt;game, and in 2019, World’s Edge was established to oversee the &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUkBj7"&gt;Microsoft’s first big acquisition was when it bought British-based developer Rare in 2002. Throughout the ’90s and into the early aughts, Rare became emblematic of the mascot platformer genre with the release of &lt;em&gt;Battletoads&lt;/em&gt; in 1991, continuing with the &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong Country &lt;/em&gt;series, &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Conker’s Bad Fur Day&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong 64&lt;/em&gt;. Rare’s first Xbox exclusive was the mediocre action-adventure game &lt;em&gt;Grabbed by the Ghoulies&lt;/em&gt;. Its second, V&lt;em&gt;iva Piñata&lt;/em&gt;, enjoyed a much warmer reception. Rare developed several games for Xbox’s now-defunct Kinect peripheral and currently maintains the popular pirate co-op game &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;. In 2019, Rare announced it was working on a new action-adventure game titled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20965203/rare-everwild-xbox-windows-10-new-game-watch-trailer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everwild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBTbBG"&gt;In 2014, Mojang became Microsoft’s largest acquisition to date, adding the wildly successful sandbox game &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; to the Xbox family for $2.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UJBvy"&gt;2018 was a major year for Xbox, acquiring six studios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CQqvRY"&gt;Compulsion Games, creator of &lt;em&gt;We Happy Few&lt;/em&gt; and currently working on an unannounced third-person narrative game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kx9DrS"&gt;Ninja Theory, creator of the critically acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Hellblade&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vaaUgx"&gt;RPG-centric inXile Entertainment, developer of &lt;em&gt;Wasteland 3&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2tpE0V"&gt;Obsidian Entertainment, maker of&lt;em&gt; The Outer Worlds&lt;/em&gt; and the forthcoming first-person RPG &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21333050/obsidian-avowed-xbox-series-x-game-trailer-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avowed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lnpn9C"&gt;Playground Games, developer of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769985/forza-horizon-5-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4igzej"&gt;Undead Labs, developer of the &lt;em&gt;State of Decay&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lqpWIX"&gt;The buying spree continued in 2019 with the purchase of&lt;em&gt; Psychonauts 2&lt;/em&gt; developer Double Fine Productions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iTpwB"&gt;In 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;Microsoft acquired ZeniMax Media / Bethesda Softworks&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly dispensing with the strategy of buying single companies in favor of absorbing one giant publisher and all its studios at once. Microsoft bought Bethesda for $7.5 billion, acquiring its eight subsidiaries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zdE9u2"&gt;Mobile developer Alpha Dog Games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mOuNj0"&gt;French-based &lt;em&gt;Dishonored&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; developer Arkane Studios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UP0Uj3"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Fallout&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls&lt;/em&gt; developer Bethesda Game Studios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="P5uHdR"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein&lt;/em&gt; series developer MachineGames&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qTFXvy"&gt;Id Software, the celebrated creators of &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Quake&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZwhPi8"&gt;Tango Gameworks, the Japanese developer of horror series &lt;em&gt;The Evil Within&lt;/em&gt; and the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575328/ghostwire-tokyo-tango-microsoft-ps5-exclusive-delayed-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostwire: Tokyo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bzrgej"&gt;Roundhouse Studios, formerly known as Human Head Studios, developer of 2006’s &lt;em&gt;Prey&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KP8wLe"&gt;ZeniMax Online Studios, which oversees MMO &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls Online&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="VNTwlH"&gt;Provided the deal goes through, Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard King will add nine new studios, bringing the total number of developers owned to 32. The biggest studios in the deal are &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; developer Treyarch Games and Infinity Ward, as well as &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; developer Blizzard Entertainment. Activision’s previous purchases and mergers will grant Microsoft ownership of former PlayStation exclusives &lt;em&gt;Spyro the Dragon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Crash Bandicoot,&lt;/em&gt; as well as the &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk&lt;/em&gt; series. The deal also incorporates a number of smaller studios that work as co-developers or support for Activision Blizzard’s bigger games, including Beenox, Toys for Bob, High Moon Studios, Sledgehammer Games, and the embattled Raven Software, whose employees are entering their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820549/activision-blizzard-raven-software-layoffs-walkout-call-of-duty"&gt;fifth week of striking&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft will also gain a major player in the mobile gaming scene with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9662214/actvision-blizzard-buys-candy-crush-king-5-9-billion"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; creator King. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1a0foy"&gt;Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard presents an immense opportunity to grow Xbox’s Game Pass library, and the titles mentioned here are by no means a comprehensive list of all the games it will soon have access to. Microsoft will also have to reckon with Activision Blizzard’s history of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;permitting abuse and discrimination in its workplace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;the CEO who allegedly enabled and buried those practices&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828146/activision-blizzard-exec-brain-bulatao-anti-unionization-letter"&gt;burgeoning efforts to unionize&lt;/a&gt; the various studios under ABK’s ownership. The acquisition is still subject to an approval process and isn’t expected to close until 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0fIu1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYzXiD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD hides its claim that 4GB of VRAM is ‘not enough’ just as it launches a 4GB GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CmObtW8HrpAm-rZVynFdGYp24-Q=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407618/amd4gbofvramoops.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0qPZ1h"&gt;AMD claimed back in 2020 that 4GB of VRAM was “insufficient” for modern PC games and could result in error messages, warning limits, lower framerates, and even gameplay stutter or pop-in issues. Today, AMD is launching the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865817/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-rdna-2-price-release-date"&gt;$199 RX 6500 XT&lt;/a&gt; with... 4GB of VRAM, and the blog post featuring AMD’s original claims has mysteriously disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tNhpf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/amd-hides-2020-blogpost-claiming-4gb-vram-is-not-enough-for-todays-games/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KitGuru &lt;/em&gt;reports that&lt;/a&gt; AMD has hidden the blog post today, as it was previously accessible yesterday, and a &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:SFDks_9NnscJ:https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/game-beyond-4gb/ba-p/414776"&gt;Google cached view version&lt;/a&gt; from January 16th has the post in full. “AMD is leading the industry at providing gamers with high VRAM graphics solutions across the entire product offering,” said Adit Bhutani, a Radeon marketing specialist for AMD, in the blog post from 2020. “Competitive products at a similar entry level price-point are offering up to a maximum of 4GB of VRAM, which is evidently not enough for todays games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3ZyT5"&gt;At the time, AMD was promoting its own GPUs for 1080p gaming that included 6GB or 8GB of VRAM. The company performed a series of tests showing how much better an 8GB model of its RX 5500 XT was compared to a measly 4GB model. It looks like this blog post magically disappeared just as AMD is about to launch a new 4GB GPU today. &lt;em&gt;Mysterious&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xWbvQ9tNarmmy_ZEhVAVkx36HdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23178953/amdoops.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: AMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMD’s 2020 blog post included performance graphs highlighting 4GB GPUs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="35S32j"&gt;The new entry-level RX 6500 XT is supposedly priced at $199 and is available to purchase today (if you’re lucky). AMD’s marketing for this new GPU included a media roundtable earlier this month, where &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563016/why-less-could-mean-more-in-amd-and-nvidias-new-budget-gpu-battle.html"&gt;Radeon vice president Laura Smith claimed&lt;/a&gt; “even with the four gigs of frame buffer, that’s a really nice frame buffer size for the majority of triple-A games.” &lt;em&gt;Awkward&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3cKf9"&gt;Now, this could all be a totally innocent mistake or the most coincidental technical glitch we’ve ever seen, so we’ve reached out to AMD to comment on whether it has a search party looking for the missing blog post. We’ll update you once the blog post has mysteriously returned safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FuboTV launches new FanView widgets alongside multi-view on Apple TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zo5csh2WkYlm9EYq9ngWJRbTxl0=/32x0:2116x1389/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407485/fuboTV_Multiview_FanView.Jan_2022.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: FuboTV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S5QW3v"&gt;Live streaming app FuboTV is bringing its FanView widgets to Apple TV users, allowing them to view stats alongside single or multi-view match streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNt1X3"&gt;Multi-viewing, which allows sports fans to stream up to four live TV channels at once, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21529068/fubotv-multiview-four-channels-apple-tv"&gt;previously supported&lt;/a&gt; on Apple TV. But beginning today, users will be able to use the streaming service’s Multiview and FanView features on Apple TV all at once. FanView allows users to see stats and scores from games alongside their matches on the same screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E11VYw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/79I1KBWDRQA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pe27N3"&gt;With the feature support, Apple TV users will now be able to stream two games and two FanView widgets simultaneously, the company announced today. Mike Berkley, chief product officer at FuboTV, said in a statement that the addition will allow users to keep tabs on multiple games while also getting real-time stats from other matches. FanView widgets also work as one-click shortcuts to a selected game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fO5qOw"&gt;When FanView &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; enabled, Apple TV users will still be able to stream up to four simultaneous live TV feeds at once, the company said. Those feeds can display not only sports, but live news and entertainment programming as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54g8KZ"&gt;Apple TV is the latest platform to get support for FuboTV’s FanView feature, which &lt;a href="https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-to-Launch-Integrated-Free-to-Play-Games-FanView-Live-Stats-With-September-South-American-Qatar-World-Cup-2022-Qualifiers-CONMEBOL/default.aspx"&gt;first launched&lt;/a&gt; in August of 2021. The stats widget was previously available on Android TV, Fire TV, LG, Roku, Samsung Smart TV, Vizio SmartCast TV, and Xbox One devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A lone undersea internet cable connected Tonga to the world — a volcanic eruption broke it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Satellite Images Show Before/After Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai Volcano Eruption" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ChHPGne5hcGsBST1hgT8Hf_0zzo=/552x297:8375x5512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407480/1237820761.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano(pictured here on January 6th) erupted on January 14th&lt;/em&gt;. | Photo by Maxar via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Isb8CF"&gt;The effects of a colossal volcanic eruption in the Pacific archipelago of Tonga &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/19/climate/scientists-tonga-volcano-eruption-effects.html"&gt;are still being calculated&lt;/a&gt;, but one consequence is clear: Tonga has been cut off from the internet, after the lone undersea cable that connects the country to the rest of the web was damaged during the eruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPK7qV"&gt;Like many island nations, Tonga relies on just a single undersea cable, about the thickness of a garden hose and filled with fragile fiber-optic filaments, to get citizens online. But on Tuesday, the government of Tonga &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ConsulateKoT/status/1483384039826464768/photo/1"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; “communications both international and domestic were severed due to damage sustained by the submarine cable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GAEFb4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No internet has made it hard to get to detailed reports on the volcano’s damage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KB081Z"&gt;The government added that “limited communication” was possible through satellite phones and high-frequency radio, but these constraints are making it difficult to assess the damage caused by the January 14th eruption. The Tongan government has reported three fatalities as a result of a tsunami created by the volcano, which erupted on an uninhabited island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bf5Eno"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/funds/undersea-cable-fault-could-cut-off-tonga-rest-world-weeks-2022-01-18/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the internet cable that joined Tonga to the web is 827 kilometers (514 miles) long and secured via a relay on Fiji, Tonga’s second-nearest neighbor. Fixing the cable could take as long as two weeks, as the work requires the intervention of a specialist undersea cable repair ship.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Workers haul part of a fibre optic cable" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/22UJXnT8Cxjd6QmjMwXJ6q9qUCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23178917/88449405.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undersea cables like this one, being laid in the Kenyan port town of Mombasa, carry 99 percent of international internet traffic. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d9F6qS"&gt;The nearest such vessel is the Reliance, owned by US firm SubCom. But it is &lt;a href="https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:711444/mmsi:538001583/imo:9236494/vessel:RELIANCE"&gt;currently moored&lt;/a&gt; some 4,700 kilometers (2,920 miles) away in Papua New Guinea, and will take days to travel to Tonga. According to Craige Sloots, a marketing and sales director at Southern Cross Cable Network, a company that maintains a number of undersea cables in the region, that means it could take two weeks in total for Tonga’s internet connection to be repaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GvzNeP"&gt;“Its ability to repair would also be dependent, as you would expect, on any volcanic activity,” Sloots told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifQ6eR"&gt;The incident is a vivid demonstration of the fragility of modern internet. Although we think of the web as a dense network with numerous redundancies, the truth is that it contains many single points of failure. In the West, this is most obvious when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523953/twitch-reddit-down-fastly-outage-issues"&gt;huge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet"&gt;web&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;outages&lt;/a&gt; are caused by disruptions from centralized services like Amazon Web Services — a subsidiary of Amazon that supplies servers and computing power to the world’s biggest companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6PeIjR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some 436 undersea internet cables carry 99% of international internet traffic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1WpBd4"&gt;For countries like Tonga, though, undersea cables are a more obvious bottleneck. Currently, 99 percent of international internet traffic is carried through such undersea cables, with an &lt;a href="https://www2.telegeography.com/submarine-cable-faqs-frequently-asked-questions"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; 436 cables spanning distances of 1.3 million kilometers. But while countries like the US are serviced by multiple lines, poorer nations like Tonga have to rely on just one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQvUQX"&gt;It’s notable that Tonga was actually hit by a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46968752"&gt;similar internet blackout in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and, as a result, signed a 15-year deal &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/tonga-signs-15-year-satellite-deal-after-january-cable-outage/"&gt;with an internet satellite company&lt;/a&gt; to protect against future failures. But according to a &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/kacific-waiting-for-tongan-contract-activation-to-supply-satellite-services-post-eruption/"&gt;report from Z&lt;em&gt;DNet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the terms of the contract with provider Kacific were disputed and, as a result, satellite connectivity was never activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1eMBg"&gt;Now, Tongans must wait for their internet to be repaired by hand. Such repairs are not unusual on a global scale— an undersea cable breaks &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/subsea-internet-cable-ship-boat"&gt;roughly every two weeks&lt;/a&gt; — but they are time-consuming. Technicians on a specialist repair vessel will have to locate the fault in Tonga’s cable by sending pulses of light down the line and timing how long it takes for the pulse to return. They will then have to sail to the location of the breakage and, depending on the depth of the water, retrieve the cable using diving robots or grappling hooks. The cable will then be brought to the surface and repaired by engineers onboard the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Philips Hue’s four-pack of white ambiance smart bulbs are half off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Philips Hue’s white smart bulbs" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u6cAkNAlTZ5Qc8KQvQcRF5i1pGg=/0x63:1500x1063/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407478/PhilipsHue.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Philips Hue’s white smart bulbs have dropped to an all-time low. | Image: Signify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jisN9F"&gt;If you’re looking to light up your home with smart home tech for less, Philips Hue is selling an E26 starter kit containing &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-ambiance-starter-kit-e26/046677530297#specifications" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;four white ambiance smart bulbs and a Hue Bridge for just $59.99 instead of $119.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is an all-time low. These steep discounts come well after Philips Hue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22650951/hue-light-tube-gradient-filament-brighter-bulbs"&gt;launched new 1,100 lumen smart bulbs&lt;/a&gt;, which means it’s likely offering this steep discount on the 800-lumen bulbs looped into this deal until they’re sold out for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMmVIq"&gt;These popular smart bulbs can be customized with adjustable smart timers, and they allow you to set different hues of white light, with a warmer color temperature to help you relax, or a brighter, cleaner color temp to help you focus. You can also pair the bulbs with your existing setup via the Bridge, which uses the Zigbee protocol, thus allowing you to control it all with the most popular smart home ecosystems, including Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant, and Amazon’s Alexa. The included Bridge allows you to set lighting routines, control varied scenes, and connect up to 50 lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gpXlSp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10984520"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="TxLqqe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sengled’s newest smart bulb can track your heart rate","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22864783/sengled-smart-health-monitoring-smart-bulb-ces2022"},{"title":"All the smart home gadgets worth knowing about from CES 2022 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22870187/smart-home-gadget-ces-2022-roundup-samsung-wemo-eve"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vtyYaI"&gt;Whether you travel often, or perhaps you just frequently forget where you placed your keys, Apple’s AirTags can be helpful in a variety of situations. These Ultra Wideband-ready Bluetooth trackers make it easy to monitor and find missing items that they’re attached to by using Apple’s Find My app, which taps into the expansive Find My network, allowing any iOS device within range to send the location of your AirTag to you. Each tracker has the ability to make a chirping sound when requested, and its user-replaceable battery should last for up to a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWF5NC"&gt;Unfortunately, like most Apple products, they’re usually a little costly, which is why today’s modest discount on a four-pack is notable. Typically $99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX532AM-A-AirTag/dp/B0932QJ2JZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling four AirTags for $94&lt;/a&gt;. It usually costs $29 for each AirTag, so with this deal, you’re spending about $24 per tracker instead. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="05MRqr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873581"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nop9oI"&gt;For those on the market for a security camera deal, Arlo makes some good-quality devices — one of which is $120 cheaper today. Arlo’s $599.99 Ultra 2 Spotlight wireless security system &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HRSWY37?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is on sale at Amazon for $479.99&lt;/a&gt;, matching its best price to date. The deal includes two security cameras that run on rechargeable batteries and boast an ultra-wide 180-degree lens, which can zoom into objects and record video in 4K with HDR. Other notable features include free local storage from the Arlo Smart hub, colorized night vision, two-way audio, a siren, and support for HomeKit, Alexa, Google Assistant, and IFTTT.&lt;/p&gt;

Amazon is once again selling the Apple Watch Series 7 at its best price ever. Regularly $399, the green, 41mm GPS model and its matching Sport Band are selling for $339 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HF1DC1J/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgrIjyP2Ouw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $60. Best Buy is also throwing in an additional month of Apple Fitness Plus with each purchase. Compared to the previous generation, the Series 7 boasts a larger display than its predecessor, and features IP6X dust and water resistance. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bvNuzB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VCyaQB"&gt;Gamers shopping for a new entry-level wireless mouse can get a swell deal on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CMS5Q6P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s G305 Lightspeed in black for just $32.42 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (normally $49.99). That’s just $3 shy of its best price ever and a 35 percent total discount on the lightweight mouse, which sports six programmable buttons, a 12K DPI sensor, and built-in USB receiver storage so you can easily stow it when you need to take it on the go. The peripheral, Logitech claims, is also capable of lasting up to 250 hours on a single AA battery. If you’re not a fan of the black colorway, the white model is on sale for $39.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CMS5Q6N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgrJ9Pj6Egg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s5IihW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10821865"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Smixhg"&gt;Here are some other great tech products you can save on today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="8z2tx6"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling the standard edition of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgrLXaEfFlf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; for Nintendo Switch for just $37.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $56.99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Hqn2yC"&gt;If you’re on the market for an affordable, basic smart 4K TV, TCL’s 5-Series QLED TV is selling the 55-inch configuration for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgrLTrOrt6G" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 instead of $649.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now.

    <title>How to look your best on a video call</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pXKz9Y1Ei7CA-aX7yRe_QpHCcg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407393/webcam_6_notext.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2adddb"&gt;As we approach the two-year mark for this pandemic, it is very clear that everyone could use a refresher course in looking their best on camera. Nice lighting and perfectly decorated bookshelves were once the standard for video meetings, but now it seems as though my coworkers couldn’t care less about hiding their messy living rooms, bedrooms, and offices. And long gone are the days of flattering lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUqc9N"&gt;As a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;video director and host, let me assure you: your messy background and poor lighting is still wildly distracting. So let’s make it our New Year’s resolution to refresh our video chat setups: from knowing where to sit to get the best light and choosing the right microphone to just staying comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDlO19"&gt;Here are my tips and tricks to once again becoming a video call MVP. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ivvMR36f5TAtO2jARGkzkmxsFRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19880369/bfarsace_200407_3962_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xk87gQ"&gt;Light your face&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LXEnKh"&gt;It’s best to start with lighting&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;because that will dictate where you are sitting. Open up your window shades and let the natural light pour in — but don’t let all that light hit your back. I recommend having your largest light source either right in front of you or no more than 45 degrees away from directly in front of you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8Ofyb"&gt;Also be aware that your screen can be a large source of light, so adjust your screen brightness, too, especially if you are taking a call without natural light. A bright screen can blow the highlights on your face out, making you look more like Casper the Ghost than a video calling champion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACYcUI"&gt;And if you wear glasses and keep your computer screen too bright, everyone on your Zoom call will be able to see themselves in the reflections on your lenses. Dim your screen and place some lighting off to that 45-degree angle — you’ll look a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KUesr0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:9200443"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="q5WG8y"&gt;Raise your camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cmqYUL"&gt;There is one, and only one, acceptable camera angle: head-on and at eye level. Your table is almost certainly going to be lower than your face, and that means people are going to get an unflattering look up at you. Use a set of books, a stool, or a higher table to make sure your camera is at the same level as your eyes. You don’t want people to feel like they are looking up or down at you. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Lgf6NS_52AauzmFQQc0K1yp3xk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19880374/bfarsace_200407_3962_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do whatever you have to do to get your camera at eye level.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="U1cn1V"&gt;Test your video before the call&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3apoR8"&gt;You want to show up to your meeting already looking good — not adjusting your surroundings, screen brightness, angle, or hair live for everyone to see. Zoom, Webex, and other video meeting apps have an option for showing you a preview of your video before the call starts. If you select this option, a video preview will pop up before you enter a call so you can check how everything looks. Skype will show you this preview by default, but If I’m using a videoconferencing app that doesn’t include previews, I open &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photo-booth/id1208226939"&gt;Photo Booth&lt;/a&gt; to check my video before entering a call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PcMbGY"&gt;Once the call starts, I recommend hiding your own video from yourself. Not only will you be less prone to fix your hair or move the angle during the call, you will also be less distracting to yourself and others. You can do that in Zoom by hovering your cursor on your own video window, clicking on the three dots in the upper right corner, and choosing “Hide self view.” It can be easy to forget you’re on camera without your video preview, though, so try not to pick your nose. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qIK7GeAlxxV_AmjhOKqj0YDPt54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19880373/bfarsace_200407_3962_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoom and Webex have options for showing a video preview before entering calls, while Skype will show you this by default.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ryVPMP"&gt;Find a quiet place (and your best headphones)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sz00bS"&gt;Most of us don’t have a great deal of control over audio, but you’ll sound better if you take a call in a quiet place. Also keep in mind that your headphones might have a better mic than your computer. Most videoconferencing apps have a tool in their settings for testing your mic, and I recommend collecting all the mics in your house (headphones often have one built in) and testing them out to find the one that sounds clearest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDxk1S"&gt;As a courtesy to others, please keep your mic muted unless you are talking. You might be used to your neighbor’s midday thrash metal, but no one else is. In Zoom, I use the feature that lets you unmute yourself while holding down the space bar. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yMydZRu4zxKI2sjQN7Mk-njInEI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19880372/bfarsace_200407_3962_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Test different microphones to find the best audio quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Mw5lFO"&gt;Get comfortable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cNq4Ab"&gt;Much like being in a physical meeting, once you join a call, you shouldn’t be getting up and moving around. Start with a comfortable place to sit or stand for a long period of time. Although I like to sit on my bed, I found that sitting crossed-leg for more than 20 minutes is not comfortable for me, so I moved my video call setup to my standing desk. If you are using a laptop, have a charger plugged in and ready for when your battery gets low. I also like to bring a water bottle and cup of coffee to my meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T4k0kiXH6ezZuPav6PKpFfAMwdY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19880371/bfarsace_200407_3962_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The essentials I have handy when taking a video call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O3ykCd"&gt;And finally: stay professional, even when you haven’t gotten out of your sweatpants in over a year. May a 10/10 on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ratemyskyperoom?lang=en"&gt;Room Rater&lt;/a&gt; be ever in your favor!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s newest game is a Hearthstone-style card battler</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3soLivgoPmSLClev-hpOUF06kNQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407076/ARC_5.5_SCR8.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: Arcanium: Rise of Akhan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="34taD1"&gt;Netflix’s foray into the mobile gaming subscription market is showing no signs of slowing down. This week it added a pair of new titles to its service, a card-battling roguelike called &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1483559835786518528"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcanium: Rise of Akhan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a hidden object game called &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1483590028831993856"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krispee Street&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Both are available to download on iOS or Android free of charge if you’re already subscribed to the streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w50EFY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcanium &lt;/em&gt;follows an increasingly familiar template for Netflix’s mobile game releases, in that it’s a pre-existing title added to the subscription service. The game originally launched in &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1056840/Arcanium_Rise_of_Akhan/"&gt;early access on Steam back in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, where it currently boasts “Mostly Positive” user reviews. Its Steam listing describes it as an “open-world, single-player strategy card adventure” and fusion of the roguelike and deckbuilding genres. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fhLkN0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Dive into a fantasy world where good, evil, magic, and technology collide for the ultimate tale of fellowship and bravery. Arcanium, an open-world single-player strategy card game, is now on Netflix. &lt;a href="https://t.co/vWHgiIY8u4"&gt;pic.twitter.com/vWHgiIY8u4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1483559835786518528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cNri42"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;Krispee Street&lt;/em&gt; is a hidden object game that almost looks like a digital version of Where’s Waldo based on the webcomic &lt;a href="https://krispee.com/"&gt;Krispee&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-launches-two-new-mobile-games-arcanium-rise-of-akhan-and-krispee-street/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s On Netflix&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that it’s the fourth game from developer FrostyPop to release on Netflix since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772480/netflix-games-apple-iphone-ipad-ios-subscription-app-store"&gt;service’s official launch last November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CtcGty"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k1kQyJg6DZ8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nyb7W8"&gt;With the release of the two titles, Netflix now has a dozen mobile games available to download and play free of charge as part of its subscription. It’s still probably not enough to warrant a subscription by itself, but they’re a neat addition, especially when all of them are free from annoying in-app transactions. If you’re already paying for a Netflix subscription, what have you got to lose?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung leaks new notched tablet on its own website</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZrmoO6wLFMmJEfGHKZXdFSNCtaY=/0x0:420x280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70406999/PH_GS_S21_Voice_wakeup_on_multiple_devices.png.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The image from Samsung’s website, showing the unannounced tablet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jzh4Dc"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00080448/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung support page&lt;/a&gt; for, of all things, Bixby, may have just given us our first official look at the company’s upcoming flagship tablet. The picture, which was &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-support-page/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, shows a familiar looking Samsung smartphone alongside a very unfamiliar looking tablet, complete with a display notch that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/6/16611758/samsung-mocks-iphone-x-commercial"&gt;Samsung savagely mocked&lt;/a&gt; when first introduced on the iPhone X. Reports suggest this new tablet will be called the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra, and it may be announced as early as next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFmNr4"&gt;The design shown in the image on Samsung’s site corresponds with &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-renders-design-exclusive/"&gt;unofficial renders of the tablet released last October&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1467761746609938433"&gt;leaked images from December&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/16/22886595/samsung-tablet-lineup-ultra-notch-rumor"&gt;leaked details from &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from this month. If these unofficial details are to be believed, the Android tablet will have a 14.6-inch OLED display, with a 120Hz refresh rate and a resolution of 2960x1848. That notch is thought to be housing two 12-megapixel selfie cameras. It’s not exactly clear what the second sensor may be for, but other devices have added ultrawide cameras for group selfies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zb2xW3RPYXeZNKGcawy-FB8vHYo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23178775/Screen_Shot_2022_01_19_at_8.14.41_AM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Samsung.com&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the image on Samsung’s support page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yp0Yl8"&gt;Internally, the tablet is thought to be running Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, paired with a 11,200mAh battery, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to 512GB of storage. S Pen support is thought to be included, as well as optional 5G, and two rear cameras (a 13-megapixel main camera and a 6-megapixel ultrawide). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RuhjNJ"&gt;The Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra will reportedly sit at the top of a three tablet lineup, which includes the Tab S8 and Tab S8 Plus. All three tablets are rumored to be powered by the same processor and feature S Pen stylus support, but the S8 Plus will reportedly have a smaller 12.7-inch OLED display and 10,090mAh battery, while the base S8 could have an 11-inch LCD and an 8,000mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OfB7Z"&gt;There’s no official word on when the new tablet lineup may make an appearance, but with the Galaxy S22 lineup &lt;a href="https://ddaily.co.kr/m/m_article/?no=228997"&gt;reportedly launching on February 8th&lt;/a&gt;, it wouldn’t be surprising to see these tablets launch alongside it. The announcement would come at a very different time of year to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;their predecessors&lt;/a&gt;, which were released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21408972/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-android-wifi-5g-preorder-release-date-price"&gt;in late 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Banjo-Kazooie returns to Nintendo hardware this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8qJgNz4_4KmuCV_JjpRwtlSrEyY=/130x0:1534x936/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70406914/Screenshot_2022_01_19_at_16.00.07.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zUd6mX"&gt;Nintendo has announced the next game coming to its Switch Online service: Nintendo 64 platforming classic &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt;. The game is inextricably associated with the N64 — it’s a collect-a-thon with blurry cartoon graphics and cute animal characters — but this will actually mark the first time you’ll have been able to play it on Nintendo hardware since Microsoft bought original developer Rare in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WHRb8"&gt;Rare did release a couple of spin-off titles for the Game Boy Advance, but the last major &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt; game was 2008’s &lt;em&gt;Nuts &amp;amp; Bolts&lt;/em&gt; for the Xbox 360. That game, as well as 360 ports of the original &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt; and sequel &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Tooie&lt;/em&gt;, are also available on modern Xbox consoles through Game Pass and a compilation called &lt;em&gt;Rare Replay&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0P3ST"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt; will be available on Thursday for subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online’s Expansion Pack, which brought N64 and Sega Genesis games to the service. Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22815382/n64-switch-paper-mario-release-date-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paper Mario&lt;/em&gt; was added in December&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like Nintendo is planning to add roughly one N64 game a month, which isn’t exactly a breakneck pace of release but makes a change from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275714/nintendo-switch-online-games-february-2021"&gt;NES and SNES deep cuts&lt;/a&gt; that used to show up every few months. Hopefully Nintendo is able to make sure that the emulation works better than it does with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275714/nintendo-switch-online-games-february-2021"&gt;some of the earlier N64 titles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
