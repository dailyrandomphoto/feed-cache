    <title>The Wordle clones have disappeared from the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zZmq0Lstg1m_wcC2YCTG26fErM=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70377148/VRG_ILLO_4536_001_7.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earlier today, the App Store was overflowing with games ripping off a viral web app. &lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLIZAP"&gt;Has Apple taken action against apps that cloned the popular web game Wordle? They have now disappeared from the App Store, after &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/11/psa-wordle-clone-with-annual-subscription-is-the-latest-rip-off-to-hit-the-app-store/"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wordle-copycat-app-store-twitter"&gt;publications&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase"&gt;including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) called out a flood of copycats so blatant as to be named “Wordle” and that featured the same gameplay and UI, each taking advantage of the fact that developer Josh Wardle didn’t create an Apple app of his own. While we’re still seeing a few clones on the App Store, they don’t use the Wordle name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMeMb6"&gt;The clone apps had a spotlight shone on them today, when one developer &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/tech-dude-rips-off-wordle-angers-internet-1848341422"&gt;started bragging about how many downloads his version of Wordle was getting&lt;/a&gt;. Following some intense backlash from the community, he set his account to private, but people had already started finding many other apps like it on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eXFsor"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The App Store clones are here to profit off Wordle’s success","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yYQOJeNtNEEZB_72WBwboMnXZj4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162051/IMG_3661.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The search results for Wordle at 5PM ET today, showing two clones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cBxGL0BzrKpXmt9N2ro0h_yUC18=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162334/IMG_3666.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The search results for Wordle at 8:08PM ET — the first results are now an app from five years ago, and a story about Words With Friends 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fdr2q4"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for confirmation that it was the one that took action against the Wordle-alikes, but it seems vanishingly unlikely that each developer decided to take down their app in the space of about an hour. If Apple really is initiating a crackdown on the apps, it’s tipping the scales significantly to protect the original game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KGNEZ"&gt;While there have been similar high-profile situations in the past — &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/wordle-clone-ios-mobile-gaming"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5401552/the-weird-world-of-flappy-bird-clones"&gt;Flappy Bird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/28/5556760/threes-developer-releases-emails-showing-work-in-reply-to-clones"&gt;Threes vs 2048&lt;/a&gt; come to mind — it’s hard to think of a recent example where Apple stepped in as heavily as it seems to have done today. Apple &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#copycats"&gt;does have language about copycats in its developer guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s notably vague: “Come up with your own ideas,” section 4.1 reads. “Don’t simply copy the latest popular app on the App Store, or make some minor changes to another app’s name or UI and pass it off as your own.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ooG9T"&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/apple-goes-after-clones-and-spam-on-the-app-store/"&gt;questions about how Apple would deal with blatant clones&lt;/a&gt;, as it’s seemingly let things slide in some instances. With disappearance of the Wordle-alikes from the App Store, we may have gotten a precedent for how similar is too similar. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile say they’re not blocking Apple’s iCloud Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bVCnW6IcjHg1auWUvneXHpkTC_U=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376980/og__ishslgdhhimq.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gsPVr9"&gt;T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&amp;amp;T — the three biggest US cellular carriers — have all confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they aren’t blocking Apple’s new iCloud Private Relay feature, following reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"&gt;some customers were having issues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"&gt;with the VPN-like feature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjO0fq"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon straight-up say they’re not blocking the feature from functioning. Verizon spokesperson George L. Koroneos confirms that Private Relay works on both cellular and Fios internet connections, and AT&amp;amp;T spokesperson Seth Bloom says the carrier’s policy is not to block Private Relay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IG6Sn"&gt;T-Mobile’s situation is a little more complex: most customers shouldn’t have any issues with iCloud Private Relay. But those who use content filtering services (like the carrier’s Family Controls) won’t be able to use iCloud Private Relay, the carrier tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fa5X2u"&gt;“Customers who chose plans and features with content filtering (e.g. parent controls) do not have access to the iCloud Private Relay to allow these services to work as designed. All other customers have no restrictions,” T-Mobile spokesperson Bennet Ladyman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That tracks with Apple’s messaging around the feature, which notes that “Networks that require the ability to audit traffic or perform network-based filtering will block access to Private Relay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uuaZLl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"T-Mobile identifies issue that prevented some iPhone users from using Private Relay","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="X5VL8i"&gt;T-Mobile’s spokesperson also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the carrier &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; find an issue with Apple’s recent iOS 15.2 update that caused iCloud Private Relay to be toggled off following the update. “Overnight our team identified that in the 15.2 iOS release, some device settings default to the feature being toggled off. We have shared this with Apple. This is not specific to T-Mobile.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnIzGG"&gt;If the problem really is on Apple’s end, it could also explain the issues that some Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T customers may have been experiencing in the wake of the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o68AKN"&gt;That said, it’s possible that carriers may sour on supporting Apple’s privacy feature in the future. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fbusiness%2F2022%2F01%2F09%2Fapple-fire-iphone-encryption-tech%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22878885%2Fverizon-att-t-mobile-apple-icloud-private-relay-feature-supported" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Vodafone, Telefonica, Orange, and T-Mobile have all signed a joint letter asking the European Commission to block Private Relay, arguing that the feature is “cutting off other networks and servers from accessing vital network data and metadata, including those operators in charge of the connectivity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZv0Sy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;iCloud Private Relay&lt;/a&gt; is similar in many ways to a VPN, working to automatically mask your internet traffic from both Apple, your ISP, and anyone else trying to snoop around what you’re doing online. The feature is still in beta but is currently available to anyone subscribing to a paid iCloud plan — although Apple doesn’t keep it toggled on by default, at least for now. There are other limitations, too: Private Relay won’t let you spoof your internet as coming from outside your rough geographic area (a popular use for VPNs to get around national or regional content limits), and it only works in Apple’s own Safari browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Apm9t5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The App Store clones are here to profit off Wordle’s success</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lw21bUEW8l0kQjcVdBZ7XBEnmGI=/16x0:1110x729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376898/IMG_3664.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copies of the popular web app have made it past App Review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oddcq1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt;, the word-guessing puzzle game that’s &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/01/09/lifestyle/what-is-wordle-why-is-everyone-twitter-playing-it/"&gt;taken over our Twitter timelines&lt;/a&gt;, doesn’t currently have an official app. That may come as a surprise to anyone who’s searched for it on the App Store, though — earlier today, doing so would show you several blatant unofficial copies, each of which use the same name and mechanics as the original, which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/11/wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-hit-puzzle"&gt;was made by Josh Wardle&lt;/a&gt; and distributed on the web for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iobEAS"&gt;Most people who’ve been online recently will have had at least some exposure to Wordle if they haven’t been playing it themselves (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/11/wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-hit-puzzle"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; it has 2 million daily players). It’s a simple concept but done well: each day, you go to the Wordle website, where you’re given five chances to guess a five-letter word. The game gives you feedback about what letters you’ve put in the right place, what letters are in the word, but not in the order you’ve picked and what letters aren’t in the correct answer. Certain parts of Twitter have been taken over by black, green, and yellow square emojis, which players use to show off their gameplay without spoiling the word of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="io8n5e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As with many good viral ideas, Wordle has spawned waves of parodies and memes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sVgm5Z"&gt;As happens to most good ideas (especially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5401552/the-weird-world-of-flappy-bird-clones"&gt;the ones that go viral&lt;/a&gt;), there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2022/1/11/22877996/wordle-spoofs-alternatives-letterle-sweardle-queerdle"&gt;several clever parodies of Wordle&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Fobwashed/status/1480975713620541440"&gt;waves of jokes&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter using the emoji block format that players use to share their scores. But while many of the parody versions point users back to the original, this doesn’t seem to be the case for the versions on the App Store. Instead, they try their best to look like the web version without mentioning that they’re actually a spin-off. Trying out five versions of the game from the App Store, only one seemed to acknowledge Wardle’s version — ironically, it was one of the few that didn’t actually call itself Wordle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GOchjE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10973311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="7978Mo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data="{&amp;quot;stories&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;The weird world of 'Flappy Bird' clones&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5401552/the-weird-world-of-flappy-bird-clones&amp;quot;}]}"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9wtMf3"&gt;The situation is a little embarrassing for Apple, which has often cited its high standards and App Review process as a reason it should be allowed to keep control over which apps run on iPhones and iPads. The review process has been called into question by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454468/ios-app-scam-review-3-star-force-review-process-apple"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;scams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;controversies&lt;/a&gt;, but these feel especially blatant — they’re using the same name and have an extremely similar interface to the original. It’s easy to see many people being tricked into thinking that they’re playing an official version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEfdJN"&gt;Even worse is that the apps are copying a website, months after Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417725/apple-vs-epic-full-trial-slideshows-opening-arguments"&gt;championed&lt;/a&gt; progressive web apps in court as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22421912/iphone-web-app-pwa-cloud-gaming-epic-v-apple-safari"&gt;an option for developers during its legal battle with Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;. That argument may fall flat with developers targeting mobile audiences. As Owen Williams, a UX manager, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ow/status/1480984480538005504?s=20"&gt;points out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, they won’t even get a seat at the table when someone searches for their creation on the App Store (which is something a lot of people might do if they, say, see a flurry of tweets with the name of a Cool New Thing everyone’s playing with).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tyno2K"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If Apple and Google were *actually* allowing proper competition, you’d be able to register a PWA/web app in their stores if you choose that route instead of a native app. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But uh, that doesn’t help build their walled gardens so we get…this&lt;/p&gt;— Owen Williams ⚡ (@ow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ow/status/1480984480538005504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 11, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vqJ57J"&gt;To add insult to injury, it appears that Wordle clones aren’t nearly as rampant on Google’s Play Store. Only one of the first two dozen search results for “wordle” appeared to be a clone, and it was buried deep behind a “show more” button. Google Play reports the app has “500+ downloads” — the developer behind one of the Wordle clones on iOS claimed to be getting 5,400 downloads an hour on Twitter, and their version wasn’t even in the top three search results. (The same developer tweeted a screenshot of a notification saying that their app was waiting for review, with the caption “let’s see what Apple thinks” prior to the app going live.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LibNuw"&gt;Wardle hasn’t monetized his version of Wordle with ads, subscriptions, one-time payments, or a tip jar. It’s totally free. According to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html"&gt;a profile in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he made the game for his partner, who enjoyed crossword puzzles. “I think people kind of appreciate that there’s this thing online that’s just fun,” Wardle said of Wordle’s success. “It’s not trying to do anything shady with your data or your eyeballs. It’s just a game that’s fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="3yUEzd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re going to the fucking moon”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hkZLp8"&gt;The Wordle apps I tried haven’t copied the original’s lack of a monetization scheme. Some showed a plethora of ads, often with the option of paying to remove them, and one even had a $30-a-year in-app purchase to unlock the “Pro” version. (That particular app’s developer said on their now-private Twitter account that the app was “going to the fucking moon” and that one of their goals for 2022 was to “make tons of fucking money.”) Paying would let you choose how many letters you wanted in the words and would allow multiple games a day. As &lt;a href="https://slate.com/culture/2022/01/wordle-game-online-free-explained.html"&gt;many have noted&lt;/a&gt;, the real Wordle’s once-a-day play is another one of the things that makes it so appealing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ugXCOB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Added a share button to Wordle that generates a spoiler-free emoji grid for you. Shoutout to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/irihapeta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@irihapeta&lt;/a&gt; for inventing such a cool way to share your results each day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛&lt;br&gt; ⬛  ⬛&lt;br&gt;     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wordle 180 3/6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Try it out: &lt;a href="https://t.co/pZTmeT1p7E"&gt;https://t.co/pZTmeT1p7E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Josh Wardle (@powerlanguish) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/powerlanguish/status/1471493886031773707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OYMB2N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordle’s developer explaining the game’s share function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3SU7O"&gt;Most of the apps I tried didn’t have any obvious copies of the original’s share feature, which lets you easily copy a series of spoiler-free blocks to share with friends or on social media. The one that offered the $30 subscription, however, did — adding a few extra words and saying “The Wordle App” in place of Wordle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tqv7X7"&gt;Keeping blatant copies off the App Store might not be an easy moderation task if Apple wanted to do it — for example, there are a few games on the App Store that share the “Wordle” name but not gameplay. However, they’re pretty obviously not trying to capitalize on a trend by copying a popular app — many of them haven’t been updated in years (and are therefore not likely requiring any judgment calls from App Review). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VdUXQ"&gt;It appears that Apple has decided to try, though. Roughly an hour after we published this post, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1481063416630583300"&gt;we heard&lt;/a&gt; that the clones had started disappearing from the App Store. All the ones we saw that used the word “Wordle” in their title are now gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdiT6Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to both Apple and one of the developers behind a Wordle clone. Neither responded to our request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hw18VC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Wordle clones are now disappearing from the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="KGZoGb"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22870203/ces-2022-best-of-gadgets-concepts-tech"&gt;CES 2022 having just wrapped&lt;/a&gt;, the future looks bright if you’re looking to nab a great TV deal. At CES, many manufacturers — including LG and Samsung — announced new versions of some of their most popular models, ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22858577/samsung-frame-2022-tv-matte-antireflective-screen"&gt;The Frame&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features"&gt;LG’s new C2 lineup&lt;/a&gt;. That means we’re probably going to start seeing prices fall on last-gen models as newer models become available throughout the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOJ1Fo"&gt;For those looking to pick up a solid deal before the new models arrive, however, fret not, as retailers will also likely be discounting TVs in the run up to the Super Bowl next month. And if you need one now, there are currently a lot of discounted 4K TVs available to choose from, complete with a wide variety of prices and performance for those who can’t wait. Whether you want a secondary TV for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built for a cinema-like experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals across four common categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mszLRr"&gt;A 55-inch TV is a popular size for good reason. It’s not too big, nor is it too small, making it a safe size if you’re looking to upgrade the TV in a living room or bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="etpdeM"&gt;Sony X80J&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cart-6484511"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch X80J TV has Google TV software built-in, so you won’t need to purchase any additional streaming boxes, like an Apple TV or Chromecast. The LED panel also supports HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision HDR, and has four HDMI ports (one of which is HDMI ARC). It’s a relatively low-frills affair, but it seems like a good deal that’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743620079563082108" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $649.99. In addition to free delivery, the retailer is also offering six months of Peacock Premium, $50 off a Google Nest Hub smart display with each purchase, and up to $200 off select soundbars. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-X80J-Inch-Compatibility-KD50X80J/dp/B08QXFT4M9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1617352-REG%2Fsony_kd55x80j_x80j_55_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo are also selling the same TV&lt;/a&gt; for roughly the same price but without the added incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEtknI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10610217"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="JGFJFJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony announces the world’s first QD-OLED 4K TV, coming later this year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865220/sony-a95k-qd-oled-qdoled-4k-tv-announced-features-explainer"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h3 id="JbaBai"&gt;TCL 6-Series&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="W4zBa6"&gt;The TCL 6-Series R635 model is a good option if you are looking to balance price and performance. The R635 model sports a QLED panel, but it goes a step above with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363318/tcl-2020-5-6-series-4k-tvs-qled-mini-led-backlighting-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mini LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt;, which brings better brightness and contrast. The 55-inch model is currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-Dolby-Vision-QLED-Smart/dp/B0885F5GMP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $699.50 and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggC5UJW2ka" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $699.99 ($250 off), though, we’ve seen the R635 drop to as low as $650 in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Osz4r"&gt;If you prefer a larger model, Best Buy is also offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCtSSCCCU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $999.99&lt;/a&gt; ($300 off), while selling the 75-inch for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVnwOsusm3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,299.99&lt;/a&gt; ($500 off). Regardless of which configuration you choose, however, Best Buy will also take $90 off Facebook Portal TV, if you purchase the two together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y8BpYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327662"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kuUEp8"&gt;Samsung The Frame TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HtcmiY"&gt;Samsung’s The Frame blends into your home decor, displaying customizable images that look like a piece of decorative art if its motion sensor detects someone in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into an HDR-compatible QLED TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and support for AirPlay 2. The stylish, 4K TV also boasts a 120Hz refresh rate, access to all the popular streaming services, and four HDMI ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAIL8Z"&gt;We saw the 55-inch drop from $1,499.99 to $998, its best price ever, during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Sadly, it’s now only about $100 off, with the 55-inch model going for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCWIlxESJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,399.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1620610-REG%2Fsamsung_qn55ls03aafxza_the_frame_ls03a_55.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,397.99 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. Best Buy is also taking $90 off of Facebook Portal TV with your purchase, as well as up to $300 off on select soundbars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JD5CqS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="UmMHNt"&gt;Insignia’s 4K HDR Fire TV Edition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zWYgij"&gt;You don’t have to spend a fortune for a 4K TV; spending $500 or less can still net you a TV with good image quality and features. Insignia’s 4K HDR Fire TV Edition model is the perfect case in point, one that supports HDR10, HDMI ARC, and HDMI eArc, among other notable features. Right now, you can pick up the 55-inch model from &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748188127423432886" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $369.99&lt;/a&gt;, a $180 discount on what is its typical $549.99 price tag. Best Buy will also take $90 off of Facebook Portal TV and offer 30 days of free FuboTV Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is offering the same discount on the TV&lt;/a&gt;, too, though it’s shipped and sold by Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIOPJT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cW4VPC"&gt;Toshiba Smart Fire TV Edition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="by223n"&gt;Another Fire TV Edition TV deal happening now is on Toshiba’s 55-inch Smart Fire TV Edition 4K LED, which normally retails for $519.99. As the name might imply, it allows you to stream content from services such as Disney Plus and Netflix, and includes the option to watch live TV. The latest models also tout an Alexa-enabled remote, an easy-to-use interface, and support for both Dolby Vision HDR and HDR10. Right now at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoh5l0KZNF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-55-inch-4K-UHD-Smart-Fire-TV/dp/B0924WG7JD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, you can pick up the 55-inch model for $469.99, a modest $50 discount. Best Buy is also throwing in a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV with each purchase (Amazon is not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="67O1o8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="74eOSC"&gt;TCL Class 4-Series&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="irmzdA"&gt;TCL also has competitively priced televisions, and its 4-Series lineup is one of the more affordable options on the market. The S435 model features a built-in Roku interface, dual-band Wi-Fi, HDR10, and support for all Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. You can currently get the 55-inch model for $379.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoilIi4bwL" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is $220 less than the usual retail price. Other sizes are on sale, too, like the 43-inch model, which &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoioZ12jhm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1603431-REG%2Ftcl_43s435_43_4k_led_roku.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; have for $279.99 instead of $349.99, about $8 shy of the TV’s best price to date. Best Buy also offers new subscribers 30 days of FuboTV Pro and three months of Apple TV Plus with each purchase, along with a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HtnMEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740197"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="6xim8b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"TCL announces 98-inch XL QLED TV, and you can buy it today","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866323/tcl-98-inch-qled-google-tv-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h3 id="SPPi6g"&gt;Amazon Omni Fire TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gGh4Mn"&gt;Amazon’s first TV, the Omni Fire 4K TV, only just launched a few months ago and starts at $370. The self-branded effort features the ability to query Alexa even when the TV is off, as well as a low input lag and support for two-way video calling. We gave it a 7/10 in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22785648/amazon-fire-tv-omni-review-alexa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, while noting how the TV shows great promise thanks to its robust Alexa integration and support for Apple’s AirPlay 2, among other things. At the same time, however, TCL and other similarly priced television makers offer better picture quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nj1DzI"&gt;Right now, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for $419.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $559.99, which is just $10 more than the discount we saw during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Both the larger and smaller configurations are on sale as well, with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6J1HG8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch going for $599.99 instead of $829.99, nearly matching its lowest price to date.&lt;/a&gt; Best Buy is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggFNuZaIWh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering comparable sales&lt;/a&gt; on various sizes, while throwing in a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV if you purchase the two together. Note, however, only the larger 65-inch and 75-inch models include support for Dolby Vision HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="robl5C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="X4U9P7"&gt;If you’re looking for a budget-friendly TV with good picture quality, Vizio’s midrange M7 Series Quantum TV is worthy of consideration, even if it is over $500. The 2021 model sports a 60Hz panel, along with support for Apple’s AirPlay 2, AMD FreeSync, and a variable refresh rate (VRR). It also touts Vizio’s SmartCast system and a built-in Chromecast, allowing you to cast content from your phone and access Netflix, Disney Plus, and all your favorite streaming services. Right now, both Amazon and Best Buy are offering discounts on various size configurations. You can buy the 55-inch, for example, for around $579 ($170 off) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggJ132Z3aW" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B094MJRG2V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B094MNFP4D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch version&lt;/a&gt; for $10 less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="vbJRlM"&gt;OLED televisions offer the best image quality you can get in a mainstream TV, and many were heavily discounted during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. If you missed out on those sales, however, you may still have another shot at landing a good deal, as many of the best models are still currently available at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dlhOGg"&gt;LG A1 OLED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="OfP5UO"&gt;Right now, Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and Amazon are discounting various sizes of the LG’s entry-level A1 OLED, starting at just around &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Built-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED48A1PUA/dp/B092LZNZB7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$796.99&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon — its lowest price ever — instead of $1,199.99 for the 48-inch. Meanwhile, the $1,299.99 55-inch is selling for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1632395-REG%2Flg_oled55a1pua_a1pu_55_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,196.99 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggFTcfLZsN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,199.99&lt;/a&gt; ($200 off) at Best Buy, $100 shy of its best price to date. Best Buy is also offering up to $200 off on select soundbars, a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV, and 30 days of FuboTV Pro at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9yade"&gt;The 4K A1 offers support for both Alexa and Google Assistant, as well as an automatic low-latency mode. Unlike more expensive OLEDs, however, it doesn’t come with a slate of advanced gaming features, like those found on LG’s C1 model. It offers a slower 60Hz display and lacks HDMI 2.1, for example, and doesn’t support a variable refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cKOBk3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10596459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="QVK3a0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"LG announces its largest and smallest OLED TVs ever as part of 2022 lineup","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h3 id="EC2RcQ"&gt;LG GX Series OLED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4XqEcE"&gt;Despite the high price tag, LG’s Gallery Series GX OLED is a good TV for those looking for a more cinematic experience. It includes support for Google Assistant and Alexa, and for those who want to use their TV for gaming, it features Nvidia G-Sync and HDMI 2.1 support, meaning it can take full advantage of the RTX 30-Series cards or next-gen consoles. Right now, you can get the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744656950369633474" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for as low as $1,529.99&lt;/a&gt; ($270 off) at Best Buy in some areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lpiA85"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10445785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nGYSCL"&gt;Vizio OLED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HVsMDE"&gt;Normally $1,299.99, Vizio’s 55-inch OLED was recently selling for around $999 – its lowest price ever – but is currently only &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229763/9383?subId1=TheVergeBestTVdeals11022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FVIZIO-OLED-55-Class-4K-HDR-SmartCast-Smart-TV-OLED55-H1%2F664326832&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for $1,085.39 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=TheVergeBestTVDeals11022&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Felectronics%2Ftvs-monitors%2Ftelevisions%2Fproducts%2Fvizio-55-in-class-oled-4k-hdr-smart-tv-oled55-h1%2F328244.html%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAiAz--OBhBIEiwAG1rIOkxcXYlj6ScGOoFBZgjK6aTkIKD4FzPqFF_iAJuMpBNs7HSsc9KnXRoC48gQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,199.99 at GameStop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgooPl8Oqdb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, the TV is one of the more affordable options if you’re looking for an OLED. Vizio doesn’t have the same kind of experience in the OLED playing field as LG, sure, but it’s a great deal if you want a high-end viewing experience and HDMI 2.1 ports to display high frame rates from your PS5 or Xbox Series X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKhcwu"&gt;Like with other models, Best Buy is also offering a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV with each purchase, in addition to three months of Tidal Premium, HiFi, or Family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L4HPUh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ubtWst"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Vizio’s profit on ads, subscriptions, and data is double the money it makes selling TVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22773073/vizio-acr-advertising-inscape-data-privacy-q3-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xr7I2E"&gt;Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So, naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of your console, it might be time to upgrade to one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. For the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gdxA6x"&gt;LG C1 OLED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qapHVJ"&gt;If you’re looking for an impressive TV, we recommend turning your attention to LG’s C1 line. Like its predecessor, the CX, the 4K C1 touts support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD Freesync technologies, along with a 120Hz refresh rate and low input lag. The main difference between the two is that the C1 is available in an 83-inch variant and features a better processor. It also utilizes a newer interface that makes good use of a settings pane dubbed “Game Optimizer,” which conveniently brings together a host of game-centric settings — refresh rate, latency, etc. — for quicker access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0d4lq"&gt;Throughout the holidays, we saw the 55-inch C1 selling for $1,296.99 instead of $1,499.99, its lowest price to date. Sadly, that deal is no longer available. However, there are still some discounts on other configurations. You can, for instance, pick up the smaller, 48-inch model for $1,196.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1632394-REG%2Flg_oled48c1pub_c1pu_48_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, as well as $1,199.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoo6VAtupu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, instead of $1,299.99. The 65-inch, meanwhile, is also selling for $1,896.99 instead of $2,099.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1632399-REG%2Flg_oled65c1pub_c1pu_65_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoknLTWvNN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; also has it for $1,899.99, but is throwing in a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV as well as 30 days of FuboTV Pro regardless of the configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YU7ceV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10618444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bn523S"&gt;Samsung Neo QLED QN90A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PXnRvH"&gt;For a viable OLED alternative, there’s the Neo QLED QN90A. Unlike the LG models above, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309077/samsung-2021-8k-4k-tvs-now-available-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s most recent flagship&lt;/a&gt; uses Mini LED backlighting, a technology that allows for better contrast, less “blooming” around white objects on a dark background, and brightness levels that outperform even the best OLED TVs. Like the C1, the QN90A is also built with gamers in mind. The 2021 model features an HDMI 2.1 port and a “Game Bar” that gives you the ability to quickly adjust your screen’s aspect ratio, monitor input lag, and check to ensure settings such as HDR and VRR are active, all of which make for a better gaming experience overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYqOuE"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the 55-inch QN90A sold for as low as $1,299.99. However, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3W4YXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748274080574733405" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are currently only discounting the $1,799.99 55-inch TV down to $1,497.99 and $1,599.99, respectively. The $3,499.99 75-inch is also on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V39W74P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,797.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. As usual, Best Buy is also throwing in additional incentives, including up to $300 off soundbars and free delivery. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It fills me with glee that Canon printers now think Canon’s own toner is fake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1fi7F8742hPtI_YmQYLctnQgbM=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376666/canon_printer_2400.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sadly, not for consumer inkjets like this one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tLZ9nT"&gt;Printers are the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt;. They’re unreliable, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-printer-ink-so-expensive-2019-8"&gt;they guzzle reportedly $12,000-a-gallon ink&lt;/a&gt;, and their manufacturers have been known to use dirty tricks, scare tactics, and DRM to &lt;em&gt;strongly encourage &lt;/em&gt;you to buy cartridges exclusively from them. But Canon is now getting a taste of its own medicine. Some of Canon’s own toner cartridges are now being detected as fakes — and they’re forcing the company to teach customers how to bypass its own DRM (via &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20220110/06555048260/chip-shortage-forces-canon-to-issue-workarounds-own-obnoxious-drm.shtml"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Techdirt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRwALM"&gt;According to Canon’s own support website (&lt;a href="https://www.canon-europe.com/support/business-product-support/interim-toner/"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.canon.de/support/business-product-support/interim-toner/#id2"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;), the company is “currently facing challenges in sourcing certain electronic components that are used in our consumables for our multifunction printers.” In other words, Canon’s been hit by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;the great chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;, too — only the components Canon’s missing aren’t powering video game consoles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/13/22780037/tesla-reportedly-shipping-cars-without-usb-ports"&gt;or your Tesla’s USB port&lt;/a&gt;; they’re the DRM for its own toner cartridges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vf1jyu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  Semiconductor shortage leads to Canon selling toner cartridges without chips which usually identify them as genuine, so Canon now instructs customers on how to override the warnings for using "counterfeit" cartridges &lt;a href="https://t.co/rqcmXckPFp"&gt;https://t.co/rqcmXckPFp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nils Adermann (@naderman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/naderman/status/1479529888977760258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wdZfYN"&gt;But wait, there’s a simple solution, says Canon! See all our warnings about how your toner cartridge might be “malfunctioning”? Ignore them. Just hit the close button, and you’ll be good to go: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/urVXXnFMKN29CNim_LZSggQushM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161960/Interim_Toner_Screenshot_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Canon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canon explains how to bypass its own DRM: just ignore the warning and hit the close button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oRAf8e"&gt;If you’re hoping to experience an approved-bypassing-of-DRM on your inkjet home printer, though, you might be out of luck — we’re only seeing Canon’s big workplace multifunction printers (MFP) on the list of “affected models” at Canon’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BENYmi"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Techdirt&lt;/em&gt; points out, &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.470665/gov.uscourts.nyed.470665.1.0.pdf"&gt;Canon is currently facing down a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; involving some alleged behavior that seems even more egregious than the typical DRM tricks: Queens resident David Leacraft claims his Canon Pixma All-in-One doesn’t even scan documents unless it has ink. We checked, and Canon hasn’t yet issued a response to that lawsuit in court, but multiple posts on Canon’s official support forums suggest that the ridiculous restriction is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0kaGU"&gt;“The PIXMA MG6320 must have all ink tanks installed in the printer and they must all contain ink in order to use the functions of the printer. Replacing the empty ink tank with a new ink tank will resolve this issue. There is no workaround for this,” &lt;a href="https://community.usa.canon.com/t5/Desktop-Inkjet-Printers/one-ink-empty-can-t-scan/m-p/323046/highlight/true#M40538"&gt;wrote one rep in 2020.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5GhcD"&gt; “If you are getting a ‘Ink Out’ error, you will not be able to use the unit until the ink is replaced,” &lt;a href="https://community.usa.canon.com/t5/Desktop-Inkjet-Printers/I-am-out-of-ink-and-would-like-to-scan-a-document-using-my-Canon/td-p/165982"&gt;they wrote in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dk2IvZ"&gt;The lawsuit is seeking class action status, and we’ll let you know if it goes anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9v5K6S"&gt;Sadly, some of us still need printers (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323097/pdf-signature-windows-pc-adobe-how-to"&gt;though&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321383/signature-pdf-mac-pdf-how-to-preview"&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22762041/android-signature-adobe-acrobat-pdf-how-to"&gt;always&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22761773/iphone-apple-pdf-signature-markup-how-to"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; signing and scanning documents, as I recently discovered). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279634/best-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office"&gt;Here’s our guide on how to choose one&lt;/a&gt; if you can’t get out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California budget aims to clear up port congestion and pollution</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Southern California Ports Work Through Night To Help Ease Congestion" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HbPOqL_Qpy-MDxTkCdkrkDAPlBw=/12x0:7938x5284/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376556/1349102611.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Southern California Ports Work Through Night To Help Ease Congestion | Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h4yCpc"&gt;California Governor Gavin Newsom’s newly proposed &lt;a href="https://www.ebudget.ca.gov/FullBudgetSummary.pdf"&gt;budget&lt;/a&gt; includes plans to tackle pollution choking portside communities while also expanding the state’s capacity to accommodate the nation’s growing hunger for imported consumer goods. The proposal comes as pandemic-fueled supply chain problems have created a crisis at California’s ports, thrusting them into the national spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4fE3E"&gt;The draft budget released yesterday for the 2022–23 fiscal year proposes investing $2.3 billion in the state’s congested ports. That includes $875 million for zero-emission vehicles and infrastructure — with a majority earmarked for trucks. It also includes $1.2 billion for “port-related” projects, like rail yard expansions, meant to increase the flow of goods from ports to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7DAVl"&gt;Southern California is home to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which together comprise the busiest port complex in the Western Hemisphere. Americans’ shopping habits have long saddled neighborhoods near these ports and others with pollution from ships, trains, and trucks transporting everything from electronics to furniture. But the COVID-19 pandemic has made things considerably worse, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22800410/black-friday-holiday-shopping-supply-chain-pollution-ports-warehouses-california"&gt;triggering toxic traffic jams&lt;/a&gt; as container ships piled up offshore and trucks struggled to keep up with the rush of imported goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j3AUfw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There is no time to waste”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1XeqGe"&gt;To alleviate the recent supply chain bottlenecks, state and federal officials have announced initiatives aimed at boosting port capacity. But those efforts, like Joe Biden’s decision last October to keep ports open 24/7, can also increase pollution unless ports turn to zero-emission vehicles at the same time. Emissions from container ships, which typically burn heavy bunker fuel and diesel, have been tied to &lt;a href="https://theicct.org/blog/staff/silent-deadly-case-shipping-emissions"&gt;60,000 premature deaths&lt;/a&gt; globally in a single year. Diesel-burning trucks, meanwhile, largely drove a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876380/greenhouse-gas-emissions-2021-biden-climate-change-pledges"&gt;jump in US greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Without a transition to cleaner transportation,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;ports will continue taking a toll on nearby residents’ health and thwart climate goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etbQiM"&gt;“There is no time to waste in tackling the climate and environmental impacts that are happening at the ports,” Teresa Bui, state climate policy director at the nonprofit Pacific Environment, said in a statement. “Our frontline communities and public health depend upon it.”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZ5Ikx"&gt;Newsom’s proposed budget includes $475 million for short-haul trucks, with the goal of getting 1,000 zero-emission vehicles on the road. There’s another $400 million for port electrification, although there aren’t many details yet on what that might entail. The budget proposal also includes $200 million for demonstration and pilot projects across maritime, aviation, rail, and “other off-road” modes of transport. These are sectors that are harder to electrify and decarbonize. It’s all part of broader efforts to address climate change in the budget, to the tune of $22.5 billion for climate and clean energy programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37jXR3"&gt;California ports already have some lofty &lt;a href="https://www.portoflosangeles.org/references/2021-news-releases/news_110421_ctf"&gt;environmental goals&lt;/a&gt;, although they’ve been called out for making slow progress on them. The twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which together are the &lt;a href="https://www.aqmd.gov/nav/about/initiatives/clean-port"&gt;largest fixed source of pollution&lt;/a&gt; in Southern California, announced a plan in 2017 to transition to a zero-emissions truck fleet by 2035. “But they have done little since then to cut emissions in the near term,” The &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-11-22/supply-chain-issues-port-pollution"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Editorial Board wrote last November. “Freight pollution is a major, ongoing threat to public health, air quality and the climate, and we cannot settle for half-measures and hope they make a dent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Giw7sR"&gt;In April, the twin ports will start to &lt;a href="https://www.presstelegram.com/2022/01/10/how-newsoms-proposed-budget-will-help-la-long-beach-ports-shore-up-supply-chain-reduce-pollution/"&gt;impose a fee&lt;/a&gt; on shipping containers to help raise the estimated $10 billion it will take to hit that 2035 goal. They could soon get another infusion of cash if Newsom’s budget is approved by June. The state’s new fiscal year starts in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHGD7Z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tHe8x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fR5pJ"&gt;When it comes to smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of voice-enabled Echo devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. Maybe you want to add Alexa to a spare bedroom, for example, or you’re looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your lighting or other smart home devices. Regardless of the reason, this is one of the best times of the year to pick up an Echo device, even if Black and Cyber Monday are behind us. Below, we’ve curated a list of some of the very best Amazon Echo deals available right now, from the last-gen Echo Dot to Amazon’s latest Echo Show 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="868HqZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Kindle deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21539047/best-amazon-kindle-deals"},{"title":"The best smart displays for every home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="qblixW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10913993"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;The best Echo Dot deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry: Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;third-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape and is currently on sale for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoH6E6qPbd" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$24.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot/dp/B07FZ8S74R/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BDRU5"&gt;We’ve recently seen the latest Echo Dot drop to an all-time low of $29.99, however, it’s currently only &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $34.99&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is also selling a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; that showcases the time, weather, and other information for an additional $10 more, bringing the price to $44.99. Note, however, that both the base model and the LED-equipped variant are available 25 percent off at Amazon when you trade in select devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7P5bD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, are also offering the fourth-gen Dot for $34.99, with the latter retailer taking $10 off if you buy two — meaning you’d pay $60 instead of $70 for a pair. The same Best Buy promotion applies to the fourth-gen Dot with the built-in LED display, which is available at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-clock-and-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795704%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYzQMDs5Oi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $44.99, $15 off of the standard retail price. Best Buy is also throwing in a four-month subscription to SiriusXM Streaming Platinum, if you’re a new subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EVsfiu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;The best Echo Dot Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt; is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kids Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;The Kids Edition is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $44.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, 25 percent off the original list price. If you prefer a different retailer, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502549%26clkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgbfjoL52Lr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are also selling the Kids Edition for $44.99, the latter with a four-month trial to SiriusXM Streaming Platinum. Best Buy is offering $10 off if you purchase two as well, dropping the final price of a pair to around $80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VgQp2M"&gt;The best Amazon Echo deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; also received a makeover this year. Like the aforementioned fourth-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. That said, it also touts a built-in smart home hub and produces better sound, thanks to a pair of 0.8-inch tweeters and a 3-inch woofer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdAa8S"&gt;We’ve seen the Echo drop to as low as $60 during shopping events like Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday, however, it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747624046492524210" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo--4th-gen----smart-home-hub-with-alexa---charcoal%2F-%2FA-80770246%2F%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; right now for $74.99, a discount of $25. Amazon is offering a 25 percent discount when you trade in select devices, though, and Best Buy is taking an additional $10 off the price of two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbxI7Q"&gt;If you’re looking for a bundle, you can pick up the latest Echo at Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-4th-Gen/dp/B08NSWKV7L/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with a pair of fourth-gen Echo Dots for $144.97&lt;/a&gt; ($55 off), or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-4th-Gen/dp/B08N6D9DYR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with a wall mount for $99.98&lt;/a&gt; ($25 off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;The best Amazon Echo Studio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $199.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon also offers a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0939S1B5R/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Billie Eilish Limited Edition Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; with the singer’s image pasted on the side for $229.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D411Fi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for a compact Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is the Echo device to consider. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest edition&lt;/a&gt;, which launched in June, features an always-on microphone, an upgraded 2MP camera, a 5.5-inch display, and a physical shutter, allowing you to block the camera’s view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8jLZ5"&gt;The latest Echo Show 5 is currently available for $44.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAzhE7JLdJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KJN3333/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, an all-time low and $35 cheaper than the first-gen model is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Sandstone/dp/B07HZJ64WD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently selling for at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. You can also pick it up with a Blink Mini for $5 more through either retailer — which is a nice discount on the basic, 1080p security camera — or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09155JR3K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon for $64.98 (normally $104.98). Like with other Echo devices, Amazon will take 25 percent off any aforementioned configuration if you trade in an eligible device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mVseNr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609475"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FiYkkx"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JGaEAZ"&gt;The Echo Dot isn’t the only Echo device with a kid-friendly design. The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition offers all of the same features as the standard, second-gen Echo Show 5, only with a vibrant print on the rear and a year of Amazon’s Kids Plus service, which grants your family access to a trove of videos, games, and other kid-friendly content. It even comes with a two-year warranty, providing a bit of protection from whatever your child might (literally) throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1db3Rn"&gt;The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition is available for $45 off ($54.99) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMSC4WZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740551130085982176" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers. If you’re looking for add-ons, you can also pick up an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09345FQWY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $74.98 (normally $114.98) through Amazon. Once more, Amazon is also offering a 25 percent discount on each model and bundle if you trade in certain devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DwZKlk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O97UD3"&gt;The best Echo Show 8 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Like the Echo Show 5, the Echo Show 8 is available in two distinct models, both of which feature 8-inch displays and dual speakers. However, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with a 13MP camera and some unique software tricks, one of which grants it the ability to keep the subject centered in the frame as they move around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNLpG4"&gt;When pitted against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Home Hub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, their closest competitors in terms of price and functionality, both iterations of the Echo Show 8 are better options for a few reasons: they feature slightly larger displays, better speakers, and cameras that allow you to use them as video chatting devices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; the Echo Show 8 to be better than other devices in Amazon’s current smart display lineup, which is why we think it’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best smart display&lt;/a&gt; for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;As far as deals go, the first-gen Show 8 is currently available for $69.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and there are a few discounted bundles available for a few dollars more. For $74.99, for instance, you can pick up a first-gen Echo Show 8 and a Blink Mini security camera at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $90.98 instead of $130.98, or with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DDXMXFT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;portable battery for $119.98&lt;/a&gt; instead of $159.98. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovLiAu"&gt;Sadly, the second-gen Echo Show 8 is currently only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084DCJKSL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCe6zrQP2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $129.99, its full retail price. However, like the last-gen model, it is available as part of a discounted bundle at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZN82HH7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCe6zrQP2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; that contains a Blink Mini for $134.99 instead of $164.99. If you purchase through Amazon, the 25 percent trade-in discount is also applicable to all generations of the Echo Show 8 as well as the bundles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YdQbrX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="NkSBNy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10611942"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QJ2PFl"&gt;The best Echo Show 10 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-gen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. The device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and, unlike the Show 5 and Show 8, the 2021 model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It’s also mounted on a motorized, swiveling base that allows the display to follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;We’ve seen the latest Echo Show 10 get discounted to as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now. But if you still want to pick it up, you can get it for its usual $249.99 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SQ2F8D2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is also offering a discounted bundle, which includes an Echo Show 10 and a Blink Mini for $259.99 instead of $284.98. Again, trading in select devices at Amazon can net you 25 percent off on the Echo Show 10 and all aforementioned bundles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bA0Mnl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10362085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Amazon workers will redo Bessemer union election on February 4th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eBbQjdt-8zaNK8TiXiWjfemG9C0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70375180/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The NLRB said Amazon broke labor laws in the original election.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4ob1ga"&gt;The second union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama will begin on February 4th, according to a notice posted Tuesday by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which you can read below. The election is a redo of the one that was carried out in 2021, the results of which were declared invalid by the regulatory agency after reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;Amazon had broken labor laws&lt;/a&gt; during the union drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzk62X"&gt;The election will be carried out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;almost a year after&lt;/a&gt; workers originally voted on whether to unionize Amazon’s BHM1 facility. The union &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;lost that election nearly two-to-one&lt;/a&gt; but disputed the results, taking issue with a mailbox that employees feared Amazon had access to. The mailbox was installed by the USPS, at Amazon’s request, and at one point had a “privacy tent” put up around it, which the NLRB says employees believed was monitored with video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6lGAQk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The redo is taking place because regulators found Amazon interfered in the first election&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Cdllp"&gt;The NLRB cites the mailbox in its notice of the second election, saying that the results of the first are being set aside after the regulator “found the Employer interfered with the employees’ exercise of a free and reasoned choice by creating the appearance of irregularity in the election.” It also accuses Amazon of “improperly polling employees’ support during mandatory meetings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E83WXP"&gt;The redo will be carried out through the mail and supervised by the NLRB. In response to the notice, the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union (the organization behind the union drive in Bessemer) put out a statement saying that it’s “deeply concerned that the decision fails to adequately prevent Amazon from continuing its objectionable behavior in a new election.” The RWDSU says it “proposed to the NLRB a number of remedies that could have made the process fairer to workers, which were not taken up in the Notice of Election issued today,” and promises to “continue to hold [Amazon] accountable for [its] actions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvfXRn"&gt;The RWDSU’s specific request was detailed in the NLRB regional director’s order for a second election, which was released &lt;a href="https://foiaonline.gov/foiaonline/action/public/submissionDetails?trackingNumber=NLRB-2022-000389&amp;amp;type=Request"&gt;thanks to a Freedom of Information Act request&lt;/a&gt;. According to the document, which you can read below, the RWDSU asked that the second election be held at an off-site location where employees couldn’t be surveilled, and the NLRB would have more control. Conversely, Amazon asked for an on-site election and said it would provide “a large, climate-controlled tent in the parking lot” where its employees could vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5fANU"&gt;The RWDSU said its desired location could be made COVID-19 compliant, and Amazon cited lower infection rates of COVID-19 (the order is dated November 30th, 2021, pre-dating the spikes we’ve seen in recent weeks). However, the pandemic plays a large part in the NLRB’s argument as to why the election will be carried out by mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElU4Tz"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately reply to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEzX5E"&gt;The NLRB says that it will start counting the ballots on March 28th, though ballots will have to reach its offices by March 25th to be counted. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851842/amazon-union-settlement-nlrb-email-electronic-post-rights"&gt;Due to a recent NLRB / Amazon settlement&lt;/a&gt;, organizers may have more opportunities this time around — the company has agreed to stop barring employees from being at their workplace more than 15 minutes before or after their shifts if they’re carrying out union activity and has promised to prominently post statements of workers’ rights in its facilities and employee apps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge says the FTC’s Meta monopoly lawsuit can go forward</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BwRySi41tbUsbM-NdK7CoCpm2lM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376041/acastro_211101_1777_meta_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AifJ7H"&gt;A federal judge says the US Federal Trade Commission can proceed with an antitrust lawsuit against Meta, formerly known as Facebook, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;dismissing the suit&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZejye"&gt;District of Columbia Judge James Boasberg &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21177063-memorandum-opinion"&gt;said in an opinion&lt;/a&gt; released today that the FTC’s first complaint had “stumbled out of the starting blocks.” But a revised version, Boasberg said, makes the same arguments with facts that are “far more robust and detailed than before.” As a result, he’s denying Meta’s motion to dismiss and allowing the case to proceed, although he states that the agency “may well face a tall task down the road in proving its allegations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tr0N24"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FTC may still face a “tall task” proving its claims&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6hfyAy"&gt;Throughout the case, the FTC has alleged that Meta holds an unlawful monopoly in personal social networking services and maintained it by acquiring the competitors Instagram and WhatsApp. Today’s opinion says the agency has reasonably backed that allegation up with data about Meta’s market power, although like before, Boasberg held back on approving allegations involving older Meta interoperability policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdOR4Z"&gt;“In stark contrast with its predecessor, this complaint provides reinforcing, specific allegations that all point toward the same conclusion: Facebook has maintained a dominant market share during the relevant time period,” the opinion says. If you accept the market definition and the reliability of the FTC’s data, “Facebook’s market share comfortably exceeds the levels that courts ordinarily find sufficient to establish monopoly power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNeYOU"&gt;Boasberg also shot down Meta’s new allegation that FTC head Lina Khan invalidated the complaint by prejudging Meta’s guilt, saying Khan’s previous public criticisms of Facebook don’t suggest an “axe to grind” based on personal animosity or a financial conflict of interest. Likewise, “although the court recognizes the importance of her vote, it is an exaggeration to treat Khan as the sole instigator of the current case.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8sm0w"&gt;The FTC suit against Meta is one of several US government efforts to curtail the monopoly power of major tech companies, including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786079/google-jonathan-kanter-justice-department-antitrust-division-facebook-lina-khan"&gt;Department of Justice lawsuit against Google&lt;/a&gt; proceeding under antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCpKmv"&gt;Today’s decision reverses a significant blow that Boasberg dealt the FTC in June, when he said the complaint contained “nothing” proving Meta’s monopoly power except for the “naked allegation” that it held a dominant share of personal social networking services. The new complaint amended that claim with Comscore data illuminating Meta’s market share of daily active users (DAUs) and monthly active users (MAUs) of social networks, as well as the relative time spent on these networks. While these numbers will likely be questioned as the case proceeds, they were convincing enough to let the FTC clear the first hurdle and proceed with discovery, where more details could come to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZvwmT"&gt;Meta responded in a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by Chris Sgro. “Today’s decision narrows the scope of the FTC’s case by rejecting claims about our platform policies. It also acknowledges that the agency faces a ‘tall task’ proving its case regarding two acquisitions it cleared years ago,” says the statement. “We’re confident the evidence will reveal the fundamental weakness of the claims. Our investments in Instagram and WhatsApp transformed them into what they are today. They have been good for competition, and good for the people and businesses that choose to use our products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZtYHj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 4:35PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Meta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="No0TbS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 129.2857%; padding-top: 80px;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21177063-memorandum-opinion/?embed=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile identifies issue that prevented some iPhone users from using Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a679SQQpMlD7hp-oo9jH_r4cJPA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372164/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4lX89e"&gt;T-Mobile said Tuesday that it had not blocked iCloud Private relay, and that it had identified what was causing some iPhone users to appear blocked from using the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OE9nGi"&gt;“Overnight our team identified that in the 15.2 iOS release, some device settings default to the feature being toggled off. We have shared this with Apple. This is not specific to T-Mobile. Again though, we have not broadly blocked iCloud Private,” the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1480987702363189248?s=20"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reporter Mark Gurman. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HhyPo0"&gt;iCloud Private Relay lets users hide the websites they visit from third parties, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/t-mobile-block-icloud-private-relay/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;VPN-like Private Relay&lt;/a&gt; hides your web activity from any outside sources — including Apple and your carrier — and prevents anyone from identifying you or the sites you access. It’s currently available &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;via a subscription to iCloud Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5ygsEB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TMobileHelp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TMobileHelp&lt;/a&gt; What the hey?  Why are you keeping us from using &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; ‘s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/icloud?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#icloud&lt;/a&gt; private relay? &lt;a href="https://t.co/EtdxkVSpWh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EtdxkVSpWh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Guidry (@guidryjd) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guidryjd/status/1480599787577696260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hwCA9M"&gt;Private Relay is still in beta in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, and it isn’t turned on by default. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;You have to go into your iPhone’s settings to switch it on&lt;/a&gt;, which is where some T-Mobile customers first noticed the message above appearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z095du"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guidryjd/status/1480631410239094797?s=20"&gt;a reply to that tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the user shows what happens when you click the “Learn More” button below the initial message — there, Apple explains why T-Mobile might be blocking the feature. “Networks that require the ability to audit traffic or perform network-based filtering will block access to Private Relay,” it reads. “Your cellular provider may be providing network-based services, such as Parental Controls, requiring them to view the traffic on your network.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oYDJF"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2022/01/t-mobile-blocking-icloud-private-relay-for-some-but-its-not-what-you-think/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;iCloud Private Relay conflicts with a number of T-Mobile services, but that doesn’t appear to be the case here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4ZROa"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/european-carriers-seek-to-block-iphone-private-relay-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;iPhone users in Europe were the first to notice that access to the Private Relay feature wasn’t working. T-Mobile, Vodafone, and Telefonica added their names to an open letter published in &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/01/09/apple-fire-iphone-encryption-tech/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that criticizes the feature. Carriers argue that Private Relay “will impair others to innovate and compete in downstream digital markets and may negatively impact operators’ ability to efficiently manage telecommunication networks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWnp0v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 11th, 4:48AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with additional &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2022/01/t-mobile-blocking-icloud-private-relay-for-some-but-its-not-what-you-think/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;reporting by The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k79kN0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 11th 3:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated throughout with comment from T-Mobile about the cause of the issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
