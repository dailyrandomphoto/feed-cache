    <title>Apple employees say the company is cracking down on remote work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kxNmtVq_JC4s00f9NPfwg0RmLZs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69588204/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="74nfy4"&gt;Apple employees say it’s harder than ever to get remote work requests approved after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;rolled out a new hybrid model&lt;/a&gt; that will require people to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Some employees say they will quit if Apple doesn’t change its stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNMKlT"&gt;While Apple historically discouraged employees from working from home, there were one-off exceptions to the rule, and some teams were more lenient than others. Now, employees say that even those exceptions are being denied. In a company Slack channel where employees advocate for remote work, roughly 10 people said they were resigning due to the hybrid work policy or knew others who’d been forced to quit. The Slack channel currently has more than 6,000 members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hkEz0"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560586/apple-hybrid-work-internal-survey-tim-cook"&gt;survey on remote work&lt;/a&gt; conducted by employees in June, 36.7 percent of respondents said they were worried they’d have to leave Apple due to the lack of flexibility (1,735 people answered the question).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBg79W"&gt;The return-to-work plan has already been a flashpoint at Apple, where employees wrote a letter in June asking Apple CEO Tim Cook to reevaluate the hybrid model. Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556615/apple-response-hybrid-work-model-employee-letter-remote"&gt;sent a video in response&lt;/a&gt; saying that in-person collaboration was “essential” and noting the company would not be backing away from its current approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="M1xHzX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I will be out of a job in September”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HielYm"&gt;While Apple’s corporate employees certainly have more flexibility than the retail staff, some say it’s out of step with other big tech companies in Silicon Valley. Twitter and Facebook have already announced a permanent work-from-home policy, and Apple employees say they’ve been flooded with recruiting messages from other tech organizations eyeing a potential opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ld1Cht"&gt;One employee said they were currently on an Americans with Disabilities Act accommodation that allowed them to work from home, but were told that accommodation would be denied when the company went back to the office. “I will be out of a job in September,” they wrote in Slack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jt11t"&gt;Apple typically gives employees 30 days to find a new job within the company if their current team denies a medical accommodation. But one worker said in Slack that there weren’t any open remote positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRBKN7"&gt;Some employees say they were told only people with documented medical conditions would be approved for permanent remote work. But the form that Apple employees use to request such an accommodation asks them to release their medical records to the company, which made some people uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oU6QlI"&gt;Now, employees are discussing how to get Apple’s attention. Some suggested writing another letter to reiterate their concerns, while others have discussed talking to lawyers about possible legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToWXQ8"&gt;Apple declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elgato announces new Stream Deck the same day Valve announces new Steam Deck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Er4refyJyMUgG4zfZktVZjou9E=/8x0:2660x1768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587965/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_1.39.04_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elgato’s new Stream Deck, which is different from Valve’s Steam Deck.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Elgato&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4oVk4r"&gt;Elgato’s Stream Deck is a popular tool for live-streamers, letting them set shortcuts and controls they can access with the push of a button, and the company announced a new model on Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck-mk2"&gt;the Stream Deck MK. 2&lt;/a&gt;. This version brings a host of welcome improvements, including a detachable stand, interchangeable faceplates, and a removable USB-C cable. You can &lt;a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck-mk2"&gt;order it right now on Elgato’s website for $149.99&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzKi4m"&gt;While the Stream Deck MK. 2 does seem like a nice upgrade, it was announced on perhaps the worst possible day. Just a few hours ago, Valve made a huge splash by revealing its new handheld gaming console called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Preowc"&gt;While they’re entirely different products, there’s sure to be some confusion about the names “Stream Deck” versus “Steam Deck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cT7qrx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;amazing that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/valvesoftware?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@valvesoftware&lt;/a&gt; announced steam deck just hours before &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elgato?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@elgato&lt;/a&gt; announced their new stream deck. i'm gettin eyestrain just THINKIN about these press releases &lt;a href="https://t.co/DJKSCxT6UM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DJKSCxT6UM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— tim rogers (@108) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/108/status/1415756755192193027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3kSLJy"&gt;Alongside the &lt;s&gt;Steam&lt;/s&gt; Stream Deck, Elgato also revealed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22568273/elgato-facecam-webcam-price-features-streaming-1080p"&gt;streamer-friendly Elgato Facecam&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elgato/status/1415751930471608320"&gt;Wave XLR USB audio interface&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elgato/status/1415752902694498305"&gt;new mic arms&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google adds option to instantly delete your last 15 minutes of search history</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R68153-XRoa5BoWJIJh8sqfNMEw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587843/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YDRprS"&gt;Google is launching a new privacy feature for search that lets you instantly delete your last 15 minutes of search history on mobile, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/new-privacy-tool-search/"&gt;announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The new option &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/our-work-keep-you-safe/"&gt;was first revealed&lt;/a&gt; alongside several other search and Chrome improvements &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/google-io"&gt;at I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt; and is now rolling out to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19UyiI"&gt;The option to delete your last 15 minutes of search history is currently only available in Google’s iOS app and is headed to Android later this year. On desktop, your options for deleting searches are limited to setting your history to auto-delete every three, 18, or 36 months (18 months is the default for new accounts), or deleting searches by hand. You can see what the new option looks like in the iOS app below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5dwpayVPtzvPEZDPR9OTuI1UmdE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22720317/QUICK_DELETE.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deleting the last 15 minutes of your Google search life is as simple as tapping one button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X3tpLT"&gt;Google says it only tracks your search history to “personalize” your experience when the “Web and App Activity” setting is enabled. Adding a way to instantly delete your history is great for your peace of mind, but it also means you can get some of the benefits the people who’ve taken the time to mess with their settings receive, without doing the extra work. Think of it as an emergency “oh no” button for terrible, embarrassing, or just plain private searches. If you’d rather just secure your searches from prying, non-Google eyes rather than delete them, Google also offers the option &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452122/google-my-activity-page-password-privacy-verification-web-and-app-history"&gt;to password protect your search history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skOBiW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Old memes are Bill Murray, dodging them is Tilda Swinton</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="“The French Dispatch” Photocall - The 74th Annual Cannes Film Festival" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XnSXcUNROPbPrOwH-4IAN408Rm4=/0x166:4681x3287/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587829/1328503506.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;One of the photos from this Cannes photo shoot has been widely memed. Please make it stop. | Photo by Samir Hussein/WireImage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PVY1MR"&gt;Twitter said Thursday it was hearing from users who were seeing too many topic suggestions in their home timelines and was moving to remedy the situation. “We’re fixing that now, and will continue to improve Topics and find ways to show you the very best of Twitter. Things you want to see, that is,” its &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1415757630836981764"&gt;Support account tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. To its credit, Twitter has seemed more responsive to users’ complaints — or their lack of interest — of late; in addition to Thursday’s topics announcement, Twitter said this week it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;kill off Fleets&lt;/a&gt;, its ephemeral disappearing tweets that apparently no one was using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZqvgt"&gt;But instead of showing us more things we want to see, I think Twitter should lean into taking away things we don’t want. I have a suggestion that I think most of the internet will be able to get behind — and we know the internet never collectively agrees on anything, so hear me out here: a way to block memes that are past their expiration date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tihjzw"&gt;This request is inspired by the meme-ified photo of Wes Anderson, Timothée Chalamet, Tilda Swinton, and Bill Murray from the Cannes Film Festival. It’s meant to promote their movie &lt;em&gt;The French Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;, but since we (the internet) have to beat every funny thing into the ground, then dig it up and beat it some more, a version of that meme is now everywhere. Murray represents the “older” end of the spectrum, Swinton is the “cool” one, etc. I’m not going to over-explain it to you. If you know, you know, and explaining memes is probably &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/style/cheugy.html"&gt;cheugy&lt;/a&gt;. (I don’t know, I am Gen X.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9CYRI"&gt; Example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eg4XTE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;TechCrunch, The Information, The Verge, Techmeme? &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZefkeyZqxL"&gt;https://t.co/ZefkeyZqxL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— alex (@alex) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1415373066658516993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S87JQs"&gt;I’ll refrain from debating the accuracy of the above (it’s correct), but you get the idea. In all seriousness, a “block image” feature would be extremely useful, and not just to reduce the number of annoying memes in our timelines. Twitter has a way to &lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/437099/how-to-unblock-potentially-sensitive-content-on-twitter/#:~:text=To%20disable%20the%20warning%2C%20head,disable%20the%20warning%20for%20tweets."&gt;block “sensitive media,”&lt;/a&gt; but it would be great if there were a toggle for specific images — maybe ones that are potentially triggering to a given user but not necessarily widely objectionable — rather than a blanket block-all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEm1cX"&gt;For the time being, you’ll just have to continue to grit your teeth through everyone’s “clever” takes on this worn-out meme; it’s a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22Bill%20Murray%22&amp;amp;src=trend_click&amp;amp;vertical=trends"&gt;trending topic&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter at the moment. But it’s also beginning to make the rounds on Facebook, which should be the agreed-upon sign that the meme is officially over and we need something new and shiny to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky9EFC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irCGbQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Video game handhelds didn’t die after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DxIdBhI7qTxOCWCkFlUaWksuYKY=/375x0:4425x2700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587743/Steam_Deck_coop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steam Deck.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MbZPFL"&gt;When the beloved PlayStation Vita eventually died out, many blamed the rise of mobile gaming. “I think the PS Vita, while ahead of its time in many ways ... launched at exactly the wrong time in terms of market opportunity,” former Sony vice president of marketing John Koller &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545198/playstation-vita-10-year-anniversary-sony-handheld"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about going up against smartphones. But despite the Vita’s demise, dedicated gaming handhelds didn’t die out — in fact, the space is arguably as vibrant as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wl0Okd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;Valve just announced the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, a chunky portable PC that looks like a Sega Game Gear from a parallel universe. It’s designed to let players take their Steam library of PC games on the go. Just a few hours later, preorders opened for the latest iteration of the Nintendo Switch, one that doesn’t change much aside from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;a bigger, brighter OLED screen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand"&gt;a kickstand that doesn’t suck&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Panic is planning to release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/22/18628360/playdate-panic-teenage-engineering-qwop-katamari"&gt;the oddball Playdate this year&lt;/a&gt;, and Analogue is building &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/16/20906665/analogue-pocket-game-boy-handheld-release-date-price"&gt;possibly the most beautiful Game Boy ever&lt;/a&gt; with the Pocket, also slated for a 2021 launch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CeMwG_ePFdMNsdP7u7vnsihAghY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719912/3_Analogue_Pocket_All_Angles.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Analogue&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analogue’s Pocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gLkJm9"&gt;Nintendo showed that there’s still a market for this kind of device. Nearly five years ago, the company completely changed its approach to hardware with a machine that blurred the lines between a handheld and a home console, and the Switch has since become a massive hit, moving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422451/nintendo-annual-earnings-switch-84-59-million"&gt;more than 84 million units&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps most interesting, though, is that the two hardware revisions since the Switch debuted in 2017 have both been focused on portable play. First, there was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;the handheld-only Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt;, and now the OLED version; a better screen doesn’t matter much if you’re playing the Switch docked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V7BZtX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The DS was Nintendo at its best and weirdest","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21441254/nintendo-ds-3ds-discontinued-eulogy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IIjXG2"&gt;The Steam Deck follows a similar approach. It’s basically a cheap PC with a screen so you can play on the go, but which can also connect to an external monitor or TV if you want. It’s kind of like a Switch without Nintendo games. Given Valve’s history with building hardware like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price"&gt;the Steam Controller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17190394/valve-steam-machines-steamos-section-hidden-pc-gaming-living-room"&gt;living room-focused Steam Machines&lt;/a&gt;, chances are the Steam Deck won’t be the breakout hit the Switch was. It could usher in a new style of PC gaming hardware, or, far more likely, it could end up as a beloved niche. But its sheer existence further proves that there’s a market here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzQAH6"&gt;Because smartphone gaming didn’t kill the portable console.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Mobile gaming continues to be a massive success; EA isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273187/ea-glu-mobile-acquisition-kim-kardashian-hollywood"&gt;throwing around&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547324/ea-golf-clash-playdemic-acquisition-warner-brothers-games-mobile"&gt;billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; for nothing. But, for the most part, the kinds of games that have proven to be successful on mobile aren’t the ones you would buy a device specifically to play. Free-to-play has completely upended the space, covering virtually every genre and major release, from &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Mobile&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush Saga&lt;/em&gt;. At this point, unless your game is called &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, it’s probably not going to sell. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"&gt;Apple Arcade is an attempt&lt;/a&gt; to bring things back to those early, exciting days of premium iPhone gaming, but dedicated handhelds seem better suited to filling that niche.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Playdate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="y4h490"&gt;What’s most exciting about this handheld renaissance is how different each machine is. The Switch is so incredibly Nintendo, an underpowered device that’s still a must-own because of &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;. The Steam Deck is a PC on the go. Analogue’s first foray into portables — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18513025/analogue-console-clones-gaming-history-preservation-code-hardware"&gt;the company makes some great retro consoles&lt;/a&gt; — solves a very important problem, namely letting people play original Game Boy cartridges on a beautiful, modern screen. The Playdate is the strangest of all: a little yellow box with a crank handle you can use to play black-and-white games designed by the likes of Keita Takahashi and Zach Gage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0fMGu"&gt;In some ways, 2021 looks a lot like the handheld markets of years past. You have Nintendo leading the way at the top, and lots of other companies — some big, some small — trying to carve out their own niche. In the past, those failed experiments have turned into much-loved devices. I still keep a Vita, Game Boy Micro, and Neo Geo Pocket Color in a desk drawer because I can’t let go. That could very well happen again here, as none of these machines are a guaranteed success. Years from now, a Playdate might fill an empty space in that drawer. But one thing &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; for certain: I can’t wait to travel again with a messenger bag full of games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Self-driving startup Aurora will raise $2 billion in SPAC merger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6M6UtTJ_OVjlGpEOz8gl6217hO0=/342x0:2364x1348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587551/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_2.45.08_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vmJI52"&gt;Self-driving technology startup Aurora, which was founded by the former head of Google’s autonomous vehicle program, is the latest company to announce that it’s going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (or SPAC). The deal will give Aurora about $2 billion in new cash when it closes, which will help the startup in its quest to become a provider of self-driving hardware and software to companies in the trucking and ride-hailing industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwgA16"&gt;Aurora is merging with a SPAC called Reinvent Technology Partners Y that’s already listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, and is run by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus, and investor Michael Thompson). That trio is also in the process of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298957/joby-aviation-public-evtol-electric-aircraft-spac-hoffman"&gt;taking electric aircraft startup Joby Aviation public&lt;/a&gt; with another Reinvent SPAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BAL0qG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Aurora’s co-founders came from Google, Tesla, and Uber &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UiEzX5"&gt;Founded in 2017, Aurora has a short history. But its executives have deep and diverse experience with autonomous vehicles. Chris Urmson, who architected Google’s self-driving car project before it was spun off as Waymo, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/12/10/13905292/google-car-chris-urmson-new-company"&gt;started plotting Aurora in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. He eventually recruited Sterling Anderson, who was the head of Tesla’s Autopilot team until &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/teslas-push-to-build-a-self-driving-car-sparks-dissent-among-its-engineers-1503593742"&gt;he reportedly resigned over disagreements&lt;/a&gt; about Elon Musk’s push to advertise that the company’s cars would be capable of “full self-driving.” Urmson also tapped Drew Bagnell as a co-founder. Bagnell had been a self-driving engineer at Uber after the tech company poached him from Carnegie Mellon (as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2015/5/19/8622831/uber-self-driving-cars-carnegie-mellon-poached"&gt;much larger raiding of the university’s vaunted robotics division&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfHLA5"&gt;Since then, Aurora has been developing the hardware and software required to allow vehicles to drive themselves — a package of technologies that it calls the Aurora Driver. The startup already has deals in place with companies like Uber, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274640/toyota-aurora-denso-self-driving-car-robotaxi"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358005/volvo-aurora-autonomous-truck-partnership"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt; to use the Aurora Driver. Aurora also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;bought Uber’s entire self-driving division at the end of last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ZtNNBw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10368711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WMZr9M"&gt;The deal with the Reinvent SPAC will value the self-driving startup at $11 billion and is expected to close in the second half of 2021. Just under $1 billion will come from the SPAC itself, while the other $1 billion will come from a consortium of investors that includes Uber, Volvo, and PACCAR (a trucking company that Aurora also has a deal with), as well as T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, Sequoia Capital, and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDz6Gq"&gt;Aurora said in &lt;a href="https://aurora.tech/ir"&gt;presentations and filings made public Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that it plans to have trucking customers start using the Aurora Driver without humans behind the wheel in late 2023, and in ride-hailing vehicles in late 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0EeJR"&gt;Aurora expects to lose money until at least 2027, which is why the SPAC merger is crucial. The next two to three years are going to be very expensive for Aurora as it continues to prove out its technology to the point that it can start making money selling it to other companies. Aurora lost $214 million across 2020 (with $179 million of that going to research and development), and that cash burn has only accelerated since, as the startup lost $189 million in the first quarter of 2021 alone (with $159 million spent on R&amp;amp;D in the quarter). Aurora has pitched investors that putting money into a technology this expensive is worth it, though, because the startup believes the autonomous vehicle industry will be dominated by very few players. In one slide, it compares the self-driving industry to the digital ad duopoly held by Facebook and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUcCGg"&gt;The deal announced Thursday is just the latest in an increasingly long line of SPAC mergers in the wider transportation industry, which is resulting in huge injections of cash into startups that need the money. Faraday Future is expected to start trading on the Nasdaq next week in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22247942/faraday-future-spac-merger-public-psac-property-solutions-nasdaq"&gt;a deal that will net the EV startup $1 billion in fresh cash&lt;/a&gt;. Lucid Motors will pull in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;astonishing $4.4 billion&lt;/a&gt; when it goes public soon after. LIDAR companies like Luminar, Velodyne, and AEye have also gone public by merging with SPACs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qao4N"&gt;Not all the deals have gone well. Some startups have struggled with the scrutiny that comes with being publicly-traded, like Lordstown Motors, whose CEO already resigned following an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;investigation into false statements he made about preorders&lt;/a&gt;. Velodyne is already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453138/velodyne-david-hall-spac-letter-board-removal"&gt;locked in a legal battle with its own founder&lt;/a&gt;, who was ousted from the board of directors following the merger. EV startups like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;Lordstown Motors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections"&gt;Canoo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21454738/nikola-cult-founder-worship-trevor-milton-general-motors"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; are all facing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;federal investigations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOc2ha"&gt;At the very least, Aurora’s founders can’t sell shares for four years and some of the SPAC’s leaders agreed to similar terms, in a show of commitment to seeing this through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvWCNI"&gt;Self-driving startups had not jumped into the SPAC fray until now. But that may be changing. In addition to Aurora, fellow autonomous vehicle startup &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/ford-backed-argo-said-to-choose-citigroup-jpmorgan-to-go-public?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Argo AI is reportedly in talks to go public in a SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldBdqB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s payment system extends to online retailers in August</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5X6hhojPhhf7Xerp3yCrb9-T7xo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587398/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jRCmCK"&gt;Online shoppers will eventually see another option listed next to the usual payment methods, now that &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/integrate-facebook-pay-directly-into-business-website"&gt;Facebook Pay will expand beyond the company’s own platforms&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after credit card companies dropped out of its Libra cryptocurrency project, Facebook launched its payments system for use across the main site, as well as WhatsApp and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zrK06wjN52nBRSvy5rAEt5-QIW0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719620/218332548_1237235380047988_2622834128320440862_1000.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook Pay is coming to online shopping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ThDddn"&gt;Now, just like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17358034/google-pay-how-to-mobile-payments-android-iphone"&gt;Google’s stored cards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/19/22541286/paypal-raise-seller-fees-transactions-online-payments"&gt;PayPal integrations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/17970466/amazon-prime-shopping-behavior-streaming-alexa-minimum-wage"&gt;Amazon Pay&lt;/a&gt;, and others, Facebook Pay is opening itself up for use in transactions with participating retailers. Shopify merchants are first in line to add the system on their sites, with others to follow after it launches in August. Interested merchants &lt;a href="https://pay.facebook.com/business/"&gt;can sign up here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJ5tDH"&gt;Of course, this isn’t just an easier way for retailers to get paid with cards customers have already stored in their Facebook profiles, it’s also a way to get even more data into Facebook. The announcement points to &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/11/privacy-matters-facebook-pay/"&gt;this privacy page&lt;/a&gt; for Facebook Pay, which clearly states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1Hb5wZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this impact data collection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmA7jD"&gt;As with previous payment options on our apps, when you make payments with Facebook Pay, we’ll collect information about the purchase such as the payment method, transaction date, billing, shipping and contact details. We designed Facebook Pay to securely store and encrypt your card and bank account numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6rATa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this impact the ads I see?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9B870"&gt;As with our other products, the actions you take with Facebook Pay can be used for purposes such as to deliver you more relevant content and ads, to provide customer support and to promote safety and integrity (e.g., to investigate violations of our payments policies). For example, if you buy a baseball glove on Facebook Marketplace, you might see an ad for a baseball bat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZmEUj"&gt;The card and bank account numbers you provide will not be used to personalize your experience or inform the ads you see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RUlD4g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elgato’s Facecam is a $200 webcam with streamer-friendly features </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elgato Facecam" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1RBo49i9O3G5ZujFDtA8C7AnAY8=/0x1:2594x1730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587297/facecamhero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Facecam includes a monitor mount, but you can also mount it to a tripod with its quarter-inch thread.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Elgato&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WwM7nL"&gt;Elgato has attempted to be the brand of choice for streamers and content creators who need gear to get started — even if it’s rarely the most affordable option. It makes its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18172438/elgato-key-light-display-streamers-youtube-ces-2019"&gt;LED lighting rig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/26/20886205/elgato-multi-mount-extendable-rigging-system-twitch-youtube-streamers-creators"&gt;multiple kinds of mounts&lt;/a&gt; for lights and mics, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22311223/elgato-light-strip-wifi-app-ios-android-sound-panels-stream-price"&gt;app-controlled adhesive light strips for your monitor or desk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22311223/elgato-light-strip-wifi-app-ios-android-sound-panels-stream-price"&gt;sound-dampening pads&lt;/a&gt; for podcasting, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314075/elgato-green-screen-mousepad-mat"&gt;a mouse pad that doubles as a green screen&lt;/a&gt;, and a lot more. Now, it has a $199.99 webcam to sell you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpuC3M"&gt;The Elgato Facecam is a 1080p webcam that can record at up to 60 frames per second. It has a Sony Starvis CMOS sensor, with an eight-element prime fixed focus lens with an f/2.4 aperture, 24mm full-frame equivalent focal length, and up to an 82-degree field of view. The company says it’s great for capturing detail while reducing noise in all sorts of lighting conditions, and the fixed focus is good if you don’t want a camera that’s constantly refocusing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZ8hXs"&gt;The webcam is meant to be an option for people who don’t have a high-end camera of their own to connect to something like Elgato’s (pricey) Cam Link HDMI-to-USB devices, which range from $129.99 to $359.99. The Facecam includes a low-profile monitor mount and can attach to it or a standard tripod with its quarter-inch thread.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Elgato Facecam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ag_S5iNMGhFplQdKW3s1OG71RbI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706315/facecam2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Elgato&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The monitor mount will encroach a bit on displays with very thin bezels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g6VrFX"&gt;An app called Camera Hub is available for Windows 10 and macOS, and in it, you can update the Facecam’s firmware and tweak the settings. This webcam has onboard storage that can save your specific white balance, contrast, zoom, and other settings, so it won’t need to be adjusted through the app again if you move to a different device. Elgato says the Facecam’s sensor is surrounded by a heatsink, which it says allows for “cool 24/7 operation” without overheating. Webcams &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;get a little toasty, so this will likely be a good feature to have if you run multi-hour streams, or if you’re someone gunning to overtake &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22362532/ludwig-twitch-subathon-ends-stream-ninja-subs-record"&gt;Twitch marathon streamer Ludwig’s 31-day stream record&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBin4k"&gt;What the Facecam offers might make it a good option for streamers who can afford its $200 price, or people like me who occasionally jump into a video meeting. I’ve been using a review model for the past week, and its auto-balancing features make me look presentable in my basement apartment dwelling — no small feat. I need to spend more time with it to really put it through the paces, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Elgato Facecam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4vq0H5cwVCmj-FYRr7VIW5EqQTo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706318/facecam3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Elgato&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Facecam connects via USB-C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MYXt8q"&gt;Despite the positive first impressions, it’s tough to ignore what the Facecam lacks compared to some similarly-priced competitors: the Facecam doesn’t have a microphone. Elgato omitted it because it figured most people have a preferred headset or dedicated microphone, which will almost definitely be the case for Elgato’s target audience. On the other hand, the Logitech StreamCam is a little cheaper at $170, has a microphone, and can also record at 1080p with 60 frames per second. It's smaller overall, and its Logitech Capture software can enable an auto-tracking feature that keeps you centered in the frame, which the Facecam currently doesn’t at launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEbXmJ"&gt;Logitech isn’t the only competitor in this price range. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295235/razer-kiyo-pro-webcam-review-adjustable-field-of-view-streaming-zoom-video-calls-price-features"&gt;Razer’s $199.99 Kiyo Pro offers 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22553857/dell-ultrasharp-4k-webcam-features-price-release-date"&gt;Dell’s new $199.99 UltraSharp webcam goes up to 4K resolution at 30 frames per second&lt;/a&gt;, though it doesn’t have a built-in microphone either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzVANA"&gt;The Elgato Facecam is available today for $199.99.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="lH6wtc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 15th, 4:55PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The Nintendo Switch OLED model is no longer available for preorder in either color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guw0Bh"&gt;After months of speculation and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346041/oled-nintendo-switch-dlss-nvidia-chip-report"&gt;sea of rumors&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;officially announced&lt;/a&gt; the next iteration of its popular gaming console: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt;. The upcoming device serves more as a midlife update than anything else, a refinement of the 2019 model as opposed to the more powerful “Switch Pro” that was rumored (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565469/nintendo-switch-pro-oled-timing-chip-shortages-cpu-nvidia-tegra"&gt;may still launch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKuikp"&gt;On sale for $350 starting October 8th, the aptly-titled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565307/nintendo-oled-switch-screen-news-updates"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt; is the next iteration of what has become one of the best-selling consoles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562530/nintendo-switch-lite-sales-october-2020"&gt;over the last two years&lt;/a&gt;. It’s outfitted with a 7-inch 720p OLED display, a new dock with a wired Ethernet port, and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand"&gt;improved kickstand&lt;/a&gt; that seems to take a cue directly from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablets&lt;/a&gt;. It also offers 64GB of built-in storage, up to nine hours of battery life — the same as the current Switch — and features “enhanced audio” for handheld or tabletop play. Sadly, despite persistent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;rumors of 4K support&lt;/a&gt;, the OLED model only supports 1080p resolution when docked. Apparently, Bluetooth support and an improved CPU will also have to wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6ASo1a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo confirms no new CPU or increased RAM in the OLED Switch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565118/nintendo-oled-switch-cpu-ram-bluetooth-audio-headphones-dock-no-4k"},{"title":"Nintendo Switch OLED hands-on: a small upgrade that makes a big difference ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="UyweAO"&gt;Still, the OLED model has plenty to get people excited, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564966/nintendo-switch-oled-display-ps5-xbox"&gt;including our own Alex Cranz&lt;/a&gt;. It plays all the same games, supports the original Joy-Cons, and ships with a sleek black-and-white finish reminiscent of next-gen consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S. It will also be available with the red and blue Joy-Cons, if you prefer the original model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HnhAvm"&gt;Where to buy the Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="L5vIbx"&gt;If you’re looking to get your hands on the OLED-equipped Switch at launch and get ahead of what might be yet another console shortage, you’re in luck. Right now, you can preorder the white iteration of the forthcoming console for $350 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746309011089526565" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/Ea9Yj9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Preorders began at 3 PM ET / 12 PM PT today, and will likely sell out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IVVBUk"&gt;If you’re more of a traditionalist, you can also preorder the red-and-blue model at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746309061747374347" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/Ry1DX2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, though neither configuration is expected to ship until the Nintendo Switch OLED model officially goes on sale on October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Anthony Bourdain documentary deepfakes his voice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VLfYaxjkr4lkpwAoPssgK3aFK58=/0x0:5279x3519/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587142/abpu_s11_newfoundalnd1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: CNN&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZBWBLx"&gt;In a new documentary, &lt;em&gt;Roadrunner, &lt;/em&gt;about the life and tragic death of Anthony Bourdain, there are a few lines of dialogue in Bourdain’s voice that he might not have ever said out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNo5No"&gt;Filmmaker Morgan Neville used AI technology to digitally re-create Anthony Bourdain’s voice and have the software synthesize the audio of three quotes from the late chef and television host, Neville &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/the-haunting-afterlife-of-anthony-bourdain"&gt;told the&lt;em&gt; New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b80fjO"&gt;The deepfaked voice was discovered when the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s Helen Rosner asked how the filmmaker got a clip of Bourdain’s voice reading an email he had sent to a friend. Neville said he had contacted an AI company and supplied it with a dozen hours of Bourdain speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rh72d1"&gt; “ ... and my life is sort of shit now. You are successful, and I am successful, and I’m wondering: Are you happy?” Bourdain wrote in an email, and an AI algorithm later narrated an approximation of his voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdF5yc"&gt;You can hear the line in the documentary’s trailer linked below, right around the 1:30 mark. The algorithm’s generation of Bourdain’s voice is especially audible when it says, “and I am successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WUPplf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihEEjwRlghQ?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=89&amp;amp;start=89" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0pRSR"&gt;Neville told Rosner that there were three lines of dialogue that he wanted Bourdain’s voice to orate, but he couldn’t find previous audio to string together or make it work otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8bJ8y"&gt;There’s no shortage of companies that can achieve this kind of AI voice replication, and there’s actually a burgeoning industry of companies that can specifically generate &lt;a href="https://replicastudios.com/"&gt;voices for video game characters&lt;/a&gt; or allow you to &lt;a href="https://www.descript.com/overdub?lyrebird=true"&gt;clone your own voice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xDxOl"&gt;But whether it’s ethical to clone a dead person’s voice and have them say things they hadn’t gotten on tape when they were alive is another question, and one Neville doesn’t seem too concerned with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rawzJQ"&gt;“We can have a documentary-ethics panel about it later,” he told the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
