    <title>Deathloop is an intricate mystery that also happens to be an amazing action game  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/stDMqCO5Hhhr5q9vWNRL88UGTVk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69850900/Deathloop_Map_of_Blackreef_863726099713bed9a51.13118819.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Hard to explain, easy to get lost in&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="27LVGS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is the first game to make me risk my life for an audiolog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLbyYN"&gt;It’s the latest release from Arkane Studios, a studio best known for helping keep the lineage of “immersive sims” alive through first-person action games like &lt;em&gt;Dishonored&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Prey&lt;/em&gt;. And &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; most certainly fits into that lineage, with its stealth-focused exploration, supernatural abilities, and open-ended gameplay that almost always gives you a handful of ways to tackle a problem. On a moment-to-moment basis it’s as tense, thrilling, and creative as any Arkane release should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWZvBg"&gt;That’s just the start with &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, though. What makes the game so interesting is its structure, which has players — in the role of an assassin named Colt — reliving the same day over and over again. (Between this, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630397/12-minutes-review-steam-xbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twelve Minutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I’m not sure what it is with game developers and time loops lately.) This conceit turns &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; into a game where investigation is as important as combat. You aren’t just fighting to survive, you’re doing it to learn new information that will help you unravel the strange and complex mystery at the heart of the game. It’s that mystery that will help pull you through the same day repeatedly, digging through dangerous locations in search of scraps of crucial information to hopefully make the next loop just a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vB9wa"&gt;I’ll do my best to summarize &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;’s premise, but it’s not easy. It starts when Colt wakes up on a beach of what turns out to be an island called Blackreef, which looks like a supervillain’s lair from the 1960s. Quickly he learns that Blackreef is run by a homicidal woman named Julianna and that its residents relive the same day in a loop. A few, like Julianna, keep their memories from loop to loop, and have decided that they want to keep things the way they are. Colt, naturally, does not, and decides he’s going to stop the loop once and for all. In order to do so, he needs to kill Julianna and seven “visionaries” from Blackreef. The twist is that he has to kill them all in a single day without dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="JFLY4O"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cLIgM8XX1X0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="69sThj"&gt;The ultimate goal in &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is basically one big puzzle you slowly piece together. Blackreef is an intricate island divided into four districts, and each day is split up into four time periods: morning, noon, afternoon, and evening. Over the course of the game you’ll explore each area, at different times of day, and steadily Blackreef will open up. Colt retains his memories after each loop, so as you discover shortcuts or passcodes for gated areas, that information sticks with you. Eventually I found myself knowing areas inside and out, able to stealthily make my way through the quickest paths; it’s a very satisfying kind of mastery. The end goal of all of this information-gathering is to learn as much as you can about the island and its visionaries so that you can figure out how to kill them all within the constraints of a single day. Information is, as they say, power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DRRwRB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s one big puzzle you slowly piece together&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lkZXX6"&gt;This probably sounds pretty confusing, and it is, but the game does an incredible job of easing you along so you don’t get overwhelmed. The main menu is basically an evidence board that lets you track all of the information for each visionary, so that you’re tackling everything in a series of small steps. Likewise, the game is divided into relatively bite-sized chunks, as you explore areas over specific time periods like morning or evening, almost always with a specific goal in mind. Sometimes that could be as big as killing a boss. Other times it just means finding a way into a locked apartment in search of a passcode. Put simply: while the overarching goal is huge and complicated, the steps to get there are clear and direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5eW5g"&gt;It’s also important to note that, despite the time looping premise, &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a roguelike with randomized levels like &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496904/hades-supergiant-games-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; each area changes depending on the time of day, but otherwise it’s the same each time you visit. And while initially Colt can’t bring weapons or skills with him from one loop to the next, that changes when you’re able to harvest a material to infuse items so that they’ll carry over. This “residual energy” is called, obviously, residuum. This lets you steadily build out an arsenal over time, and grow more powerful by collecting “slabs” from downed visionaries that grant supernatural abilities like invisibility or teleportation. (The structure is almost like a modern day &lt;em&gt;Mega Man&lt;/em&gt;, with bosses that grant game-changing powers when you beat them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pm5qy9"&gt;The game &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be repetitive at times. In one mission early on, for instance, I had to start up the same set of generators on three different days, in order to divert power to different areas of the island. For the most part, though, I was constantly doing different things. Missions involved everything from decrypting pictograms to infiltrating a masked ball. I also found that when I did have to revisit areas or scenarios, I usually either knew a shortcut to breeze past it or by that point was much more powerful, making it easier to take down whatever enemies I might need to kill. It’s also a very open game. With seven visionaries to kill and a big island to explore, there’s pretty much always something else to do if you get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZjB3M0OQlYNR5FO3gatAoOVsydE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22846279/Deathloop_Shift_8637261279a70e6e756.01266203.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zPU6Fx"&gt;That I’ve gone this far without even talking about the shooting should tell you something: &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;’s central mystery is such a fun and satisfying thing to pull apart and solve that it almost overshadows the action. That said, the action &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; amazing. This is clearly an Arkane game, which means it’s less a straight shooter, and more a game where you sneak into dangerous places and use a combination of stealth, creativity, and luck to kill everybody. I barely even used guns, instead relying primarily on my arsenal of superpowers and, more than anything else, a machete for quiet takedowns. (Kills in &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; are extremely gory, with lots of decapitated heads and needlessly large splashes of blood.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xi5oWr"&gt;But, in true Arkane fashion, there always seemed to be multiple ways to tackle a problem, whether it was a different combat technique or a hidden passageway that sidestepped violence altogether. I should also note that on the PS5 the game makes great use of the DualSense controller, so combat really does feel better, thanks to realistic vibrations and different trigger tension depending on your weapon. The controller’s speaker, in particular, is put to good use, with Julianna constantly pestering you with messages over a walkie talkie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wdMCrR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There always seemed to be multiple ways to tackle a problem&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0u0pT"&gt;I really only have a few small nitpicks with &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, and they mostly have to do with some artificial techniques the game uses to create tension. The first has to do with saves. Despite being a primarily single-player experience, you can’t save &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; mid-mission; instead, the game only saves when Colt leaves an area. Many of the missions are short, so it’s not always a problem, but some can drag on quite a bit, particularly when it comes to finally taking down the visionaries. It’s really frustrating to not be able to take a pause when real life interferes with playing the game. Likewise, &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; has an interesting take on multiplayer. While the story puts you in the role of Colt, you can also play as Julianna and wreak havoc on another player’s game. It’s a cool concept, but I mostly just found it annoying to be on a good run and have someone jump in and kill me in the middle of a carefully planned mission. It’s also unavoidable; if you aren’t playing online, an AI-powered Julianna will pop in on occasion instead. In my pre-launch experience, this always seemed to happen at the worst possible moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdFk2T"&gt;The most remarkable thing about &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is how all of its elements — the intricate, stylish world of Blackreef; action that encourages experimentation; a mystery dense with ideas and surprises; the entertainingly hostile relationship between Colt and Julianna — fit together so seamlessly. You could spend the morning tip-toeing around guards to find a password hidden in a desk, which helps you steal a sniper rifle in the afternoon, which you then use to take down a boss in the evening. And right after, Julianna is going to call you on a walkie for a charmingly expletive-laced tirade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Vf8rPT"&gt;Each of those elements feels not only cohesive, but necessary. In most games, audiologs are throwaway lore meant for the most hardcore fans. Here they can be the difference between success and failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IiXkA"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Deathloop&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launches September 14th on the PS5 and PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mozilla has defeated Microsoft’s default browser protections in Windows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eB1YMygh_06LyekrJ1bRao5-Rxo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69850817/acastro_200207_3900_firefox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rNf13a"&gt;Mozilla has quietly made it easier to switch to Firefox on Windows recently. While Microsoft offers a method to switch default browsers on Windows 10, it’s more cumbersome than the simple one-click process to switch to Edge. This one-click process isn’t officially available for anyone other than Microsoft, and Mozilla appears to have grown tired of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPp4AR"&gt;In version 91 of Firefox, released on August 10th, Mozilla has reverse engineered the way Microsoft sets Edge as default in Windows 10, and enabled Firefox to quickly make itself the default. Before this change, Firefox users would be sent to the Settings part of Windows 10 to then have to select Firefox as a default browser and ignore Microsoft’s plea to keep Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEe9w0"&gt;Mozilla’s reverse engineering means you can now set Firefox as the default from within the browser, and it does all the work in the background with no additional prompts. This circumvents Microsoft’s anti-hijacking protections that the company built into Windows 10 to ensure malware couldn’t hijack default apps. Microsoft tells us this is not supported in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0BQwEzaE5oKefBcIRcLyaXqaqdU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22846262/firefoxdefaults.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefox now makes it easy to switch default browsers in Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7fs018"&gt;Mozilla has clearly grown tired of the more complicated way of setting up a default browser, a process that Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"&gt;making even harder in Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. “People should have the ability to simply and easily set defaults, but they don’t,” says a Mozilla spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “All operating systems should offer official developer support for default status so people can easily set their apps as default. Since that hasn’t happened on Windows 10 and 11, Firefox relies on other aspects of the Windows environment to give people an experience similar to what Windows provides to Edge when users choose Firefox to be their default browser.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fk86j"&gt;Mozilla has been trying to convince Microsoft to improve its default browser settings in Windows since its &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/an-open-letter-to-microsofts-ceo-dont-roll-back-the-clock-on-choice-and-control/"&gt;open letter to Microsoft in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing has changed, and Windows 11 is now making it even harder to switch default browsers. That appears to be the final straw, as Mozilla began implementing its changes in Firefox shortly after the Windows 11 unveiling in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aeQEyt"&gt;So far, Google, Vivaldi, Opera, and other Chromium-based browsers haven’t followed Mozilla’s lead, and it’s not clear exactly how Microsoft will respond. Microsoft has some genuine security-related reasons to protect against malware with anti-hijacking, but by allowing Edge to easily switch defaults it undermines rival browser vendors that simply want a level playing field. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"&gt;Windows 11 makes that playing field even more complicated&lt;/a&gt;, and competitors aren’t happy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Revolt of the delivery workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/flKHzgvqy1cP1wirFu1n6mqFfGM=/0x84:1359x990/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69850802/1921COV_MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 1, 6:30 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Anthony Chavez makes dinner deliveries during Hurricane Ida.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Exploited by apps. Attacked by thieves. Unprotected by police. The city’s 65,000 bikers have only themselves to count on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="UMAfkY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is a collaboration between &lt;/em&gt;New York&lt;em&gt; Magazine and The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/article/los-repartidores-nyc.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lea el reportaje en español aquí.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="NhJxKj"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PwAGJd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Willis Avenue Bridge,&lt;/strong&gt; a 3,000-foot stretch of asphalt and beige-painted steel connecting Manhattan and the Bronx, is the perfect place for an ambush. The narrow bike path along its west side is poorly lit; darkened trash-strewn alcoves on either end are useful for lying in wait. All summer, food-delivery workers returning home after their shifts have been violently attacked there for their bikes: by gunmen pulling up on motorcycles, by knife-wielding thieves leaping from the recesses, by muggers blocking the path with Citi Bikes and brandishing broken bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgwSyX"&gt;“Once you go onto that bridge, it’s another world,” one frequent crosser said. “You ever see wildlife with the wildebeest trying to cross with the crocodiles? That’s the crocodiles over there. We’re the wildebeests just trying to get by.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqfDZW"&gt;Lately, delivery workers have found safety in numbers. On a humid July night, his last dinner orders complete, Cesar Solano, a lanky and serious 19-year-old from Guerrero, Mexico, rode his heavy electric bike onto the sidewalk at 125th Street and First Avenue and dismounted beneath an overpass. Across the street, through a lattice of on-ramps and off-ramps, was the entrance to the Willis, which threads under the exit of the RFK Bridge and over the Harlem River Drive before shooting out across the Harlem River. Whatever happens on the bridge is blocked from view by the highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnLAgH"&gt;Several other workers had already arrived. The headlights of their parked bikes provided the only illumination. Cesar watched, his arms crossed, as his older cousin Sergio Solano and another worker strung a banner between the traffic light and a signpost on the corner. It read WE ARE ON GUARD TO PROTECT OUR DELIVERY WORKERS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sZrwZ"&gt;Sergio walked back beneath the overpass, took up his megaphone, and whooped the siren, signaling to workers riding up First Avenue to wait and form a group before crossing. When five assembled, he announced the next departure for the Bronx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bh547qLqPRQBMjnoNvcaRr3rBhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840800/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;August 31, 8:45 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Juan Solano makes deliveries in midtown during the dinner rush.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D7Box9"&gt;Cesar, Sergio, and three other members of their family, all of whom work delivering food, had been standing watch each night for nearly a month. They live together nearby and heard about the attacks through the Facebook page they co-founded called El Diario de los Deliveryboys en la Gran Manzana, or “The Deliveryboys in the Big Apple Daily.” They started it in part to chronicle the bike thefts that have been plaguing workers on the bridge and elsewhere across the city. Sergio himself lost two bikes in two months. He reported both to the police, but the cases went nowhere, an experience common enough that many workers have concluded calling 911 is a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWoN8E"&gt;Losing a bike is devastating for a delivery worker, obliterating several weeks’ worth of wages as well as the tool they need to earn those wages. “It’s my colleague,” Cesar said in Spanish through an interpreter. “It’s what takes me to work; it’s who I work with and what takes me home.” He’s customized his with dark-blue tape covering its frame, blue spokes, and color-changing LED light strips on its rear rack. Two Mexican flags fly from his front fork. He also attached a second battery since the main one lasts only seven hours, and he rides fast and for every app he can, typically working from breakfast to dinner. He maintains his bike with the help of a traveling mechanic known only as Su, who broadcasts his GPS location as he roams upper Manhattan. Recently, Cesar added a holster to his top bar for his five-pound steel U-lock so he can quickly draw it to defend himself in case of attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="davm3p"&gt;Even before the thefts started, the city’s 65,000 delivery workers had tolerated so much: the fluctuating pay, the lengthening routes, the relentless time pressure enforced by mercurial software, the deadly carelessness of drivers, the pouring rain and brutal heat, and the indignity of pissing behind a dumpster because the restaurant that depends on you refuses to let you use its restroom. And every day there were the trivially small items people ordered and the paltry tips they gave — all while calling you a hero and avoiding eye contact. Cesar recently biked from 77th on the Upper East Side 18 blocks south and over the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge, then up through Long Island City and over another bridge to Roosevelt Island, all to deliver a single slice of cake for no tip at all. And now he had to worry about losing his bike, purchased with savings on his birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O3lAwjYvUCt6bf3jORBeBGItntY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840810/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_015.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;September 1, 6:20 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Anthony Chavez delivers an ice cream during Hurricane Ida.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9iN0Bm"&gt;For Cesar and many other delivery workers, the thefts broke something loose. Some started protesting and lobbying, partnering with nonprofits and city officials to propose legislation. Cesar and the Deliveryboys took another tack, forming a civil guard reminiscent of the one that patrolled San Juan Puerto Montaña, the small, mostly Indigenous Me’phaa village where they are from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHcA3R"&gt;That night, the space under the RFK overpass was a makeshift but welcoming way station. Aluminum catering trays of tacos and beans were arrayed beneath the trusses of the bridge. Arrivals never went long before being offered a plate and a Fanta. The parked bikes flashed festively. Some workers lingered only long enough for a quick fist bump before forming a convoy and departing. But a rotating crew of around a dozen stayed and chatted — sharing stories about who got in an accident and how they’re doing, how orders had slowed lately. Cesar, who hopes to be a video editor, livestreamed his nightly broadcast to the Deliveryboys page. It was something between a news bulletin and a pledge drive, with Cesar interviewing workers, thanking people for donating food, and shouting out to his viewers, who number in the thousands and tune in from Staten Island to their hometown in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXjZqg"&gt;Just before 1 a.m., a delivery worker rode up, his right arm bleeding. People rushed to him. The worker had been waiting, he explained, at a red light on 110th when someone leaped in front of him with a knife and demanded his bike. The worker accelerated but was slashed on the arm as he fled. Soon, a police cruiser arrived and later an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vavvq1"&gt;The worker, his blood pooling on the street, at first refused to be taken to the hospital. But the Deliveryboys convinced him to go. Sergio and Cesar shared their phone numbers and took his bike home when they left around 2 a.m. He retrieved it the next day before the Deliveryboys began their watch again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DS4GpL"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Uvcy7M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For years,&lt;/strong&gt; delivery workers in New York have improvised solutions like the bridge patrol to make their jobs feasible. These methods have been remarkably successful, undergirding the illusion of limitless and frictionless delivery. But every hack that made their working conditions tolerable only encouraged the apps and restaurants to ask more of them, until the job evolved into something uniquely intense, dangerous, and precarious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrpEUL"&gt;Take the electric bike. When e-bikes first arrived in the city in the late 2000s, they were ridden mostly by older Chinese immigrants who used them to stay in the job as they aged, according to Do Lee, a Queens College professor who wrote his dissertation on delivery workers. But once restaurant owners and executives at companies like Uber, DoorDash, and Grubhub-Seamless figured out it was possible to do more and faster deliveries, they adjusted their expectations, and e-bikes became a de facto job requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDey6o"&gt;Today, delivery workers have an overwhelmingly preferred brand: the Arrow, essentially a rugged battery-powered mountain bike that tops out at around 28 miles per hour. A new Arrow runs $1,800 and can easily exceed $2,500 once it’s equipped with phone-charging mounts, lights, second batteries, air horns, racks, mud flaps, and other essential upgrades. What began as a technological assist has become a major start-up investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoM4RF"&gt;Delivery workers now move faster than just about anything else in the city. They keep pace with cars and weave between them when traffic slows, ever vigilant for opening taxi doors and merging trucks. They know they go too fast, any worker will say, but it’s a calculated risk. Slowing down means being punished by the apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsiQwt"&gt;A few days after the Deliveryboys began their Willis guard, I met Anthony Chavez in front of a sleek glass apartment building near Lincoln Center. Chavez is something of an influencer among delivery workers, though his fame was inadvertent and the 26-year-old is too reserved to fully embrace the role. Wanting to share the tricks and texture of New York delivery, he started filming his work in late 2019 and posting the videos to a Facebook page he started called Chapín en Dos Ruedas, meaning “Guatemalan on Two Wheels.” Later, his posts about bike thefts would expand his audience to more than 12,000, but at first it was mostly just the six other Guatemalan delivery workers he lives with in the Bronx. Long stretches of his videos pass with little dialogue, just the background whine of his bike and the Dopplering traffic punctuated occasionally by his advice: Always wear a helmet, only listen to music with one earbud, avoid running red lights, and, if you must, really look both ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nmd-dH_H3BZp8LNg4zQgpm1j7QQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840801/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;August 25, 4:30 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Between the lunch and dinner shifts, delivery workers rest at an underground garage that serves as a makeshift break room.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AEvLtx"&gt;For about half his week, Chavez works at a rotisserie-chicken spot in midtown. He likes it there; the delivery radius is a bit over a mile, and the kitchen is good at batching orders. The restaurant pays him even when an accident takes him out of commission. He doesn’t even need his Arrow. Instead, he rides his pedal-powered Cannondale. An enthusiastic cyclist who rode BMXs back home and wears a small gold bike on his necklace, he likes cycling best about the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZvT3h"&gt;This used to be how delivery worked across the city. A restaurant that made delivery-friendly food like pizza or Chinese employed people to take it to customers in the neighborhood. Managers could be cruel, and owners frequently exploited a worker’s immigration status with illegally low wages, but the restaurant also provided shelter, restrooms, and often free meals and a place to eat them alongside co-workers. Unfortunately for Chavez, the chicken spot never has enough hours, so the rest of the time, he works for the apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzOCVw"&gt;Before the apps, sites like Seamless and Grubhub simply listed restaurants that already offered delivery. But DoorDash, Postmates, and the other apps that arrived in the mid-2010s had their own delivery workers, armies of contractors directed by software on their phones. If a restaurant didn’t offer delivery or was too far away, the app just sent a gig worker to order takeout and bring it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMB790"&gt;The main reason restaurants weren’t already letting you order a single bacon, egg, and cheese from 50 blocks away for almost no charge is that it’s a terrible business model. Expensive, wasteful, labor intensive — you would lose money on every order. The apps promised to solve this problem through algorithmic optimization and scale. This has yet to happen — none of the companies are consistently profitable — but for a while they solved the problem with money. Armed with billions in venture capital, the apps subsidized what had been a low-margin side gig of the restaurant industry until it resembled any other Silicon Valley consumer-gratification machine. Seamless, which merged with Grubhub and added its own gig platform to compete, was particularly direct in its pitch, running cutesy subway ads about ordering delivery with zero human contact and requesting miniature entrées for your hamster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ChCmly"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They obey the bespoke instructions that pop up on their screens:  Don’t wait outside Benny’s Burritos, don’t ask to use the restroom, be “super nice!” to Dig Inn because it is a “VIP  client” — or have your account suspended.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y0yhC2"&gt;The apps failed and bought each other, and now three giants remain: DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Grubhub-Seamless. Each divides the New York market more or less equally, and each uses the piecework model pioneered by Uber itself. Workers get paid when they accept and complete a delivery, and a gamelike system of rewards and penalties keeps them moving: high scores for being on time, low scores and fewer orders for tardiness, and so on. Chavez and others call it the &lt;em&gt;patrón fantasma,&lt;/em&gt; the phantom boss — always watching and quick to punish you for being late but nowhere to be found when you need $10 to fix your bike or when you get doored and have to go to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpfSCb"&gt;Then there is a fourth app, which Chavez and thousands of others work for but few customers have heard of, called Relay Delivery. It’s a privately held company founded in 2014 and mostly limited to New York. The best way to understand Relay is to think of most delivery apps as two different businesses: the lucrative digital one that customers order from and that charges restaurants commission and advertising fees, and the labor-intensive, logistically complicated — “crummy,” in the words of Grubhub’s founder — business of getting the food to the customer. Relay handles just the second one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EPPkn2"&gt;Restaurants can outsource all their delivery to Relay, no matter if the customer ordered on Seamless or DoorDash or called direct. When the food is ready, the restaurant uses the Relay app to summon a worker who is supposed to appear in under five minutes. It’s often cheaper for restaurants than the other apps, and it’s extremely reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1LaHY"&gt;This is in part because the rewards Relay offers workers are greater and its penalties more severe. Rather than piecework, it pays $12.50 per hour plus tips. But unlike Uber and DoorDash, workers can deliver food only if they’re scheduled, and the schedule is designed through daily zero-sum competition, with the best-rated workers getting first dibs. If you get an early enough sign-up time to grab the Upper West Side from 5 to 9 p.m., you can rest easy knowing you’ll have a decently paying job tomorrow. But if you rejected a delivery, or went too slow, or weren’t in your designated zone the second your shift started (even if that was because you were delivering a Relay order from your prior shift), or committed any other mysterious infraction, your sign-up time moves back 20 minutes. Maybe all that’s left is Hoboken from 2 to 4 p.m. Worse, maybe there’s nothing and you’re relegated to &lt;em&gt;picoteo, &lt;/em&gt;or “pecking.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JtSngIiXP1dhbiuRP2Eu8coSpuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840806/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;August 30, 5 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Anthony Chavez with the batteries for the electric bikes that must be changed every six hours. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EWUOly"&gt;You see them around the city, sitting on benches jabbing their screens, refreshing the schedule on the off chance some unlucky colleague had to cancel. It’s a fate terrifying enough that when one worker hit a storm drain, flew from his bike, and suffered a concussion so severe he was passing in and out of consciousness and had to be taken to the hospital, he still made sure to have a friend message the company explaining why he wasn’t accepting orders. Later, trying to get his score up, he volunteered to work during Hurricane Ida, wrecked his bike, and got bumped from the schedule entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BQDba"&gt;So while DoorDash and Uber workers have some leeway to pick which deliveries they take, as a practical matter, Relay workers accept every order assigned to them. They obey the bespoke instructions that pop up on their screens: Don’t wait outside Benny’s Burritos, don’t ask to use the restroom, be “super nice!” to Dig Inn because it is a “VIP client” — or have your account suspended. Above all, they try to maintain the ideal pace of a delivery every 15 minutes, no matter the delivery distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LO9cQT"&gt;If these sound more like the demands placed on an actual employee as opposed to an ostensibly free independent contractor, many class-action plaintiffs have agreed. The company has been sued multiple times for worker misclassification, tip theft, and other infractions. It settled three times, avoiding a ruling that could torpedo its business model, and another case is currently in arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTIC8G"&gt;A spokesperson said the company has implemented a fix to prevent restaurants from unilaterally expanding their delivery zones, but it currently only works for new entrants to the platform. The tip theft that workers often complain of occurs when restaurants receive an order, then enter the wrong tip information into the Relay app, the spokesperson said, and the company has added a way for workers to dispute this. As for the intense pressure, the company said that it matches the number of riders each day with anticipated demand but that there is a large backlog of people who want to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQ5pm7"&gt;That’s true. Many would rather work for a restaurant, but when forced to pick among the apps, Chavez, Cesar, and others choose Relay, which they say pays better and more consistently than its piecework peers. It is, after all, the closest among them to a traditional job. But all the apps have this in common: The physical practicalities of maintaining the modern buffet of speedy delivery options fall to the workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="0oXONW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgmC-OWnk_M?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ICCsYj"&gt;I followed Chavez down the ramp of the glass tower’s parking garage and around the corner to where delivery workers have set up a subterranean base. Electric bikes were parked in front of plywood shelving crammed with charging batteries, their lights blinking red and green. Under the garage ramp, five workers sat on a pipe eating lunch beneath a harsh fluorescent light, clothes hung to dry on another pipe above their heads. About a dozen people sat on folding chairs around a long table, eating from Styrofoam takeout trays and playing with their phones. Others napped in the carriages of bike rickshaws draped with plastic flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTTFfv"&gt;Garages like these are scattered across the city, a solution worked out to replace some of the necessities once supplied by restaurants. Another option for shelter, particularly in the winter, is to get a Chase debit card and take refuge in the lobbies of the bank’s ubiquitous branches, warming yourself with a coffee before you’re told to move on. But the coffee raises another pressing question: where to find a restroom. The garage solves both problems and others, like bike storage and battery charging. Now, instead of shift meals during the predinner lull, workers take turns ordering delivery and eat underground. (They always tip well.) Chavez pays $120 a month for his spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DX0yc"&gt;Every adaptation has a cost, the Arrow being by far the largest. The appeal of the Arrow is the network of shops that sell it. They sell only Arrows, and if you have one, they will do simple repairs for cheap or free. The shops also charge second batteries for a monthly fee. The city’s pocked streets are rough on the bikes, and each evening just before the dinner rush, delivery workers wait outside Arrow stores as mechanics strip and rewire water-damaged controllers and replace bald tires with the fluid focus of a NASCAR pit crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WSHLmo"&gt;Bikes, cold-weather gear, garages, maintenance: The costs add up. Workers even pay for their own app-branded cooler bags. So while DoorDash claims Manhattan workers make $33 per hour, including tips, when you factor in expenses, delivery workers have a base pay of $7.87 per hour, according to a recent study of app-based workers conducted by the Cornell Worker Institute and the Worker’s Justice Project. Neither estimate includes time spent waiting between deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yQkA2TlX4gaL98hPPhjDF4Oiirc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840799/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;August 27, 6 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; At a garage on the West Side of Manhattan, bikers charge batteries for their electric bikes ahead of the dinner shift.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QeJhMv"&gt;Workers developed the whole system — the bikes, repair networks, shelters, charging stations — because they had to. To the apps, they are independent contractors; to restaurants, they are emissaries of the apps; to customers, they represent the restaurants. In reality, the workers are on their own, often without even the minimum in government support. As contractors and, often, undocumented immigrants, they have few protections and virtually no safety net. The few times city authorities noted the delivery worker’s changing role, it was typically with confused hostility. Until recently, throttle-powered electric bikes like the Arrow were illegal to ride, though not to own. Mayor de Blasio heightened enforcement in 2017, calling the bikes “a real danger” after an Upper West Side investment banker clocked workers with a speed gun and complained to him on &lt;em&gt;The Brian Lehrer Show&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqstNx"&gt;The NYPD set up checkpoints, fining riders $500, seizing their bikes, and posting photos of the busts on Twitter. The police would then return the bikes because, again, they were legal to own. It was a costly and bewildering ritual. For years, bike activists and workers pushed for legalization, though the apps that benefited from them were largely silent. It was only when another group of tech companies — hoping to make scooter-sharing legal — joined the fight that a bill moved forward in Albany. Then the pandemic hit, restaurants were restricted to takeout, and the mayor had to acknowledge that the bikes were an essential part of the city’s delivery infrastructure. He halted enforcement. The bikes were officially legalized three months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4iu4a0"&gt;Maybe it was legalization that triggered the robberies. Maybe it was the pandemic-emptied streets. Maybe it was all the people out of work who needed money, or all the other people out of work who were enlisting to serve the newly formed Zoom class and suddenly needed e-bikes. Everyone has a theory. But what happened next is a familiar story. The workers turned to the city for help, got none, and started figuring out a solution themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="pCw5wl"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rwYWaj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chavez has no history&lt;/strong&gt; of activism and no interest in being a leader. Those things take time, and he came to the city with a plan: work hard for five years and save enough money to buy a house in Guatemala City. Many workers treat the job like a dangerous but temporary trial they hope will give them a shot at pulling themselves out of poverty back home. Cesar has a plan too: work until he can buy a house for his parents and himself, then return. Things don’t always go according to plan. You meet someone here and start a family. You discover that all the money you thought you were saving has gone to bikes and food and rent. The city becomes familiar. Years go by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJuhhW"&gt;That was the case for Eliseo Tohom, Chavez’s 36-year-old roommate. He’s been working delivery for 14 years. Chavez teases him on his livestreams. “That Eliseo is well known around these streets,” he said when Tohom chimed in on the chat. “Single ladies, delivery worker Eliseo is looking for a girl to take back to Guatemala.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aqkzb"&gt;Last October, the two were eating pizza in Central Park and talking about the robberies. A fellow garage member, 17 years old, had been unlocking his bike after depositing a dinner on Riverside Drive when two men tackled him from behind. A third grabbed his bike and rode off as the other assailants leaped into a waiting car.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LpwG0Wn5x5v5McZXvIObDKZ521o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840802/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;August 27, 6 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Anthony Chavez preparing to head out for the dinner shift.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o2aHPW"&gt;It was the second such attack to befall a garage member and one of countless they had heard about. According to NYPD data, robberies and attempted robberies of delivery workers increased 65 percent in 2020, to 332, and are on track to exceed that number this year. But those are only the small fraction of cases that are reported to the police. Workers say officers often discouraged them from filing reports and showed so little progress solving the thefts they did report that many stopped bothering to do so. In contrast to the NYPD’s numbers, the Worker’s Justice Project’s survey found that 54 percent of the city’s delivery workers have had their bikes stolen. About 30 percent of those thefts were violent. The group said it receives approximately 50 reports of thefts and robberies a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIjSyo"&gt;Tohom had put together a pool to buy the kid a new bike, but he wanted to do more. He proposed going to the local precinct, maybe with a dozen or so people from their garage and another group in midtown, and asking the police to do something. Chavez posted the announcement on Chapín.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSfvQf"&gt;About 30 people showed up to the park at 72nd and Amsterdam and rode honking to the precinct. There, they blocked the street, shouting “No more robberies!” to nonplussed cops. Eventually, a Spanish-speaking officer came out. Tohom stepped forward and listed robbery after robbery — Monday at 150 Central Park, yesterday at 100th, another at 67th, knives, guns, machetes, thefts they reported months ago and received no response about, bikes stolen with GPS that police refused to pursue — as the crowd yelled “Help us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Z8dSp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bikes, maintenance, shelters, charging stations, cooler bags — when you factor those in, delivery workers take home a base pay of $7.87 per hour.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xggwp7"&gt;Chavez posted a video of the scene, and it ricocheted through New York’s delivery community. Overnight, he gained 1,000 followers. The next day, a representative got in touch from the Worker’s Justice Project, which had previously supported construction workers and domestic laborers and had started organizing delivery workers during the pandemic. WJP helped file the paperwork for a more formal rally the following week. Again, Chavez announced it on his Facebook page. This time, hundreds showed up. Chavez livestreamed as the armada rode honking down Broadway, flags waving from their bikes, to City Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FhYxcW"&gt;It was the first time so many delivery workers had gathered in one place, and it sparked an explosion of new groups. It was there that Cesar met Chavez. Soon after, he and his cousins and uncles launched the Deliveryboys page. Like Chavez’s page, it soon became a hub for theft alerts, but it was also a place to memorialize slain and injured workers. When the DoorDash worker Francisco Villalva Vitinio was shot and killed for his bike in March, the Deliveryboys posted videos of vigils in New York and of Villalva Vitinio’s casket being carried down the streets of his hometown in Guerrero, Mexico. Later they broadcast live from the precinct on the day the suspect was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02kE2z"&gt;Small cadres of workers had already begun forming groups on WhatsApp and Telegram to share information and protect one another. But now they built more formal and larger versions with names like Delivery Worker Alerts, Emergency Group, and Robbery Alerts in the Big Apple. At the protest, workers scanned QR codes on one another’s phones to join. Approximate territories took shape, with groups for the Upper West Side, Astoria, and lower Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tkqwD"&gt;“There are thousands of delivery workers on the streets, and if we are all connected, we can see the thieves and act ourselves,” Chavez later told his viewers as he rode. Join a group, he said. Buy a GPS and hide it on your bike; that way, when it gets stolen, you can track it down and call on your fellow workers for help. If the police wouldn’t get their bikes back, maybe they could do it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="h3O3EI"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Yu94h7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was Gustavo Ajche,&lt;/strong&gt; a 38-year-old construction worker and part-time DoorDasher, who contacted Chavez’s group after the impromptu precinct rally and helped get permits for the larger one. Even then, he was pushing the group to think bigger. Chavez and Tohom wanted to march to Columbus Circle; Ajche said the thefts were affecting everyone, so they should march all the way to City Hall. He also wanted them to think beyond the robberies, to regulations and durable improvements to working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnYD4D"&gt;I met Ajche at 60 Wall Street, a gaudy ’80s atrium decorated with palm trees and columns that is a frequent hangout for delivery workers in the Financial District. The nearby parking garage where Ajche stores his bike isn’t as nice as Chavez’s, he explained, on account of leaks and rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bYf6z"&gt;There were about a dozen Arrows parked outside, all with stickers bearing the red-and-black fist-raised deliveryman logo of Los Deliveristas Unidos, an arm of the Worker’s Justice Project that Ajche helped start. An animated speaker with an open face, Ajche is an effective organizer, and he’s eager to grow the movement. Taking out his phone, he showed me a new Deliveristas logo written in Bengali — part of the group’s effort to expand beyond Spanish-speaking workers. He would soon make versions in Mandarin and French. I noted the green gear-eyed skull logo on the back of his phone case, the symbol of Aztecas en dos Ruedas (“Aztecs on Two Wheels”), a fixie-riding, alley-cat-racing club of delivery workers. “They are my friends; they are with us,” he said by way of explanation. A worker, still helmeted, pushed through the turnstile door and waved to Ajche before joining a group seated on the other side of the hall — Ajche’s friends too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyhmSn"&gt;After the success of the October march, the Deliveristas planned an even larger rally for April. This time, thousands gathered and rode honking to City Hall, where they were joined by representatives from SEIU 32BJ, the powerful union that backed the Fight for $15. City Councilmember Brad Lander, then running for city comptroller, and State Senator Jessica Ramos spoke. Later, the City Council introduced a package of bills crafted in discussion with the Deliveristas that would establish minimum pay and give workers more control over their routes, among other changes (it will likely be voted on this month). In June, the Deliveristas helped kill a bill pushed by Uber and Lyft that would have allowed gig workers to unionize while falling short of offering them full employment rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NLnZ_uaCtc9SpxXVPmMmjcO9Qto=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840804/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;August 27, 9:20 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Delivery workers store their bikes at a garage overnight and prepare to take the subway home.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pt9A4r"&gt;Some of the apps also began discussions with the Deliveristas. DoorDash announced that nearly 200 (out of 18,000) of its restaurants would let delivery workers use their restrooms and that the company is working on an emergency-assistance button for its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7USgrR"&gt;Ajche is far from appeased. He recalled a Zoom meeting in which DoorDash put forward a “top Dasher” to tell them how great working for DoorDash was. Ajche silenced him by saying that he can bring 500 people with complaints. “They are afraid of us,” he said. “They think we are trying to unionize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpOOHr"&gt;Later in June, around the time when Cesar and the Deliveryboys were beginning their watch at the Willis Avenue Bridge, Ajche and other Deliveristas met with the NYPD chief of department, Rodney Harrison, who agreed to appoint an officer to act as a liaison with the workers and to increase security on the bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbJNzD"&gt;Progress is slow. The NYPD said it encourages people to register their bikes with the department and to call 911 if their bike is stolen. But the department is a sprawling organization with tremendous inertia and little understanding of what modern delivery work entails. “What we’ve been doing is conquering precinct by precinct,” said Hildalyn Colón Hernández, whom the WJP brought on to handle police relations and policy. Colón Hernández, who previously worked on a construction-fraud task force in the Manhattan DA’s office, recalled a recent exchange in which she was pushing an officer to investigate a stolen bike and he said, essentially, “What’s the big deal? It’s just a bike.” Colón Hernández launched into an explanation: First off, it’s their tool; they lose that tool, they don’t work tomorrow. Second, it probably cost around $3,000. “That patrol officer looked at me very differently,” she said. “They were like, ‘Wait a minute. This is a grand larceny?’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r68GZw"&gt;She has been having conversations like that across the city’s bureaucracy. Take the Willis Avenue Bridge. First, she had to talk to the precincts on either side of the bridge because the city splits jurisdiction down the middle. Then came the cameras, which workers complained were broken, because despite the NYPD sign saying the bridge was under 24-hour surveillance, whenever they went to the police asking for footage of their assaults, they were told none existed. But the cameras worked just fine; it’s just that they were pointed at the cars, not the bike path. To change that, Colón Hernández will need to track down someone in the Department of Transportation and explain why it’s urgently important that they shift the traffic cameras on a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2YkBRB"&gt;Chavez and the Deliveryboys rarely attend these meetings. They stress their independence and express skepticism that anyone — police, city officials, sometimes even the Deliveristas — will ever help them. Chavez sees himself as just a guy with a Facebook page. Juan Solano, Cesar’s uncle and the most outspoken of the Deliveryboys, sees a distinction between “politics,” which are futile, and what they are doing, which is “organizing our people” to help themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3e0Xw5"&gt;Ajche understands the wariness. “In our countries, organizations show up, promise to do stuff, and never deliver,” he said. It’s not like they’ve gotten much help from institutions here, either. Yet he is palpably frustrated at the resistance. “A change of mind would be good for them. They have potential; they’ve done things. But they reached a point where they can’t do much more since they’re not in touch with politicians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBz2Wl"&gt;Ajche pointed out that earlier this year, the Deliveryboys told their followers to barrage the Relay app with a cut-and-paste indictment of the company’s rating system, long routes, and vanishing tips. “Us delivery workers are tired of so much injustice,” they wrote, threatening to “stop working without prior notice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQCRxj"&gt;“It’s the same thing that we are trying to do!” Ajche said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbM8pG"&gt;Not long after the walkout threat, Relay added a DISPUTE TIP button. It was a victory, but a partial one. Making use of the feature requires workers to know the actual amount a customer tipped, and many lack the language skills to ask. Juan is thinking about making cards in English so they can show customers why they need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="tJtxNo"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rF8fUF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compared to&lt;/strong&gt; the grinding progress of New York’s bureaucracy, when it comes to thefts, self-defense yields immediate results: a bike recovered, a thief apprehended, a bridge defended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpQAj0"&gt;Chavez advises workers to keep a photo of their bike on their phone. If it’s stolen, send the photo to the group, and often another worker will soon spot someone selling it on the street. The spotter sends the location, then pretends to be an interested buyer — “Hey, buddy, how much you want for that?” — until reinforcements arrive and unobtrusively encircle the two hagglers before closing in. Ideally, surrounded by a dozen delivery workers, the suspect gives up peacefully and returns the bike to its rightful owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFj42L"&gt;But not always. In June, a Lower East Side group saw someone selling a stolen bike on Lafayette, but the suspect hopped on the bike and fled. The group gave chase for several blocks before tackling him on Delancey. At that point, the police took notice and detained the suspect. When the bike’s owner arrived, he ceremoniously inserted his key into the lock, dangling from the frame, and opened it to cheers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQ4Svf"&gt;Two weeks later, a Relay worker named Angel Lopez was cruising up Amsterdam with a dinner from Celeste when he noticed someone sawing through a bike lock with a power grinder, throwing up sparks. He stopped, shocked. While he was debating what to do, workers from a nearby Chinese takeout place rushed out, grabbed chairs from their outdoor-dining setup, and started hitting the thief, who responded by brandishing his buzz saw. A standoff ensued until the thief, deterred, jogged off. Lopez sent an alert to his group, Upper Furious, and followed from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMvesY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I let him go, he’s just gonna get away, just like every other guy, &lt;/em&gt;he thought. Lopez crossed paths with two other workers and told them what was happening. They joined in cautious pursuit. Periodically, the thief looked back and yelled, “Keep following me. I got something for you,” Lopez said, and they wondered what that could mean, whether he could have a gun in his backpack and be luring them to a less crowded part of town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaFoRm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xYs3XO3V7N2qyVdfVEJVqVN-tjM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840809/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;August 30, 11:30 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Bikers wait for a bigger group to form before crossing the Willis Avenue Bridge.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mjIENc"&gt;The man stopped at another locked bike and began again with the buzz saw, threatening the workers whenever they got close. “That thing will cut your face off,” Lopez recalled. The bike freed, the thief started to pedal away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjRE0a"&gt;There were now about ten workers, and they chased the thief, trying to shove him off his bike as he attempted to strike them with his saw. Lopez said they passed a cop car and shouted for help, to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ud1kXZ"&gt;They hit the downward slope toward Riverside Park, and a few workers gunned their bikes forward to head off the thief. Surrounded, he got off the bike and swung the saw, then hurled the cut lock at the gathered crowd. But in throwing the lock, he lost his grip on the saw, and it fell to the ground. It was at that moment that police arrived, pushed through the workers, and pinned the suspect to the ground with, Lopez said, a degree of force he felt ambivalent about. “It got to the point where he said, ‘I can’t breathe’ — you know those famous lines,” he recalled. A few workers shouted that he deserved it. “You could feel the anger in the air,” Lopez said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYmRm7"&gt;He couldn’t stay to talk to the cops. He was 30 minutes late with his order and worried Relay would deactivate him. “You’re no superhero,” he imagined the company telling him. “Just deliver the food.” The suspect was charged with attempted robbery, possession of a weapon, petit larceny, and resisting arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nlRk9S"&gt;These ad hoc sting operations worry Colón Hernández. She believes that some of the thieves are organized, possibly transporting the bikes out of state. They are often armed. Workers have been stabbed and attacked with fireworks when they tried to recover their bikes themselves. Chasing down and apprehending every thief in the city is both unsustainable and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRqsxD"&gt;“The first time works. The second time may work. What happens when the third time, somebody gets killed? Or you hurt somebody because you’re chasing people at a very fast pace?” she said. “I’ve been saying this to the NYPD: One day I’m going to get a call that I don’t want to get.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="jq8BPC"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6gNW0X"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a Friday night&lt;/strong&gt; in July, Nicolas was coming back outside after dropping off a pizza near Madison Square Park when he saw that his bike had vanished. &lt;em&gt;What am I going to do? &lt;/em&gt;he thought. &lt;em&gt;How am I going to work?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njrTXQ"&gt;Originally from Puebla, Mexico, Nicolas, 42 (who, fearing retaliation from the thief, requested a pseudonym), worked to send money home to his four children, whom he hadn’t seen since he crossed the border 12 years ago. The more he worked, the sooner he could return, and he worked a lot: a 5 a.m. cleaning shift at a pizza place, then delivering either for the restaurant or for DoorDash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbnCEZ"&gt;He called his brother, another delivery worker, and asked him to post a photo of his bike to the Deliveryboys’ WhatsApp. An hour later, he got a hit: Someone had spotted his bike, a teal-taped Arrow, being wheeled into an apartment building in the Bronx. The tipster had followed the man, filmed him, and noted the address. Nicolas got on the train and headed there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDNjMT"&gt;He was met by five other workers from the WhatsApp group who’d come to help. Standing in front of the building, Nicolas called 911 and was told to wait for a patrol car, so they waited. And waited. After midnight, he thanked the others for standing by him and told them to go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TeSPjQ"&gt;Three days later, after he’d given the bike up for lost, one of the workers who had stood with him Friday flagged him down. Another bike had been stolen and traced to the same building. A group was gathering to get it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tZWN4"&gt;When the two arrived, they encountered 15 or so workers standing in front of the building. Cesar was there along with a contingent that had caravanned from the Willis Avenue Bridge. Chavez was there too. Nicolas introduced himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tO6sac"&gt;Cesar and Chavez had been called there by the owner of the other bike, Margaro Solano. Unlike Nicolas’s bike, Margaro’s had a GPS. Seeing his bike had been taken to the Bronx, he and his wife — who left her restaurant job to help — had immediately headed there. They confirmed they had the right place by obtaining building surveillance footage of a man — the same one filmed carrying Nicolas’s bike — lugging Margaro’s up the stairs and into his apartment. They could hear Margaro’s bike alarm blaring through the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZAClcdiv0YMu2l_ClXTOAwfZSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840805/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;August 30, 11:30 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; A delivery worker at the Willis Avenue Bridge.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rXbGjI"&gt;After Margaro was unable to get help from the nearby precinct, he called Chavez, who texted Cesar, who put out a call on WhatsApp. By the time Nicolas arrived, the group had gone back to the precinct, failed to get help, and settled in for a stakeout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NFRIK"&gt;Rather than risk a confrontation inside the building, Chavez and the others decided the safest approach would be to wait for the thief to emerge and ask for the bikes back. Two workers stood just outside the building entrance, while another loitered in the lobby. The rest gathered on the sidewalk outside, chatting. The stakeout was the first time most of them had met in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdFIEA"&gt;Around midnight, conversation began to shift to how late it was and when they should decide to call it a night. Many had come directly from work, skipping dinner. Then he emerged, the man from the videos. The workers on the street watched as he opened the lobby door and stepped outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOzqX2"&gt;The group followed him for a block, tailing him as stealthily as a dozen deliverymen on electric bikes could manage. After a second block, they descended, surrounding him on the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="faTgVa"&gt;For vigilante justice, it was a restrained confrontation. No one touched anyone else. The workers, masked, stood back in a circle and asked for their bikes to be returned; the man towered over them by at least two heads. Chavez was filming, Cesar broadcasting live. Nicolas stood at the margins, watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbmDC3"&gt;To Cesar’s surprise, the man asked how many bikes they had come for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xU2OPT"&gt;Two, he answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LY6EJr"&gt;When the thief asked for $1,000 to give them back, the workers started shouting. “Show him! Let him see!” they yelled in Spanish. “The camera was watching you!” in English. Chavez said they didn’t want trouble and wouldn’t call the police if the man just gave back the bikes — a bluff. Chavez knew the police wouldn’t come. The man didn’t budge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LL5T7ts3VosqNhbDGUvOGfPdjcE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840808/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;September 4, 6 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Juan Solano at home in the two-bedroom apartment he shares with five other delivery bikers.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="81j0Q3"&gt;A worker held out his phone to the suspect, showing him the surveillance video. He watched footage of himself carrying the bike up the stairs. Then he watched it again. He paused, thought it over, and agreed to return the bikes. The group formed an escort down Grand Concourse, the suspect surrounded by workers on foot who were circled by bikers cruising slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plG08g"&gt;Chaos ensued once they entered the building. An acquaintance of the man blocked the workers in the entryway while attempting to assure them he would bring their bikes down. Unconvinced, they pushed forward until everyone — the two men, followed by Cesar, Chavez, Nicolas, Margaro, and several others — started running up the stairs. As they neared the fifth floor, they could hear the bike’s shrill alarm. Nicolas was too thrilled at the prospect of being reunited with his bike to be scared. One man held the workers at bay while the other brought out Margaro’s bike, lights flashing, and then Nicolas’s. Cesar glimpsed two other bikes inside before the men shut the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkRtWF"&gt;“Thank you!” a worker shouted in English as the group shuffled the bikes down the stairs. “Let’s go! Two bikes — we came to get one, left with two,” he continued in Spanish. “Let’s go tell the precinct we actually could get it. Police don’t know how to do their job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRkxHD"&gt;Cesar was bringing up the rear and still streaming when someone grabbed him from behind. In the video, the suspect’s acquaintance can be heard shouting that he should be rewarded for helping them. Cesar elbowed his assailant and broke free, dashing down the stairs to join the others in front of the building. They mounted their bikes and sped away, riding down the bike lane together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuSWzl"&gt;The next day, Chavez would tell Colón Hernández what had happened and send her the evidence they’d gathered. She’d watch the video of the raid with dismay — reckless, dangerous, no plan at all — and then work the system her way. She’d finish the process of filing Nicolas’s police report and stay on the detectives. She’d involve the new delivery liaison. Three weeks after the bikes were recovered, the suspect would be arrested and charged with petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9ANuz"&gt;But the workers didn’t know any of that that night. In fact, they wouldn’t hear about the arrest until I told them. The night they got the bikes back, they had little reason to believe justice would be served. It was their own detective work that had succeeded when the system failed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BORn4v"&gt;After they rode some distance from the building, Chavez filmed a news broadcast outside a bodega. It was a mix of anger and triumph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uP37X0"&gt;“The police did nothing,” Chavez narrated as Nicolas held up the paperwork he’d been given by a precinct days before. “We had agreed with them that they would be there for us whenever a bike got stolen, and they weren’t. Don’t commit then. We organize. We recover our bicycles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SuxJIh"&gt;They didn’t linger to celebrate their victory. It was late, and they had work in the morning. Nicolas’s predawn shift would begin in just four hours. He hopped back on his bike and sped home to get some rest.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo lowers Switch price across Europe ahead of OLED model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jUIFteFYNfoxkyBwoNnFWMSvjMo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69850431/jbareham_1492_170228_0097.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MMKMWQ"&gt;Nintendo is lowering the price of its base Switch model across Europe ahead of the OLED version’s launch next month. The Nintendo Switch is now priced at €299.99 in Europe, down €30 from the previous €329.99 pricing. In the UK, Nintendo has adjusted the base model to £259.99, down £20 from the previous £279.99 pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1j2mE"&gt;The new pricing can be found at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen_gb%2Fconsoles%2Fnintendo-switch-consoles%2Fnintendo-switch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F13%2F22671208%2Fnintendo-switch-pricing-lowered-europe-uk" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo’s own store&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-09-13-nintendo-cuts-price-of-base-switch-model"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; it hasn’t been reflected at other retailers like Amazon just yet. Given the small changes, it’s likely more of a currency-related change in pricing, but it does arrive just under a month before Nintendo’s OLED Switch is due to go on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gj3MT1"&gt;“After carefully weighing up a variety of factors, including currency exchange rates in Europe and the upcoming launch of Nintendo Switch – OLED Model, we decided that now was the appropriate time to change the European trade price of Nintendo Switch,” says a Nintendo spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new Nintendo Switch OLED model has an updated dock with ethernet." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/45djf0iouwMIFpUALhSfXKFp1n4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22707192/NintendoSwitchOLEDmodel_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch OLED model arrives on October 8th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TFWNnX"&gt;The OLED model will be priced at €364.99 in Europe and £309.99 in the UK. This small price drop creates a slightly larger price difference between OLED and original models, all while the OLED version is mostly about the screen changes rather than any significant hardware upgrades elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NykuGY"&gt;Nintendo’s Switch OLED goes on sale on October 8th, and during our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;first look at the device&lt;/a&gt; we found it’s a small upgrade that makes a big difference. The bigger and brighter screen, a new kickstand, and speaker improvements are the main additions, alongside an ethernet port on the dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OthJP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 13th 7:30AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with comment from Nintendo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp reportedly developing transcriptions to tame chaotic voice notes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/McHafLhjcm3QoHQoIO8F-kvV-rE=/0x0:600x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69850418/ezgif.com_gif_maker.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A “Transcript” section lets you skip to different parts of the message.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/WABetaInfo/status/1436549909562499072" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jU76sQ"&gt;WhatsApp is reportedly developing a feature that’ll offer transcriptions of received voice messages, letting you easily read what’s been said without having to play it out loud. The feature spotted &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-working-on-voice-message-transcription/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is currently in development for iOS. It’s unclear when it’ll hit the WhatsApp beta for iPhone users or when it’ll come to Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MSSDc"&gt;According to a screenshot shared by &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;, the feature works by sending speech data to Apple “to process your requests,” not to parent company Facebook. There’s a disclaimer that this data “will also help Apple improve its speech recognition technology.” It’s unclear how the data “sent to Apple” will be secured since the feature is yet to be officially announced. Currently, voice messages are protected by &lt;a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/security/?lang=en"&gt;WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I7BffuIB_y51_3q9j35Uv8Af5hs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22846264/WA_TRANSCRIPT_VOICE_MESSAGE_PERMISSION_IOS.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-working-on-voice-message-transcription/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A popup warns that transcriptions involve sending speech data to Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wl9Zvn"&gt;Voice messages are a useful WhatsApp feature, particularly if you need to send a longer message and aren’t in a position to type it out. But they can sometimes cause problems for recipients who don’t have headphones and aren’t in a position to listen to a message out loud, or if they simply don’t have time to listen to a voice message in its entirety. Transcriptions could let people silently see the contents of a voice message, or reference important details later without having to scrub through audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReY4EV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; reports that transcriptions are saved to the device after they’re created, and that a “Transcript” section makes it easy to skip to specific parts of a message. That’s similar to other auto-transcription software like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915452/google-pixel-4-recorder-app-transcription-real-time-free-language-processing"&gt;Google’s Recorder&lt;/a&gt; or Otter.ai, which let you click on a word to skip to the moment it’s said in a recording. Transcribing WhatsApp voice messages is currently only possible &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/how-to-transcribe-whatsapp-voice-messages-on-android/"&gt;using third-party software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEMUhH"&gt;At the moment, there’s no sign of an equivalent feature on WhatsApp’s Android app. However, given the level of feature parity between WhatsApp’s different apps, &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo &lt;/em&gt;speculates that it might also be on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ujPhm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite season 8 is all about the cubes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MoM8mmpCKdu0LQaT6lw9ODto1IQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69850393/S18_SS_BP_1920x1080_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oNXaSe"&gt;The alien invasion is over, and now &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s island is... full of cubes. Season 8 of the battle royale’s second chapter just launched and it’s called, simply, “&lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/whats-new-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-2-season-8-cubed"&gt;Cubed&lt;/a&gt;.” The premise is pretty strange: according to developer Epic, the cubes that used to power the giant alien mothership have now been set free to wreak havoc on the island. As with all new seasons, the update means a combination of new characters, locations, weapons, and even portals to transport players to a monster-filled realm. The launch follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670317/fortnite-alien-invasion-season-7-end-event-operation-sky-fire"&gt;an explosive live event that took place over the weekend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omJANJ"&gt;First, here’s the basic story, via Epic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eEG63u"&gt;The alien and IO war is over, but a new war has taken shape, one where you’re a combatant. After Slone double-crossed you and left you to perish on the Mothership, the cubes that powered it are now free. These things are a bigger threat to the island than those aliens could’ve ever been. They have no face, no speech, but they’re sentient and have six sides of malice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SwLyA"&gt;If you think the corruption they’ve caused is bad now, you have no idea what can happen if we let them stomp all over the island. It doesn’t matter if you were pro-alien or pro-IO, it’ll take all the help we can get to keep the island from falling. It’s up to everybody — including you — so take my information below and put it to good use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QPSzHG"&gt;The cubes also appear to be sentient now, which is fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LK7xZR"&gt;(Longtime &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fans will remember that cubes have always been an important part of the game’s lore, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17785756/fortnite-mystery-cube-obsession"&gt;dating back to when Kevin rolled around the original island&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 before, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/4/18057306/fortnite-fortnitemares-end-cube-gone"&gt;melting&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N52zan"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z5y2BMxrAqw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="GngL9c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10748940"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wIvx8e"&gt;The biggest change in chapter 8 appears to be a new element called “The Sideways,” which is described as a “dark, malevolent, monster-filled reality” which is spread by the cubes. Players can access it via portals — in addition to the monsters, it features low gravity and no building — and it will impact different island locations. Players will be able to get a new crafting component from these areas to create superpowered “sideways” weapons. This season also brings back some classic guns, including the automatic sniper rifle and harpoon gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTwjGz"&gt;There also appears to be a newfound focus on collaboration between players, who can now work together to enforce the island. Here’s how Epic describes it: “With fellow Loopers across the island, donate the bars you earn to construction sites where you want to see turret stations built up. In the future, we’ll need you to come together and decide which new weapons to develop, which ones to unvault, and more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRRhhx"&gt;Lastly, a new season means a new battle pass to purchase, and this time around that includes the addition of characters to unlock like Carnage, a monster hunter called Torin, and a soldier named J.B. Chimpanski. Also, a buff unicorn called Fabio Sparklemane. Just look at this guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZfN87W"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You took quite the fall there…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, that’s Fabio Sparklemane...he’s just getting ready for battle. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ffjxbzgTpK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ffjxbzgTpK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1437159205174136834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sL9L9Z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22519431/fortnite-season-7-superman-flying-saucers-aliens"&gt;Season 7 originally kicked off in June&lt;/a&gt;, and aside from introducing aliens, it was pretty eventful, adding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628622/fortnite-among-us-copy-new-imposters-game-mode"&gt;a new &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;-style mode&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;an Ariana Grande concert&lt;/a&gt;, and characters ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553914/fortnite-crew-loki-release-date"&gt;Loki&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22570612/lebron-james-fortnite-skin-release-date"&gt;LeBron James&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: The Matrix: Resurrections, The Guilty, Ron’s Gone Wrong, Star Trek: Picard and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EJRp5Z7EGGROVh1T0dHIBjBFYKw=/329x0:1531x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69849147/matrix_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Neo is back in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix: Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ix7TUGVYIo&amp;amp;ab_channel=WarnerBros.Pictures" target="_blank"&gt;Warner Bros&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XePo1E"&gt;The clues were there all along if you were paying attention, but I still gasped at the very big reveal in the latest episode of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;. I won’t spoil it except to say: it was very well done from beginning to end, my crush on Roy Kent continues, and I’ve had &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oextk-If8HQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=KeaneVEVO"&gt;Somewhere Only We Know&lt;/a&gt; in my head all weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJM0sn"&gt;Trailers! Let’s get right to it because pretty much every one of these trailers is extremely relevant to my interests and I just don’t know how I’m going to find the time to watch everything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9EjkXP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ix7TUGVYIo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nBDZll"&gt;The Matrix: Resurrections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="F4HQkn"&gt;The first trailer for the fourth &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; movie has arrived at last along with some robust internet analysis of whaaaaat is going on here. It seems Neo doesn’t know what’s real and isn’t in the Matrix, but maybe he also is? Also his name is Thomas again. Also is that young Morpheus? Young Oracle? Hi Trinity! Kicking, flying, shooting, exploding, jumping from buildings— all accounted for in the trailer. And in case you missed it: Neo, with a rubber duck on his head. Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Yahya Abdul Mateen II, Jessica Henwick, Jonathan Groff, Neil Patrick Harris, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Christina Ricci, and Jada Pinkett Smith star in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix: Resurrections,&lt;/em&gt; directed by Lana Wachowski, which comes to theaters and HBO Max December 22nd. I can not wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X9slW5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oUhBOmtFYr8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Gz4uy5"&gt;Star Trek: Picard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gXsmQq"&gt;The season two trailer has a lot packed into it, namely: Q makes an appearance and screws up the future so that Jean-Luc and co. have to go back to 21st-century Earth (hey that’s us) and fix things. Oh and they only have three days before the future is changed irrevocably, Picard tells us. I have to admit Q was never my favorite &lt;em&gt;Star Trek &lt;/em&gt;character but he does make for some interesting plot twists. Patrick Stewart, Alison Pill, Isa Briones, Evan Evagora, Michelle Hurd, Santiago Cabrera, Jeri Ryan, and John de Lancie as Q are in &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Picard&lt;/em&gt;, whose second season hits Paramount Plus in February 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nkLBpl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaB_ERMAZu4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="LmMg0V"&gt;The Guilty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="RqfCWB"&gt;Some of us at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; were discussing how unbelievable it is that Jake Gyllenhaal doesn’t have an Oscar yet; he was nominated for &lt;em&gt;Brokeback Mountain&lt;/em&gt; and has done so much good work since. Come on, Academy! In &lt;em&gt;The Guilty&lt;/em&gt;, which is based on a &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/10/the-thriller-the-guilty-wants-to-take-you-on-a-wild-ride.html"&gt;Danish film&lt;/a&gt; of the same name, Gyllenhaal is a 911 operator who gets a call from a woman who seems to have been abducted and is in danger. He tries to track her down but as the Netflix description tells us “nothing is as it seems.”  It never is, Netflix. it never is. Directed by Antoine Fuqua with a screenplay by Nic Pizzolatto, &lt;em&gt;The Guilty&lt;/em&gt; comes to Netflix October 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oVB30q"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8I8nMtzN05s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MCfupN"&gt;Ron’s Gone Wrong&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="x9OmY1"&gt;This is a story about Barney, an awkward kid, and Ron, his personal robot friend who’s a little off because he’s got some code missing from his programming (but I still love him look how cute he is). Hijinks ensue, and I don’t think it’s going out on a limb to say some lessons about friendship are on the menu. Also this movie has an all-star voice cast, including Zach Galifianakis, Jack Dylan Grazer, Olivia Colman, Ed Helms, Justice Smith, and Rob Delaney. &lt;em&gt;Ron’s Gone Wrong&lt;/em&gt; comes to theaters October 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QxnVqA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9vkzjGBAcTM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="krdkq3"&gt;Star Trek: Lower Decks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mUIwIB"&gt;Did I put two &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; trailers in one roundup? I sure did. A mid-season trailer? Sure, why not. This show is such a fun, clever take on the Star Trek universe, I admit I have to get caught up on season two because wow it’s at the halfway mark already. The crew of the U.S.S. Cerritos returns doing “the million little things that keep the ship going” and hey look at the phaser rifle! &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Lower Decks&lt;/em&gt; is streaming on Paramount Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2vUnj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is also forcing the popular Rythm Discord music bot offline </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wA-3YNXlFdmXgcSaGFnBGjR8c60=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69848936/acastro_180806_1777_youtube_cancel_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K93Z0F"&gt;Just weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640024/youtube-discord-groovy-music-bot-closure"&gt;forcing the Groovy Discord music bot offline&lt;/a&gt;, Google-owned YouTube is now turning its attention to Rythm, the most popular music bot on Discord. The search giant has sent a cease and desist to the owners of Rythm, a bot that lets Discord users play music from YouTube videos and has more than 560 million users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvw7mv"&gt;Google wants the Rythm bot closed down within seven days, and the service is complying by shutting down its bot on September 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bVchm"&gt;Rythm is currently installed on more than 20 million Discord servers alone. Rythm has more than 560 million Discord users, and 30 million of them actively use the service each month. Given Discord has 150 million monthly active users, this shutdown is a huge blow to a core feature of Discord that’s used by around 20 percent of its userbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlIwuS"&gt;“One way or another we knew this was due to happen eventually,” admits Yoav, the creator of Rythm bot, in a Discord message to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Which is why we started working on something new a year ago. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640024/youtube-discord-groovy-music-bot-closure"&gt;Groovy receiving one&lt;/a&gt; just meant it would happen sooner rather than later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="opO928"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube is forcing the popular Groovy Discord music bot offline ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640024/youtube-discord-groovy-music-bot-closure"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MU3Mkw"&gt;The Rythm bot team is working on “something new in the music space that we’re very excited about,” says Yoav. There will be some form of connection to Discord, but the team isn’t ready to talk more about their upcoming project just yet. Rythm has been a full time job for Yoav, and it took 16 servers with more than 4TB of RAM and over 1,000 CPU cores to power this Discord music bot, illustrating how popular the service had become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JUqjv"&gt;“I believe that now that we received the letter, all music bots will be getting them too in the following weeks and I strongly believe all of them will shut down,” explains Yoav. “As someone that was a very early user on Discord it’s hard to envision Discord without music bots, they’ve become key to the experience and bring so much fun and engagement to a community. It’s a sad end of an era here for everyone on the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlEXfN"&gt;While music bots might feel like a core part of Discord, they have been enabled by third parties for years, allowing Discord to avoid scrutiny or legal action from companies like YouTube. Groovy and Rythm shutting down will force many Discord users to look for alternatives, but smaller bot developers could soon end up in a similar position if they attempt to fill the giant gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QI3JEX"&gt;YouTube and Discord do appear to be working on some form of alternative, though. Discord has been testing a social party feature on its service for the past 10 months, and it allows Discord users to form a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/jtnso2/social_party_games_on_discord/"&gt;YouTube watch party&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not a straight replacement for music bots on Discord, but if the feature ever officially launches then it will be an official way to watch YouTube content inside Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0P3KR"&gt;We’ve reached out to both Google and Discord to comment on the Rythm shutdown. Discord declined to comment, and Google did not respond by the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnsZQ4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 13th 5:30AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with Discord’s decision not to comment, and more details on Rythm active user numbers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s explosive alien event saw the return of Kevin the cube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dCtctPNY7xvErY4ephZ79aZfYfc=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69848925/Fortnite_20210912161644.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HALlOd"&gt;The latest live &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; event saw the return of a familiar friend, with an explosion-filled spectacle involving aliens, cubes, and lots of strange bits of lore. And now that it’s over, the game is down in the lead-up to season 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AXBmD"&gt;Before the event started, players were able to hang out in a sort of holding pen, located on some chunks of farmland floating above the island. They were greeted by the booming voice of Doctor Slone — the main protagonist, or possibly antagonist, of this season — who warned “the aliens are about to start their biggest abduction yet.” In my instance of the game, everyone jumped on top of the same grain silo and danced for 20 minutes before the event actually kicked off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iqBer"&gt;When that happened, players were initially sucked onto the giant alien mothership that has floated above the island all season long, and were able to actually explore it, running down long pink and purple sci-fi hallways together while following Slone’s orders. The goal, according to Slone, was to use some fancy backpacks to arm explosives that would take down the ship for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/loyAxhgJk8iJjGEbsdTRXc9rcbU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22845024/Fortnite_20210912161216.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVmol26AIcUaj9QXQGFTVoLAfeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22845026/Fortnite_20210912161355.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="HK56HJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite’s experimental story is an attempt to create ‘the entertainment experience of the future’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ZBKiBi"&gt;Things, of course, didn’t go exactly as planned, and eventually players were shut in a room with fan-favorite character Kevin, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17785756/fortnite-mystery-cube-obsession"&gt;the massive cube that rolled around &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s island in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. The cube started out a familiar bright pink and purple, before eventually going dark for a brief period — at which point Slone made it clear this would be a suicide mission. Players were then able to commune with Kevin; he turned a happy shade of blue before creating an escape route. Eventually, everyone was brought to a huge room full of lots of giant cubes, revealing that Kev isn’t alone in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIbrnD"&gt;That’s when everything exploded in a scene ripped right out of &lt;em&gt;Independence Day,&lt;/em&gt; and pieces of the alien ship — cubes included — fell towards the island. As with past live events, players couldn’t really affect what happened. It was more of a strange-yet-fun rollercoaster, with millions along for the ride. The experience most closely resembled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333635/fortnites-season-6-single-player-event-storytelling"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s very first single-player mission, which kicked off season 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvTA0Y"&gt;If you don’t play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, that was a few hundred words of gibberish, but for those who are invested in the strange world, the alien event was yet another example of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"&gt;Epic’s increasingly expansive narrative ambitions.&lt;/a&gt; The event ended with a timer, which is now counting down the minutes to season 8 — which starts tomorrow, September 13th. Until then, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is down and unplayable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qx655b"&gt;Epic Games has filed an appeal to a Friday’s ruling in its lawsuit against Apple, calling on a higher court to reexamine the case and overturn the judge’s ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29aZkr"&gt;“Notice is hereby given that Epic Games, Inc.... appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from the final Judgment entered on September 10, 2021,” &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21061142-epic-games-appeal"&gt;the document reads&lt;/a&gt;. Few details are given about the legal basis for Epic’s appeal, but it is likely to continue to press on the federal antitrust allegations dismissed by the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYIsOt"&gt;At trial, Epic argued Apple had a monopoly because of how it requires developers to use its payments system for in-game purchases. But Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled Friday that Epic should pay damages to Apple for violating rules around its in-app purchasing system, while undoing Apple’s most restrictive rules on steering customers to alternate payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yG3pML"&gt;Most notably, the judge found that Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;failed to make the case&lt;/a&gt; for Apple as a monopoly in the mobile gaming marketplace, which she ultimately found was the relevant market for the company’s claims. “The evidence does suggest that Apple is near the precipice of substantial market power, or monopoly power, with its considerable market share,” Judge Rogers wrote — but said the antitrust claims failed in part “because [Epic] did not focus on this topic.”&lt;/p&gt;
