    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NmKC7V"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554566/softbank-pepper-robot-production-layoffs-robotics"&gt;SoftBank’s Pepper robot is dead&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; is dancing upon its grave with a thorough account of how the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/5/5781628/softbank-announces-pepper-robot"&gt;emotional robot&lt;/a&gt;” failed to live up to the hype. Expectations were so inflated back in 2014 that the first batch of 1,000 robots sold out in a minute, despite being priced close to $2,000.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yw4p28"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/humanoid-robot-softbank-jobs-pepper-olympics-11626187461"&gt;entire article&lt;/a&gt; is well worth a read as a reminder that tech is hard, and predicting its impact on society is even harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ilR22"&gt;Although SoftBank certainly overhyped Pepper, saying its launch would be remembered “100, 200, or 300 years” into the future, humans are also to blame for getting sucked in by the bot’s doe-eyed demeanor, despite &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; article titled “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/19/5820080/meeting-softbank-pepper-robot"&gt;I met an emotional robot and felt nothing&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mbgHU"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; report does credit the robot, which also required monthly subscriptions starting at $550, with being able to take temperatures about as well as a $1 thermometer. It could also function as a rudimentary hotel concierge. Otherwise, Pepper failed at almost every other task assigned and ended up being roughly as sophisticated as the smart speakers that were appearing around the same time. Its failures include such improbable jobs as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/24/16196752/robot-buddhist-priest-funeral-softbank"&gt;Buddhist priest&lt;/a&gt; and exercise coach for the elderly. But it also failed at tasks like home companionship for which it seemed ideally suited, as recounted by tech journalist Tsutsumu Ishikawa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vsvlz7"&gt;After arriving at the Ishikawa home, however, Pepper couldn’t recognize the faces of family members or carry on a proper conversation, said Mr. Ishikawa. The robot, connected to the cloud, is supposed to remember the family even after a breakdown, Mr. Ishikawa says, but when Pepper returned home after the repair of a sensor, Pepper greeted him, “Nice to meet you!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3kpIR"&gt;He shipped the robot back to SoftBank in 2018 after spending at least $9,000 over the three-year life of his subscription services agreement; he wasn’t eligible for any form of refund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3PvHr"&gt;“It was such a waste of money. I still regret it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="SB8jlx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fOlhsoldBSE?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=17&amp;amp;start=17" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H1Brvq"&gt;Pepper was also a terrible cheerleader, dispatched by the 100s to raise enthusiasm for SoftBank’s professional baseball team during the COVID lockdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="m4MW4v"&gt;Commenters said the scene reminded them of a dystopia. Hirofumi Miyato, 56, of Tokyo, was watching a game on television and saw the Pepper group in team uniforms moving their arms in unison. He wasn’t inspired to cheer along. “It reminded me of a military parade in North Korea or China,” Mr. Miyato said. “It felt creepy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Microsoft reveals first Windows 365 pricing for PCs in the cloud</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KfI2SJGDuVsSwghWpO6Z0l-Dy4E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585492/VRG_ILLO_4030_Windows_10_Guide_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZtvR3G"&gt;Microsoft announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22575064/microsoft-windows-365-cloud-pc-launch-date-price-features"&gt;new Windows 365 service&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, but the company said it wouldn’t discuss pricing options until the Cloud PCs launch on August 2nd. Now, Microsoft has inadvertently revealed one pricing option, allowing businesses to use a virtual Windows PC in the cloud for $31 per user, per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCSh9O"&gt;The pricing option was revealed during a Microsoft Inspire session yesterday, as the company demonstrated how businesses can sign up to the service. For the $31 monthly subscription, Microsoft offers two CPUs, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. This is part of the Windows 365 Business option, designed for businesses with fewer than 300 overall users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3k2GK"&gt;“This is pricing for just one SKU. Microsoft will have many more options, both in terms of configurations and price points, to share when the product becomes generally available on August 2nd,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsyQxosjkG0qAKhA_5MBsWN6C-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22718996/kJIzAI8.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Windows 365 pricing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YqKDwo"&gt;This isn’t the lowest-priced option, as Microsoft will also be offering a single CPU, just 2GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. It’s not clear if the Enterprise versions of the same Cloud PC specifications are priced the same as the Business versions or if there’s a discount for larger organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnPv9C"&gt;It’s difficult to compare this pricing directly to Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fpricing%2Fdetails%2Fvirtual-desktop%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F15%2F22578396%2Fmicrosoft-windows-365-pricing-skus-monthly-subscription-cost" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Azure Virtual Desktop offerings&lt;/a&gt; or even competitors like Citrix and Amazon WorkSpaces, as there are often additional charges for compute power or bandwidth used. Microsoft has designed Windows 365 to be simple for businesses to access, and the pricing structure includes all license entitlements, usage, and compute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGVAeL"&gt;Citrix offers virtual desktop access for around $30 per month, but the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.citrix.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproducts%2Fcitrix-workspace%2Fresources%2Fpricing-calculator.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F15%2F22578396%2Fmicrosoft-windows-365-pricing-skus-monthly-subscription-cost" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pricing varies&lt;/a&gt; depending on the length of contract and number of users. Amazon offers a virtual Windows PC with two CPUs, 4GB of memory, and 50GB of storage &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/pricing/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $35 per month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaYAth"&gt;Pricing aside, Microsoft has also offered some &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/get-started-with-windows-365/ba-p/2530504"&gt;more details on Windows 365&lt;/a&gt;, including the various PC configurations and supported features. Here’s what businesses will be able to pick from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e3nO4P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10653257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jDmScH"&gt;Each Cloud PC will also be able to access an impressive internet connection, with 10Gbps download speeds and 4Gbps upload speeds. Microsoft is also exploring the option to redirect video and other multimedia in virtual sessions. Naturally, the best way to experience Windows 365 will be through connecting from an existing Windows PC since features like multiple monitors (up to 16), USB, Teams AV redirection, and support for scanners will only be available if you’re connecting from Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7FcCo"&gt;Microsoft is planning to launch Windows 365 fully on August 2nd, so we’ll know all pricing options in less than three weeks time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin picks teen to fly to space after anonymous auction winner reschedules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos Introduces The Blue Origin&amp;amp;nbsp;New Shepard&amp;amp;nbsp;System" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C4XEb543b73e3RGDakU5NO50urM=/0x0:4908x3272/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585454/665033922.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dL6XKg"&gt;The fourth passenger to ride with Jeff Bezos on his space company’s suborbital rocket next Tuesday is an 18-year-old named Oliver Daemen, Blue Origin revealed Thursday. Daemen’s seat had been reserved for the winner of a $28 million auction that closed last month, but that winner remains anonymous and “has chosen to fly on a future New Shepard mission due to scheduling conflicts,” a &lt;a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news-archive/first-customer-on-new-shepard"&gt;news release said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3WzhP"&gt;Blue Origin’s launch, scheduled for July 20th, marks the company’s first crewed mission to the edge of space. Four people will launch aboard its suborbital New Shepard rocket from a remote desert site in Van Horn, Texas. Blue Origin founder Bezos, his brother Mark, aviation icon and astronaut candidate Wally Funk, and Daemen will be New Shepard’s full crew. The company received Federal Aviation Administration approval to fly passengers on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0NmpaD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Welcome to the crew, Oliver! We’re grateful to have you as our first customer to mark the beginning of commercial operations. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NSFirstHumanFlight?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NSFirstHumanFlight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/gwZ6qBOFpi"&gt;https://t.co/gwZ6qBOFpi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/SuOwxe2353"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SuOwxe2353&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Blue Origin (@blueorigin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1415676185418387456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bN7qFA"&gt;Blue Origin said Daemen marks the company’s first paying customer, but it’s unclear how much the ticket cost. “We’re not disclosing the price paid,” a Blue Origin spokeswoman said in response to questions from &lt;em&gt;The Verge. “&lt;/em&gt;He was a participant in the auction and had secured a seat on the second flight. We moved him up when this seat on the first flight became available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSuTUV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVralf"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Surgeon general calls out platforms over COVID-19 misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Health Committee Considers Nominees For HHS Appointments" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EMQVDqbMQu6C-pyITJ8WRPyMXds=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585433/1231376251.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Caroline Brehman-Pool / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BsHNG0"&gt;On Thursday, the surgeon general &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-misinformation-advisory.pdf"&gt;published a new report&lt;/a&gt; calling on social media platforms to make new investments in combating online coronavirus misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UV4TCy"&gt;The report calls for an all of society push to address vaccine and coronavirus misinformation, including sweeping policy recommendations for companies like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy specifically calls on companies to redesign their algorithms to “avoid amplifying misinformation.” He also suggests that they build more “friction” into sharing functions that urge users to rethink whether to share a post containing false information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjd0lw"&gt;Murthy also recommends that platforms put out “clear consequences for accounts that repeatedly violate platform policies,” like instituting broader bans and suspensions for sharing misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JrgLD"&gt;Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kucBzn"&gt;Last December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150425/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-misinformation-ban"&gt;Facebook pledged to remove&lt;/a&gt; all COVID-19 vaccine misinformation after heightened criticism of the platform’s role in spreading misinformation. Prior to the move, Facebook only removed related misinformation that could cause “imminent physical harm.” Currently, the vaccine policy extends to all content that has been “debunked by public health experts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6WNPh"&gt;“While health misinformation has always been a problem, today it spreads at unprecedented speed and scale,” the report says. “We are all still learning how to navigate this new information environment. But we know enough to be sure that misinformation is an urgent threat, and that we can and must confront it together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjTMrJ"&gt;The stern warning comes amid rising case numbers and deaths from COVID-19, falling most heavily among the unvaccinated population. &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases"&gt;Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; show the US averaging more than 20,000 new cases per day. Deaths linked to COVID-19, typically a trailing indicator, have also begun to tick upward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQOH6N"&gt;Alongside the misinformation effort, the White House has also kicked off a string of events encouraging people to get vaccinated. On Wednesday, popular actress and singer Olivia Rodrigo joined President Joe Biden at the White House to inspire young people to get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7z2lGR"&gt;“It’s important to have conversations with friends and family members,” Rodrigo said at Wednesday’s press briefing, “and actually get to a vaccination site, which you can do more easily than ever before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHvoTy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elago’s Siri Remote case has room for an AirTag tracker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RuoLHyBDPGfB8zRCoAsmhJzZeNQ=/164x0:1946x1188/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585417/siri_remote_airtag_case.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;PREMIUM SILICONE! | Image: Elago&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xpvVDC"&gt;Apple’s new Siri Remote arrived &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448388/apple-tv-4k-siri-remote-no-uwb-u1-couch-thickness"&gt;without a built-in locator chip&lt;/a&gt;, so Elago has created the next best thing: the &lt;a href="https://www.elago.com/apple-tv/2021-apple-tv-siri-remote-r5-case-black-1"&gt;R5 silicone case&lt;/a&gt; with a slot for Apple’s new AirTag tracker. According to Elago, it features a “THICK LAYER OF PREMIUM SILICONE,” which is so dense it can only be expressed in caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCD7LC"&gt;The $14.99 price doesn’t include the cost of the $29 AirTag, but it does promise to put an end to lost Siri remotes, especially if you own an iPhone fitted with UWB to enable precision tracking. It costs a lot more than &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aliexpress.com%2Faf%2Fsiri-remote-airtag-case.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F15%2F22578412%2Fapple-tv-remote-airtag-case-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;comparable AirTag cases available on AliExpress&lt;/a&gt; that list for just a few dollars, but well, this one can be &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/elago-Locator-Compatible-Remote-AirTag/dp/B097WZQV1Z/?tag=9to5toys03-20%5C" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;found on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for whatever that’s worth. Alternatively, you could always &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/5/10/22429238/apple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design"&gt;just 3D-print your own case&lt;/a&gt; if you’re in more of a DIY mood. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Preorders for the new OLED Nintendo Switch will start at 3PM ET / 12PM PT today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RKNowLfmo5JYjDWLA6zg84aywp4=/90x0:1110x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585364/Nitendo_Switch_OLED_Model_Press_Image_Front.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uSbobJ"&gt;Preorders for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;Nintendo’s new OLED Switch model&lt;/a&gt; will start today, July 15th, at 3PM ET / 12PM PT, the company announced today. The console is set to be released on October 8th for $350, a $50 price increase over the standard Switch model. Nintendo isn’t offering any specific details, directing customers to check with stores directly for how they’ll be handling preorders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqVLX1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;will have a complete guide to preordering an OLED Switch soon, so check back later today to find out how Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, and more are handling preorders for the popular new console. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FyWrzv"&gt;The OLED Switch, as the name implies, is largely focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566479/oled-nintendo-switch-vs-lite-screen-size"&gt;upgrading the display&lt;/a&gt; of the original Switch, swapping the 6.2-inch LCD out for a brighter, richer 7-inch OLED panel. Resolution, RAM, CPU, and even the physical dimensions of the console are the same as the original model, however. Despite the rumors, the OLED Switch doesn’t offer any “Switch Pro”-style upgrades for a more powerful console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Som77q"&gt;Also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand"&gt;new is a redesigned kickstand&lt;/a&gt; (which spans the entire device and looks to be a notable improvement on the original’s flimsy stand), “enhanced audio” for the built-in speakers, and a new dock that adds an integrated ethernet port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAMXpL"&gt;Snagging a new console is a tricky business these days, as anyone who has tried to buy a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X in the past few months can attest to, with bots, scalpers, and the sheer demand of thousands of customers all trying to snap up a limited number of consoles. And if demand is anywhere near as high for the OLED Switch, you’ll probably need a healthy dose of luck to snag one when preorders open later today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZGJlI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lyft is bringing back shared rides starting on July 19th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/810irVBp0tmQmPT_Oo-h9vO-h9E=/0x0:1194x796/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585299/shared_rides_are_back_lyft.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Lyft is bringing back shared rides | Lyft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ypOtQL"&gt;Lyft will once again allow passengers to share their rides with strangers starting next week after suspending the service over a year ago in response to the pandemic, the company announced today. Shared rides will be available in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Denver starting on Monday, July 19th, followed by additional markets “in the coming months.” It’s good news for anyone who wants a cheaper or more environmentally friendly way of making a journey in a private hire car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rmf7u1"&gt;Although shared rides are returning, they’re doing so with some social distancing restrictions. Drivers and passengers will still be required to wear masks at all times, and eating or drinking is banned during journeys. Shared rides will also be limited to two riders who’ll have to keep the front and middle seats empty to maintain distance. Drivers and passengers have the option of canceling journeys without any penalty if fellow riders aren’t obeying the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEYtD7"&gt;Lyft is also tweaking how shared rides work in an attempt to make them more predictable. Passengers will now have the option of booking a shared ride up to half an hour in advance, which Lyft says will help it “better match riders going in the same direction for the most efficient route.” Routes, pickups, and pricing will be fixed ahead of time, and the further in advance a journey is booked, the more discounted it’ll be, Lyft says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SldKxP"&gt;Although it’s unclear how many passengers will be comfortable sharing rides with strangers, even with Lyft’s safety measures in place, carpooling is seen as an important means of reducing the environmental impact of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152512/uber-lyft-climate-change-emissions-pollution-ucs-study"&gt;One study last year&lt;/a&gt;, released before the pandemic took hold in the US, said that services like these generate around 69 percent more climate pollution than the modes of transport they replace, and it recommended electric cars and carpooling as a means of mitigating this. Although Lyft dismissed the report as “misleading,” it said that it “encourages the use of shared rides.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Daki00"&gt;Uber and Lyft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183276/uber-uberpool-suspension-coronavirus-us-canada-carpool-pandemic"&gt;suspended their carpooling services&lt;/a&gt; in response to the pandemic in March. But while Lyft is moving to reintroduce ride-sharing, the future of UberPool is less certain. &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uberpool-cheap-shared-rides-are-not-coming-back-after-pandemic-2021-5?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that it may return in an “unrecognizable” format in an attempt to make it more profitable. Discounts for using a shared ride could be reduced from 50 to 20 percent, and the service may only be available in certain locations or at select times of day. However, at least &lt;a href="https://thewest.com.au/technology/uber/uber-pool-to-return-to-perth-as-rideshare-giant-shakes-covid-19-fears-ng-b881811412z"&gt;one market in Australia&lt;/a&gt; has seen the return of UberPool, suggesting it won’t disappear entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GE2C8t"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sklKTK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TSMC’s revenues surge as it warns chip shortage will continue into next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7h_lGQId3k7X145w-W3QCd6a_c=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585265/1232190357.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wDnuIL"&gt;Chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has reiterated that it expects chip shortages to continue into next year, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-15/tsmc-s-second-quarter-profit-rises-11-on-strong-chip-demand?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The warning came as the company reported its &lt;a href="https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/2852"&gt;latest financial results&lt;/a&gt;, which saw its net sales rise almost 20 percent to NT$372 billion (around $13.3 billion) compared to the same quarter the previous year. However, automakers should see the shortage gradually easing this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROxJ2X"&gt;As the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer, a lot of attention has been paid to TSMC amid the global chip shortage, which has impacted the manufacturing of everything from cars to game consoles. TSMC is a leading manufacturer of semiconductors and is responsible for producing the majority of smartphone processors worldwide. It supplies chips to the world’s biggest tech companies, including Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD, and controls 28 percent of the world’s semiconductor production capacity, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/mega-wave-capex-cycle-logic-semiconductor-industry/"&gt;report from Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQ0LjE"&gt;Warnings about the chip shortage lasting into 2022 are broadly in line with what TSMC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385240/tsmc-chip-shortage-2022-intel-ceo-earnings-graphics-cards-cpus-gpus"&gt;said last quarter&lt;/a&gt;, when CEO C. C. Wei said, “In 2023, I hope we can offer more capacity to support our customers. At that time, we’ll start to see the supply chain tightness release a little bit.” Other companies have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;issued warnings along a similar timeline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yq4Urd"&gt;Amid the continued shortages, all eyes are on how quickly TSMC can increase production. The company has committed to spending $100 billion through 2023 to expand its capacity, and in this year alone, it expects microcontroller production to increase by almost 60 percent, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes. Last month, the company started construction of a new $12 billion semiconductor manufacturing facility in Arizona, and in April, it confirmed it would spend $2.8 billion expanding production in Nanjing, China, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/TSMC-logs-20-net-profit-rise-in-Q2-amid-chip-shortage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also considering building its first chip plant in Japan, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-15/ceo-says-tsmc-is-considering-building-a-chip-plant-in-japan?utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;its CEO has confirmed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KN0PjG"&gt;In the meantime, the chip shortage is continuing to have a real impact on the electronics available for people to buy. Just this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575836/gm-wireless-charging-cadillac-chevy-tahoe-chip-shortage"&gt;General Motors said it would drop wireless smartphone charging&lt;/a&gt; from some of its new SUVs because of supply chain challenges, and shortages are also starting to cause a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575037/pc-market-q2-growth-slowing-chip-shortage-covid-demand"&gt;slowdown in the PC market&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEIgJG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfrpQO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram experiences survived the pandemic and are expanding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-JJl2q0-Bdn5THXTb8sjH57C7mc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585209/akrales_191010_3617_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gCGSkh"&gt;The pandemic nearly killed those Instagram-ready pop-up experiences. Places like Color Factory and Museum of Ice Cream &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202081/instagram-museum-pop-up-color-factory-museum-ice-cream-lay-offs"&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt; employees as the world shut down, and they tried, seemingly unsuccessfully, to re-create their photogenic experiences online. But now, they’re back, raising money, and opening new locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwCU7H"&gt;Color Factory tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it recently closed a $10 million fundraising round from private equity and angel investors, which it’ll use to expand and hire people who help build the sites. Today, it’s additionally announcing its next location: Chicago. It’ll be opening a Color Factory in the Willis Tower, a major sightseeing destination that brings in nearly 2 million visitors a year on its own. The idea is clearly for Color Factory to benefit from the people already visiting the building and to attract new visitors who might care more about Color Factory’s setup than the Willis Tower’s Skydeck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qSMNqR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The team is renovating rooms to encourage repeat visits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4GxVfl"&gt;At the same time, Color Factory seems to be entering a new stage, one where building a location might not be enough to propel the business forward, and instead, the team has to encourage repeat visitors. They, for the first time, renovated multiple rooms in their original New York City location and will upgrade the camera system in the coming months to allow for people to take home actual prints of the photos they take. (Seemingly the team is now acknowledging that its locations are no longer pop-up experiences and will stay in a space for as long as it’ll have them and be successful.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjltGA"&gt;“Eighty percent of our business [in New York] pre-pandemic was tourism, like people going one-and-done, so you didn’t need to make exhibits that you wanted to go back to three or four times because most of our consumers would come once and never come again, or not to that facility, or they would leave and come again years later,” CEO Jeff Lind says. Now, however, the New York City location mostly caters to locals who the team wants to keep coming back for years. That means exhibit updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRdYb1"&gt;Color Factory’s main competitor, Museum of Ice Cream, also &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CREghPaB9Ev/"&gt;just announced&lt;/a&gt; its newest location: Austin. The photogenic experiences are spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odBjKi"&gt;But all of this news comes at a time when Instagram’s own CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557942/instagram-no-longer-photo-app-video-entertainment-focus"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; the platform as “no longer a photo-sharing app.” Still, Color Factory, its competitors, and its investors see potential in the space. In 2019, Lind and his team &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20949838/color-factory-houston-instagram-pop-up-experience-museum"&gt;told me&lt;/a&gt; their work wasn’t all about the ‘gram, and these changes, as well as the deemphasis on photos on Instagram, might test that belief.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new 3D emoji include Clippy coming back to life in Office</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/46JL8qR4XMuAi3rzStCWgluNyCI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585177/Clippy.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FMlAcP"&gt;Microsoft is bringing its infamous Clippy character back to life as an emoji in Office. After a successful campaign &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577468/microsoft-office-clippy-emoji-tweet-likes"&gt;to get some Twitter and Instagram likes&lt;/a&gt;, Clippy will now replace the paperclip emoji that exists across Windows, Office, Microsoft Teams, and other Microsoft 365 products. It’s part of a bigger update that will see 1,800 emoji in Microsoft 365 updated with 3D designs and the company’s Fluent Design language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKE0Tu"&gt;Clippy is the star of the show, with 3D emoji that have been redesigned to add a lot more personality. “I grew up using Clippy, and it just seemed like a fun little Easter egg,” says Claire Anderson, Microsoft’s official “Emoji-ologist,” in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We just all imagined that delight when you put the paperclip in a Microsoft product and then all of a sudden, you get this dose of nostalgia.” Clippy, with its Groucho eyebrows, will now replace the flat and boring paperclip.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l7VDu38yBzK6S9BEU62UKbo5rxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22718943/Clippy.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clippy replaces the old and flat paperclip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QSjtE9"&gt;The big change with Microsoft’s emoji is a move to 3D that will show up across Windows and elsewhere. “We opted for 3D designs over 2D and chose to animate the majority of our emoji,” explains Anderson. The emoji have been redesigned to include bright and saturated colors, with a focus on fun in the workplace. The 3D element really makes them pop, and they look a lot more modern than what’s currently available in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUFxh1"&gt;Around 900 of these overhauled emoji will also be animated in products like Microsoft Teams. “We loved that element of Skype legacy, so we wanted to bring that into this new system and bring that to life for more of our users,” says Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dCwky"&gt;Emoji have increasingly been an important part of online communications in recent years, adding emotion to what would otherwise be lifeless computer-based interactions. Microsoft says it has worked to “rethink graphical expressions of professionalism” with this big emoji update, something that’s particularly relevant during a pandemic that has blurred the lines between work and life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bF7wopg37YAx2Aag5NHarduGog4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22718946/windowsemoji.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Windows emoji.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r3heIu"&gt;“Because being playful or highly expressive doesn’t come easily to everyone, emoji are the perfect little helpers,” says Anderson. “Far from being frivolous or ornamental, they’re extensions of our own humanity and an important communication tool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmnFwM"&gt;Microsoft’s renewed focus on fun with its emoji is a far cry from the company’s previous effort to resurrect Clippy. Some employees working on Microsoft Teams&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18276923/microsoft-clippy-microsoft-teams-stickers-removal"&gt; released a fun sticker pack in 2019 featuring animated Clippy GIFs&lt;/a&gt;, but Microsoft quickly removed them after a few days. An insider at Microsoft told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time that the “brand police” inside the company weren’t happy that Clippy had appeared in Microsoft Teams. It’s likely that there were legal or copyright issues behind the decision, and interestingly, Microsoft actually&lt;a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/907/82/clippy-90782096.html"&gt; filed for a Clippy trademark&lt;/a&gt; just last month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qI8ShXYAgua4BDKMfvX-f5cXFl8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22718948/smileys_collection.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new smiley emoji.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HD6pPo"&gt;Microsoft’s new emoji might be a minor addition to the company’s online services, but they also speak to a broader design ambition at the software maker. Microsoft has been&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/29/18515776/microsoft-design-open-fluent-prototypes-history"&gt; challenging itself to adopt an “open design” philosophy&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, a more coherent and human approach to how it designs software and hardware across its various teams. We’ve seen a greater focus on iconography, and a Fluent Design system that spans across Microsoft’s services.&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt; Windows 11 is the latest example of Microsoft’s design changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXOb9B"&gt;The refreshed emoji will start to appear across all of Microsoft 365 in the coming months. Flipgrid will get access to the new emoji next month, with Microsoft Teams and Windows getting updated in the holiday season. Yammer, Outlook, and other Office apps will see the emoji updates soon after, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yZDxx"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
