    <title>The 44mm Apple Watch SE is $40 off at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xqsrgx"&gt;Amazon is offering a good deal on the 44mm-sized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; (GPS). Normally $309, it’s $270 for the model built with space gray aluminum that comes with a black sport band. For now, this puts both the 40mm and larger 44mm Apple Watch SE at the same price. If you’re wondering where the SE sits among all of Apple’s recent smartwatches in terms of specs, it has the same processor as the Apple Watch 5, but it notably lacks its ECG capability and the ability to have an always-on display. No other retailers are currently offering this deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="GIfrF3"&gt;If you bought a PS5 or received one as a gift over the holidays, you can add &lt;em&gt;Godfall &lt;/em&gt;to your lineup of games today for less than it usually costs. The third-person game normally costs a full $70, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728753977509596763" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but the disc version is $40 today only at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. I haven’t played this title, but I’ve heard that you’re most likely to enjoy it if you like games like &lt;em&gt;Warframe &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with nonstop action encounters that only end to let you collect a lot of loot for your character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="jirPH4"&gt;Sam’s Club members can still take advantage of the best deal I’ve seen yet for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262459/razer-opus-review-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones-thx-over-ear-price-specs"&gt;Razer’s Opus&lt;/a&gt; noise-canceling headphones. These usually cost $200 (with the lowest previous price at $150), but you can snag them at Sam’s Club for just $80 for one more day. The Opus justify their full price, but at $80 I think you really should just get yourself a set. The noise cancellation effect, sound quality, battery life, and overall design are surprisingly good for a relatively budget-friendly set of over-ear headphones. The biggest barrier to getting these is the paid Sam’s Club membership.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new Yoga all-in-one has a rotating display for better TikTok videos and Twitter scrolling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AOQSvxaucEbXzCvV-uOqoONvsTM=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632136/lenovo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Yoga AIO 7 in its rotated configuration | Image: Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtEIpt"&gt;Lenovo has a new Yoga computer out, but it’s not a laptop — it’s the new Yoga AIO 7 desktop. But while it may look like a standard all-in-one desktop, like its more portable cousins, the Yoga AIO 7 does have a display trick up its sleeve: the entire screen can rotate around, transforming the 27-inch landscape monitor into a vertical form factor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oM9v9D"&gt;Of course, the ability to rotate a display isn’t a wholly new idea. Standalone desktop monitors have offered the feature for years, making it easier for users to display content that’s better suited to a taller panel like Twitter feeds, long documents, or TikTok videos. But it’s far rarer to see the concept on an all-in-one computer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/boRyXvu-QEsXyIU96Vz9bI6z_9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219478/lenovo2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Yoga AIO 7 in its standard mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oPwHVa"&gt;The idea is reminiscent of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21050604/samsung-sero-tv-rotate-vertical-video-tiktok-ces-2020"&gt;Samsung’s Sero TV from last year&lt;/a&gt;, a similarly rotating product that scaled up the idea to a full-sized 43-inch television in response to the popularity of vertical video formats from apps like Instagram and TikTok (which, in turn is directly due to the ubiquity of smartphones with video cameras). Lenovo seems aware of the potential for a vertical TV, promising a future software update that will effectively let the AIO 7 double as a full-fledged 4K smart TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wqxj1Q"&gt;As for the specs, the Yoga AIO 7 offers a choice between two 27-inch 4K panels (one regular and one that meets Adobe RGB and DCI-P3 color standards); a choice between AMD’s Ryzen 7 4800H and Ryzen 5 4500H CPUs; Nvidia’s integrated RTX 2060 GPU; either 16GB or 32GB of RAM; and a mix of PCIe and HDD storage options (topping out at a 1TB SSD and a 2TB hard drive, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZhDjm"&gt;Of particular note is how Lenovo is taking advantage of USB-C with the Yoga AIO 7. Plug in your laptop with a USB-C cable, and you’ll be able to use the Yoga AIO 7’s hardware — including the display, speakers, mouse and keyboard, power supply, and even the integrated hard drive — directly with your laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXdoPX"&gt;The Yoga AIO 7 is already available in China (where its called the Yoga 27), but it’ll be out in “select markets” in February starting at $1,599. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new IdeaPad 5 Pro includes AMD Ryzen mobile processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRRpgpob8_b4OnN9EYZHY9TfqyQ=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632036/Lenovo_IdeaPad_5_Pro_AMD_Front_Facing_Cloud_Grey.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XlCA6q"&gt;Lenovo has announced a new lineup of IdeaPad laptops for 2021. But American readers should note that only one of them is coming to the US: the 16-inch IdeaPad 5 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWkEfQ"&gt;Lenovo says that the IdeaPad 5 Pro is one of the most powerful IdeaPad laptops the company has ever made. The device can be configured with up to an H-Series AMD Ryzen mobile processor and “next-gen” Nvidia GeForce RTX GPUs. You can also get up to 32GB of DDR4 memory and 1TB of SSD PCIe M.2 storage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OhHAqWqKwxWKtkEjp4IVoXa53aY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22218911/Lenovo_IdeaPad_5_Pro_AMD_Rear_Facing_Cloud_Grey.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OR5UQB"&gt;One thing I’m excited about: the 5 Pro is the first IdeaPad laptop to offer a 16:10 display. Coupled with a 90 percent screen-to-body ratio, that should provide extra space for productivity and multitasking over a 16:9 device. The display also has a 90Hz refresh rate and can reach 400 nits of brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWqkZx"&gt;Lenovo says you’ll also get a larger trackpad than those of previous IdeaPads, as well as an improved keyboard with “soft-landing switches.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L-y-eSfapIjvN5UKsuo4LNvxROg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22218913/Lenovo_IdeaPad_5_Pro_AMD_Right_Profile_Storm_Grey.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vxvLQt"&gt;You’ll be able to buy the IdeaPad 5 Pro in May 2021, starting at $1,149.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWQD90"&gt;In addition to the IdeaPad 5 Pro 16, Lenovo has announced the IdeaPad 5G 14 (coming to “select markets” at a not-yet-announced time), and the IdeaPad 5i Pro (available in Europe, Middle East, and Africa starting March 2021) which contains Intel processors. The 14-inch IdeaPad 5 Pro isn’t coming to North America, but it will also be available in Europe, Middle East, and Africa in March 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4tBqx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 hands-on: promisingly boring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jMDvxmO8olif93zOD0dDBhlNmMQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632044/bfarsace190331_4355_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It’s a regular-ass Chromebook&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="F682fD"&gt;“Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2” is a somewhat misleading title. Yes, this $549.99 laptop is technically the second device to bear the name “Samsung Galaxy Chromebook.” But it’s not a sequel in the sense that it’s an upgrade: Samsung didn’t add a ton of new features or bump up many of the specs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TATFFq"&gt;The Galaxy Chromebook 2, coming in the first quarter of 2021, is actually a step &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; from its predecessor when it comes to most of the hardware. Some of the features that made the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; stand out have been removed — there’s no AMOLED screen or included stylus. It retains the original’s unique color, but on paper the Chromebook 2 is a world away. It’s not fancy or flashy; it’s not pushing the boundaries of the category. It’s a regular-ass Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkLOpJ"&gt;And I’m totally fine with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C8_GN30cBihPrMWa-L5TC1N9ph4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217912/bfarsace190331_4355_0011.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xThKCfBX2wMxjBEv3Mj-JCYQU_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217908/bfarsace190331_4355_0008.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ktFfXE"&gt;From the outside, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 doesn’t look too different from the Galaxy Chromebook. That’s largely because of the color. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 comes in a bold “fiesta red” that looks either bright red or bright orange depending on the lighting. Either way, it’ll turn heads. (There’s also a “mercury gray” option, if you’re boring.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8qdQN"&gt;Pick the Chromebook 2 up, though, and you’ll feel the first corner that Samsung has cut. The Chromebook 2 is noticeably thicker and heavier than its predecessor: 2.71 pounds and .55 inches thick, to the Galaxy Chromebook’s 2.29 pounds and 0.38 inches thick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Bzki1"&gt;Of course, that’s still plenty portable as Chromebooks go —&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt; Acer’s Chromebook Spin&lt;/a&gt; 713 is thicker and heavier. The one thing I’ll note is that while I had no trouble using the Galaxy Chromebook as a tablet, holding the Chromebook 2 in one hand for long periods of time is more of a chore. I wouldn’t have wanted to use it for a long presentation. (Your mileage will vary, of course — I’m not particularly swole.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b_jjobf89GEUexkRifvCV1P6F7Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217906/bfarsace190331_4355_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LNfI5nS5L2Wer27Ch9C4vdmUl58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217913/bfarsace190331_4355_0015.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="l7FB5l"&gt;The second big change: the screen. The Galaxy Chromebook’s display was its highlight feature. It was the first 4K AMOLED panel ever to appear on a Chromebook, and it was one of the most drop-dead gorgeous screens I’ve ever seen on a laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3R0Pzh"&gt;That’s gone here. The Chromebook 2 has an FHD (that is, 1920 x 1080) QLED screen. QLED panels, despite the name similarity, are not OLED panels — they’re LED-backlit LCD screens that use Samsung’s quantum-dot technology. You won’t see the same natural contrast and impeccable blacks that you would on an OLED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXEYPc"&gt;That doesn’t mean the screen is bad, though. The Chromebook 2 is the first Chromebook to feature a QLED display, and QLEDs are still very good. Samsung says this one can produce over a billion colors. I watched a few videos on the device, and they all looked just fine. On top of that, the audio sounded great, easily filling up the large testing area far below its maximum level. All in all, a good multimedia experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q4xhs5"&gt;There were a few other nifty features of the Galaxy Chromebook’s chassis that are absent here. There’s no built-in stylus (though you can purchase one separately), no keyboard deck camera, and no fingerprint sensor. I understand why Samsung removed these things — they’re all cool to have, but I can’t imagine I’d miss them too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRrnLf"&gt;Regarding what’s inside, you have two options. The $549.99 base model includes an Intel Celeron 5205U, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. The $699.99 configuration has an Intel Core i3-10110U, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. Both models get two USB-C ports, a microSD slot, and a headphone / microphone combo jack, as well as a 720p webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TOGT4"&gt;The Chromebook 2’s Core i3 processor is another downgrade from its predecessor (which had a Core i5-10210U), but I’m hesitant to call that a big compromise. I reviewed an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21206912/asus-chromebook-flip-c436-review-chromeos-android"&gt;Asus Chromebook Flip C436&lt;/a&gt; with that same Core i3 last year and the chip absolutely got the job done — I didn’t notice much of a performance difference between that system and the Core i5-powered Galaxy Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmuqhZ"&gt;(The Celeron, on the other hand, is fairly entry-level. I generally don’t recommend it for tasks beyond general browsing or light office work — the $699 model will likely be the best choice for most people.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qoVeBrHIh5X8XPkooBaC_RPgzYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217916/bfarsace190331_4355_0020.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VxKHEkaPPPTb6glOvQTELaGrajM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217915/bfarsace190331_4355_0019.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nDfOF9"&gt;But there’s one question I’m waiting on that might make or break my recommendation for this device, and that’s battery life. The Galaxy Chromebook had a number of great features, but it could only last around four hours and 20 minutes to a charge. I don’t think anyone should buy a $999 Chromebook that can’t even last five hours, no matter how nice it looks. Heck, I don’t think anyone should buy a $700 Chromebook that can’t even last five hours. There are just way better options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HP24pR"&gt;So when Samsung sends the Galaxy Chromebook 2 out for review, all eyes will be on the battery life. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Chromebook 2 outlasts its predecessor, given its lower-resolution screen and the lower-powered processor. On the other hand, the Chromebook 2 also has a slightly smaller battery — and the Chromebook Flip C436 (with the same processor and screen resolution) only lasted a bit longer than the Galaxy Chromebook, giving me around five hours in testing. So, we’ll have to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VNuQtYFv3V6MXf7XAFPPWEkRBK4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217914/bfarsace190331_4355_0016.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="yC2F2O"&gt;Samsung made a bold, bright bet with the Galaxy Chromebook. It put out a Chrome OS device unlike anything the market had ever seen, full of bells and whistles that made me go “wow.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77iwWG"&gt;The Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t that. It’s not out to target a brand-new segment of users or to push the boundaries of what a Chromebook can be. And I’m glad to see that, because what I really want at the $549 and $699 price point is a Chromebook that’s nicely built, nails the basics, and doesn’t have any major flaws. It doesn’t need extra fancy stuff; it just needs to deliver in the areas that matter most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NqoVkl"&gt;I’m excited that Samsung is trying to do that. As for whether it’s succeeded, that remains to be seen. But I have my fingers crossed.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wi-Fi’s biggest upgrade in decades is starting to arrive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9wy6axN3k4f6oC1CwFi86v2eSXk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68631819/acastro__171016_1777_0001_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrator by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TuRqRi"&gt;Wi-Fi is about to get a lot better. Many of this year’s new phones, laptops, TVs, routers, and more will come with support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;Wi-Fi 6E&lt;/a&gt;, a new upgrade to Wi-Fi that’s essentially like expanding your wireless connection from a two-lane road to an eight-lane highway. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;It’s the biggest upgrade to Wi-Fi in 20 years&lt;/a&gt;, and connections should be faster and a lot more reliable because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAaal3"&gt;The Wi-Fi Alliance, the industry-wide group that oversees Wi-Fi, is now starting to certify the first wave of products with support for Wi-Fi 6E. Phones, PCs, and laptops with support should start hitting the market in the first months of 2021, according to the IDC research group, and TVs and VR devices with support are expected to arrive by the middle of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xrTBBL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wi-Fi 6E explained: Wi-Fi is getting its biggest upgrade in 20 years","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PXv0kg"&gt;Some of the first devices are likely to be announced over the next week. During CES, which kicks off on January 11th, router companies will preview what they have coming up for the year. Samsung is also planning to announce its next flagship phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;the Galaxy S21 series&lt;/a&gt;, and some if not all of them are likely to have support for Wi-Fi 6E thanks to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21672519/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-cpu-gpu-details-performance-ai-isp-photography-specs-release-date"&gt;Snapdragon 888 processor&lt;/a&gt;. Because the chip includes support for it, Wi-Fi 6E should be present in many of this year’s top Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLEJgG"&gt;Wi-Fi 6E is such a big upgrade because it relies on a huge expansion of the wireless airwaves available to consumer devices. In April 2020, the Federal Communications Commission opened up this wide new swath of spectrum in the United States, but new hardware was required in order to make use of it. Nearly a year on, we’re finally starting to see devices with those capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vfJf9W"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oOZLhkaehzU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KziBaF"&gt;Existing Wi-Fi devices operate on two spectrum bands, 2.4GHz and 5GHz. Wi-Fi 6E adds a third — 6GHz — and there’s a lot more of it, quadrupling the total amount of airwaves used for typical Wi-Fi. That means you can have larger, higher-speed connections, and that airwaves are less likely to be congested. In an apartment building, for instance, your neighbors’ Wi-Fi networks might interfere with your own. But with Wi-Fi 6E, there’s a lot more bandwidth to go around, so there’s less of a chance that you’ll be fighting over the exact same airwaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeBSF5"&gt;It’ll be some time before most new devices are shipping with Wi-Fi 6E, though. Not all new gadgets are even shipping with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18232026/wi-fi-6-speed-explained-router-wifi-how-does-work"&gt;standard Wi-Fi 6 yet&lt;/a&gt;, and that version of Wi-Fi started rolling out about two years ago. By the start of 2022, IDC only expects 20 percent of shipping Wi-Fi 6 products to also support Wi-Fi 6E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnOmYV"&gt;Another hurdle is support from regulators worldwide. Though the US has approved use of 6GHz airwaves, communications regulators in other countries need to approve the spectrum for Wi-Fi use, too. The Wi-Fi Alliance says that the UK, EU, South Korea, Chile, and United Arab Emirates have all given a green light on allowing 6GHz usage for Wi-Fi, while regulators in Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and Japan are among others where progress is being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWaBuV"&gt;“There is absolutely momentum, and it is building around making [6GHz] available for Wi-Fi,” Kevin Robinson, the Wi-Fi Alliance’s marketing leader, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz unveils its absolutely massive 56-inch ‘Hyperscreen’ display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/68f6P9cNNvPmZtTs-NwZLWJq3f8=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68631835/21C0001_011.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9eSk2d"&gt;There are big infotainment displays. And then there’s Mercedes-Benz’s “Hyperscreen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27CEqf"&gt;The German automaker just unveiled a mammoth, pillar-to-pillar, 56-inch touchscreen that will debut in the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504049/mercedes-benz-eqs-electric-sedan-eqe-suv"&gt;EQS luxury electric sedan&lt;/a&gt;. The Hyperscreen is the centerpiece of the automaker’s second generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21316700/mercedes-benz-mbux-second-generation-infotainment-system-touchscreen-hey-mercedes"&gt;MBUX infotainment system&lt;/a&gt; that eschews physical buttons in favor of a completely digital (and voice-controlled) in-car user experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cm67M4"&gt;To be sure, the Hyperscreen isn’t one screen, but several displays embedded in one solid piece of curved glass that spans the entire dash. Based on early images, there appear to be at least three screens embedded in the display: an instrument cluster behind the steering column, a central infotainment screen, and an additional screen facing the front passenger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wtsSdJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To be sure, the Hyperscreen isn’t one screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qo1mul"&gt;The Hyperscreen will first appear in the EQS, a luxury electric sedan that Mercedes has said will go into production in late 2021. It will be powered by MBUX, which is short for “Mercedes-Benz User Experience.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/2/16965682/mercedes-a-class-mbux-voice-assistant"&gt;First introduced in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, MBUX is one of the more capable automaker-created, voice-controlled infotainment systems on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ABQsU1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10270759"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xRfcMf"&gt;Mercedes says the Hyperscreen will include something called “zero layers,”  in which the user no longer has to scroll through a variety of sub-menus or give voice commands “as the most important applications are always available in a situational and contextual way at the top of the driver’s field of vision.” The automaker provided a couple of examples, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xLHA6h"&gt;If you always call one particular person on the way home on Tuesday evenings, you will be asked to make a corresponding call on that day of the week and that specific time of day. A business card appears with their contact information and – if it’s stored – their photo will appear. All MBUX suggestions are linked to the user’s profile. If someone else drives the EQS on a Tuesday evening, this recommendation would not be made – or another one is made, depending on the preferences of the other user.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="m2eHUP"&gt;The Hyperscreen will include a total of 12 actuators beneath the touch-sensitive surface for haptic feedback. Two coatings of the cover plate are said to reduce reflections and make cleaning easier. The curved glass itself consists of particularly scratch-resistant aluminum silicate. And analogue air vents are embedded in the surface at either end, offering an interesting blend of the digital and physical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q02gYB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;analogue air vents are embedded in the surface at either end&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kbu0PG"&gt;The Hyperscreen won’t appear in a production car until the late 2021 release of the EQS, but the new version MBUX will see its debut in the new S-Class, which was first unveiled late last year. The updated infotainment system will let drivers save various preferences like seat settings, interior lighting color, favorite radio station, and more. These personal profiles can be enabled or disabled by using the new security features, or even loaded in other Mercedes-Benz vehicles. A fingerprint sensor in the main touchscreen and voice recognition will come standard, and there is a PIN setting as well. Buyers can opt for a version of the car with cameras that allow for facial recognition, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUACGf"&gt;Vehicle touchscreens have grown larger over the years, with some automakers assuming that bigger equals better. Among production vehicles, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21126299/escalade-2021-oled-display-touchscreen-curved-glass"&gt;2021 Cadillac Escalade’s&lt;/a&gt; 14.2-inch screen is particularly noteworthy, as is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/15/16892836/ram-1500-carplay-android-auto-detroit-show-2018"&gt;2019 Ram 1500’s 12-inch screen&lt;/a&gt;. And the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;Cadillac Lyriq&lt;/a&gt; electric SUV is promising a mind-boggling 33-inch screen. The Tesla Model 3’s 15-inch screen, which floats above the dash rather than hugging the interior’s curves, has set the bar high for electric cars — one that Mercedes seems eager to vault over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKObOE"&gt;Of course, it remains to be seen how distracting to the driver all these screens will be. Without a robust driver monitoring system to ensure drivers stay focused on the road, these  ultra-large screens can be a huge liability and safety risk. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-seniors-autos/vehicle-infotainment-systems-dangerously-distracting-especially-for-seniors-idUSKCN1UK34F"&gt;A recent study by AAA found&lt;/a&gt; that many digital infotainment systems turning up in newer cars may be distracting enough to increase the risk for accidents, especially for older drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xGvPU"&gt;Mercedes says its zero layer feature will hopefully reduce driver distraction — though that will need to be proven out. “The goal was a concept without distraction of the driver or creating complicated operation,” Sajjad Khan, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz AG and CTO on the new MBUX generation, said in a press release. “We didn’t want to build the biggest screen ever in a car. Instead, we have developed special screens with a perfect ratio of size and functionality for maximum user-friendliness.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pandemic made everyone familiar with a decades-old immigrant tradition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OtQ7t0V3Yr6aWW1anulwQvGEPlw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68631821/acastro_210105_4358_immigrantVirtualGatherings_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;I grew up relying on technology to bring family together&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="axnCtG"&gt;The only thing that actually felt normal this holiday season was a video chat with my family on Christmas day. I logged on to a Facebook video call from New York City while my mom and brother called in from California. Aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces, and nephews joined from more states across the US, the UK, Canada, Qatar, and the Philippines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="O1ptwF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Finding ways to reach out over long distances is nothing new, it’s what we do in a diaspora&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pqp5ll"&gt;The platforms we’ve used to keep this tradition going have changed over the past few decades. Way before Zoom became the lifeline for staying connected during the pandemic, immigrant families like mine have had to rely on whatever technology was available to stay in touch. Finding ways to reach out over long distances is nothing new, it’s what we do in a diaspora. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tP18En"&gt;This year, I found myself glued to the screen all Christmas morning marveling at how much taller my nieces, nephews, and god kids have gotten since the last time I saw them in person — which in most cases, has been years. I’ve mostly watched them grow up on screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Igh2Nz"&gt;Before there were apps like Skype, it was even harder for us to connect. My dad moved to California from Manila not long after I was born to set up a life for us in America. Before my mom and I joined him, the only way my dad could see our faces was in photographs that my mom sent him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drib3N"&gt;“Daddy, just want to show you my complete set of teeth… and my dimple...” my mom scrawled on the back of a photo of two and a half-year-old me. Another copy of that picture would end up in my very first passport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OsHSpt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Skype was a game changer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ky2gTl"&gt;Once the three of us, plus my American-born brother, were all stateside, there were expensive, hurried calls with relatives in the Philippines on our landline. Those calls triggered another frantic game of telephone. You needed to corral the household so that each person could have a moment on the call. “Hurry, tell so-and-so to pick up the phone,” whoever was holding the receiver yelled out. “It’s long distance!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JddI6"&gt;Skype was a game-changer when it started offering free video calling in 2006. I remember logging on from the desktop computer in my parents’ bedroom when I was visiting home from college. There, I’d see my grandma in the Philippines squinting to make out our faces in the blurry webcam picture. Before then, just hearing her voice was an expensive luxury. Suddenly, it was free — and I could look her in the eye while we chatted for as long as we wanted. By 2009, I had my own Skype account separate from my parents, and it seemed like all my cousins, aunts, and uncles did, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTRq4R"&gt;Now, I have an entire folder of apps on my phone that my family uses for free, long distance calls. There are so many platforms to choose from that each of our calls tends to start with the question of whether we’re using the right app: will switching over to Viber or Facebook offer a better signal or be easier for elders on the call to use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0sFK67"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Those calls have seamlessly melded into in-person events&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EMJCJ6"&gt;Those calls have seamlessly melded into in-person events, too. My mom’s side of the family has held a reunion on New Year’s Day every year since before my mom was born. We’re a big family (my mom alone has eight siblings), so this is a big production. My mom rarely gets to attend in person, but she calls in every year. The last time I attended the reunion, in the Philippines in 2014, my mom was still in California. I called her from my laptop and set her up on a table with a good view of the party. Other relatives abroad made their rounds on cellphones passed around by guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxI1fo"&gt;For the first time in more than 60 years, the reunion didn’t take place in person this year. I still found comfort in talking with my family over another video chat on New Year’s Day, but it doesn’t make me miss them any less. The heartache is still there when the holidays are over. It will be there when the pandemic ends. Going home isn’t always as easy as taking a plane ride when you’re an immigrant. There’s lots of red tape and luck involved when it comes to crossing borders. And there still isn’t an app that will let me reach out and kiss my mom on the cheek, or pick up my nieces and nephews before they get too old for me to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIk8l9"&gt;For me, sacrificing physical togetherness for the promise of more security in the future was part of growing up. And while technology can’t fully bridge the distance between family members, it has made that separation easier to bear.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYi9lk"&gt;Video calls are now a standard way to connect with other family members who’ve fanned out around the world in search of a future with bigger possibilities. A staple of our family calls is help with finding work abroad and making a home for yourself in a new place. I’ve often heard it said that the Philippines’ biggest export is its own people. Its economy relies on over &lt;a href="https://psa.gov.ph/statistics/survey/labor-and-employment/survey-overseas-filipinos"&gt;2 million overseas workers, including a lot in health care&lt;/a&gt;, whose remittances make up about a tenth of the &lt;a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BX.TRF.PWKR.DT.GD.ZS?locations=PH"&gt;country’s GDP&lt;/a&gt;. The small archipelago nation is the world’s &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1955369/"&gt;leading supplier of nurses&lt;/a&gt; — including my mom, lots of other relatives, and the &lt;a href="https://www.asianjournal.com/world/europe/filipina-nurse-administers-first-covid-19-vaccine-in-uk/"&gt;nurse in the UK&lt;/a&gt; who administered the world’s very first authorized vaccine against COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WOO2rv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sacrificing physical togetherness for the promise of more security in the future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HixswH"&gt;Searching for opportunities far from home, however, has come with costs. We’re perpetually missing our loved ones. There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-23/philippines-sends-nurses-around-the-world-but-lacks-them-at-home"&gt;shortage&lt;/a&gt; of health care workers in the Philippines, and a &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-21/filipino-americans-dying-covid"&gt;disproportionately high number&lt;/a&gt; of Filipino Americans working on the frontlines of the pandemic have died from COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3S9zz"&gt;A lot of people around the world sacrificed time with family and turned to virtual celebrations this holiday season to stop the spread of COVID-19. For that, I’m thankful, because it keeps my mom and other family members who work in health care safer. There are other immigrant essential workers who are more exposed to the virus and who have for years held up industries that take care of the sick and elderly and that bring food to our tables — perhaps at the expense of being with their family and friends during the holidays. A video call will never be as fulfilling as sitting in the same room with the people we love. But it’s more than what some of us have had in the past or have access to even now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="S1vwmG"&gt;The photos my mom sent my dad of me while we were still living in the Philippines are now neatly bound in a photo album. They’re a reminder that resourcefulness in immigrant communities has been about more than finding ways to get ahead. We’ve found ways to stay connected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ed4997"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJwXJl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok debuts first augmented reality filter that uses iPhone 12 Pro’s LIDAR camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DygVw3ARrSiEzfSckTBv7MAI6U8=/0x61:1140x821/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68631739/Screen_Shot_2021_01_06_at_4.48.53_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uhmZUR"&gt;TikTok has released its first augmented reality filter that can utilize the iPhone 12 Pro’s LIDAR sensor for an enhanced confetti effect that realistically settles on people or objects in your room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2G3MoC"&gt;The effect itself is just a somewhat belated 2021 ball drop (which feels like it would have been a lot more useful a few days ago.) But the ball drop filter is just the start, with TikTok promising to “develop more innovative effects in 2021.” And the fact that one of the most popular video platforms in the world is jumping onboard with support for one of the marquee features on Apple’s more pricey and premium smartphones is certainly notable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To ring in 2021 we released our first AR effect on the new iPhone 12 Pro, using LiDAR technology which allows us to create effects that interact with your environment - visually bridging the digital and physical worlds. We're excited to develop more innovative effects in 2021! &lt;a href="https://t.co/6yFD2FfHta"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6yFD2FfHta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— TikTokComms (@tiktok_comms) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tiktok_comms/status/1346828242506969089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tAnqPi"&gt;TikTok isn’t the only major company with eyes on Apple’s LIDAR tech. Snapchat, one of the other major players when it comes to augmented reality filters, already added support for Apple’s LIDAR sensor &lt;a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/news/create-lidar-powered-lenses-for-the-new-iphone-12-pro/"&gt;back in October&lt;/a&gt;, allowing creators to build their own enhanced AR filters for the app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam is getting expanded Xbox controller support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xbox Elite Wireless Controller" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kbIAn2GfiZqIvxPpx81PAcTv6ds=/0x0:4896x3264/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68631540/xbox_3_correct.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GLB9PI"&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/2919986982661995356"&gt;beta update for Steam&lt;/a&gt; has added new features for gamers using Xbox controllers. One of the more interesting additions is for Xbox Elite controller users, who can now use Valve’s software to bind the accessory’s rear paddles in controller configurations. The feature gives players more flexibility with how to use the extra inputs on the premium controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdDjxD"&gt;Other updates for Xbox controllers include the ability to bind the Series X gamepad’s share button in controller configurations, and the ability to use more than four Xbox controllers with Steam at a time. Support for trigger rumble has also been added for games using the Windows.Gaming.Input API. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GZsCpJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are also new features in store for PS5 controller users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pVBvQb"&gt;The Steam beta client also includes a new drop down menu for PS5 controller users, which lets them customize the controller’s LED. It can now be permanently enabled or disabled, or else enabled only when multiple controllers are connected. The update also adds support for the &lt;a href="https://wooting.io/wootingtwo"&gt;Wooting Two keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, which has features like analog key input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtUcUy"&gt;For now, these new features are only available in Steam’s beta client, which you can opt into by going into the Settings menu, selecting Account, and using the drop-down menu in the Beta participation section. The Xbox controller features will also need to be enabled in the General Controller Setting section of Steam’s settings, and require a driver to be installed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple celebrates the Year of the Ox with limited AirPods Pro in Asia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZAYDEQaWLHOnr3Xhm3MR9sUB6Q=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68631509/app.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="reHh0q"&gt;February 12th marks the first day of Lunar New Year, with 2021 ushering in the Year of the Ox and saying farewell to the Year of the Rat. To celebrate, Apple is releasing limited edition AirPods Pro in certain Asian countries, with a case branded with a new version of the cow emoji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXbijB"&gt;Apple has also given an ox-themed makeover to its logo on some regional versions of its website:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pOcnU-kbNPaBIotVqc7JfIuWLA8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219378/Screen_Shot_2021_01_07_at_17.17.28.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V4eMsW"&gt;The special edition AirPods Pro sell for the same price as the regular AirPods Pro, which is just as well considering you can order those with any text or emoji you want engraved on the case for free. They’re 1,999 yuan ($310) &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com.cn/shop/product/MJ533CH/A"&gt;in mainland China&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and they’re also for sale in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLV6w4"&gt;Apple is limiting orders to two per customer, and the AirPods Pro will only be available at retail Apple Stores as well as Apple’s local websites in each region. The Year of the Ox only comes around once every 12 years, though, so if you do buy these you may end up wanting to swap them out for a tiger-themed model in a year’s time — assuming Apple decides to release one. &lt;/p&gt;
