    <title>Spider-Man: No Way Home’s latest trailer brings back all the bad guys</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fqimi6AN7ndTuRIq13Iau3NcJ9w=/0x9:1150x776/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70152399/Screen_Shot_2021_11_16_at_5.35.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5SZbcM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA"&gt;The latest trailer&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; has arrived, bringing with it some big surprises for Spider-Man’s latest MCU outing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRPZIY"&gt;If you’re trying to go into the latest adventure of the web-slinging hero without spoilers, you’ll probably want to skip hitting play here (or reading the rest of this post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCR0KK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: Far From Home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; below: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73BP60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638877/spider-man-no-way-home-first-trailer"&gt;As revealed in the first trailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; picks up right where &lt;em&gt;Far From Home&lt;/em&gt; left off: with Peter Parker’s secret identity as Spider-Man revealed to the world, something that Peter tries to enlist Doctor Strange’s (Benedict Cumberbatch) assistance in rectifying. Magical multiverse hijinks ensue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWdKJs"&gt;Things appear to go wrong, though, resulting in appearances from a plethora of Spidey rogues from Sony’s past Spider-Man franchises (before the MCU was ever around), including &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;’s Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt;’s Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), and &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt;’s Electro (Jamie Foxx). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTXezy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; hits theaters on December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 DIY screen replacements don’t break Face ID in iOS 15.2 beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u11MpV1qW74-jkRK0vySgc-cvBw=/0x0:1995x1330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70152317/vpavic_210916_untitled_0031.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GqHPpW"&gt;Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772433/apple-iphone-13-screen-replacements-face-id-software-update"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; that it would be rolling out a software update to iPhone 13 devices to make it easier to replace their screens without breaking Face ID, but it didn’t specify when that update might arrive. Fortunately, we may not have to wait long, as repair experts say they have successfully completed the easier screen swaps on iPhone 13 handsets running the iOS 15.2 beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQBnMV"&gt;Before the update, keeping Face ID working after swapping the screens also required moving over a microcontroller from the original phone to the new one. Doing so is a complex process, and having to do it for every iPhone 13 that needs a new screen could make things difficult for indie repair shops. (You can read all about the issue &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54829%2Fapples-new-screen-repair-trap-could-change-the-repair-industry-forever&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F16%2F22786274%2Fapple-iphone-13-screen-replacement-face-id-ios-15-2-beta-fixes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in an article from &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) But on an iPhone 13 loaded with the iOS 15.2 beta, &lt;em&gt;iCorrect&lt;/em&gt; says Face ID &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f9oFrfXq5o"&gt;still worked&lt;/a&gt; after a screen swap &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; without having to bring over the microcontroller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NreKtM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0f9oFrfXq5o?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UTblbM"&gt;Although Face ID still works, the screen-swapped iPhone 13 does show an “Important Display Message” warning that the device can’t verify is the screen is a “genuine Apple part” — even though &lt;em&gt;iCorrect&lt;/em&gt; says the screen actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a genuine part. This isn’t entirely out of the norm for Apple, though, which shows similar warnings on some iPhones following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20805744/apple-iphone-battery-replacements-ios-safety-statement-unauthorized"&gt;battery replacements&lt;/a&gt; from unauthorized repair shops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xG67U"&gt;Apple didn’t reply when we asked if it could confirm that iOS 15.2 is the version that will allow for the easier screen replacements when it’s released publicly. But given that the less-intensive screen swaps appear to work on the beta, it seems likely they will work in the final release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Star Trek: Discovery is leaving Netflix tonight before heading to Paramount Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4psyHWs6x0LViNAW2r9BRqXIp0s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70152173/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rAm0Au"&gt;Paramount Plus is grabbing back its &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; series from Netflix, where it’s been streaming to international viewers for three seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dw8uZ"&gt;The series lived on Paramount Plus (fka CBS All Access) for US viewers and on Canada’s CTV Sci-Fi Channel, but the move will bring old and future seasons of the series under a single streaming umbrella for folks outside of those regions. Season 4 of &lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/star-trek-discovery-season-4-trailer-premiere-date-1235084921/"&gt;had previously been set&lt;/a&gt; to debut on Paramount Plus in the US, CTV Sci-Fi Channel, and on Netflix elsewhere on November 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7ssWu"&gt;The show will leave Netflix at 12AM PT in regions where it had previously been available to stream. (It will remain on Bell Media’s CTV Sci-Fi Channel and stream on the Crave in Canada.) All seasons of the show will become available to international viewers in 2022, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/11/star-trek-discovery-netflix-deal-paramount-viacomcbs-1234875466/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="07CZqw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To our international &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StarTrekDiscovery?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StarTrekDiscovery&lt;/a&gt; fans... &lt;a href="https://t.co/QATQzHxepK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QATQzHxepK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Star Trek on Paramount+ (@StarTrekOnPPlus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarTrekOnPPlus/status/1460714359588483074?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z337vx"&gt;The plan to grab back some of its IP comes as the company focuses on a wider international expansion heading into next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRSDPt"&gt;“As we rapidly expand our global streaming footprint, we are bringing more of our top titles home to ViacomCBS for Paramount+ markets around the world,” Kelly Day, president of streaming for ViacomCBS Networks International, said in a statement. “We have a strong global and local content pipeline that positions us for success across our regions, and repatriating beloved series like &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; for Paramount+ is another step forward as we bring fans more must-watch series worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCfpdS"&gt;According to the company, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; will become available internationally to Paramount Plus subscribers in 2022 in regions where the service is currently available. Paramount Plus is currently available in 25 countries but says it plans to expand to 45 markets by the end of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nNqgj"&gt;Uniting — for the most part — its &lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; series in a single hub for international audiences doesn’t quite fix the fractured state of the sprawling Star Trek library, however. &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Picard&lt;/em&gt; will still be on Amazon for streamers outside Canada and the US. As stated, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; will continue to stream on non-Paramount Plus channels in Canada. And lastly, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Lower Decks&lt;/em&gt; will stay on Amazon outside of Latin America, Canada, and the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s Arm acquisition undergoes more scrutiny by the UK government </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XkI3LzuxCAe53S-o5F9sVD12dpA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70152004/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jkhc4Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;Nvidia’s $40 billion proposed acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of the Brtish chip designer, Arm, will undergo an even more in-depth investigation by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/16/nvidias-arm-takeover-faces-uk-national-security-inquiry.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A notice on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/proposed-acquisition-of-arm-limited-by-nvidia-corporation-phase-1-report-and-phase-2-reference-under-section-454-of-the-enterprise-act-2002"&gt;UK government’s website&lt;/a&gt; confirms that Nadine Dorries, the UK’s Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport, ordered the CMA to launch a Phase 2 investigation. The probe will take place over a 24-week period and will scrutinize &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391744/nvidia-arm-acquisition-uk-competition-regulator-cma-investigation-national-security-grounds"&gt;potential national security risks&lt;/a&gt; and competition concerns associated with the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovsKsd"&gt;The CMA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634379/nvidia-arm-aquisition-delay-uk-phase-2-investigation"&gt;completed its Phase 1 probe&lt;/a&gt; in August — which you can now read in its entirety as a &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1033732/GOV.UK_-_NVIDIA_Arm_-_CMA_Report_to_DCMS__Web_Accessible_.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; — with CMA’s chief executive &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-finds-competition-concerns-with-nvidia-s-purchase-of-arm"&gt;Andrea Coscelli commenting that&lt;/a&gt; “NVIDIA controlling Arm could create real problems for NVIDIA’s rivals by limiting their access to key technologies.” It recommended a Phase 2 investigation at the time, so Dorries’ choice to take the next steps doesn’t come as much of a shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KNb1bu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang initially gave its acquisition of ARM a March 2022 deadline&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nvgXZq"&gt;In addition to the CMA, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22266504/nvidia-arm-deal-eu-formal-investigation-merger"&gt;the EU launched its own investigation into the acquisition&lt;/a&gt; late last month, on the account that acquiring Arm may give Nvidia an unfair edge. This will likely drag out the deal even more, and that doesn’t include the possible investigations that may be conducted by the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95h89j"&gt;Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang initially gave the company’s acquisition of Arm a March 2022 deadline, but with regulators closely scrutinizing the deal, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/5/12798302/softbank-arm-acquisition-complete"&gt;he admitted that it may take much longer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/5/12798302/softbank-arm-acquisition-complete"&gt;Arm was bought out by the Japanese company SoftBank&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 in a deal valued at $31 billion. The chip designer is considered neutral territory in the world of tech, as it licenses out schematics to tech giants such as Samsung, Apple, and Qualcomm, which then manufacture and install the hardware in their own devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4qK2R"&gt;Since Nvidia actively competes with many of Arm’s customers, regulators worry that Nvidia may put other companies at a disadvantage, possibly preventing Arm from designing more powerful chips for Nvidia’s competitors. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns"&gt;Microsoft, Google, and Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; possess the same fear — Nvidia has the power to choose how Arm makes designs, what companies it sells them to, and at what price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keAKiU"&gt;Not only could an anti-competitive outcome like this affect Nvidia’s competitors, but it would also impact consumers. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; has already made it difficult to buy certain items, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701878/xbox-phil-spencer-supply-constraints-2022"&gt;Xbox Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"&gt;new graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, and if Nvidia decides to use Arm to give itself special treatment, the chips that are available might have worse performance or cost more than they already do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber reintroduces shared rides with a new name</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Uber logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CCjwVJW7Da3aGqgfXJiUBGDtypM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70151970/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cWvUoh"&gt;Uber is bringing back shared rides with a new name: UberX Share. The revamped carpooling product is available first as a pilot in Miami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vPzot"&gt;Uber suspended its Uber Pool carpooling feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183276/uber-uberpool-suspension-coronavirus-us-canada-carpool-pandemic"&gt;in March 2020&lt;/a&gt; in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the company promised earlier this month that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22764246/uber-pool-prices-shared-ride-covid-earnings"&gt;planned to bring shared rides back&lt;/a&gt;. Uber prices have gone way up recently, so a carpooling option allows the company to offer cheaper costs that could make taking an Uber a more popular transportation option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2N7ZD"&gt;On an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fride%2Fuberx-share%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F16%2F22786147%2Fuber-uberx-share-rides-carpooling-new-name" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;UberX Share ride&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll only ride with one other person (in addition to the driver) during your trip. Everyone in the car must wear a mask, even if they are all vaccinated. UberX Share rides will have a 5 percent discount, and you’ll get &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fride%2Fhow-it-works%2Fuber-cash%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DUber%2520Cash%2520can%2520be%2520used%2Cfor%2520orders%2520with%2520Uber%2520Eats.%26text%3DYes%252C%2520you%2520can%2520pay%2520with%2Cis%2520available%2520in%2520select%2520markets.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F16%2F22786147%2Fuber-uberx-share-rides-carpooling-new-name" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Uber Cash&lt;/a&gt; if another person is picked up during your trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Bw33uG"&gt;It’s unclear when UberX Share might expand, and the company said Tuesday it didn’t have anything additional to share about future rollout plans to other cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DjwyfF"&gt;Uber rival Lyft brought back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578402/lyft-shared-rides-rideshare-back"&gt;shared rides in July&lt;/a&gt; after also suspending the feature in March 2020. Similar to Uber, only one other rider can join, and everyone &lt;a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/e/articles/115013078848-Lyft-Shared-rides-for-riders"&gt;must wear a mask&lt;/a&gt;. Lyft’s shared rides launched in Chicago, Denver, and Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senate confirms Google critic to lead DOJ antitrust division</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AC6tZT"&gt;On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Google critic and competition lawyer Jonathan Kanter to lead the Justice Department’s antitrust division, marking yet another progressive win in antitrust enforcement under the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQf7kb"&gt;Kanter has a long history representing tech companies, like Yelp and Microsoft, in lawsuits accusing Google of anti-competitive behavior. Now that he’s been confirmed, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585590/joe-biden-jonathan-kanter-antitrust-lina-khan-tim-wu-google"&gt;Kanter will lead several Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; competition cases against big tech, including a monopoly lawsuit against Google alleging that the company maintains an illegal monopoly in the digital ads market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NA0xdO"&gt;“Throughout his career, Kanter has [sic] been a leading advocate and expert in the effort to promote strong and meaningful antitrust enforcement and competition policy,” the White House said in a statement over the summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wKa4yl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kanter is just the latest progressive favorite confirmed to lead the federal government’s crackdown on tech companies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uYsumk"&gt;Kanter is just the latest progressive favorite confirmed to lead the federal government’s crackdown on tech companies like Facebook and Google. In June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;the Senate confirmed Lina Khan&lt;/a&gt; to chair the Federal Trade Commission. Khan first rose to prominence as a law student after authoring a 2017 paper titled “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” The paper argued that the government needs new antitrust laws to prevent anti-competitive conduct in the tech industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05OtEd"&gt;The FTC has the authority to sue companies for anti-competitive behavior, and the agency is currently enmeshed in litigation against Facebook and Google. Kanter aligns closely with Khan and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315224/tim-wu-net-neutrality-antitrust-big-tech-biden-administration-national-economic-council"&gt;progressive antitrust scholar Tim Wu&lt;/a&gt;, who currently sits on the National Economic Council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SixUj5"&gt;Kanter’s history of leading lawsuits against big tech companies in the past has led to calls from critics for him to recuse himself from the DOJ’s active antitrust cases against Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6W889"&gt;“Given that Kanter is famous for representing Microsoft and Yelp and attacking Google, Kanter will raise questions about his ability to impartially enforce the law against tech businesses, just like FTC Chair Khan,” said NetChoice vice president and general counsel Carl Szabo in a statement this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xq1oh5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Universal’s new contracts will make it more difficult for artists to rerecord their work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Saturday Night Live - Season 47" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nsc0qxhoHIP3lKOLYP2MVuOBefk=/524x361:2424x1628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70151692/1236560335.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By: Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YhinUA"&gt;Universal Music Group is modifying its contracts to extend the period in which an artist can rerecord their music, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-taylor-swift-rerecorded-her-red-album-universal-reworked-contracts-11636741201"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The move comes after the success of Taylor Swift’s rerecorded albums and the music label’s effort to gain more rights from artists who decide to rerecord their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1sh3P"&gt;Before, a standard contract stated that an artist couldn’t rerecord their work five years after their last delivered recording or two years after the end of their contract term, whichever is later. The new format increases the time after recording to seven years and the time after a contract term to five years, &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDIcZA"&gt;Swift owns the music composition rights to her music. Her first label, Big Machine Records, sold the rights to her master recordings (the final version we hear) to an investment firm in 2019. Her masters were reportedly &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/music/news/scooter-braun-sells-taylor-swift-big-machine-masters-1234832080/"&gt;later sold to an investment fund&lt;/a&gt; for over $300 million in 2020, which was also around the time she was free to rerecord her music. So far, she has rerecorded and released her 2008 album &lt;em&gt;Fearless&lt;/em&gt; and her 2012 album &lt;em&gt;Red&lt;/em&gt;, with “(Taylor’s Version)” in the album title to distinguish ownership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwoTRX"&gt;Music labels have gradually been losing their grip on their power and influence on the music industry with the rise of music streaming platforms like Apple Music and Spotify. One impact of music streaming platforms in the industry is a change in the way business is done because artists can release and promote their own work without the help of a label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fon7Mj"&gt;This change will prevent an artist from creating competition during the recording’s biggest monetization period within the first 10 years, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrBpyD"&gt;Universal’s change is likely to set a standard for other recording companies. With artists who are wanting to start out, this is another consideration for how they interact with labels and their work. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lucid Motors passes Ford’s market cap four years after it nearly got bought</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QPAgGan5uW8uXFixoWh8xzXKDgw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70151615/ahawkins_210623_4646_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gQwQ02"&gt;Four years after Ford was reportedly considering buying Lucid Motors, the EV startup is now worth more than the Detroit automaker. Lucid Motors’ market capitalization passed Ford’s on Tuesday, one day after the startup reported its &lt;a href="https://ir.lucidmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lucid-announces-third-quarter-2021-financial-results-and-lucid"&gt;first quarterly financial results&lt;/a&gt; as a publicly traded company and just a few weeks after it started shipping its luxury electric sedan, the Air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0roY9M"&gt;Lucid Motors has a comparatively long history for an EV startup as it was founded in 2007 as a battery company called Atieva. But after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/13723308/lucid-motors-vs-tesla-electric-luxury-car-concept-design"&gt;a 2016 pivot to making an electric sedan&lt;/a&gt;, Lucid Motors found itself running out of money at a time when others were starting to take off. One of the options it turned to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/20/15999024/lucid-motors-ford-funding-tesla-electric-car"&gt;was a potential Ford acquisition&lt;/a&gt;. From a July 2017 report in &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AvpXUJ"&gt;Lucid began its fourth round of institutional fundraising earlier this year, with the help of investment bank Morgan Stanley. Ford’s acquisition offer came as a surprise, said a source close to Lucid: “The bank approached Ford to see if they wanted to participate in the Series D. They came back and said they wanted to acquire.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="naaTTy"&gt;That never happened, though, and Lucid Motors ultimately treaded water until striking a massive deal with Saudi Arabia, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594177/lucid-motors-spac-nasdaq-saudi-arabia-ev-startup"&gt;now owns a majority of the startup&lt;/a&gt;. Ford, for its part, was able to work out a pretty sizable investment of its own into Rivian — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/7/22768373/go-read-this-gm-deal-ford-rivian-fell-apart"&gt;a deal it swiped out from under rival General Motors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyrySg"&gt;In the years since, Lucid Motors spent billions of dollars of Saudi Arabia’s money getting the Air EV ready for production. The startup revealed Monday that it has lost more than $1.5 billion this year alone in the mad dash to start shipping the Air to customers and has spent some $5 billion across its lifetime.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7Patx"&gt;The stock market — which has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;extremely hot on electric vehicle startups lately&lt;/a&gt; — rewarded that effort Tuesday, pushing Lucid Motors’ valuation to nearly $90 billion. Ford finished the day at about $79 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyiMuK"&gt;Lucid Motors still has a lot of work ahead. The startup is still building out its new factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, and says it plans to build 20,000 Air sedans in 2022 before adding an electric SUV to its lineup at the end of the following year. It will be challenging work, to be sure. Today, at least, the market treated that to-do list as pretty much pure upside.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram may soon ask users to verify themselves with video selfies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rpFX3VzndJ99zzY4L5Z6EbgRllw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70151611/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JdMg34"&gt;Instagram is asking some users to provide a video selfie showing multiple angles of their face to verify that they’re a real person, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1460341104667201536"&gt;screenshots posted to Twitter&lt;/a&gt; by social media consultant Matt Navarra. The social network has long struggled with bot accounts, which can leave spam messages, harass people, or be used to artificially inflate like or follower counts, and it’s possible that Meta (formerly Facebook, Instagram’s parent company) is looking to this feature to help curb the prevalence of bots on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msLUZ6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/instagram-video-selfie-verification/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company started testing the feature last year but ran into technical issues. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vicente_vma/status/1460517235055808515?s=20"&gt;Multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/darvi_sh/status/1459191474332000258?s=20"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StellarHeather/status/1459991213600296964?s=20"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Shannon79053723/status/1457754879578025987?s=20"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; being asked to take a video selfie to verify their existing accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0zQbHv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instagram is now using video selfies to confirm users identity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meta promises not to collect biometric data. &lt;a href="https://t.co/FNT2AdW8H2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/FNT2AdW8H2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1460341104667201536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ksIGUz"&gt;Another writer on Twitter, Bettina Makalintal, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bettinamak/status/1460306493207715840?s=20"&gt;posted a screenshot&lt;/a&gt; of the help screen for the step where you actually take the video selfie — it reiterates that it’s looking at “all angles of your face” to prove that you’re a real person and shows that the verification screen is showing up for multiple people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uYlNEC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;why the fuck is instagram making me take a video selfie in order to access my account &lt;a href="https://t.co/BxSW0Bnodt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BxSW0Bnodt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— tender juicy tofu pup (@bettinamak) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bettinamak/status/1460306493207715840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1SMgb7"&gt;It’s unclear whether this feature is currently a test or slowly rolling out — I made several attempts at setting up a sketchy-looking Instagram account and was never presented with the video challenge. Meta didn’t immediately respond to request for comment about the feature or its rollout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcerUu"&gt;The move may surprise some, given &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/update-on-use-of-face-recognition/"&gt;Meta’s recent announcement&lt;/a&gt; that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759613/meta-facebook-face-recognition-automatic-tagging-feature-shutdown"&gt;shutting down one of its Face Recognition features&lt;/a&gt;. As the company has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22761598/facebook-facial-recognition-meta"&gt;since reiterated&lt;/a&gt;, though, it was only shutting down a specific Facebook feature, not Meta’s use of facial recognition as a whole. The message on the bottom of the screenshot also implies that the feature won’t use face recognition at all and that the video will be deleted after 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6F5pR0"&gt;Meta’s promise to not store or post the data may not reassure some users who are already distrustful of Facebook. People may remember the time when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189494/facebook-bug-instagram-email-birthdays-messages"&gt;a bug let attackers access&lt;/a&gt; Instagram users’ supposedly private birthday info (which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648578/instagram-age-birthday-requirement-younger-people-ai-verification"&gt;you’ll soon be required to provide to use the app&lt;/a&gt;) with just a DM. Of course, Instagram hadn’t promised to delete that birthday info like it says it’ll do with the video selfie, but it’d be hard to blame people (especially minors or those who want to stay anonymous) for feeling uncomfortable with providing that data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech reworked its G303 mouse just for Shroud, but you can buy it, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech G303 Shroud Edition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6TQU-xhN8wMmUsWPUqCgzvzs17w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70151247/g303shroudhero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A top and bottom view of the new, wireless G303.&lt;/em&gt; | Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3yz6g5"&gt;Logitech has announced the G303 wireless gaming mouse. It’s a little more than just a cordless version of the G303 Daedalus mouse that the company released several years ago. Both a prolific streamer and pro gamer, Michael “Shroud” Grzesiek seemingly got to call the shots for how this revised version would look and feel — even down to requiring that it charged via USB-C. I doubt that he had any input on the price, though. It costs $129.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gtWrT"&gt;Logitech says that in this collaboration, it was decided by Shroud that the mouse should have “subtle markings approximating Shroud’s finger grip positions, translucent side panels to allow a window into the technology that Shroud wanted to see, and USB-C connections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPjj7L"&gt;To me, the overall shape of the newer mouse looks nearly identical to the older G303 mouse, save for a few tweaks. Logitech says it repositioned side buttons, and on the inside, it changed the switch location. I think the most noticeable difference is the lack of RGB lighting (there’s just a battery indicator light near the scroll wheel). Logitech has been trending toward more subtle designs for its mice recently, and I’m all for it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G303 Shroud Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EXyEHjIOKkiz3JCEMAi6KAOugbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23008949/g303shroudinline.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Underneath the side buttons, the G303 transitions to translucent plastic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="he4Ob9"&gt;The G303 wireless mouse is lightweight at 75 grams, though if you’re looking for the most feather-light wireless mouse under Logitech’s umbrella, check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21562618/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-wireless-gaming-mouse-release-date-price-features-weight"&gt;the G Pro X Superlight&lt;/a&gt;, which weighs around 63 grams. Logitech claims that this new G303 model can last up to 145 hours per charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOeUU7"&gt;Included in the box along with the mouse is a USB-C to USB-A cable that’s used for charging the G303, as well as serving as an extender for the USB-A dongle. Also in the box is a new USB-A to USB-C converter that allows the cable to interface with the dongle. The G303 Shroud Edition, as it’s being referred to, is available now through Logitech G’s site for $129.99. I’ll be testing it more in the coming weeks for an upcoming update to our best gaming mice buying guide, so stay tuned for that. &lt;/p&gt;
