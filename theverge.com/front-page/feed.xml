    <title>Google One adds a 5TB storage plan for $24.99 per month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_2JiA-97ZSPYtyZ8-VywoPadcOs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69845524/mdoying_180117_2249_0281stills.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sn2cMk"&gt;After it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561171/photo-storage-service-google-amazon-flickr"&gt;ended free unlimited storage &lt;/a&gt;for Google Photos in June, many Google users had figure out how to store images and other data in the Google accounts. They could keep their Google account stored data under 15GB, or pay for a Google One plan. Options included a 100GB plan for $1.99 per month, a 200GB plan for $2.99 a month, a 2TB plan for $9.99 a month, or a plan with 10TB of storage for $49.99 per month. 20TB and 30TB plans are also available, for $99.99 and $149.99 per month, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gtgy76"&gt;Now Google’s introduced a middle option between 2TB and 10TB, as noticed by &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/11/google-5tb-one-storage-plan/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://one.google.com/storage"&gt;5TB Google One plan&lt;/a&gt; costs $24.99 per month, a good (and less expensive) option for people who want a little more than 2TB but don’t quite need a plan with 10TB of storage or more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="76Hqjt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to choose an alternative to Google Photos — if you want one","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21561171/photo-storage-service-google-amazon-flickr"},{"title":"How to share your Google One storage with your family","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22543606/google-one-storage-share-family-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rX5Uns"&gt;If you’re sure the 5TB plan will meet your needs, you can save a little money by prepaying for a year’s subscription; it will run you $249.99. Like the 2TB and 10TB plans, the 5TB plan also includes 10 percent off Google Store purchases, the option to add family members, access to Google experts, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21541032/google-one-vpn-cloud-storage-subscription"&gt;VPN for Android&lt;/a&gt; phones. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reportedly gave some users’ data to Hong Kong authorities in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OtA4ChznIJ_h1r8ryH0QM9tGjZA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69845427/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AGWy4c"&gt;Google provided some user data to the government of Hong Kong last year, despite promising it would not process such data requests from authorities, according to the &lt;a href="https://hongkongfp.com/2021/09/11/google-handed-user-data-to-hong-kong-authorities-despite-pledge-after-security-law-was-enacted/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hong Kong Free Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company told the news outlet it “produced some data” in response to three of the 43 requests it received from Hong Kong’s government. Two of the requests had to do with investigations into human trafficking and included search warrants, and a third was an emergency disclosure as part of a credible threat to someone’s life, &lt;em&gt;HKFP &lt;/em&gt;reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3smXc"&gt;The company told &lt;em&gt;HKFP&lt;/em&gt; that none of the three responses included users’ content data.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRTpwc"&gt;Last August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21314900/google-facebook-twitter-hong-kong-government-data-china"&gt;Google said it would stop responding&lt;/a&gt; to data requests from Hong Kong’s government, unless the requests were made in cooperation with the US Department of Justice. The move was in response to a new Hong Kong national security law imposed by China, which included a possible sentence of life in prison for people found guilty of subversion. China has used subversion charges to detain political protesters and dissidents in the Chinese mainland. Facebook and Twitter also halted the processing of data requests from Hong Kong’s government in response to the security law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRj7WO"&gt;Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3HAU1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL won’t release a foldable smartphone this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2020 World 5G Convention" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1sMJHfoe7g0PsiwEx_kaf-ZmJvk=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69844847/1288191697.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;TCL won’t release a foldable phone in 2021 | Photo by Li Zhihao/VCG via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dyG2CT"&gt;Electronics company TCL is pausing its plans release a lower-cost foldable phone this year, the company confirmed in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; Its clamshell-style foldable phone, codenamed Project Chicago, was in mid-development when the company made the decision to put it on indefinite hold. According to TCL the delay is due in part to rising production costs and supply chain shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZkmUG"&gt;“Although the foldable market is growing each year, it is still a premium product category,” Stefan Streit, chief marketing officer of TCL said in a statement t&lt;em&gt;o The Verge. &lt;/em&gt; “In combination with recent component shortages, the COVID-19 pandemic and rising costs in foldable production, TCL has made the difficult decision to suspend the launch of its first commercially available foldable smartphone until the company can produce and bring it to market at a price point that’s accessible to as many consumers as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdOmRe"&gt;Streit added that the company is “closely monitoring the market to determine the best time to launch a foldable smartphone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HzjOj"&gt;The company gave out a few sample devices to reviewers (looks like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmJJvzrGODk&amp;amp;ab_channel=MrMobile%5BMichaelFisher%5D"&gt;MrMobile got their hands on one&lt;/a&gt;) , but said it did not have any additional devices available, or any photos of Chicago to share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLt1bP"&gt;The news comes a few weeks after the launch of Samsung’s latest foldable devices: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; (TCL decided to pause its Chicago device before Samsung’s launch) But both of the foldable Samsung phones are on the higher end of the price range; the Flip 3 goes for $999, and the Fold 3 is priced at $1,799.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jo7aU9"&gt;TCL &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/3/5/21165069/tcl-foldable-trifold-phone-hands-on-rollable-concept-prototype-display-tablet"&gt;showed off a few foldable&lt;/a&gt; prototypes last year, and again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;earlier this year at CES 2021&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a “rollable” screen design. In April &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383668/tcl-fold-n-roll-concept-rollable-phone-tablet"&gt;TCL showed off a Fold ‘n Roll&lt;/a&gt; device that could expand from a 6.87-inch phone screen to become an 8.85-inch phablet, or a 10-inch tablet size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCYO0w"&gt;The company says it’s not giving up on the foldable product category but doesn’t have a time frame for when its first foldable device may be commercially available. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now buy a $475 NFT ticket to see Beeple’s $69 million NFT at an IRL party</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BJk7wCHQmPfQiilBZZ3ATt_VMXI=/0x112:1858x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69844723/Screen_Shot_2021_09_10_at_5.58.33_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The NFT tickets, seen above, change after they’re scanned. | Image: Dreamverse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f8jlr7"&gt;We can all agree &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt; are kind of weird, so here’s another twist to puzzle over: in November, you’ll be able to see the “inaugural display” of &lt;em&gt;The First 5000 Days&lt;/em&gt;, the collage/NFT that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;Beeple sold for $69 million&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. You can also, obviously, view the image right now, for free, wherever you are, on whatever device you’re using, by searching that title on Google. You could also pull the image up on your TV, or display it on a projector, or print it out, because that’s how digital images work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zh5eE"&gt;Here, look, I’m just going to embed a tweet with the image in it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pF3clf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Christie's is proud to offer "Everydays - The First 5000 Days" by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/beeple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@beeple&lt;/a&gt; as the first purely digital work of art ever offered by a major auction house. Bidding will be open from Feb 25-Mar 11.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more here &lt;a href="https://t.co/srx95HCE0o"&gt;https://t.co/srx95HCE0o&lt;/a&gt; | NFT issued in partnership w/ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/makersplaceco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@makersplaceco&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/zymq2DSjy7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zymq2DSjy7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Christie's (@ChristiesInc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChristiesInc/status/1361670588608176128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lFvqkU"&gt;The meaningful twist for this party is that it will feature the first &lt;em&gt;authorized &lt;/em&gt;public projection of &lt;em&gt;The First 5000 Days&lt;/em&gt;. That means the image’s owner, Metapurse, the crypto fund run by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327594/metakovan-beeple-highest-auction-price-69-million-nft"&gt;the pseudonymous investor Metakovan&lt;/a&gt;, is taking its one-and-only authentic copy of the image (or at the very least, its nominally exclusive display rights) and using them to put this piece of artwork up for a night as though it were being temporarily shown in a gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUpQSw"&gt;So I guess the question is: is it cool to see the “authorized” debut of an image you can already see any time you want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iND9Of"&gt;My guess is, for at least some people, the answer is yes. It might be akin to waiting in line to buy something at Supreme instead of ordering a knockoff, or seeing a re-release of a movie in theaters that’s been out for years and you can just as well watch at home. Maybe &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;don’t want to spend the money on that, but surely some people do. (I don’t, mostly. Although I did pay to see the 2005 &lt;em&gt;Pride &amp;amp; Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; at Alamo Drafthouse a couple years ago, despite owning a digital copy of it at home. It looked very good on the big screen.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFmFhK"&gt;One selling point for seeing it IRL? “The inaugural showcase of the work will be projected on a bespoke three-story-tall hybrid physical and digital structure,” according to Metapurse. IMO, big artworks are often the coolest artworks, so I think this has some real potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VdxtMt"&gt;If you’re interested, the image will be shown as part of an NFT event in New York City in November. The event, called &lt;a href="https://dreamverse.life/index.html"&gt;Dreamverse New York&lt;/a&gt;, will be split into two parts. There’ll be a gallery during the day, which will showcase more than 150 artists in an “interactive digital art experience.” Then at night, there’ll be a party and, notably, the display of Beeple’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfX3BM"&gt;Tickets start at $150 for a plain ol’ ticket to the party. If you want an &lt;em&gt;NFT ticket&lt;/em&gt; (of course you do), you’ll have to pay at least $475 to get into the party. If you just want to attend the gallery, you can get an NFT ticket for $30.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook reportedly provided inaccurate data to misinformation researchers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e5V18KG7clm723TJMkgjI-8cx4Y=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69844681/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0f0Yon"&gt;Facebook apologized to misinformation researchers for providing them with flawed, incomplete data for their work examining how users interact with posts and links on its platform, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/2020-election-misinformation-distortions#facebook-sent-flawed-data-to-misinformation-researchers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. Contrary to what the company told the researchers, the data Facebook provided apparently only included information for roughly half of its users in the US, not all of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gpHHc"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that members of Facebook’s Open Research and Transparency team held a call with researchers on Friday to apologize for the error. Some of the researchers questioned whether the mistake was intentional to sabotage the research, or simply an instance of negligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXCFAP"&gt;The flaw in the data was first discovered by a researcher at Italy’s University of Urbino, who compared a report Facebook released publicly in August to the data it had provided solely to the researchers. The data sets didn’t match up, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLB2QS"&gt;Facebook didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday, but a spokesperson told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that the mistake was the result of a technical error and the company “proactively told impacted partners about and are working swiftly to resolve” the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2ikCu"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/widely-viewed-content-report/"&gt;report from August 18th&lt;/a&gt; that the University of Urbino researcher used in his comparison was released in the interest of “transparency,” showing the most-viewed content in Facebook’s public News Feed between April and June of this year, its second quarter. However, the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;discovered that Facebook had &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/technology/facebook-popular-posts.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;shelved a report&lt;/a&gt; about its first quarter that portrayed the company in a much-less flattering light. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/22/22636508/facebook-releases-shelved-content-transparency-report-content-coronavirus"&gt;Facebook eventually released&lt;/a&gt; the shelved report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXbcZg"&gt;Also in August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609020/facebook-bans-academic-researchers-ad-transparency-misinformation-nyu-ad-observatory-plug-in"&gt;Facebook banned academic researchers&lt;/a&gt; from New York University’s Ad Observatory project from its platform, after the group’s Ad Observer browser plug-in highlighted problems. Its research found &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-biden-election-ads"&gt;Facebook had failed to disclose&lt;/a&gt; who paid for some political ads on its site.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CBS’s ‘The Activist’ seems to think doomscrolling equals activism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Street Style - Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear Fall/Winter 2020/2021 : Day Four" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kF75ubYlF3tIwM3IcwBI95UEST4=/0x0:3570x2380/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69844558/1216828007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kirstin Sinclair/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bs4bow"&gt;The entertainment industry spends millions researching what we watch and why every year. As climate destruction and a global pandemic make it more difficult to turn away from our social media feeds, CBS has found a new way to exploit these horrors with its show “The Activist.” Doomscrollers are their new audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsSvQp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/09/usher-priyanka-chopra-julianne-hough-the-activist-cbs-1234829647/amp/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the five-week CBS reality series will “feature six inspiring activists teamed with three high-profile public figures working together to bring meaningful change to one of three vitally important world causes: health, education, and environment.”    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EZ50al"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The show is perfectly timed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0LdPJh"&gt;The show is perfectly timed: For the last few years, we have been stuck in a crisis loop. When California catches on fire, the streets of New York flood with toxic waters, or police officers skate by without consequences after murdering the most vulnerable on camera, we become an audience to catastrophe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNWbDp"&gt;Last week, as rain water slapped at my window — helpless — I scrolled through Twitter. Powerless, I posted. My eyes turned away from any show I may have been binge-watching and turned towards my social media feeds, filled with hopeless posts from my friends and colleagues. It’s this audience and those eyes CBS and its producers likely identified as the makings of a new market for entertainment. We’re already doomscrolling. We’re already posting — &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21359098/social-justice-slideshows-instagram-activism"&gt;mostly performatively&lt;/a&gt; — social and climate justice slide shows to our Instagram stories. Why not turn our terrifying reality into its own reality television show?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBNXTN"&gt;Real activists were quick to point out the dystopian premise of the show. “I’m confused: Is this an advanced Marxist critique to expose how competition for money and attention pits activists against each other [and] undermines deep change? Or just the end of the world,” Naomi Klein, journalist and author, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NaomiAKlein/status/1436054519146696731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1436054519146696731%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsweek.com%2Freal-activists-express-disgust-reality-series-activist-1627825"&gt;wrote in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8BnWk"&gt;“Such obscene shows make total sense in a disconnected, elite world where activists are nothing more than entrepreneurs-to-be. It’s dehumanising,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joeyayoub/status/1436234657754984450?s=20"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Joey Ayoub, a writer and researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIIduo"&gt;“It’s performative at best, and kinda makes light of the hard work a lot of grassroots organisations do on the ground, on a daily basis. Gross,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StephanieYeboah/status/1436054789171843077?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1436054789171843077%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsweek.com%2Freal-activists-express-disgust-reality-series-activist-1627825"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; Stephanie Yeboah, a writer and activist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfcJyI"&gt;It’s not just “The Activist”’s premise that’s hollow, but the solutions the show offers as well. The show measures “success” through “online engagement, social metrics, and hosts’ input” and, ultimately, the groups will head to Rome to attend the G20 Summit where they will meet with world leaders to secure funding for their causes. At its heart, “The Activist” buys into the liberal dream that simply raising awareness can enact radical change, a much easier task than approving laws or boycotting destructive companies. And when awareness itself doesn’t work, perhaps approaching Justin Trudeau as a venture capitalist for justice may do the trick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfIX0A"&gt;The show turns the collaborative nature of activism into a competition and exploits the hopelessness experienced under the US’s highly unproductive two-party system. While social media can, and has, been used in transformative ways in politics, the reductionist nature of the internet has created a new breed of empty activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8g6eQ7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;love politics &lt;a href="https://t.co/LL9t4GAxsb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LL9t4GAxsb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— jordan (@JordanUhl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JordanUhl/status/1432943870455787521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LIA38P"&gt;This emptiness has already expanded out of the personal social media accounts belonging to friends and family. Just last week, I saw a member of the Kentucky State Senate post a TikTok where he flailed his arms rapping “Rick and Morty” by Soulja Boy, a recently popular trend, facing “the Senate Chambers until we raise the minimum wage in Kentucky.” Simply pointing out the issue isn’t enough. But virality can certainly &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like doing something. Kevin Paffrath, who is running to unseat Gov. Gavin Newsom in the California recall gamified voter engagement in his app. Five social media posts in favor of his campaign earn you points which could, in turn, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662970/gavin-newsom-california-kevin-paffrath-crypto-robinhood-gamestonk"&gt;earn you a selfie&lt;/a&gt; on a private jet with Paffrath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lixKQ"&gt;It sure feels like “The Activist” will portray organizing and political action in a similar way, all while providing handsome salaries to already wealthy celebrities like Priyanka Chopra, Julianne Hough, and the guy who wrote “Yeah!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQHzMJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFILZv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney says the rest of its 2021 slate of movies will have exclusive theatrical releases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6mg8C-BmGihg2EdX43tVCQ1U0nY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69844394/acastro_190411_1777_Disney_Streaming_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Disney will release the rest of its 2021 movies in theaters first | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Eh12Rv"&gt;The remaining movies on Disney’s 2021 slate will all be released in theaters exclusively before being released on its Disney Plus streaming platform, the &lt;a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-announces-exclusive-theatrical-windows-for-remaining-2021-slate-of-films/"&gt;company announced&lt;/a&gt; late Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3Cx1D"&gt;“Following the tremendous box office success of our summer films which included five of the top eight domestic releases of the year, we are excited to update our theatrical plans for the remainder of 2021,”  Kareem Daniel, chairman, Disney media &amp;amp; entertainment distribution said in a news release, adding that “confidence in moviegoing continues to improve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2dMv1G"&gt;The coronavirus pandemic and temporary closures of movie theaters that began last spring led movie studios to delay the release of many of their films, hoping to allow time for pandemic restrictions to ease and let people return to theaters in large numbers. Warner Bros’ raised the ire of many in Hollywood when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;announced in December 2020&lt;/a&gt; that its entire 2021 slate would be released simultaneously on its HBO Max streaming platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwgFqc"&gt;Disney’s decision follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434964/disney-theatrical-window-45-days-shorter-streaming-shang-chi-free-guy"&gt;successful theater-first releases&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Free Guy. &lt;/em&gt;Disney released each of those movies with an exclusive 45-day theatrical window. &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi &lt;/em&gt;topped &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/shang-chi-marvel-box-office-opening-weekend-simu-liu-1235056782/"&gt;$71.4 million in its Labor Day weekend&lt;/a&gt; release, the second-biggest opening haul for films released theatrically during the pandemic, and &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; brought in $28.4 million in its &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/box-office/box-office-free-guy-ryan-reynolds-1235041899/"&gt;August debut.&lt;/a&gt; Both films have since surpassed $100 million at the box office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xu7of7"&gt;But Disney is dealing with the fallout of its decision to release &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, starring Scarlett Johansson, in theaters and on its Disney Plus streaming platform (for a $30 fee) at the same time in July. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;Johansson sued Disney,&lt;/a&gt; alleging that the simultaneous release reduced the amount of money the film garnered in theaters. The actress’ salary was partly based on &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s box-office performance, which meant she stood to lose a significant amount of money. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22622604/black-widow-lawsuit-disney-defends-release"&gt;Disney has disputed&lt;/a&gt; the merits of Johansson’s suit. &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; brought in $80 million at the domestic box office in its July 9th opening weekend, and generated $80 million via Disney Plus, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/movie-theater-owners-black-widow-disney-plus-1235022524/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AMsHOq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow lawsuit has unearthed a huge problem with streaming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22611516/scarlett-johansson-disney-lawsuit-streaming-services-transparency"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rQBwgz"&gt;The release schedule for the remainder of Disney movies in 2021 has the animated musical movie &lt;em&gt;Encanto &lt;/em&gt;debuting in theaters November 24th for a 30-day window. The rest of the slate will each have 45-day theatrical release window as follows (of course, as we have seen time and again, most release dates are subject to change amid the evolving conditions of the pandemic):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aWZqGw"&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Last Duel&lt;/em&gt; October 15th&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4tzmVR"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ron’s Gone Wrong&lt;/em&gt; October 22nd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IRCymY"&gt;

&lt;li id="Nm2PNc"&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>How to sell or trade in your old Android phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Pixel next to Google Pixel 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CogPkUXbGT37svqJiHkPL4h09Iw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69844389/pixel_pixel2_vladsavov.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YTcT3i"&gt;There are a plethora of new and exciting smartphones that have just come onto the market (or are about to), and it wouldn’t be at all surprising to find out that you are planning to upgrade from your current phone. Samsung has introduced two new folding phones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt;, along with its flagship &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Google has released its latest mid-priced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; and has announced its upcoming &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/magazine/google_pixel_6?hl=en-US"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPirAZ"&gt;Whether you want to buy one of Samsung’s new folding phones or one of the upcoming Google 6 phones without paying full price, trading in your old phone — or selling it — is a smart way to do that. On the other hand, there are those who will decide instead to buy a lightly used phone from an older generation that will suit their needs without breaking the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzeqwI"&gt;If you’ve got an older model and are ready for an upgrade, here are a few steps to take in order to get your device ready to sell, followed by how much cash you can expect to earn back. We’re going to concentrate on Samsung and Google Pixel phones here, but you can probably expect similar results with phones from other vendors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oxubhS"&gt;Inspect your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CXxopT"&gt;If your old device is in good condition, you shouldn’t have much of a problem finding a new owner. As mentioned in our guide on selling your iPhone, having a phone in good condition is crucial to finding a buyer who’s willing to pay top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pUgLB"&gt;Even if your phone isn’t in the best shape, you should still be able to get &lt;em&gt;something &lt;/em&gt;for your trade. Take into consideration its blemishes, including scratches, dents, cracks, and any other quirks that the next owner should know about. Be honest or else it will probably come back to bite you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OGt0Dv"&gt;Erase your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ffByZn"&gt;There are three steps involved in securely wiping your Android phone. These steps can vary slightly depending on whether you have a Samsung, a Pixel, or a phone from another manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ws0xuU"&gt;First, instructions for a Samsung running Android 11:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="XYw9xt"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Disable Factory Reset Protection.&lt;/strong&gt; This feature prevents your phone from being wiped if it’s stolen. To disable it, all you have to do is turn off your Screen Lock. (You’ve had your Screen Lock set, right?) Navigate to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Lock Screen	” &amp;gt; “Screen lock type” and select “None.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TaEHML"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Remove your account. &lt;/strong&gt;Navigate to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Accounts and backup” &amp;gt; “Managed accounts” and tap on the account (or accounts, if you have more than one) that’s listed there. Then tap on “Remove account.” (Incidentally, if you haven’t backed up your phone recently, you can go to “Accounts and backup” &amp;gt; “Backup” to get that done.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dD1Ir5"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Factory reset the phone. &lt;/strong&gt;The next step is to factory reset the phone to completely wipe it of all your data. Back at the main settings menu, select “General management” &amp;gt; “Reset” to  take you to the final step. Select “Factory data reset.” You will get a warning page listing the data that will be erased; any accounts you’re still signed into (and you should go back and remove them); and which apps will be removed. Ready? Tap on “Reset” (you’ll be prompted to put in your Samsung account password).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="cnZ8rV"&gt;The instructions here are for a Pixel running Android 12 beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="CvdFUj"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Disable Factory Reset Protection.&lt;/strong&gt; This feature prevents your phone from being wiped if it’s stolen. To disable it, all you have to do is turn off your Screen Lock. (You’ve had your Screen Lock set, right?) Navigate to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Security” &amp;gt; “Screen lock” and select “None.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uOXeGA"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Remove your account. &lt;/strong&gt;Using Android 12, erasing your phone starts with navigating to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Passwords &amp;amp; accounts” and tapping on the account (or accounts, if you have more than one) that’s listed there. Then tap on “Remove account.” You’ll get a warning pop-up. Tap on “Remove account” again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9aIV6A"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Factory reset the phone. &lt;/strong&gt;The next step is to factory reset the phone to completely wipe it of all your data. Back at the main settings menu, select “System.” If you haven’t backed up your phone to Google Drive recently, you can go to “Backup” and select “Back up now.” Otherwise, going into “Reset options” will take you to the final step. Select “Erase all data (factory reset).” You will get a warning page listing the data that will be erased, and if you’ve neglected to sign out of any accounts, it will be listed there (and you should go back and remove it). Otherwise, tap on “Erase all data.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="odtDGL"&gt;Trade your phone in?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AVX9Bj"&gt;When you trade in your phone to a manufacturer or carrier, you may be trading price for convenience. It’s up to you which you choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qWtJb"&gt;At the time of publish, Samsung says it is offering up to a $750 trade-in credit on a Galaxy Z Fold3 5G or Z Flip3 5G. Interestingly, Samsung’s offers tend to be relatively generous. For example, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17093588/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-phone-review"&gt;three-year-old Galaxy S9&lt;/a&gt; will give you a credit of $150, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/17/17703434/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review-battery-specs-price-pen-stylus"&gt;Galaxy Note 9&lt;/a&gt; goes up to $400 as does a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18245446/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-android-phone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy S10 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, while if you’re trading in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155012/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-review-5g-screen-camera-space-zoom-price"&gt;Galaxy S20 5G Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, you can score $750 in trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sfjc84"&gt;During its preorder period, Google says it offers up to $600 for a trade-in. I pretended to have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;Pixel 4 XL&lt;/a&gt; with 128GB storage that was in working condition and free of cracks, and I was offered $170, while a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Pixel 4a 5G&lt;/a&gt; with 128GB brought a quote of $190. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt; with 128GB storage got me an offer of $58, and finally, an original unlocked Pixel with 32GB or 128GB was worth a big $25.01.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRrsai"&gt;You may be able to get a good deal with a carrier as long as you read the small print. For example, Verizon is offering a discount of up to $800 on specific new phones (such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 5G&lt;/a&gt;) if you trade in one of a long list of phones (and commit yourself to its Unlimited plan). &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original Google Pixel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MW7paS"&gt;Sell your phone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZSXwS"&gt;As for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73hQPc_RInM"&gt;where you can sell&lt;/a&gt; your old phone, &lt;a href="http://swappa.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swappa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a top pick with a healthy community of buyers and sellers. With Swappa, you create a listing along with a price; when your device is sold, you receive payment from Swappa and then ship the phone directly to the buyer. Swappa charges a fee from the buyer, depending on the price of the phone, but you are responsible for shipping costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdPOfD"&gt;Since what you can get from a site like Swappa can vary, I looked at the lowest price suggested (for which you would more likely find a buyer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0AVz9"&gt;First, Samsung. A Galaxy S9 in fair condition with 64GB brought a low price of $129; a Galaxy Note 9 rated a low price of $219; a Galaxy S10 Plus bottomed out at $249, while a Galaxy S20 5G Ultra started at $539. Even considering that these are the cheapest prices that these phone will go for, there is considerable difference between these and the trade-in prices for Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTZ4VX"&gt;Meanwhile, original Pixel with 32GB of storage brought a low price of $62, while a Pixel XL got low price of $60. An unlocked Pixel 2 with 64GB rated a low price of $90; the 2 XL version was quoted with a low price of $99. An unlocked Pixel 3 with 64GB in good condition had a low price of $115; the 3 XL version in fair condition brought a low selling price of $95. Finally, you could score a Pixel 4 XL in good condition with 64GB for $250.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EE4Ox7"&gt;There are, of course, other sites where you can sell your phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofjsLE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decluttr.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22666545%2Fandroid-pixel-samsung-galaxy-sell-trade-how-to-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decluttr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; buys the phone from you and then resells it. The company gives you a price online; you then ship your phone to Decluttr within 28 days. The phone will be inspected; if there are issues, you will be offered a revised price which you will have 14 days to accept or decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xczo9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gazelle.com%2Ftrade-in&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22666545%2Fandroid-pixel-samsung-galaxy-sell-trade-how-to-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gazelle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; works in much the same way: the company gives you a price online and you then ship your phone to Gazelle within 30 days. The phone will be inspected; if there are issues, you will be offered a revised price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6JQzg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fservices%2Fbest-buy-trade-in%2Fpcmcat133600050011.c&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Buy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lets you either mail in your phone or bring it to your nearest Best Buy retail store; either way, you can trade it in for an e-gift card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5F5SmE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://flipsy.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flipsy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deals with a variety of retail sites; it will let you know what vendors offer how much, and then you get 14 days to ship the device. The vendor pays for shipping. If the vendor doesn’t agree with your assessment, they will send a revised offer; since each vendor has its own return policies, it’s a good idea to check before you ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3Gx6n"&gt;And of course, there’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fseller-center%2Findex.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22666545%2Fandroid-pixel-samsung-galaxy-sell-trade-how-to-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eBay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Selling here can be a bit complicated, but basically you get up to 250 listings for free each month; once you sell your item, there is a 10.2 percent fee plus a $0.30 transaction fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktxNwU"&gt;Other places where you can sell your phone free of charge (except, of course, for shipping fees) include &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/selling/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook Marketplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://craigslist.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craigslist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tb6JxY"&gt;Whether you use one of the resources listed here to make up the cost of a new Google Pixel 6 or decide that the convenience of trading in the phone is worth the extra bucks is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today is the last day to save up to $100 on Sonos speakers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lJGGDwUAX2TMk0-MFQ55Jr8Sh2o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69844165/RoamFrame.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J3GL6Y"&gt;If you want to save up to $100 on Sonos products, now is the time. Starting Sunday, September 12th, Sonos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667044/sonos-speaker-price-increases-announce-september-12"&gt;will be increasing&lt;/a&gt; its prices from $10 to $100, depending on the product, meaning today is the last day you will be able to pick up one of the company’s many smart speakers at their current price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNboTu"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfywbqrMnbJ#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Arc&lt;/a&gt; will jump the highest in price, going from $799 to $899. You can also expect to pay $50 more for the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfywdzRyiRp#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Five&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfyweNMGe96#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Sub&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfywg0TufHi#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Amp&lt;/a&gt;. The Five will go for $549 instead of $499, while the $699 Sonos Sub will sell for $749 and the $649 Sonos Amp will retail at $699. Sonos will also increase the prices of the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfyv7HQialG#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfywic78Zmx#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;One SL&lt;/a&gt; by $20, and the company will tack on an additional $10 to the portable &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfywjGCiJEC#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Roam&lt;/a&gt;, offering it for $179 instead of $169.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rlk9wJ"&gt;The table below breaks down the forthcoming price hikes in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="825u4a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10745576"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="dcaaJs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10523576"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="MSHA39"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10672350"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ki6K4s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10634629"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zfpJq6"&gt;If you want a laptop that’s similar in quality to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;, HP’s new Pavilion Aero 13 is a solid option, even when it’s not on sale. Today, however, with HP’s extended Labor Day promotion going on, it’s a must-buy. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDailyDealsRoundUp091021&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-pavilion-aero-13z-be000-laptop-pc-2r1x0av-1%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP is selling the Pavilion Aero 13&lt;/a&gt; with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800U, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $703 with promo code &lt;strong&gt;HP21LDS5&lt;/strong&gt;, nearly $50 off the configuration’s typical list price. Note that you’ll need to customize the laptop to have the specs above before you add it to cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwenYO"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22632318/hp-pavilion-aero-13-2021-amd-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; — which was based on a similar configuration — we dubbed the high-quality budget laptop “the first premium Pavilion,” namely because it comes with features typically found in more premium Windows devices, such as 10-hour battery life. In fact, its 16:10 screen is brighter than the one found on the more expensive Spectre model. It’s also incredibly lightweight, and comes with a powerful eight-core processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X3aO9c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730332"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vt3ev2"&gt;Right now at Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can save $150&lt;/a&gt; on our pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users, the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless. Comfortable and stylish, we found the headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound. They provide 17 hours of playback time per charge, too, as well as convenient features like ambient passthrough and a customizable EQ. Given these perks, they’re an excellent choice for those who don’t want to fork out twice as much for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Silver/dp/B08PZD76NP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s luxe AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;, our top pick for best noise-canceling headphones when it comes to sound quality. Normally $400, Amazon’s current discount brings them down to $250, an all-time low. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dKr7FP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G9AiKJ"&gt;Whether you’re working in the office or at home, a good monitor can make a world of difference. Thankfully, Samsung’s M7 Smart Monitor is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-43-Inch-Class-Monitor-LS43AM702UNXZA/dp/B096MY3BN8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for a limited time&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon for $530 instead of $600, its best price to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzsIm1"&gt;Described as a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21562738/samsung-smart-monitor-m5-m7-tizen-smart-tv-airplay-2-usb-c-release-date-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TV for your PC&lt;/a&gt;,” the M7 Smart Monitor can stream HDR10 content via your Wi-Fi network from apps such as Netflix and Hulu, without needing external devices. The 43-inch monitor also features a healthy range of ports and support for AirPlay 2, as well as a voice-enabled remote control that works with Google Assistant and Alexa; you can even mount the display to your wall or a monitor arm via Vesa mounts, if desired. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="nNhAFb"&gt;Now that Amazon has introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662985/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-announced-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt;, retailers are starting to slash the price of older streaming devices to some of this year’s best prices. Right now, for instance, you can pick up the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079QHML21/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfybDjfQNAO#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $35 instead of $50, the lowest price we’ve seen on the capable streamer outside of Amazon Prime Day. The older, 4K-ready device comes with an Alexa voice remote, as well as support for Dolby Vision, HDR10, and Dolby Atmos. It doesn’t, however, feature Wi-Fi 6 support like the newer Max model. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorcycle vibrations can degrade iPhone camera performance, Apple says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fcXBzDn9Z-qcK5MgoivX8atXJq4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69844108/akrales_201018_4238_0293.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple says its iPhone cameras may be damaged by motorcycle vibrations | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hTpRpF"&gt;A new post on &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212803"&gt;Apple’s Support forum&lt;/a&gt; says exposing iPhones to high-amplitude vibrations, “specifically those generated by high-power motorcycle engines” could degrade the devices’ camera system. The company recommends against mounting an iPhone on a motorcycle, as the vibrations may be transmitted via the bike’s handlebars and chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sRwLO"&gt;Here’s the technical explanation from Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QRkuKC"&gt;If you accidentally move a camera when you take a picture, the resulting image can be blurry. To prevent this, some iPhone models have optical image stabilization (OIS).1 OIS lets you take sharp photos even if you accidentally move the camera. With OIS, a gyroscope senses that the camera moved. To reduce image motion, and the resulting blur, the lens moves according to the angle of the gyroscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Blnfge"&gt;Additionally, some iPhone models have closed-loop autofocus (AF).2 Closed-loop AF resists the effects of gravity and vibration to preserve sharp focus in stills, videos, and panoramas. With closed-loop AF, on-board magnetic sensors measure gravity and vibration effects and determine the lens position so that the compensating motion can be set accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLszE5"&gt;The OIS and closed-loop AF systems in iPhone are designed for durability. However, as is the case with many consumer electronics that include systems like OIS, long-term direct exposure to high-amplitude vibrations within certain frequency ranges may degrade the performance of these systems and lead to reduced image quality for photos and videos. It is recommended to avoid exposing your iPhone to extended high-amplitude vibrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="CP5Qud"&gt;The iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and all iPhones since the iPhone 7 have both optical image stabilization and closed-loop autofocus (as noted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/iphone-camera-vibration-damage-motorcyles/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the first outlet to spot the Apple support post). Both features are also vulnerable to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208747"&gt;magnetic interference from some iPhone accessories&lt;/a&gt;, Apple warned earlier this year, but removing the accessories should take care of that issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uftGp"&gt;Additionally in the new post, Apple says if you’re planning to mount your iPhone to a scooter or a moped, it recommends using a vibration-dampening mount to lessen the risk to the phone and its camera system. And avoiding prolonged regular use of an iPhone mounted to a vehicle that produces lower-amplitude vibrations is also a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;
