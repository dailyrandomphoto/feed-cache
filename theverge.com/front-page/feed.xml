    <title>New Oculus Quest feature can automatically sync VR photos and video clips to your phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HTtyXKMQ1Y5G3IvBELdzxy3TV34=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69765336/akrales_200904_4160_0390.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7C411b"&gt;Oculus has begun rolling out a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fa-more-flexible-oculus-move-improved-gifting-and-more-in-the-latest-oculus-software-update%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;set of new software features&lt;/a&gt; for Quest and Quest 2 virtual reality headsets. The v32 update introduces some small, but important tweaks to the in-headset user experience, as well as to the Oculus Move health tracking app. The feature that most piqued my attention is an option to automatically sync saved photos and videos captured within VR to the Oculus mobile app for iOS and Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8IBUO"&gt;In an earlier update, Oculus let you upload files from a headset through the Browser app within VR, an improvement over the original method of plugging the headset into a PC. But this update goes a step further in removing friction for viewing or sharing content, as it lets you do it without a headset on. To sync items from your headset (running v32 software, of course) to the app for the first time, open up the Files app from your Quest’s app library within the headset, then click the cloud icon that will appear at its top-right corner. It’ll ask you to turn on the syncing feature. Once you’re finished, your clips and pics will be viewable and shareable within the “Devices” pane in the Oculus mobile app. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4yY7Yhqi8ngeKk4GQGFWwqxel9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800904/oculusv32.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6YL3Zm"&gt;Oculus has made a few other changes, including the ability to gift apps and games while you have a headset on. Previously (and frustratingly), gifting had to be done by the Oculus app or through a browser, but you can do it all in one place now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmQJuF"&gt;If you like to chat with your Oculus friends while in virtual reality, you’ll soon find these contacts in the “People” tab within Facebook Messenger in VR, not as a separate section. Oculus contacts will be placed in the same list as your Facebook friends, but Oculus says that the friends you made in VR won’t be able to see Facebook activity unless you add them as friends on Facebook, so they remain separate despite how it may appear within the app. For people who don’t want any crossover between the lists, we’ve reached out to Oculus to see if this feature can be turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNnqXj"&gt;Lastly, Oculus is making tweaks to its Move fitness platform that can monitor your movements within games to report metrics, much like a fitness tracker does. Instead of only tracking daily goals, Oculus added a new weekly goal metric that lets you select how many days you’re aiming to work out in VR each week. It’s also letting you share Oculus Move workout stats that you’re proud of to your Facebook timeline, groups, or within Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Michigan Republicans run afoul of TikTok’s vaccine misinformation rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bbyvA0RqFVjXAkwaxbqKVvOpWvg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69765044/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g5UX6y"&gt;As the Michigan governor’s race heats up, a handful of candidates are turning to TikTok to build followings ahead of the 2022 election. Two Republicans have already found sizable audiences, but they’re also testing TikTok’s limits on misinformation, espousing possible 2020 election fraud and spreading false vaccine information on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5OY5SS"&gt;Garrett Soldano and Ryan Kelley are both running in Michigan’s Republican primary for governor, hoping to replace current Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Soldano, a chiropractor from Kalamazoo County, is one of the leading fundraisers, raising more than all other candidates combined, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/07/garrett-soldano-out-raises-other-republican-candidates-for-governor-at-625k.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michigan Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8B3m6A"&gt;Both candidates have built large followings on TikTok, Soldano and Kelley boasting over 74,000 and 35,000 followers, respectively, as of publication. Both have created dozens of TikToks casting doubt on the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of masks. They have also posted videos questioning the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, calling for a “full forensic audit” of the election results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aXiC1m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Maybe that’s why flu just disappeared”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lwuaTN"&gt;Many of Soladano’s videos suggest that the COVID-19 vaccines are not as effective as advertised and that the pandemic isn’t as deadly as people proclaim. &lt;a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMR2cBoWd/"&gt;In one video&lt;/a&gt; with over 2.5 million views, Soladano falsely states that older PCR tests couldn’t detect the difference between COVID-19 and cases of influenza. “Maybe that’s why flu just disappeared,” he said. Another video denigrating Fauci and Whitmer &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@garrettformichigan/video/6971942344757087494?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowfE%2FB4XirCnv8NTdSlmLKasDzUjqfZv9LD2b%2FM8UrrKwfAWEmuIqvULIqnm67bt2dGgA%3D&amp;amp;checksum=39106e9cd892ac22e889725b3ea9ad84d833f3444d6a1b0ab46598427e42878a&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;sec_uid=MS4wLjABAAAAzMuxyfzmzCoQ_TFP-yf2zps6jDXO-5bqLT5h1DNIcHwfdsnSIgbKc6UdUV5k8kuv&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAU_NLfoQvgV1qSg48z-BuWPtzBcnGehekRWqneVCN2lgItLER_m1BUK4dO7-bdnJq&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_author_id=6859098120735802374&amp;amp;share_link_id=9B633909-1A3C-452F-9F9A-DAC032BD637E&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=5a3i73892bk7d&amp;amp;user_id=119258479655079936&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;is_copy_url=0&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;sender_device=pc&amp;amp;sender_web_id=6898175130696254982"&gt;was removed&lt;/a&gt; by TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lXm1H"&gt;“If COVID is so scary then why in the hell aren’t they closing the southern border?” Soladano &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@garrettformichigan/video/6996636404373540101?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowfE%2FB4XirCnv8NTdSlmLKasDzUjqfZv9LD2b%2FM8UrrKwfAWEmuIqvULIqnm67bt2dGgA%3D&amp;amp;checksum=39106e9cd892ac22e889725b3ea9ad84d833f3444d6a1b0ab46598427e42878a&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;sec_uid=MS4wLjABAAAAzMuxyfzmzCoQ_TFP-yf2zps6jDXO-5bqLT5h1DNIcHwfdsnSIgbKc6UdUV5k8kuv&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAU_NLfoQvgV1qSg48z-BuWPtzBcnGehekRWqneVCN2lgItLER_m1BUK4dO7-bdnJq&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_author_id=6859098120735802374&amp;amp;share_link_id=9B633909-1A3C-452F-9F9A-DAC032BD637E&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=5a3i73892bk7d&amp;amp;user_id=119258479655079936&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;is_copy_url=0&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;sender_device=pc&amp;amp;sender_web_id=6898175130696254982"&gt;asked in one video&lt;/a&gt;. “Common sense,” he continued, holding up a sign that says “mic drop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZYmd1"&gt;TikTok has always hosted political content, and the platform revamped its election and coronavirus misinformation policies over the last few months and years. On election integrity, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/election-integrity/"&gt;TikTok says it defines&lt;/a&gt; “misinformation” as “content that is inaccurate or false” and “causes harm to individuals, our community, or the larger public regardless of intent.” TikTok also bans false or misleading content about COVID-19 and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="it94FE"&gt;“In addition to removing content, we redirect searches associated with vaccine or COVID-19 disinformation to our Community Guidelines and do not autocomplete anti-vaccine hashtags in search,” TikTok said &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/covid-19/"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; outlining its policies. It’s unclear what triggers these actions outside of direct reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dF1dP"&gt;There’s reason to think Soldano may have been kicked off the platform for violating those policies — but the ban didn’t stick. In a video posted earlier this year, Soldano wrote that he would be uploading all of his old videos because his previous account “was banned for LIFE.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChSbHN"&gt;At the same time, Republican leaders who take a more reasonable line on vaccines often meet with harsh resistance from their base. Earlier this weekend, former President Donald Trump was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/08/22/trump-alabama-rally-vaccine-crowd-boos-sot-ip-vpx.cnn"&gt;booed at his own rally&lt;/a&gt; after encouraging supporters to take the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRlf0I"&gt;In an apparent effort to sidestep TikTok’s moderation systems, Soldano has avoided using the word “vaccine” in his videos. “I can’t use the ‘v’ word because TikTok will take me down, so I’m going to call it a ‘medical procedure,’” Soldano said in a video posted &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@garrettformichigan/video/6993387805711912197?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowfE%2FB4XirCnv8NTdSlmLKasDzUjqfZv9LD2b%2FM8UrrKwfAWEmuIqvULIqnm67bt2dGgA%3D&amp;amp;checksum=39106e9cd892ac22e889725b3ea9ad84d833f3444d6a1b0ab46598427e42878a&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;sec_uid=MS4wLjABAAAAzMuxyfzmzCoQ_TFP-yf2zps6jDXO-5bqLT5h1DNIcHwfdsnSIgbKc6UdUV5k8kuv&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAU_NLfoQvgV1qSg48z-BuWPtzBcnGehekRWqneVCN2lgItLER_m1BUK4dO7-bdnJq&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_author_id=6859098120735802374&amp;amp;share_link_id=9B633909-1A3C-452F-9F9A-DAC032BD637E&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=5a3i73892bk7d&amp;amp;user_id=119258479655079936&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. In another video, he writes &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@garrettformichigan/video/6977704699818511621?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowfE%2FB4XirCnv8NTdSlmLKasDzUjqfZv9LD2b%2FM8UrrKwfAWEmuIqvULIqnm67bt2dGgA%3D&amp;amp;checksum=39106e9cd892ac22e889725b3ea9ad84d833f3444d6a1b0ab46598427e42878a&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;sec_uid=MS4wLjABAAAAzMuxyfzmzCoQ_TFP-yf2zps6jDXO-5bqLT5h1DNIcHwfdsnSIgbKc6UdUV5k8kuv&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAU_NLfoQvgV1qSg48z-BuWPtzBcnGehekRWqneVCN2lgItLER_m1BUK4dO7-bdnJq&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_author_id=6859098120735802374&amp;amp;share_link_id=9B633909-1A3C-452F-9F9A-DAC032BD637E&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=5a3i73892bk7d&amp;amp;user_id=119258479655079936&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;“vac…. cination.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIBH6G"&gt;Kelley, a real-estate broker and lifestyle vlogger, has previously &lt;a href="https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/garret-soldano-leading-republican-candidates-for-michigan-governor-in-fundraising"&gt;organized protests&lt;/a&gt; against Michigan’s COVID-19 orders and attended the&lt;a href="https://wwmt.com/news/local/right-wing-activist-spotted-at-capitol-insurrection-explores-run-for-mi-governor"&gt; January 6th US Capitol protest&lt;/a&gt; as well. (Kelley says he never entered the building.) Kelley’s videos also cast doubt on expert advice like that from the Centers for Disease Control. In several videos, he calls for “medical freedom” and for Michigan to outlaw mandatory vaccinations. He frequently tags his videos with #medicalfreedom which populates hundreds of videos from users protesting vaccine mandates or suggesting that they won’t receive the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHPee1"&gt;“Ryan is not anti-vax,” a spokesperson for the Kelley campaign told &lt;em&gt;The verge &lt;/em&gt;Monday. “But he is pro-medical freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TioASn"&gt;Kelley avoids using “vaccine” as well, opting for language like the “jab” when discussing masks and the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uz5bkl"&gt;Soldano did not immediately respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpDuL4"&gt;Over the last few years, TikTok has become a valuable platform for candidates seeking office. The platform’s For You algorithm makes it easier for candidates to create content and go viral as users don’t need to follow their accounts for their videos to show up on feeds. Democrats like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21408407/ed-markey-stans-fandom-politics-massachusetts-primary-joe-kennedy"&gt;Sens. Ed Markey&lt;/a&gt; (D-MA) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754927/jon-ossoff-tiktok-snapchat-account-influencer-marketing"&gt;Jon Ossoff&lt;/a&gt; (D-GA) have previously used the platform to organize voters and galvanize support ahead of their elections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgTXQs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 8/23/21 at 3:08PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added a statement from the Kelley campaign.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees are organizing, now under the banner #AppleToo </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/soaXPKqSo6ORL2cvv7Cki-DsE_g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69765010/acastro_170731_1777_0006_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OZ6WX6"&gt;Apple employee organizing took another step this morning with the launch of a website called &lt;a href="https://appletoo.us/"&gt;AppleToo&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to collect stories from workers at all levels of the organization who’ve experienced harassment or discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8X1gj"&gt;“For too long, Apple has evaded public scrutiny,” the website reads. “The truth is that for many Apple workers ... the culture of secrecy creates an opaque, intimidating fortress. When we press for accountability and redress to the persistent injustices we witness or experience in our workplace, we are faced with a pattern of isolation, degradation, and gaslighting. No more. We’ve exhausted all internal avenues. We’ve talked with our leadership. We’ve gone to the People team. We’ve escalated through Business Conduct. Nothing has changed. It’s time to Think Different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qy4bHp"&gt;Only about 15 current and former Apple employees were directly involved in the organizing effort. This morning, the organizers launched the website and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleLaborers"&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; and sent the news out on a 200-person Discord server for Apple employees and contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pOdio"&gt;The effort has already gained support from organizers like Timnit Gebru, who worked at Apple prior to joining Google in 2018. After Gebru was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;abruptly fired from Google in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;, she went public about her experiences with racism and discrimination at the company. But she hasn’t spoken quite so publicly about her time at Apple. Now, she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “I experienced so many egregious things when I was at Apple, and always wondered how they manage to get out of the spotlight. I’m happy to see that Apple workers are organizing. It is past time for Apple to be held accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpDXXX"&gt;Cher Scarlett, an Apple engineer and activist who’s involved in the organizing effort, posted the website in two internal Slack channels — #allies4change and #women-in-swe — this morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyctJm"&gt;Since launch, eight Apple employees have shared their stories through the AppleToo website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nightmare of the Wolf captures the soul of The Witcher, even without Geralt</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="witcher nightmare of the wolf" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M2ArfLGC0CcDAeaKQpup-Yo5nPI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764956/The_Witcher__Nightmare_of_the_Wolf_00_47_25_01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfqYjS"&gt;If there’s one thing that ties the many iterations of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; together — whether it’s the original books, the hit games, or more recently the live-action show — it’s Geralt of Rivia. The lovably miserable monster hunter is the core of the series in a way that’s rare for fantasy, which often follows stories bigger than just one person. But that’s also what makes &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;, an anime spinoff on Netflix, so interesting. It’s a prequel that shifts back in time to focus on Geralt’s mentor Vesemir, who can feel like the polar opposite of his protege: charming, playful, and with a voracious appetite for the finer things in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UOUnn"&gt;It’s a refreshing twist that also does a good job of exploring some of the mysteries at the heart of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; universe, without getting away from the hallmarks of the series. &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; might not be the most welcoming starting point for the franchise, but it’s a whole lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JoDnv"&gt;The anime movie jumps back and forth in time, focusing on Vesemir’s life during two key points. Initially, it’s mostly about his upbringing and what led him to life as a witcher (which, for the uninitiated, are mutated monster hunters who train from a young age to kill deadly creatures for cash). Essentially, he fled a life of servitude in hopes of some respect (and money) hunting monsters, unaware of the harsh realities at Kaer Morhen, the bleak castle that serves as a training ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JO4HXs"&gt;These scenes show just how brutal the witcher training is and use that as way to explore the different ways people react to trauma. Witcher stories often talk about how few candidates actually survive this process, and in &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; you can see why: young boys are forced to fight seemingly impossible odds in a nightmare swamp and, if they manage to survive that, subjected to a painful alchemy meant to enhance their strength and senses. Those who make it through can be grim like Geralt, or hide their pain under a lust for life like Vesemir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sErr2Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Witcher’s anime spinoff keeps the bathtub, but adds a fun-loving lead","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22602293/witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-anime-spinoff-netflix-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="63n6Ov"&gt;The other half of the story follows Vesemir at the height of his abilities. (Witchers age slowly, so even though he’s a handsome-looking young man with a square jaw and mischievous smirk, he’s actually 70 years old.) At this point he’s renowned for his ability to slay tough monsters and is able to charge a hefty price because of it; one of the earliest scenes shows Vesemir in the bath, haggling with an elf over his fee, before deciding he’s too expensive. At the same time, though, monsters seem to be few and far between, creating a conundrum for Vesemir and his compatriots. As one witcher puts it, “we’re putting ourselves out of business with every monster we kill.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="witcher nightmare of the wolf" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BqxXv5jpHxRnWlRybOfk_X_KAo0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800825/The_Witcher__Nightmare_of_the_Wolf_00_35_02_04.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HIpLJ5"&gt;As these two periods intersect, they shine light on a very pertinent relationship: namely between the witchers and the monsters they’ve sworn to kill. I won’t spoil anything, but &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; answers some questions that have been floating around on message boards for years about the origins of both hunter and hunted. And those new answers will likely change how you think about them both. Unfortunately, these revelations might be lost on newcomers, those who aren’t already immersed in the intrigue of the Continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBnznP"&gt;The good news is that, revelations aside, &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; is still a blast to watch even if you’re coming in cold. The shift to animation means that the action is more fluid than ever, particularly when it comes to Vesemir slicing his way through beasts with an inhuman grace, all while making smart-ass quips. (The slick action shouldn’t be too surprising, as &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf &lt;/em&gt;was created by Studio Mir, the same team behind shows like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts&lt;/em&gt;.) Whereas combat in the live-action show and games can feel heavy and laborious, in the anime things are much faster and more dynamic, befitting Vesemir as the new lead. For Geralt, fighting seems like a chore. Vesemir has fun. That doesn’t mean the battles don’t pack a punch: &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf &lt;/em&gt;is incredibly violent. It’ll only be a few minutes in before you see dismembered limbs and gushing blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1LagV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; manages to capture much of what has made &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; such a hit — a dark fantasy world, political intrigue, brutal action, buff men in the bath — but it does so without spending much time setting up the world. It assumes you already care. (This is especially true when it comes to the Big Twist, which won’t mean much if you aren’t invested in the universe.) So as fun as its gory action and plentiful one-liners can be, the movie can still feel like supplementary material — something to hold you over until season 2 finally drops in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gX4lyi"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is streaming now on Netflix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is retiring the swipe up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N0ZsIzlUP4EyC0XM1af1uO3U3yg=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764905/swipeup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ap5gV0"&gt;The swipe-up will be no more. Instagram is planning to retire the feature, which allows people to visit external webpages by swiping up, starting August 30th, according to a notification viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and confirmed by Instagram. Instead of the swipe-up link, Instagram says people will be able to use link stickers, which are exactly as they sound: tappable stickers in stories that take people to external websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JR35W3"&gt;The company says it’s retiring the swipe up — a feature that’s spawned its own category of GIFs and a phrase that’s now part of the lexicon — to “streamline the stories creation experience” and offer more “creative control,” given that uses can format the look of stickers and not the swipe up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNdf2r"&gt;This update builds on a test the company began earlier this summer. In June, Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555434/instagram-link-sticker-post-test-swipe-up"&gt;started testing&lt;/a&gt; these stickers for various users, not just people who already had swipe up privileges. (Users have to be verified or have at least 10,000 followers to gain access to swipe up.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHBqsC"&gt;At the time of the test, Vishal Shah, Instagram’s former head of product, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the stickers fit more with the way people currently use the platform. He also said the goal was to more widely roll out the stickers. The key difference between the two features, apart from the obvious gesture difference, is viewers can respond to stories that have a link sticker, but cannot respond to swipe up stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFaZ1w"&gt;Instagram says that for now, only people who had swipe up privileges will receive the sticker option, but that it’s “still evaluating” rolling it out to more users. This update will “help us determine whether it’s the right decision before expanding access to more people,” a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrmplI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 23rd, 2:50PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to include and reflect comment from Instagram.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Android 12’s clever new auto-rotate system  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ANwkcSj_r9As8hf02dEtaiIL_d0=/0x0:620x413/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764903/VRG_1777_Android_12_001.5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oH2k7i"&gt;Google’s upcoming Android 12 update has plenty of eye-catching features, but don’t let yourself be fooled: sometimes, it’s the smaller, less obvious elements that are most deserving of your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MncrqD"&gt;That’s certainly the case with the software’s new auto-rotate system. With Android 12, Google has introduced a smarter way to control when your screen switches between its vertical and horizontal orientations. And while the improvement isn’t getting all that much time in the spotlight, you’d better believe it has the potential to make your life a whole lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFc34j"&gt;In short, instead of relying solely on your phone’s accelerometer to figure out which way you’re holding the device and then rotate your screen accordingly, Android 12 allows your device to use its front-facing camera as a guide. That way, the software can sense how that striking face of yours is positioned at any given moment and make sure the screen is always positioned to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21VymK"&gt;The advantage is that you then avoid those awkward situations where you’re lying down — and thus holding your phone at an angle — and the screen then flips into its landscape orientation when you’re actually &lt;em&gt;looking &lt;/em&gt;at it in its portrait mode. Since the system pays attention to the position of your face, it makes the screen match the way you’re actually &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; the device, no matter how you might be holding it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBeWZM"&gt;Activating the new option couldn’t be easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fFiin7"&gt;Four steps to a smarter auto-rotate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="phGYzW"&gt;(Note that these steps are specific to Google’s Android 12 interface and the way the new auto-rotate system is presented on Pixel phones. It’s not entirely clear at this point how other device-makers will alter the software’s interface or what specific features they’ll offer on their devices.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hAjnCl"&gt;Swipe down twice from the top of your screen and then tap the gear-shaped settings icon in the lower-right corner of the Quick Settings panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="N4bcC7"&gt;Tap “Display.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t0vEVk"&gt;Scroll down until you see the line that says “Auto-rotate screen.” Tap it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Vh5zL1"&gt;Make sure the toggle next to “Use Auto-rotate” is in the on position, then activate the toggle next to “Enable Face Detection.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="That tucked-away toggle is the secret to enabling Android 12’s effective new auto-rotate technology." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/00LsbktXHvkM0rtH3wvtKLDL4Ro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800854/android_12_auto_rotate_off.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This tucked-away toggle will enable Android 12’s effective new auto-rotate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once you turn on the auto-rotate, you can then enable face detection." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2_7gzJuEmIdadnUwBsNoHUWSmsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800199/android_12_auto_rotate.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once you turn on the auto-rotate, you can then enable face detection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ClDJP7"&gt;And that’s it: all that’s left is to use your phone normally and watch as Android 12’s auto-rotate enhancement works its magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgyUME"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gqvYKU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In Greece, heatwaves are so bad officials are considering giving them names</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GREECE-WEATHER-HEAT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rmfOSGlKzhpJeJjxR_fCUTVh308=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764899/1234294387.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qNU8bu"&gt;During a summer of punishing heat, Greek officials and researchers are thinking about naming individual heatwaves to help keep people safe when temperatures soar. It’s part of a bigger push internationally to create a system for naming and ranking heatwaves, similar to the process for major storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R6jqNA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re a silent killer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BlvbBh"&gt;“Heatwaves cause a lot of deaths; they don’t make noise and they may not be visible but they’re a silent killer,” Kostas Lagouvardos, research director at the National Observatory of Athens, recently told &lt;em&gt;The Observer&lt;/em&gt;, a Sunday paper published by Guardian Media Group. “We believe people will be more prepared to face an upcoming weather event when the event has a name.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QC4aZR"&gt;Extreme heat kills 5 million people a year around the world, one recent &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(21)00081-4/fulltext"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found. Many of those deaths could be prevented by encouraging people to prepare for and find shelter from the heat, and by building more heat-resilient neighborhoods. The hope is that official names will prevent extreme heat events from sneaking up on people and make disaster preparedness for extreme heat a more urgent priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ry5RJx"&gt;Greece has been wracked with repeated heatwaves this summer, which have also stoked devastating wildfires. The worst heatwave to hit the country in several decades landed in August, when temperatures soared to a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/world/europe/greece-turkey-heat-fires.html"&gt;record-breaking 115.3 degrees&lt;/a&gt; Fahrenheit (46.3 degrees Celsius). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OcFhE"&gt;Even under normal circumstances, Athens is the hottest capital city in mainland Europe. In July, Athens named former deputy Mayor Eleni Myrivili its new “chief heat officer,” the first such role in Europe. In a recent interview with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/21/world/europe/athens-is-only-getting-hotter-its-new-chief-heat-officer-hopes-to-cool-it-down.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Myrivilli said talks are underway over whether to name heatwaves after people or cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfTBz7"&gt;The World Meteorological Organization already comes up with names for tropical storms. The practice of giving storms a human name started in the 1950s because it was easier than referring to them using latitude and longitude. Now, storm names like Sandy, Maria, and Katrina are thought to make it easier to issue warnings to the public and drum up news coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JOO7K"&gt;Creating a similar naming convention globally for heatwaves is the top priority of a new Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance forged last year. Its members include the City of Athens, as well as dozens of partners from other cities and charities including the Rockefeller Foundation and the Red Cross Global Disaster Preparedness Center​. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="2aspIn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The first step to being able to mitigate the risk to vulnerable communities” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WUpbqj"&gt;If the alliance succeeds in its goals, new names for heatwaves would also come with a ranking. That’s also similar to tropical storms, which are given a category from one to five based on their wind speeds. Ranking heatwaves could be “trickier” Lagouvardos told &lt;em&gt;The Observer, &lt;/em&gt;because risk can depend on population density and differences in temperatures from place to place. But temperatures over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) could be the benchmark for naming a heatwave, according to Lagouvardos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJpB2O"&gt;“Naming heat waves as a global threat is the first step to being able to mitigate the risk to vulnerable communities,” California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a &lt;a href="https://www.onebillionresilient.org/post/extreme-heat-resilience-alliance-reducing-extreme-heat-risk-for-vulnerable-people"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; when the Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance formed. Older people, children, and city neighborhoods with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452777/hot-summer-weather-race-urban-heat-island-us-cities"&gt;more residents of color&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22575481/nyc-urban-heat-island-effect-thermal-camera-surface-temperature"&gt;fewer green spaces&lt;/a&gt; are often more vulnerable to heat-related illness and death. Regions with typically cooler weather can also be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580120/emergency-department-visits-spiked-june-heat-wave-us-northwest"&gt;uniquely vulnerable&lt;/a&gt; because cities and homes weren’t built to stand the heat, and residents haven’t had to prepare for such extremes in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUeQOK"&gt;Whatever plans ultimately materialize in Greece or elsewhere, heatwaves are becoming even more formidable threats because of global warming. Extreme heat events have already become &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;more common&lt;/a&gt; across much of the world, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594471/heatwaves-prediction-more-study-climate-change"&gt;more record-shattering heatwaves&lt;/a&gt; are forecast for the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tz0xG4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmSm0L"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hbn9U9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pfizer vaccine will be officially called Comirnaty, for some reason</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Athlone Stadium Mass Vaccination Site" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CCxCKPTiWxB8TbXqVhUxWuq1SW4=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764647/1234776741.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ByzQvk"&gt;With official Food and Drug Administration approval, the Pfizer / BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22616546/pfizer-covid-vaccine-fda-approval-licensing"&gt;can now be marketed as Comirnaty in the US&lt;/a&gt;, great news for general vaccine acceptance, sure, but also anyone who loves to fixate on bizarre drug names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pHcACr"&gt;Comirnaty is apparently supposed to be a portmanteau of several words — community, immunity, COVID-19, and mRNA — &lt;a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/pfizer-biontech-select-comirnaty-as-brand-name-for-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fierce Pharma&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. The branding was produced for Pfizer-BioNTech by the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Brand Institute — “&lt;a href="https://www.brandinstitute.com/"&gt;The World’s #1 Naming Company&lt;/a&gt;” — and while it doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue, it is at least shorter than most drug names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGKa9H"&gt;On the other hand, it’s not nearly as metal as &lt;a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/moderna-secures-spikevax-name-europe-joins-pfizer-s-comirnaty-awaiting-official-name-and"&gt;Spikevax&lt;/a&gt;, the European brand name of the Moderna vaccine and another Brand Institute project. Spikevax&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;directly references the spiky structure of COVID-19 and the word vaccines (having “vax” in the name is big, I’ve read). It could mark quite a badass second wind for US Moderna fans &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/04/pfizer-gang-and-sadness-vaccine-culture/618755/"&gt;who’ve lived in the shadow of the “hot-person vaccine”&lt;/a&gt; once it's approved by the FDA. Vaxzevria, the brand name for the AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe, is a bit more inexplicable. I really have nothing to say about it other than good on them for getting vax in there, and for immediately &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latveria"&gt;bringing Dr. Doom to mind&lt;/a&gt; anytime I read the name quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nPJsRC"&gt;The names are goofy, but the absurdity is highlighted because, other than during our dark pandemic era, when would anyone notice the brand name of a vaccine? We’re at a perfect intersection of having enough time to care, enough fear to obsess, and enough nihilism to laugh. Remember this next year &lt;a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza_virus_vaccine-vial_intramuscular/article.htm"&gt;when new flu shot brand names drop&lt;/a&gt;. Afluria 2 will need your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVRvy3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="5zzzQb"&gt;Netflix has released a lot of information about its movie lineup through the end of the year, including details of its holiday slate of films. If you love cheesy holiday movies, it seems like Netflix will have you covered this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSdJca"&gt;Fans of the ridiculous &lt;em&gt;The Princess Switch&lt;/em&gt; movies starring Vanessa Hudgens will be pleased to know that there’s a third one set to release in November. There’s also &lt;em&gt;A Castle for Christmas&lt;/em&gt;, a romcom about a woman who wants to buy a castle in Scotland, which is also scheduled for November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULSic7"&gt;There are a number of non-holiday movies on the way this fall and winter, too, and we’ve listed out the full schedule below. Note that movies will hit theaters shortly before they come to Netflix, and we’ve noted when that’s the case.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best gaming laptops in 2021: seven laptops to get your game on</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best gaming laptop at every size and price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="SKtFh9"&gt;The best gaming laptops are changing every year. The early days of mobile gaming were largely desktop replacements — clunky chassis, multiple power bricks, and RGB lighting galore. But the top contenders now are different. Manufacturers are finally putting powerful specs in sleeker, more portable, and more professional builds. They have excellent, fast refreshing screens that are necessary for a great gaming experience. These laptops aren’t just great for gaming, but for everyday work as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiHviH"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;. It can handle the most demanding games on the market today and also makes a great daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRi2QJ"&gt;We’ll be updating this page regularly as the best gaming laptops hit shelves throughout this year. Some exciting updates are on the way. AMD and Nvidia have announced their next-gen series of mobile processors and mobile graphics cards — the Ryzen 5000 series and the GeForce RTX 3000 series, respectively — and we’re already seeing them in premium gaming laptops across manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGRnFN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD screen&lt;/a&gt; is another feature to watch for in the best gaming laptops. A growing number of manufacturers are releasing configurations with 1440p displays, even in gaming laptops under $2,000. These options can hit a sweet spot for many gamers: a better experience than 1080p without the price premium or raw horsepower required for a 4K display. You can expect decently high refresh rates from these panels as well, depending on the model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5KtNO"&gt;One more thing to keep in mind with the best gaming laptops is the power you can expect. Not all chips with the same name are created equal — the RTX 3070 in one laptop may not deliver the same frame rates as the RTX 3070 in another laptop due to its wattage (as well as other factors like the processor and cooling). Nvidia now requires companies to disclose clock speeds and graphics power on each model’s product page, but plenty of manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;haven’t done that yet&lt;/a&gt;. Your best bet, if you can’t find those numbers on a company’s website, is to read some reviews and make sure the model you’re considering will deliver the frame rates you’re looking for. We will note the wattage used in any laptops we review with the new RTX graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dqOSgQ"&gt;Asus’s ROG Zephyrus G14 was our top gaming laptop pick for quite a while. It did just about everything right, and we weren’t sure whether Asus could ever replicate its resounding success. But somehow, the company managed to make the G14 just a bit bigger, and a heck of a lot better. In doing so, it’s created the ROG Zephyrus G15, the best 15-inch rig you can buy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsXGzm"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not making any compromises on performance for that portability: it’s powered by the top mobile chips that AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and includes a fast 165Hz QHD (1440p) display. Together, those components can handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. The panel has excellent color reproduction as well, so your games will look great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMlhzT"&gt;But it’s not just the gaming; almost everything else about the G15 is great, too. The audio (pumped from a six-speaker array) has strong percussion and bass, the keyboard and touchpad have a satisfying click, the port selection leaves little to be desired, and the battery can last for a whopping eight and a half hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MktsFD"&gt;The G15 won’t be the laptop for everyone. There’s no webcam, which is a significant oversight, and some may prefer something more affordable, or with a flashier aesthetic. But as a package, the G15 is the one to beat. Not only is it the best gaming laptop you can buy, but it’s also one of the best laptops you can buy, period. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gXl1tL"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ibDYbq"&gt;The best gaming laptop in a 14-inch chassis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PjVXGI"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best 14-inch gaming laptop you can buy. We most recently reviewed last year’s model, which includes AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series up to the eight-core Ryzen 9 4900HS and an Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU. There’s a brand-new model out featuring the Ryzen 5000 series and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series graphics, which we’re looking forward to getting our hands on ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvmPMM"&gt;For well under $2,000, the Zephyrus crams one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market into a super portable 14-inch chassis. With capable cooling to boot, the laptop delivers frame rates we’ve never seen in a laptop of this size before. It handled every game we threw at it without breaking a sweat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRoiIm"&gt;But aside from its excellent gaming performance, the G14 makes a great daily driver. The keyboard, touchpad, display, and port selection are all excellent. Even the battery life is good — something we almost never get to say about gaming laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yypId"&gt;There are a few downsides to the G14, but they’re fairly small and user-dependent. The most significant note is that it lacks a webcam; you’ll need an external one if you plan on taking video calls. There’s also some bleed in the backlighting, there’s no Thunderbolt connectivity (since it’s an AMD system, and that’s an Intel standard), and the fans can get louder than most under load. But these are very much nitpicks that won’t have a large impact on plenty of people’s gaming experience. Overall, we have very few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eM7Jm"&gt;Asus recently collaborated with DJ Alan Walker on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629096/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-alan-walker-edition-dj-deck-gaming-laptop"&gt;Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition&lt;/a&gt;, with a box that becomes  DJ deck. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best gaming laptop 2021: Razer Blade Pro 17 gaming laptop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Hw1GXC0JJNr36nQ6K4vzlWTH-k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21820230/mchin_181119_4158_0015.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a monster of a gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yzdsDK"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jT5h16"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E8Fdz3"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 delivers some of the best gaming performance you can find in a laptop — but that’s not even its superpower. What makes Razer’s 17-inch flagship so impressive is it packs that unbelievable power into a thin and attractive chassis. It’s just 0.8 inches thick and only requires one charging brick — so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaBYbX"&gt;Gaming enthusiasts can opt for a model with a 300Hz screen — the highest refresh rate you can get on a laptop — while folks who want to combine gaming with some creative work can opt for a 120Hz touchscreen configuration. Both models come with a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color to the Pro’s design without being too obnoxious for the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsGaDN"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 certainly isn’t cheap, but it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 Advantage Edition is powered by an impressive AMD processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2kvoth"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SAASF8"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HhOl4t"&gt;The ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition is one of the few gaming laptops you’ll find that includes both an AMD processor and an AMD GPU. Not to worry — it delivers gaming performance on par with what you’ll see from laptops with Nvidia’s top GPUs. It also delivers one of the best gaming battery experiences we’ve ever seen — it was able to maintain playable frame rates on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;for over an hour with no charger attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHVLju"&gt;Speaking of battery, we averaged nine hours and 16 minutes of work use between charges, which makes the Strix G15 far and away one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops on the market. That’s doubly impressive because it’s powering a ton of flashy LEDs, including a per-key RGB keyboard and a colorful light strip around the front edge of the deck. If you’re looking for a jazzy, bold design and you’re all-in on AMD, the Strix G15 Advantage edition is the best gaming laptop for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE is the best gaming laptop you can buy for $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MaGh3q"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;Dell G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DMtcRV"&gt;The best budget gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hCCjrZ"&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE offers a great gaming experience at a price range far below that of many competitors. You can buy it for around $1,000, and it doesn’t ask too many compromises for that price. While it only comes with a 60Hz screen, the hardware inside (especially AMD’s Ryzen 7 processor) is capable of maxing that out on all kinds of demanding games at native 1080p resolution, so you can reliably expect a playable experience from your favorite titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6ozmE"&gt;We’re also impressed by the G5’s connectivity. It includes a Mini DisplayPort, an HDMI, and an Ethernet jack — all ports you don’t see every day on laptops at this price point. Overall, if you’re looking for great value for your money, the G5 is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade 15 is the 15-inch gaming laptop to beat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="n9BvYP"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wzRw2D"&gt;A great thin and light gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="EcPuJg"&gt;The Blade 15 isn’t as powerful as its 17-inch sibling, but it may be a more pragmatic purchase for many people. If you’re looking for a balanced combination of performance and portability, the Blade 15 may hit that sweet spot. It still packs the top chips on the market and can come with a 300Hz display, but at just 4.7 pounds and 0.7 inches thick, it’s comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines like the Dell XPS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8vpQe"&gt;In addition to its reliable gaming performance, the Blade 15 works well as a productivity machine. We’re big fans of its keyboard, which is quite comfortable to use and has per-key RGB lighting, and the touchpad, which is roomy with a satisfying click. Our primary complaint is that this Blade got quite hot during our game testing — not only did the processor reach 99 degrees, but the hinge and palm rests were uncomfortable to touch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7lPrCK"&gt;The best laptop with flashy RGB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SK7elL"&gt;If you’re looking for a “traditional” premium gaming laptop with colorful, flashy panache, the ROG Strix Scar 15 is for you. The Strix’s keyboard isn’t just one of the most comfortable that we’ve ever tested on a gaming laptop; it also has some of the coolest per-key RGB lighting we’ve ever seen with all kinds of effects. There’s also a colorful light strip wrapped around the front of the deck (customizable as well) and a colorful glowing logo on the lid. In short: if you use this in public, people will notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZuwqX"&gt;Of course, the Strix is great on the inside as well, delivering some of the best frame rates you’ll find from a 15-inch laptop with Intel’s and Nvidia’s top chips. You’ll get the full benefit of their power with a 300Hz screen option as well. And the Strix comes preloaded with various programs to help customize your gaming experience. You can personalize color profiles, bandwidth allocation, and more based on the type of game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tCRMB0"&gt;A gaming laptop with desktop-class parts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SH9RLt"&gt;If money and desk space are no objects for you, you might be interested in the Alienware Area-51m. This hefty rig is essentially a desktop in laptop form. It pairs a desktop-class processor and a full-power mobile GPU with a 17-inch display and a full-size keyboard, delivering true desktop performance in a chassis that’s still (technically) portable. PC enthusiasts will also appreciate that you can update many of the components yourself, including the processor, RAM, and storage. &lt;/p&gt;
