    <title>The Mark Cuban-founded audio app Fireside is asking its own users to invest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ccaAj5n5B1QvdZobYVbgd25AKWw=/225x0:1515x860/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69655806/Screen_Shot_2021_07_29_at_10.12.20_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Fireside&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8cqlOx"&gt;The Mark Cuban-funded and co-founded audio app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272148/mark-cuban-fireside-podcast-app-launch-creator-conversations"&gt;Fireside&lt;/a&gt; has yet to publicly launch, but already it’s asking the limited creators on its platform for money. In an email sent to users late last night and viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, co-founder and CEO Falon Fatemi says she and the team are accepting investments through the month of August from anyone who’s interested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmDmUG"&gt;“If you believe in our vision, this is your chance to be part of it,” she writes. “Put your money where your mouth is :) (We did.)” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FusHV9"&gt;The email says more details are to come and doesn’t disclose the deal terms, how the investments will work, what the app’s valuation is, or how much the team is hoping to raise. But the email does also make a couple other announcements about the future of the app and its vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kZ3MDy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fatemi says the live conversation app was “miscategorized” as social audio&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QC9akC"&gt;Next week, at the conference Podcast Movement, Fatemi says she and Cuban will take the stage to announce a partnership with podcast hosting service Libsyn. As &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315866/mark-cuban-fireside-app-podcast-platform-clubhouse"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;, Fireside hosts live audio chats similarly to Clubhouse and allows users to record those conversations. The team had told creators it planned to allow them to distribute their files as RSS-based podcasts, and the Libsyn partnership appears to be the solution for that goal. Fatemi says users will be able to optionally distribute their shows as a podcast with “one tap.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFpvef"&gt;Additionally, she says the team has arranged a deal with audio hardware company Rode to offer users discounts on various equipment. Again, no details were provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKOwQj"&gt;A Fireside spokesperson declined to comment. We’ve also reached out to Libsyn and Rode and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0H4t76"&gt;Meanwhile, the Fireside app launched on iOS last week in a closed beta. Users who download the app can sign up with their phone number and email to try to get off the waitlist. Fatemi writes in her email that the app is very much not like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586845/clubhouse-open-beta-invite-access-android-ios"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22540508/facebook-live-audio-rooms-clubhouse-rival-spaces-greenhouse"&gt;Live Audio Rooms&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455799/twitter-spaces-web-browser-clubhouse-social-audio-room"&gt;Twitter Spaces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaRHtH"&gt;“As many of you know the early media speculation miscategorized us as social audio — as many of you have stated we are creating an entirely new category,” she writes. What exactly that new category is, I’m unclear. You can see a teaser trailer for the app below, which focuses on digital creators owning their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="84HfMr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/564324070?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UfX1sV"&gt;Still, despite Fireside’s ownership goals, podcasting newsletter &lt;em&gt;Podnews&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://podnews.net/article/podcast-hosts-tos?utm_source=podnews.net&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=podnews.net:2021-07-26"&gt;flagged last week&lt;/a&gt; that some of the app’s terms stood out as not creator friendly. Notably, Fireside and associated parties may use the “recordings, including your name and likeness, for any commercial and non-commercial purposes (including the creation of NFTs), including to use, reproduce, distribute, and license to others in accordance with Fireside’s Terms of Service, in any manner of media whatsoever now or hereafter known, without further compensation or permissions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4d2tV"&gt;The terms also seem to give Fireside ultimate ownership of recordings that happen in the app, and an arbitration clause is included, as well. Some of these details might be standard, but again, they stand out because of Fatemi’s stated interest in freeing creators from binding ownership agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwhpPa"&gt;It’s unclear when Fireside will publicly launch, arguably the detail everyone wants to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon fined record $887 million over EU privacy violations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tWOR_b23RcL0ujDIsynHhN6fs8w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69655693/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qpo5Uq"&gt;Now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600255/amazon-q2-2021-earnings-aws-andy-jassy"&gt;Amazon’s Q2 earnings are in&lt;/a&gt;, it has submitted a 10-Q filing with the SEC that includes &lt;a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001018724/f373b2a5-224e-4ace-b470-bdb5d2e1b223.html#"&gt;additional details&lt;/a&gt; like this eye-popping note about a fine imposed by Luxembourg’s National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) (via &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/amazon-given-record-888-million-eu-fine-for-data-privacy-breach?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3EGvXK"&gt;On July 16, 2021, the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protection (the “CNPD”) issued a decision against Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l. claiming that Amazon’s processing of personal data did not comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. The decision imposes a fine of €746 million and corresponding practice revisions. We believe the CNPD’s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CMwS9e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The largest GDPR fine to date was a €50 million penalty handed to Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="psN8At"&gt;That converts to about $887 million US, which would be the largest fine ever under Europe’s data protection law. The CNPD has not publicly committed on its decision, and Amazon didn’t specify what revised business practices the commission is proposing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4u6H8"&gt;EU commissioners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;announced in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; that it was their belief Amazon’s retail business misused non-public data to compete with other sellers in France and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOPoaw"&gt; In a statement given to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-hit-with-record-eu-privacy-fine-11627646144"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon says, “the proposed fine is entirely out of proportion with even that interpretation.” The &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;notes that GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) regulations allow for fines of up to 4 percent of a company’s revenue, with the released number amounting to about 4.2 percent of Amazon’s reported $21.3 billion income for 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9X6ik"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="78oJY3"&gt;Maintaining the security of our customers’ information and their trust are top priorities. There has been no data breach, and no customer data has been exposed to any third party. These facts are undisputed. We strongly disagree with the CNPD’s ruling, and we intend to appeal. The decision relating to how we show customers relevant advertising relies on subjective and untested interpretations of European privacy law, and the proposed fine is entirely out of proportion with even that interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9LTTFp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 30th, 9:35AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to clarify that the Luxembourg commission is imposing the fine, and to add a statement from Amazon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRTySy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The bipartisan infrastructure bill is good for EVs, bad for the climate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Tesla Charging Station And Store Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KCEr_RAuHEtRvRmxWeLaX8934BM=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69655610/1234128057.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7INSXj"&gt;If it’s approved, the bipartisan infrastructure deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598636/white-house-infrastructure-broadband-package-bipartisan"&gt;announced this week&lt;/a&gt; will make it easier for Americans to buy and own an electric car. But it won’t help meet President Joe Biden’s ambitious goal to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22394366/joe-biden-pledge-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2030"&gt;cut carbon emissions in half by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLAcFT"&gt;Experts in urban policy and electrification told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the money authorized for a nationwide network of EV chargers would have a measurable impact on Americans’ car-buying choices. The $1 trillion deal ($550 billion of which is new spending) includes $7.5 billion to fund Biden’s plan to build half a million EV chargers across the country, which will help mend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419150/ev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan"&gt;the mostly fractured, occasionally broken system&lt;/a&gt; we currently have. A more dependable charging network will likely help juice EV sales in the US over the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAsd9Y"&gt;But it won’t help to steer people away from cars and toward more environmental modes of transportation, which many experts believe is necessary to reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lYraWd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A lot could happen between now and then&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xIll6v"&gt;There is a long way still to go. While a bipartisan group of Senate negotiators agreed on a broad framework of a deal, the bill still needs to pass through both chambers of Congress before it ends up on Biden’s desk for his signature. A lot could happen between now and then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jn74dK"&gt;If this deal passes, though, it will likely entrench — not disrupt — the transportation habits of millions of Americans. The bipartisan infrastructure plan “will make it more feasible for Americans to buy EVs and then drive them around with fewer problems,” Yonah Freemark, senior research associate at the Urban Institute, said in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrmBfX"&gt;But when it comes to the question of whether the deal will encourage Americans to use modes of transportation that are cleaner than EVs, Freemark was more pessimistic. “The bill does not seem likely to produce the conditions for a movement of Americans away from driving and toward other modes like transit, walking, and biking,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks At Mack Truck Facility In Pennsylvania" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c9fBYLnrNiGvV4ONyscRnNqEl28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749220/1331154824.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZtSPZs"&gt;There was an opportunity to revolutionize the way people get around. The proposal unveiled by the White House earlier this year was billed as an “equity-promoting, climate-change-preventing proposal,” Freemark tweeted. But as the process wound its way through the legislative meat-grinder, those radical elements — like funding for housing, schools, and racial equity — were left out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="198NrZ"&gt;For example, the bipartisan deal makes no provisions to require states and localities to “fix it first” before building new roads and highways. The original proposal called on states to repair existing roads and bridges before committing to new projects. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said as much in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412233/pete-buttigieg-transportation-secretary-interview"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in May: “When we fix things, let’s fix them right,” he said, “not just redo the status quo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fsOUKQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Our highway system is likely to expand at a much greater rate than our transit infrastructure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6Wey9f"&gt;But that provision was dropped from the bipartisan deal, which allocates nearly three times as much money for highways ($300 billion) as it does for public transportation ($105 billion). That means our highway system is likely to expand at a much greater rate than our transit infrastructure. Wider roads typically lead to more car traffic — which, in turn, generates more planet-warming emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMiYAv"&gt;“The bill provides next to nothing for non-motorized modes of transportation,” Freemark said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhOlDF"&gt;In the days leading up to the bipartisan deal’s announcement, public transportation emerged as a sticking point in the negotiations. Democrats wanted 80 percent of the funds allocated for highways and 20 percent for transit, citing past precedent, while Republicans thought that 20 percent for transit was too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCm72P"&gt;In the end, the deal would allocate $39 billion to modernize public transit, which the White House argues is the largest investment of its kind in US history. (As Freemark notes, the US spent more on transit proportionally in the late ’70s and early ’80s.) It would also replace thousands of buses and other transit vehicles with zero-emission upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e85r86"&gt;Biden’s plan to shift Americans away from fossil fuel vehicles and toward ones powered by electricity is in slightly better shape. The president originally wanted $15 billion for EV charging; instead, it looks like he’ll get $7.5 billion. But while that looks bad on the surface — that’s 50 percent less! — the EV industry argues it will nonetheless be transformational. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GRymRT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is an historic investment in charging infrastructure, which is a really big deal.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mnxP5e"&gt;“It is an historic investment in charging infrastructure, which is a really big deal,” said Joe Britton, executive director of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571747/zero-emissions-transportation-association-tesla-uber-rivian-lobby"&gt;Zero Emission Transportation Association&lt;/a&gt; (ZETA), a Washington-based lobbying group that represents companies like Tesla, Uber, Rivian, Lucid Motors, and others. “Consumers will say, ‘Wait a minute, this is happening.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EL2reH"&gt;The White House had a plan to make up for the missing funds. &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/infrastructure-deal-whittles-down-climate-spending/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;E&amp;amp;E News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the administration thought it could use its “Infrastructure Financing Authority” to tap another $7.5 billion for charging stations. But that financing authority was dropped from the deal announced this week, leaving the administration without a replacement for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqR9rr"&gt;In total, the bipartisan deal contains about $20 billion less for public transportation and EVs compared to the bipartisan framework that senators and the White House announced last June, &lt;em&gt;E&amp;amp;E &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUbuhM"&gt;Also missing from the bipartisan deal is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22334634/schumer-electric-vehicle-swap-discount-infrastructure-interview"&gt;Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s proposal&lt;/a&gt; for point-of-sale discounts for anyone trading in a gas car for an electric one. Nor does it include incentives for manufacturers to phase out their production of internal combustion engines. The Democratic leader had said his goal was for every car manufactured in America to be electric by 2030 and every car on the road to be clean by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-TRANSPORT-INFRASTRUCTURE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ylMtYHgqfreH1HAIuyYiKG707I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749227/1234018090.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="10upUn"&gt;That’s ZETA’s expressed goal as well. But Britton said it won’t happen without “strong consumer incentives and strong charging investments.” He said he was holding out for additional incentives for EVs to be included in the budget reconciliation bill that Schumer has said he wants to pass alongside the bipartisan deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYnoiB"&gt;The current federal EV tax credit of $7,500 could increase to $12,500 under an amendment that was introduced by Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) to the Clean Energy for America bill. “I don’t know that that full [$12,500] survives reconciliation,” Britton said, “but you know, very strong consumer incentives are in the works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlWrhM"&gt;But if the question is whether this deal would help meet Schumer’s goal of turning every car on the road electric by 2040 or Biden’s goal of cutting carbon emissions in half by 2030, the answer is definitely not under this current framework. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eAgIwy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t know that that full [$12,500] survives reconciliation.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OJTK9J"&gt;To understand why, look to this &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mateosfo/status/1420262881652744194"&gt;Twitter thread by Matthew Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, communications director at pro-housing group California YIMBY. In it, he notes that there are 280 million cars and trucks on the road in the US today, only 3 percent of which are electric. Americans typically buy 16–17 million cars every year, which would mean it would take roughly 16 years of EV-only sales to completely replace all of the gas cars currently on the road. Also, we would need a total ban on the sale and use of gas cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kR3s7H"&gt;Some states have indicated they want to prohibit the sale and use of internal combustion engine vehicles in the future. But that’s not a sure thing, and there’s no national plan in place to phase out gas car production. Meanwhile, modest changes to land use and transit to transform cities into virtually car-free environments would be a better approach to electrifying every car in America. Better transit and more walkable and bikeable environments would mean fewer cars would be needed overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aDEAP"&gt;Without these changes, &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab7c89"&gt;a climate catastrophe would be difficult to avoid&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘We are delivery boys who want to raise our voices’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Kzt2Fs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QWhwYT"&gt;It was a Monday night in June when César Solano Catalán heard that two of his fellow delivery cyclists had been robbed on the Willis Avenue Bridge, a thousand meters of trussed pavement running from Harlem to the Bronx. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Fc1IA"&gt;At 10:45PM, one of the couriers sent a message to &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/RepartidoresDecomidasEnNY/?ref=page_internal"&gt;El Diario de los Deliveryboys en la Gran Manzana&lt;/a&gt; (The Diary of the Delivery Boys in the Big Apple), a Facebook page that Solano operates with five of his uncles. The message urged fellow delivery workers to take precautions when crossing the bridge since two bikes had been stolen that same night. As Solano finished dinner with his uncles, he sent messages to the workers’ group chat and gathered a group to arrive at the bridge. Together, they escorted their compañeros across the bridge and helped them deliver their orders safely. That night, Solano and other delivery workers undertook the work the NYPD is not doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cgXNi"&gt;Food delivery workers in NYC have become part of a growing labor movement of gig workers. They’re demanding strong security protocols to respond to violence and theft of electric bikes; better safety protections; support when they are injured; and access to restrooms in restaurants or public facilities. And parts of that movement are playing out on pages like Solano’s, which use social media as a springboard for in-person collective action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MMxiEs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We publish whatever is related to us.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MLMd8L"&gt;Solano created El Diario de los Deliveryboys en la Gran Manzana in November 2020 after two food delivery cyclists were killed on the road. The page documents the issues that immigrant delivery workers face in New York, and sheds light on the structural inequities that impact their lives. With over 25,000 followers, El Diario has become a community space for delivery workers, mostly from Mexico and Central America, to report assaults and robberies, honor those who have been killed on the job, and amplify their fight for safety and dignity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="339hPE"&gt;“This page has several purposes: to support colleagues like us without asking for anything in return, whether in a vigil, accident, or robbery. We publish whatever is related to us,” explains Solano, who left his town of San Juan Puerto Montaña, located in the High Mountain region of Guerrero in southern Mexico, at the age of 17. “There are other pages that existed before us, but they were linked to certain groups or nationalities. But we do not have any flag, color, country, or race. We are only helping.” The term &lt;em&gt;diary&lt;/em&gt; helps describe the mission, says Solano. “It is called like that so that you can see what food delivery workers go through every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IY5QiF"&gt;According to the advocacy organization New American Economy, almost &lt;a href="https://research.newamericaneconomy.org/report/undocumented-immigrants-covid-19-crisis/"&gt;1 in 3&lt;/a&gt; food delivery workers in New York State are undocumented. Economic hardships and rising unemployment keep pushing immigrants to food apps, which are being recommended by word of mouth. If they hear about a relative or member of their community who has lost their job, Solano explains, they recommend the least worst app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="scKs6Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Your tire goes flat, your bike is stolen, they don’t answer for us. Because we are independent workers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3WPzfU"&gt;Solano had been working double shifts as a busboy in Manhattan since arriving in the US, while also working for delivery services like DoorDash to earn extra cash and pay off his crossing debt. When the pandemic began, he was laid off from the restaurant and moved to food delivery full-time, signing up for the Relay delivery app because of its secure hourly rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6yANB"&gt;“I am working with food apps because I don’t have a boss and I have flexible hours. I can rest whenever I can. That’s one of the advantages that applications give you,” says Solano. “But there are other times that apps do not understand you. Your tire goes flat, your bike is stolen, they don’t answer for us. Because we are independent workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkKjlv"&gt;Before delivering food full-time, Solano’s electric bicycle was stolen, and the average cost for one can go from $1,500 to over $4000. He felt powerless and isolated, with no means to recover it and without someone to go to for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Vq5uu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s dangerous ... It’s like going to war without weapons.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qkb7tK"&gt;“You just filed a report with the police, and the police tells you here’s the report and that’s it. They say they will call when they have something, but they never called me. The same happened to my uncle and other acquaintances,” affirms Solano, who also created another popular &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/JrCesarSolanoCatalan"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; that promotes the preservation of his native language, Tlapanec, and highlights the customs of the Meꞌphaa people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20JvC0"&gt;Amid a system that silences and erases marginalized voices, El Diario, along with their Telegram and WhatsApp groups, has been key in organizing a community-led strategy that answers directly to the impacted communities. Every time an e-bike is stolen, a delivery worker now knows where to reach out for help. If the bicycle still has a tracker, a group of three to five members goes to look for it. Or they publish a photo on the Facebook page, alerting the members to pay attention in case someone tries to sell the stolen bike. If so, again, they organize and go as a team to recover it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F95YYo"&gt;“I have participated in the recovery of five bicycles. What makes me most happy is seeing a compañero&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with his recovered bike,” says Solano. “It’s dangerous. We go without weapons, knife, or razor when going to retrieve a bicycle. It’s like going to war without weapons. As undocumented immigrants, we do not have that right or that facility to carry a weapon as self-defense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gB3BY1"&gt;The Willis Avenue Bridge, a key route for many delivery workers, has seen repeated assaults and robberies. In March, 29-year-old Francisco Villalva Vitinio, a delivery worker also from Guerrero, was shot and killed near the bridge when he refused to give his e-bike to a robber. While they wait for the NYPD to increase security measures, Solano says, they will continue to protect themselves. Every night since June 14th, they’ve been taking turns watching over their colleagues as they cross the bridge en route to a delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ino39n"&gt;“We have been there almost a month and the police have never come to accompany us. During the day they are there issuing tickets, but at night they aren’t. What we’re going through is awful,” adds Solano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AnOdM"&gt;With every live stream of a vigil to demand justice for their killed compañeros,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or of a night spent protecting fellow workers despite long workdays, El Diario not only earns new followers, but also positions itself as a digital space that houses a growing community movement. A movimiento led by workers who are carving out a space in a country that continues to deny their right to exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="T0hvg6"&gt;“We are not an organization,” explains Solano. “We are delivery boys who want to raise our voices. We demand results and progress. We are food delivery workers and want to come together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4NehX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXzefY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vaccine carrots only got us so far — now, it’s time for sticks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tj14TZjxkIQUdNluC0OJlju5kH8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69655309/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6CVBBY"&gt;This week, the dam broke. With COVID-19 surging around the United States and vaccination rates stagnating, federal agencies and state governments started announcing vaccine mandates for their workers. The Department of Veterans Affairs was the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/26/mandatory-vaccinations-urged-health-workers/"&gt;first federal agency&lt;/a&gt; to introduce a mandate, and Thursday, President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/29/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-new-actions-to-get-more-americans-vaccinated-and-slow-the-spread-of-the-delta-variant/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that all federal employees would have to be vaccinated or face testing and other protocols. New York City and Los Angeles will also &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/26/1020709931/nyc-will-require-vaccines-or-weekly-tests-for-hundreds-of-thousands-of-city-work"&gt;require&lt;/a&gt; city workers to get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9YVjv"&gt;Private companies are doing the same. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598316/google-vaccination-requirement-return-offices-covid-19-delta-variant"&gt;said Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that employees would have to be vaccinated to come to the office, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598818/facebook-vaccine-requirement-us-office-employees"&gt;Facebook and Lyft&lt;/a&gt; followed with their own announcements hours later. Some &lt;a href="https://ny.eater.com/2021/7/29/22599695/union-square-hospitality-group-requiring-vaccinations-restaurants-nyc"&gt;New York City restaurants&lt;/a&gt; are requiring that employees get vaccinated and are asking diners to show proof of vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rVZWt"&gt;For months, states and organizations have been using incentives to encourage people to get vaccinated — lottery entries, free baseball tickets, free beer. Those can work, and can spur people who were dragging their heels to make an appointment for a shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1H8oT"&gt;“Those are carrots, or positive behavioral nudges,” Aaron Carroll, chief health officer for Indiana University, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/opinion/covid-vaccine-mandate.html"&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “When it comes to incentives, most people like carrots.” Carrots are continuing — the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600571/biden-vaccine-payment-incentive"&gt;said yesterday&lt;/a&gt; it wants state and local governments to give $100 to the newly vaccinated. But carrots can only go so far. It’s clear that they’re not going to push enough people to get vaccinated to drive back the pandemic. “Sometimes, though, people need sticks,” Carroll said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vV0FBX"&gt;The US has been tiptoeing around the issue of vaccine mandates since the COVID-19 shots were first authorized. Lawmakers across the country have tried to introduce legislation &lt;a href="https://www.nashp.org/state-lawmakers-submit-bills-to-ban-employer-vaccine-mandates/"&gt;banning&lt;/a&gt; mandates. But now, with major players stepping up to require vaccinations, other, smaller organizations have cover to introduce more — they won’t be in the lonely position of being the first to do so and can point to those bigger precedents to back up their decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hcidTp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Wow, talk about hitting a tipping point…. As each organization and industry finds the courage to mandate or strongly incentivize vaccination, it makes it that much easier for the next one to do so. Until all the pressure is on leaders who have NOT done it.&lt;/p&gt;— Bob Wachter (@Bob_Wachter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bob_Wachter/status/1419735338059124750?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PdEAh1"&gt;Vaccine mandates have always been key to stopping pandemics, Carroll said in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. It took mandates to eradicate smallpox and eliminate polio. We control measles, diphtheria, and other infectious diseases by requiring kids get their shots before going to school. When vaccines aren’t required, uptake tends to stay low — it’s one reason rates of HPV vaccination aren’t as high as health experts would like, even though the shots can prevent cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aZe7K"&gt;The politicization and backlash around the COVID-19 vaccines means that, like the rest of the pandemic, mandates will be patchwork. They’re far more likely to be in place in states with higher vaccination rates and liberal leadership than in places like Florida, where Governor Ron DeSantis is &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-miami-coronavirus-pandemic-247f603722fc0f1d38d0bd97a9006c25"&gt;vocally against mandates&lt;/a&gt; and has new powers to cancel local emergency orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWNikc"&gt;But in the places where they’re implemented, mandates will get more shots in more arms. It may have been preferable to get to high vaccine rates without requirements. In the US, though, it’s unrealistic — vaccine hesitancy and misinformation is too entrenched, and too many people don’t think COVID-19 is a serious enough problem to make it worth their time. Mandates won’t fix that problem on their own, but they’re one more strategy that could help. At this point, we need all the help we can get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Var7Ef"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;

They’ve made the disease far less lethal — a fully vaccinated 80-year-old has the same risk of death from COVID-19 as an unvaccinated 50-year-old.

&lt;h2 id="grbPRu"&gt;Perspectives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="diOmZf"&gt;Most of the cats and the great apes—the gorillas and orangutans—are trained for voluntary vaccination, so they will be easy to vaccinate. And then the smaller animals are trained to go into a little mesh box, so those will be fairly easy. The trickier ones are going to be some of the mid-sized primates that maybe aren’t so interested in voluntarily being injected and are also super smart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="IOqaIp"&gt;More than numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4tzoD2"&gt;To the people who have received the 3.9 billion vaccine doses distributed so far — thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdsoGE"&gt;To the more than 196,280,506 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbHqHe"&gt;To the families and friends of the more than 4,192,702 people who have died worldwide — 611,904 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYEI4E"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s why Apple says it hates leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kusRJHhZqdRuCNeerWCWmKayuBA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69655218/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SoXH7n"&gt;Apple is a notoriously secretive company, and a cease and desist letter recently &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvzp9z/apple-says-leaks-cause-companies-to-make-iphone-cases-at-the-wrong-size"&gt;acquired by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sheds new light on &lt;em&gt;exactly &lt;/em&gt;why, arguing that leaks harm accessory makers, consumers, and Apple itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keC9kg"&gt;The C&amp;amp;D order reportedly sent to a Chinese citizen by Apple’s lawyers in China, says that leaks about Apple’s iPhone dimensions could mislead case manufacturers, who might make accessories that are incompatible with the final product. As Apple puts it, “third-party accessory manufacturers may develop and sell mobile phone cases and other accessories that are not actually compatible with the unreleased products.” &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; notes that the market for Apple accessories is estimated to be worth almost $20 billion worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VJMZXI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The secret of Apple’s latest technological innovation is an important part of the company DNA”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jwwyrk"&gt;Apple also says that leaked info prevents the company from being able to surprise and delight consumers at launch events. “Apple has made every effort to take strict measures to maintain confidentiality for any information about Apple’s products before their official release to ensure that every time Apple releases a new product, it can surprise the public,” the letter reads. “The secret of Apple’s latest technological innovation is an important part of the company DNA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYSwLp"&gt;“Such situations harm the interests of consumers and Apple. Therefore, it is obvious that when the unpublished information about the design and performance of Apple’s products is kept confidential, it has actual and potential commercial value,” Apple’s letter reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqjRjQ"&gt;The letter was sent as part of what appears to be a &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyv5bm/apple-tells-leaker-to-snitch-on-sources-or-it-will-report-them-to-the-police"&gt;crackdown on&lt;/a&gt; the sale of prototypes of unannounced Apple products on social media. These devices are allegedly stolen by factory employees and sold to anyone that could benefit, often resulting in information about the products being made public far in advance of their official announcements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZ2692"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyv5bm/apple-tells-leaker-to-snitch-on-sources-or-it-will-report-them-to-the-police"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the cease and desist letter it obtained was dated June 18th. It’s unclear how many individuals were sent similar letters, but it notes that the month coincides with the Twitter account of a seller, who went by the name “Mr. White,” disappearing from the platform. Also in June, a leaker known as “Kang” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22551182/kang-letter-apple-leak-warning-iphone-12"&gt;revealed on Weibo&lt;/a&gt; that they’d received a notice from the company, and indicated that they’d stop posting about upcoming devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLzI8I"&gt;Beyond what Apple outlines in its letter, there are a host of reasons why companies are widely understood to not want their unannounced plans to be made public. The release of confidential product information might allow competitors to start to develop copycat devices ahead of time. And hearing that an upgraded device is on the way could make people less likely to buy an existing model, per the so-called “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect"&gt;Osborne effect&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrBopN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVjIfQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band&lt;/em&gt; is set to receive another Dolby Atmos mix, after producer Giles Martin, son of the album’s original producer George Martin, admitted that the current version “doesn’t sound quite right.” The current mix, produced by the younger Martin in 2017, was made with Dolby Atmos theaters in mind, rather than personal listening via services like Apple Music. “I’m gonna replace it,” the said the two time Grammy winner &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/beatles-best-spatial-audio-albums-apple-music-abbey-road-giles-martin-1202832/"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; “It’s good. But it’s not right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIHwMA"&gt;The current Atmos mix of the album was created to &lt;a href="https://professional.dolby.com/sgt-peppers/"&gt;coincide with its 50th anniversary in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, it was designed to be played in Dolby Atmos cinemas at a series of live listening events. But now that it is available via streaming services like &lt;a href="https://news.dolby.com/en-WW/184454-sgt-pepper-s-lonely-hearts-club-band-the-immersive-experience-launches-in-liverpool-photo-image-apple-corps-ltd#:~:text=all%20tickets%20for%20the%20free%20event%20are%20now%20fully%20sold%20out.%20however%2C%20fans%20around%20the%20world%20can%20immerse%20themselves%20within%20these%20recordings%2C%20which%20are%20available%20to%20stream%20in%20dolby%20atmos%20via%20amazon%20echo%20studio%20and%20amazon%20music%20hd%20for%20the%20first%20time%2C%20with%20further%20services%20to%20follow%20in%202020."&gt;Amazon Music HD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;more recently Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;, people are listening to it in smaller rooms or with headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0sly17"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Sgt. Pepper’s is a theatrical mix that’s then being converted into a smaller medium”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VEQYdq"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Sgt. Pepper’s&lt;/em&gt; was, I think, the first album ever mixed in Dolby Atmos. And we did that as a theatrical presentation,” Martin explains. “So &lt;em&gt;Sgt. Pepper’s&lt;/em&gt; is a theatrical mix that’s then being converted into a smaller medium. Therefore, it’s not quite right. I’m gonna go back to the theatrical mix and make it into what’s called near-field Dolby Atmos, as opposed to the cinema Dolby Atmos. It’s a bit bright. It’s a bit digital. But again, I’m gonna replace it, so that’s cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdyRx7"&gt;According to Martin, the spatial mix of &lt;em&gt;Sgt. Pepper’s&lt;/em&gt; “seems to lack a bit of bass and a little bit of weight behind it.” In comparison, the Atmos mix of &lt;em&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/em&gt;, which was produced for &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; 50th anniversary in 2019 is “a much better-functioning Atmos mix because it’s much closer to the stereo mix, sonically.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6bCB8"&gt;What’s particularly fascinating about &lt;em&gt;Sgt. Pepper’s&lt;/em&gt;, is that the album was released at a time when mono recordings were the primary focus for most producers, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2017/05/23/528678711/why-remix-sgt-peppers-giles-martin-the-man-behind-the-project-explains"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;George Martin reportedly spent three weeks mixing the original mono version of the album, before spending just three days on the stereo release. The album has effectively lasted through three eras of music: first mono, then stereo, and now spatial audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AII87B"&gt;With spatial audio in its infancy, there are plenty of examples out there of well known albums that don’t sound quite right in the new format. My colleague Chris Welch outlines a few of these in his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;review of Apple Music’s spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, where songs like “Buddy Holly” by Weezer and “What’s My Age Again?” by Blink 182 suffer from problems like muffled vocals and lifeless guitars. But hopefully these are just growing pains associated with a relatively new format, and we’ll one day look back on these tracks like we look back on early stereo recordings from the 60s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjNsz1"&gt;Giles Martin’s &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/beatles-best-spatial-audio-albums-apple-music-abbey-road-giles-martin-1202832/"&gt;full interview with &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is well worth a read for the producer’s insights on the potential for spatial audio. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD’s new Radeon RX 6600 XT offers 1080p RDNA 2 gaming for $379</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JzCYI1bl5F65QpO5Xs-XrNyTaDM=/0x25:1650x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69654428/Screen_Shot_2021_07_29_at_5.08.39_PM_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT GPU from Asus | Image: AMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lmAThj"&gt;AMD has a new entry-level RX 6000-series GPU: the $379 RX 6600 XT, which is still based on the same RDNA 2 architecture as its beefier cousins, but it offers a more wallet-friendly price point. The new card promises the “ultimate 1080p gaming experience,” for customers who don’t necessarily need a next-gen 4K gaming setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTnHJN"&gt;At a suggested retail price of $379 (AMD isn’t selling its own version of the card), the RX 6600 XT slots at an even cheaper price point than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310653/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-price-release-date-availability-gpu-graphics"&gt;the $479 RX 6700 XT&lt;/a&gt; that the company released earlier this year, which targeted 1440p gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aT4HzO"&gt;The RX 6600 XT features 32 compute units, 8GB of GDDR6 RAM, a 2359 MHz base clock, 2589 MHz boosted clock, and draws 160W of power. For comparison, the top-of-the-line RX 6900 XT 80 compute units, while the RX 6700 XT offers 40 compute units. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uabxgkcULfjVUxARnRWSg3d9xtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749376/Screen_Shot_2021_07_29_at_5.07.29_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RX 6600 XT, compared to AMD’s other 6000-series GPUs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BQptbw"&gt;AMD’s logic here, though, is that most players don’t actually have the setup necessary for a full 4K gaming rig, which requires not only the latest and greatest in GPUs but also a processor and a display that can pump out enough pixels. The company cited research from IDC that claimed that roughly two-thirds of gaming displays sold last year were 1080p panels — but also that growth in high-refresh displays was 20 times higher than lower-refresh rate models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="k3lW5j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT review: AMD is back in the game","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review"},{"title":"AMD Radeon RX 6800 review: entry-level 4K","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"},{"title":"AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT review: Nvidia wins this round","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/3/17/22334662/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review-gpu-graphics-card"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XF3eH2"&gt;The RX 6600 XT is meant to slot into those trends perfectly, promising to be able to run AAA titles like &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 5 &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; at high frame rates on maximum 1080p settings. The new card isn’t meant for someone who wants the latest and greatest GPU — it’s for customers using an outdated GPU like the aging GTX 1060 (which still accounts for almost 10 percent of all graphics cards in &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/"&gt;Steam’s hardware survey&lt;/a&gt; and can struggle with more recent games).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bkZ4R35KadH5Q1LFkEN6L5PVbjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749293/Screen_Shot_2021_07_29_at_4.45.26_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: AMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;RX 6600 XT benchmarks versus the RTX 3060.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="URfWpL"&gt;The new RX 6600 XT also offers a big boost over AMD’s 5000-series cards, offering 1.4x or greater improvements in FPS rates compared to the RX 5600 XT and RX 5700 for titles like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt;. AMD also claims that the new card outperforms Nvidia’s similarly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;entry-level RTX 3060 GPU&lt;/a&gt;, which (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301391/nvidia-rtx-3060-launch-supply-demand-newegg-shuffle"&gt;at least in theory&lt;/a&gt;) starts at $329. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnznkS"&gt;AMD is also aware that supply may be an issue for the new card, commenting at a press briefing that “we’re doing our best to get supply, but the demand is unprecedented, and also the supply constraints are real, so we are working with those situations at hand.” Given the general difficulty in buying new GPUs these days, it might be best to prepare for another round of hard-to-find cards, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MFuKz"&gt;The RX 6600 XT will be available starting on August 11th from AMD’s usual slate of partners, including ASRock, Asus, Biostar, Gigabyte, MSI, PowerColor, Sapphire, XFX and Yeston, with prebuilt systems set to arrive sometime in August, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish adds HBO Max and will now offer HBO and Cinemax</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration an HBO Max logo seen displayed on..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DxuGIR6FKr8Tk6EZeh9vRFuRRPQ=/0x417:5000x3750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69653788/1229030380.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IKyeRW"&gt;Following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18055780/att-dish-hbo-battle-warnermedia-cable-streaming-battle-future"&gt;prolonged standoff&lt;/a&gt; between Dish Network and AT&amp;amp;T over licensing terms to carry HBO channels, Dish has reached an agreement with WarnerMedia to offer HBO, HBO Max, and Cinemax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6bjNb"&gt;Dish TV customers nationwide will be able to access both the HBO and Cinemax networks  today, though they’ll need to subscribe to HBO Max to get linear HBO. To promote the deal, Dish will run a free 10-day preview of the premium networks for existing customers right around the time the Olympics Games will be wrapping up, from August 6 to August 15. Customers don’t have to do anything to take advantage of the preview; the networks will appear automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvIfAn"&gt;Users interested in subscribing to HBO Max can score a discounted subscription to the service’s ad-free plan at $12 per month for up to a year if they sign up before October 27th. The service normally costs $15 per month without ads, or $10 per month if you don’t mind seeing ads on non-HBO titles. Cinemax will cost an additional $10 per month and will also include the 5-Star Max and More Max channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nkmgg"&gt;Potential subscribers should keep in mind that WarnerMedia is throwing all of its 2021 slate of films on the service, where they’ll &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;debut the same day&lt;/a&gt; they premiere in theaters. (However, its ad-supported tier &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/hbo-max-with-ads-10-mo-starting-in-june-and-guess-what-it-wont-include/#:~:text=That%20%245%2Fmo%20savings%20comes,%2C%20and%20The%20Suicide%20Squad)."&gt;will not include&lt;/a&gt; day-and-date releases like &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix 4&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;.) Subscribing to HBO Max will also unlock HBO as well as a handful of additional &lt;a href="https://my.dish.com/upgrades/premiums/hbomax"&gt;premium HBO channels&lt;/a&gt;, including HBO Family, HBO 2, HBO Latino, and HBO Signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCr1xb"&gt;HBO East, HBO West, HBO 2, and HBO Latino can be accessed with a satellite dish, and HBO Signature, HBO Family, and HBO on-demand content will require an internet-connected Hopper or Wally receiver. HBO Max is available across connected streaming devices and on most major platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vYCkE"&gt;The deal marks the end of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/1/18051390/dish-sling-tv-lose-hbo-distribution-agreement-dispute-blackout"&gt;dispute over distribution terms&lt;/a&gt; between AT&amp;amp;T and Dish that’s been ongoing since 2018, but it also arrives as HBO Max — and every streamer for that matter — looks to expand its subscriber base. The launch of HBO Max and its sister networks on Dish marks “a key addition to our distribution strategy for the platform,” Scott Miller, EVP of business and legal affairs for WarnerMedia, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj7LGifJ1euP-dbrplwPMhD36I4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67781485/dseifert_191123_3810_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 5 (left), Echo Show 8 (middle), and the Echo Show (right).&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fR5pJ"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="868HqZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on 4K TVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"},{"title":"The best smart displays for every home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;The best Echo Dot deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Late last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry: Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;third-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Prime Day, we saw the fourth-gen Echo Dot drop to its lowest price of $25. However, it’s currently only available at full price at retailers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; that showcases the time, weather, and other info that is available for $60, the full retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;The best Echo Dot Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt; is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;Like the fourth-gen Echo Dot, the Kids Edition is currently only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers at full MSRP ($60). Amazon is selling a discounted bundle for $75, however, which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition and an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VgQp2M"&gt;The best Amazon Echo deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; has also received a makeover. Like the aforementioned fourth-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. That said, it also touts a built-in smart home hub and produces better sound, thanks to a pair of 0.8-inch tweeters and a 3-inch woofer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdAa8S"&gt;Although we’ve seen the Echo drop to as low as $60 during Amazon Prime Day, it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747624046492524210#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers right now for $100. Amazon does &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M1MRHN2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offer a $100 bundle that includes a free Ring Smart Bulb&lt;/a&gt;, though, and Target is currently &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/amazon-echo--4th-gen----smart-home-hub-with-alexa---charcoal/-/A-80770246/&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22362455%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;taking $80 off a set of two Echos&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the bundled price down to $120. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;The best Amazon Echo Studio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker%2F-%2FA-81412943&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeAmazonEchoDeals051421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for a compact Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is the Echo device to consider. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest edition&lt;/a&gt;, which was launched in June, features an always-on microphone, an upgraded 2-megapixel camera, a 5.5-inch display, and a physical shutter, allowing you to block the camera’s view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8jLZ5"&gt;The second-gen model is currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B08KJN3333/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=echo+show+5&amp;amp;qid=1621006774&amp;amp;s=amazon-devices&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740550908332818656" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $85, however, you can also pick up the last-gen model at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa-charcoal%2F-%2FA-76526131%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000012807845%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Local%257CElectronics_Ecomm_Hardlines%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9061079%26targetid%3Dpla-990594042919%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwo4mIBhBsEiwAKgzXOLrJxn1_3VD1UR7wtcFcAcvw397zeAm5Hp9bimjK6d6Phv9g3whA2xoCMfYQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747625078603978178#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $45, its lowest price to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="FiYkkx"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JGaEAZ"&gt;The Echo Dot isn’t the only Echo device with a kid-friendly design. The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition offers all of the same features as the standard, second-gen Echo Show 5, only with a vibrant print on the rear and a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which grants your family access to a trove of videos, games, and other kid-friendly content. It even comes with a two-year warranty, providing a bit of protection from whatever your child might (literally) throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1db3Rn"&gt;The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition is currently available from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMSC4WZ/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740551130085982176" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $95. If you’re looking for add-ons, you can also pick up an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09345FQWY/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $115 or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093462JMH/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt; for $110, a $15 discount, through Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DwZKlk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O97UD3"&gt;The best Echo Show 8 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Like the Echo Show 5, the Echo Show 8 is available in two distinct models. Both feature 8-inch displays and dual speakers. However, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with a 13-megapixel camera and some unique software tricks, one of which grants it the ability to keep the subject centered in the frame as they move around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNLpG4"&gt;When pitted against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, their closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, both iterations of the Echo Show 8 are better options for a few reasons: they feature slightly larger displays, better speakers, and cameras that allow you to use them as video chatting devices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the first-gen Show 8 go as low as $65. However, it’s currently only available for $110 — its full retail price — at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. There are also a few bundles available for a few dollars more. For $120, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a first-gen Echo Show 8 and a 1080 Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $135. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovLiAu"&gt;The second-generation Echo Show 8 is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084DCJKSL/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08J8FFJ8H_toAsin_B084DCJKSL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742759409782754841#donotlink?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22299044%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fthis-is-my-next%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1082904/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https://www.target.com/p/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen/-/A-83387876&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22299044%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/this-is-my-next%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $130. Like the last-gen model, it’s also available in a bundle that contains a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZN82HH7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blink Mini for $140&lt;/a&gt; or with an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0914YLN4D/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;adjustable stand for $155&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="QJ2PFl"&gt;The best Echo Show 10 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and, unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It’s also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;We have seen the latest Echo Show 10 get discounted as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now. But if you want to buy this product, you can get it for its usual $250 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGQIus"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329393970906605#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/echo-show-10/dp/B08SQ2F8D2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; also have a bundle, which includes an Echo Show 10 and a Blink Mini security camera for $260. Target also has the discounted bundle, however, you’ll need to add the Blink Camera to your cart separately for the promotion to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bA0Mnl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10362085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
