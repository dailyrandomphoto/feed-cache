    <title>Go read this story of tech workers who secretly work multiple remote jobs</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jkhjVp"&gt;For journalists and others in creative and technical fields, having a side hustle or doing freelance work is extremely common. In addition to a day job an editor, for example, one may write paid-per-piece articles for other publications who aren’t competitors of her primary employer, and typically (ideally) with her employer’s explicit or tacit approval. Some people do so for the needed additional income, some like the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="actdTW"&gt;And according to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/these-people-who-work-from-home-have-a-secret-they-have-two-jobs-11628866529"&gt;story in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; a new &lt;a href="https://overemployed.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; provides tips for tech workers who want to earn two full-time paychecks while working remotely, giving half-assed effort to one (or both) and without letting either employer know about the other. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; describes the scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="vQRqVd"&gt;Alone in their home offices, they toggle between two laptops. They play “Tetris” with their calendars, trying to dodge endless meetings. Sometimes they log on to two meetings at once. They use paid time off—in some cases, unlimited—to juggle the occasional big project or ramp up at a new gig. Many say they don’t work more than 40 hours a week for both jobs combined. They don’t apologize for taking advantage of a system they feel has taken advantage of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dwqvTN"&gt;The workers who spoke to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; (anonymously) seem to go to great lengths to work for two companies simultaneously; from keeping extremely organized calendars, to juggling overlapping Zoom calls and project deadlines. And while it’s not necessarily illegal to work for more than one company, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reports, such arrangements may run afoul of employment contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KS9b9n"&gt;There’s no doubt that many employers are reaping what they’ve sown with workers across the employment spectrum; along with a lack of job security and meager paychecks, workers are dealing with a pandemic that has upended home and work life for everyone. The thing that bugged me in this piece was how some of the workers talked about gaming the system by lying about what are valid reasons someone would need accommodation from their employer: They use their unlimited PTO for a month off and cite “COVID-19 burnout,” or skip out of double-booked meetings by taking “an imaginary call from a child’s school.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIrsMK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/these-people-who-work-from-home-have-a-secret-they-have-two-jobs-11628866529"&gt;Go read this very interesting &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; about what it’s like to juggle remote jobs, and how people claim to get away with it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New and existing Google Fi subscribers can get $400 off the new Galaxy Z Flip 3 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jpkyw0E8E_Oa4pO2AlBEZuTAV6g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69725175/cwelch_210809_4701_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The new Samsung Galaxy z Flip 3  | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xUzlBk"&gt;Google Fi new and existing customers can &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip3-5g"&gt;get the new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 &lt;/a&gt;for $400 off, a significant discount on its $999 price tag. There are a &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/promo-terms/?p=2021-august-samsung-flip"&gt;few caveats&lt;/a&gt;, of course, and you have to purchase the phone first and keep it on a Fi plan for 30 days before you get the discount in the form of a bill credit. But if you’re an existing Fi subscriber and had your eye on the Flip 3 anyway, this deal makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lc0YT9"&gt;If you’re an existing Google Fi customer on one of its full-service plans — data-only plans are not eligible— buy the phone at &lt;a href="http://fi.google.com"&gt;fi.google.com&lt;/a&gt; and activate it on your plan. You have to keep the phone active for 30 days to receive the discount, which comes in the form of a bill credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6utyOt"&gt;Non-Fi subscribers have to activate the phone on a new full-service plan, and must transfer their existing phone number to Fi— if you choose to get a new number on your new Fi plan you won’t get the bill credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtRym3"&gt;Your purchase of a new Flip 3 will also be eligible for a $150 credit to use on Samsung’s website, just order the phone before August 26th and register it with Samsung. With the stacked discounts, you’ll save $550 on the phone, a good deal for a brand-new device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwZYch"&gt;The Fi promotion is valid “while the promotion is live and available on the &lt;a href="http://fi.google.com"&gt;fi.google.com&lt;/a&gt; site,” according to Google, and the Samsung credit is valid through November 9th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s Nitro XV282K KV monitor is great for next-gen console gaming, but it comes at a high price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Is a $900 monitor worth it for next-gen gaming?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="q7siaa"&gt;For years, my primary gaming display has been the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BZNDOO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus VS228H-P&lt;/a&gt;, a 21.5-inch screen with a 1920 x 1080 resolution I’ve had since late 2015. Even though it’s old, I’ve had very few complaints with it. But when I picked up both a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X last year, I wondered if I wasn’t using them to their full abilities by not having a monitor that could take advantage of the 120fps and 4K resolution of which the consoles were capable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpWHNq"&gt;For the past month and a half, I’ve been able to test &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://store.acer.com/en-us/28-nitro-xv2-gaming-monitor-xv282k-kvbmiipruzx" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Acer’s Nitro XV282K KV&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s new $900 gaming monitor, with two HDMI 2.1 ports, that supports 4K resolution and 120Hz refresh rates. During that time, I’ve been using it as my primary gaming screen to see if the high cost is worth investing in for higher-fidelity gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vIMGsW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10697233"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jgFf0m"&gt;The monitor offers a lot of real estate with its 28-inch 3840 x 2160 resolution (aka 4K) LCD display. Acer says the monitor has a one millisecond response time, and while I didn’t test that specifically, I haven’t felt input lag with anything I’ve tried. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaxYnZ"&gt;The Nitro has two HDMI 2.1 ports and a DisplayPort, so you can plug both next-gen consoles and your PC into the monitor if you want. It also has two built-in speakers, but they’re quite tinny. You’ll definitely want to pair the screen up with a set of external speakers or headphones of your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uELwG4"&gt;I’ll admit that I’m not the person to get really nitty-gritty on things like the colors and contrast ratio on this display. I suggest &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/acer/nitro-xv282k-kvbmiipruzx"&gt;reading &lt;em&gt;Rtings&lt;/em&gt;’ review&lt;/a&gt; for a detailed overview there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wH8rvh"&gt;But to me? Everything looked &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1URni4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; popped with color, particularly during Ariana Grande’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;dazzling in-game concert&lt;/a&gt;, and felt silky smooth at 120fps. I like to think that I’ve been just a hair more responsive in-game because of the faster frame rate. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy 7 Intergrade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the Nitro looks dramatically better than the PS4 version of the game did on my Asus monitor. Flying over Boca Raton in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593883/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox-series-x-s-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; on the Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; made me feel like I was taking a mini tropical vacation from the comfort of my own home. More than anything else, I’ve been wowed by having an HDR-equipped screen, which makes everything much more vibrant than what I’m used to on my Asus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LE3lk9oTrCQ6hAecPqqoZ9dgcuM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22776489/jpeters_210807_4702_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Here’s &lt;/em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart &lt;em&gt;on the monitor and what the monitor looks like as part of my desk setup.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RipFiJ"&gt;After more than a month with the Nitro, I was sold on everything it had to offer. I felt like I would never be able to go back to how I had been playing games before, and I was already mentally preparing to put aside some cash for a big monitor upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="160y64"&gt;But then I started playing some Nintendo Switch games again, and I remembered why I’ve never been one to care all that much about visual specs. I get more into a game due to its story and gameplay than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blkDi6"&gt;My wife and I have had a blast playing through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22597736/the-great-ace-attorney-chronicles-review-switch-ps4-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a port of two games first released for the Nintendo 3DS. It looks fine, but definitely doesn’t match up to the level of detail offered by something like the PS5’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523093/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve gotten sucked into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726336/fire-emblem-three-houses-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; playing entirely in portable mode, which seems to largely play at 30fps. The other night, I won a round of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on Switch on the Nitro, and even though it looks much worse than it does on next-gen consoles and also chugs along at 30fps, I had just as much fun as I always do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IGbT256LCAD-uOFz-GizfIrWtCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22776484/jpeters_210807_4702_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;em&gt; on the Nitro.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FkbkiY"&gt;My time switching between with Switch games and ultra-high fidelity PS5 and Xbox Series X games on the Nitro reiterated something that I’ve always believed: graphics and whiz-bang technical specs can be impressive, and they can add a lot to a game, but for me the &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; of the game is what matters most. If the game is fun, I don’t care very much how it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfJW3m"&gt;So, to answer my original question, is it worth paying $900 for Acer’s Nitro XV28 monitor to take advantage of next-gen gaming? If you have money to spend, I think so — you’ll probably be quite happy with the monitor. (Though you might have to wait a bit to buy it. The Nitro appears to be sold out as of this writing, but Acer says Amazon and Best Buy will get more stock in September.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bu7MX4"&gt;But for most, I’d recommend waiting until HDMI 2.1-equipped monitors are more affordable to buy, or putting aside more cash to spring for a really nice TV. Your next-gen games will look great on the Nitro, but the high cost might not be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4Pcty"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now buy DJI’s leaked $300 Mini SE drone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3fuYm0JNouQi3-RVLgr8dwYbeYo=/0x0:1619x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69724095/dji_mini_se.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c6Dn1w"&gt;In June, we got wind that DJI was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/6/14/22533473/dji-mini-se-mavic-walmart-leak-price-controller"&gt;about to release its most affordable drone yet&lt;/a&gt;: the $299 DJI Mini SE. It appeared to be a revamped Mavic Mini for $100 less — or depending on how you think, $150 more affordable than the $449 DJI Mini 2, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;our current fav under the $500 mark&lt;/a&gt;. The only question was, would it have any real improvements over the aging Mavic Mini or just be an affordable rebrand? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMoI3R"&gt;This week, DJI quietly put the Mini SE on sale, and we now have the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pT9fIH"&gt;Here are the only differences between the old $399 Mavic Mini and the new $299 Mini SE, as far as we can tell by poring over the company’s spec sheets and FAQ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="cxEDVN"&gt;It uses the DJI Mini 2’s newer chassis, with fewer exposed screws, stronger arms, and increased wind speed resistance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VaXljl"&gt;It uses the DJI Mini 2’s lighter, more powerful LiPo batteries, propellers, and charging hub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tBtRaL"&gt;There’s a USB-C charging port on the drone, instead of micro-USB &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GZezeh"&gt;You don’t have to update the firmware to get 24p video or manual ISO settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RUoahQ"&gt;“DJI Mini SE does not have ‘4K’ printed on the lens, and the rear aircraft status indicator is not clickable.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="hvtjp3"&gt;The rest seems exactly the same — which, importantly, means you &lt;em&gt;don’t &lt;/em&gt;get the far longer range and more reliable connection of the DJI Mini 2’s more capable OcuSync controller. The Mini SE comes with the old folding Mavic Mini design that relied on “enhanced Wi-Fi” instead, and you can’t just swap the controller for the newer one either. There’s also no 4K video, just 2.7K and 1080p, and it likely won’t offer the photo quality improvements we enjoyed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;in our Mini 2 review.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3kZh2"&gt;Technically, DJI says a few other accessories are interchangeable between its three mini drones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VpaPHC"&gt;The Mavic Mini battery charging hub cannot charge the DJI Mini SE battery, but the DJI Mini SE battery charging hub can charge the Mavic Mini battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkaqYf"&gt;Although DJI Mini SE can use Mavic Mini’s battery, the power will decrease and the total weight will exceed 250 g, requiring registration in some countries and regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WODTCx"&gt;The DJI Mini SE Intelligent Flight Battery, propellers, Two-Way Charging Hub, and 360° Propeller Guard are compatible with DJI Mini 2. The Mavic Mini DIY Creative Kit, Mavic Mini Snap Adapter, Mavic Mini Propeller Holder, and Mavic Mini Intelligent Flight Battery (international version) are compatible with DJI Mini SE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gX6GuJ"&gt;Like with the Mavic Mini, your wireless range depends on where you buy and where you use it, with the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, and Taiwan getting a version (MT2SS5) with 4 km transmission range, while Europe and Asia may be limited to 2 km or even 500 meters depending on the version.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia’s first game that responds directly to touch is coming this August</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cfSoa7ZqSZJQW9DUWxbqHignZjY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69724043/akrales_191113_3779_0248.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iRb9Zo"&gt;Amplitude Studios’ upcoming strategy game, &lt;em&gt;Humankind&lt;/em&gt;, will be the first Stadia release to feature a new touch-focused control scheme when it comes out on August 17th, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/13/humankind-direct-touch-controls-stadia-android/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by Google&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;“Direct touch” is designed around multitouch finger inputs like a traditional mobile game, rather than the previous way you may have played Stadia on your phone, with a Bluetooth controller or gamepad overlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZklmzT"&gt;The screenshots Google shared give a pretty good idea of how playing with direct touch works in &lt;em&gt;Humankind&lt;/em&gt;. A single finger tap selects in-game objects, holding a finger down previews content, two fingers cancel, dragging your fingering around moves your view in-game, and three fingers brings up the pause menu. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LT6tRobScaRhuzeKTFZzXBe-kJQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781713/HKStadia_TouchGestures__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The touch controls for Humankind with direct touch enabled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sPsEZx"&gt;The game will also feature Stadia’s State Share feature, which allows a friend to pick up where you left off in a game just by sharing a screenshot or video clip with them. In the case of &lt;em&gt;Humankin&lt;/em&gt;d, that also allows you to use a feature called “Leave Your Mark” where you let your friend play through your same world, find the ruins of your civilization, and compare their achievements to yours as they play.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wIMj0YR6PcgESdAuYpwZBj42tCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781716/image__12_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stadia’s state share feature with &lt;/em&gt;Humankind’s &lt;em&gt;“Leave Your Mark” twist will allow friends to play through each other’s worlds and interact with each other’s achievements.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c6e0xW"&gt;Using direct touch rather than a controller for a 4X turn-based strategy game like &lt;em&gt;Humankind&lt;/em&gt; makes sense, if only because offering satisfying controller support is difficult. Strategy games require navigating complicated menus and being precise where you deploy troops or build structures. You can translate a mouse to a controller stick, but you’ll lack some of the finesse you could have had otherwise. That’s why good console-specific releases of strategy franchises &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/2/21/4012924/civilization-revolution-ios-multiplayer-mode-add-ons"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;Civilization Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are so beloved: they strip down a game to its core elements and simplify things so they work with a controller or touch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X496665PdJ3bGINsNuC_KppHJT0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781718/Direct_Touch_UI_Introduction_FINAL.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stadia’s in-app prompt to enable direct touch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="38LYxR"&gt;Touch controls do come with a potential extra challenge for a streaming games service like Stadia — potential latency issues. With touch, you might expect even more immediate responses to your taps than with a controller, which isn’t always possible with slower connections. When asked, Google did not share if it’s had to make any adjusts to accommodate latency with direct touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UntzJK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Stadia is coming to Chromecast with Google TV and Android TV on June 23rd ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522416/google-stadia-chromecast-tv-nvidia-shield-android-devices-list-date"},{"title":"It took Google 526 days to give you a way to search through Stadia’s 172 games ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407927/google-stadia-store-search-bar-roll-out-526-days"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0sqkRY"&gt;Direct touch was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349930/google-stadia-touchscreen-controls-games-android-feature-rumor"&gt;originally spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; in an update to the Stadia app on Android, and it still isn’t entirely clear what implementing the input method entails. Google says that &lt;em&gt;Humankind&lt;/em&gt;’s use of direct touch is custom and that the feature should make it easier to port games to Stadia while maintaining the same control schemes. Whether direct touch could help mobile-first titles come to Stadia remains to be seen, but it does mean that games should be a lot easier to play on your phone in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDDfQN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Humankind&lt;/em&gt; is scheduled to be released on PC, Mac, and Stadia on August 17th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola is updating its first-gen foldable Razr — with Android 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vnq9LHmbpjTnN2EJ0oi1YzPVkog=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69723914/awhite_200210_3893_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Avery White for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PYMq5g"&gt;You could be forgiven for forgetting about Motorola’s folding phones in light of new shiny ones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22613790/samsung-galaxy-fold-flip-3-event-watch-announcements"&gt;announced by the likes of Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, but someone at the company must care about them — &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/motorola-razr-update/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new OS update has been released for the 2019 Razr&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it from Android 10, to Android 11 (&lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/08/13/motorola-razr-android-11-update/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Droid-Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Yes, that’s correct — the OS that &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-11-update-tracker-1155652/"&gt;started hitting Pixels in September of 2020&lt;/a&gt; is the one that became available for the Razr today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsn1DE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The original Razr reboot and the Razr 5G both became available in 2020. However, the first one was announced in 2019, so I’ll refer to it as the 2019 Razr to help avoid confusion between it and the Razr 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vZq3an"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Getting the update only a few months after its much better successor isn’t too shabby&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sBk7g7"&gt;While it may seem like the update for the 2019 Razr is woefully late, consider this: according to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/27/the-moto-razr-5g-is-finally-getting-android-11-catching-up-to-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold2/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://motorola-mobility-en-in.custhelp.com/app/software-upgrade/g_id/2014"&gt;Motorola’s updates page&lt;/a&gt;, Android 11 started rolling out to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;much better 2020 Razr 5G&lt;/a&gt; sometime between April and July. For how first-gen the 2019 Razr is, getting the update only a few months after its successor isn’t too shabby (despite the fact that getting it almost a year after it started rolling out is pretty rough, on an absolute timescale).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLBHVM"&gt;Motorola’s update issues aren’t limited to its foldables, however. Many of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311690/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs"&gt;recent phones&lt;/a&gt; only come with the promise of two years of security updates, with some higher-end ones getting one major OS update. Given that the Razr &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21255018/motorola-razr-foldable-external-display-android-10-update-new-features"&gt;already got an upgrade to Android 10&lt;/a&gt; (in May of 2020), today’s update puts it at two feature updates, which is better than what Motorola promises for some of its non-folding phones. And it should be, given that the phones Motorola promises two years of security updates for cost between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22408041/motorola-moto-g-play-2021-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;$160&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538663/motorola-moto-g-stylus-5g-review-specs-screen-price"&gt;$400&lt;/a&gt; — the 2019 Razr was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;$1,500 at launch&lt;/a&gt;. (Though that isn’t to say that a $400 phone should only get two years of updates.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqCKBv"&gt;Still, if you’re still rockin’ an original Razr reboot, it’s an update you didn’t have before. You can read our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426066/android-11-review-features-bubbles-priority-notifications-updates-pixel-oneplus"&gt;full rundown of what Android 11 adds here&lt;/a&gt;, but the summary is that it brings chat app bubbles, more granular privacy permissions, and a more feature-packed power menu. Just do yourself a favor and don’t look too much at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;the features&lt;/a&gt; that are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619546/android-12-beta-4-released-platform-stable-af"&gt;getting ready to drop with Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, because it’s hard to imagine that it’ll come to the older Razr anytime soon, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A judge has ruled that Google infringed on Sonos’ patents</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/epzNXcpyn34NK_hAGLAwxhYqWuE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69723642/bfarsace_190826_3621_0023.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tvsZA6"&gt;Google has infringed upon Sonos’ patents, according to &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21041851-itc-judge-decision-sonos-v-google/"&gt;an initial ruling&lt;/a&gt; from a US International Trade Commission judge. Sonos has been locked in a legal battle with Google after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055048/sonos-google-lawsuit-sues-speakers-assistant-amazon"&gt;it sued the search giant&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that it had infringed on five of its patents relating to smart speakers. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Sonos says that the ruling “is only a first step in a lengthy battle” but calls it an “important milestone in the ongoing effort to defend Sonos’ technology against Google.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uQpa1"&gt;The suit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055048/sonos-google-lawsuit-sues-speakers-assistant-amazon"&gt;began in January of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, with Sonos alleging that Google stole technology it had access to as part of a partnership between the two companies. In the lawsuit, Sonos says that Google used that tech in its own products and undercut Sonos. As part of its suit, Sonos asked for a sales ban on tons of Google hardware, including Nest Hubs, Chromecasts, and Pixel phones. The suit has since set off a legal battle between the two companies, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288161/google-countersues-sonos-patents-infringement"&gt;Google filing a countersuit&lt;/a&gt; and Sonos starting another case, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21492671/sonos-google-patents-infringement-lawsuit-wireless-audio"&gt;claiming that Google had infringed five more patents&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the original five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="snTrRM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This isn’t a final decision&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4ZamjR"&gt;The commission found that Google had infringed on all five of the patents the company had cited in the original suit. As &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/13/technology/google-sonos-patents.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, this isn’t a final decision. The International Trade Commission will have to consider the case as well and issue its own ruling, which will happen on December 13th. The decision is also only for one case — there’s still &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/google-sonos-slammed-by-court-over-sprawling-patent-dispute"&gt;the mess of other lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; the two companies are embroiled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cjg1sD"&gt;The ruling comes as Sonos has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623470/sonos-survey-voice-assistant-google-fight"&gt;reportedly been surveying customers&lt;/a&gt; on whether they’d want a feature called “Sonos Voice Control,” which would seemingly add some more smarts to the company’s speakers (though some Sonos products &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/alexa-on-sonos" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;already support Amazon’s Alexa&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgirs0"&gt;There’s also the backdrop of antitrust complaints against Google. In its statement, Sonos says that its effort against Google is meant to “ensure all companies, regardless of size, receive fair compensation for investing in the development of industry leading technology.” In other words, Sonos is painting itself as the little guy going up against the Goliath. Sonos’ CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21070812/sonos-tile-basecamp-popsocket-congressional-hearing-amazon-google-apple-competition"&gt;has even testified in front of Congress&lt;/a&gt; that big tech companies like Google harm competition in their quest to be everything to everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUuBy2"&gt;Google spokesperson José Castañeda gave the following statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ziZNwG"&gt; We do not use Sonos’ technology, and we compete on the quality of our products and the merits of our ideas. We disagree with this preliminary ruling and will continue to make our case in the upcoming review process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3T8Bp"&gt;July 2021 was officially the hottest month humans have ever recorded. This July narrowly beat out three previous months in 2016, 2019, and 2020 that had tied for the previous title. The fact that all of this has happened so recently just screams climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="2yreB2"&gt;“In this case, first place is the worst place to be,” Rick Spinrad, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), said in a &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/its-official-july-2021-was-earths-hottest-month-on-record"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. NOAA confirmed the new temperature record today, which Spinrad said, “adds to the disturbing and disruptive path that climate change has set for the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2DVxGS"&gt;Scientists have more evidence than ever that links climate change to more extreme weather, especially when it comes to heat. By burning fossil fuels, humans have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;influenced the weather around the world&lt;/a&gt;, a major new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;United Nations climate report&lt;/a&gt; said definitively when it was published earlier this week. Almost every region of the world, apart from the polar regions, has seen a rise in extreme heat events since the 1950s, according to the new report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owJeEv"&gt;“Climate change is a problem that is here now. Nobody’s safe, and it’s getting worse faster,” Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said in an August 9 press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="vzbY5C"&gt;&lt;q&gt; ‘&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/" target="_blank"&gt;virtually impossible’&lt;/a&gt; without climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bNSDVH"&gt;While last month was the hottest month in the books &lt;em&gt;globally&lt;/em&gt; since records started 142 years ago, the heat was particularly bad in some regions. July absolutely smashed the land-surface temperature record for the entire Northern Hemisphere, according to NOAA. Asia also had its hottest July on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxHLnO"&gt;Such unprecedented heat can take a heavy toll even in typically cooler regions, especially since people and infrastructure there haven’t had to adapt to such hot summers — until now. Southwest Canada and the Pacific Northwest, for example, have suddenly suffered repeated heatwaves this summer that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;mangled roads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580120/emergency-department-visits-spiked-june-heat-wave-us-northwest"&gt;killed hundreds of people, sent thousands more to emergency departments&lt;/a&gt;, and fueled massive wildfires. The most severe heatwave to hit, which took place in late June, would have been “&lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/"&gt;virtually impossible&lt;/a&gt;” without climate change, an international team of researchers determined. It was also declared the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602208/june-heatwave-most-extreme-summer-record-north-america"&gt;“most extreme” summer heatwave&lt;/a&gt; in North America since records began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzfikT"&gt;August has been scorching, too. &lt;a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-forecasts/dangerous-heat-wave-to-bake-northwest-set-record-highs-in-seattle-portland/996889"&gt;Another heatwave&lt;/a&gt; is bearing down on the Pacific Northwest. Europe might have seen its &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/mediterranean-gripped-extreme-heat-new-reported-temperature-record"&gt;hottest day on record on August 11&lt;/a&gt;, when the mercury rose to 48.8 degrees Celsius (119.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in Sicily, Italy. The World Meteorological Organization is still working to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21395621/hottest-temperatures-verification-research-death-valley-wmo-record"&gt;verify that record.&lt;/a&gt; But if greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow, the world is likely to see more and more temperature records fall. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit launches a TikTok-like video feed on iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hdhcRJ5b6ulX4oI91R2QqFxuOl8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69723291/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YroA8w"&gt;If you opened your Reddit app today and noticed a new video button next to the search bar, you could be a tap away from experiencing the forum platform’s take on TikTok. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/reddit-is-quietly-rolling-out-a-tiktok-like-video-feed-button-on-ios/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; writes that the video feed, which pulls content from subreddits you follow along with some you don’t, started rolling out to iOS users on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGvuIr"&gt;Loading up the feed on my own Reddit iOS app, the experience is unavoidably TikTok-like. You can scroll through a vertical, perpetual list of videos featuring content from the wide world of Reddit. Interaction options include upvoting and downvoting, along with commenting, “awarding” (using Reddit’s in-app currency to purchase medals and reactions), and sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h3Dunqfr9nYAM5odNvpYcbV30AQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781201/66077368_EA5F_4728_9D41_DF790EBC4C7E.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The video feed in the Reddit iOS app looks a lot like TikTok.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YgKr-2-f-0y_6QFwWcdidET_zKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781200/3D11EAB5_4D9C_4A7E_ACA0_9BD59A0C5C5B.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Reddit video feed allows you to upvote, downvote, and comment on videos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IfFe6T"&gt;What’s not clear is how Reddit pulls video content from subreddits you don’t follow. TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfczi2cI6Cs"&gt;is famous for its algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, but when &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; asked if Reddit deployed something similar, the company declined to comment. When asked by &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;how it recommends content, and if the video feature had an official title, Reddit also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SvEaU"&gt;It shouldn’t be too surprising that Reddit is pushing further into video. Not necessarily because other platforms and social networks like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; have their own TikTok competitors, but because Reddit implied as much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173774/reddit-acquires-dubsmash-tiktok-rival-short-form-video-tools"&gt;when it acquired Dubsmash&lt;/a&gt;. The creative video app isn’t involved in this specific feature, but Reddit still intends to incorporate its video tools — and entirely new ones — into its platform going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pf5e2y"&gt;Reddit hasn’t shared specific details on when you can expect the feature to hit your device, or if it’ll come to Android, but it is rolling out now.&lt;/p&gt;
