    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DneWdn"&gt;Nvidia has started teasing its RTX 3000 series launch for laptops. The GPU manufacturer is holding a virtual press event for CES tomorrow, and it’s widely expected to unveil the mobile versions of the RTX 3000 series GPUs. A new teaser video includes a very clear hint of a laptop, alongside some other announcements that Nvidia is likely to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rq19pv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nvidia-rtx-30-mobile-gpu-launch-looks-set-for-tuesday"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Guide &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that the teaser includes four images: a gaming laptop, the &lt;em&gt;Outriders &lt;/em&gt;game, a GeForce RTX logo, and resizable BAR (Base Address Register). The gaming laptop hints at the RTX 3000 mobile GPUs, but it’s also likely that the RTX logo teases further desktop GPUs. Rumors have suggested Nvidia is ready to unveil an RTX 3060 GPU that will be priced below &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21726429/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-review"&gt;Nvidia’s latest RTX 3060 Ti card&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QfgMll"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;    &lt;a href="https://t.co/AHn0BWTYBh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/AHn0BWTYBh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NVIDIA GeForce (@NVIDIAGeForce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/1347950429213134849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AlI4Ox"&gt;The resizable BAR support seems like a hint for an upcoming driver update for Nvidia’s RTX cards. Much like AMD’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21552336/amd-zen-3-ryzen-review-roundup-5950x-intel-comparison"&gt;Smart Access Memory&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia can boost the throughput between a CPU and GPU to improve framerates. Motherboard manufacturers will need to supply BIOS updates to enable this for both Intel and AMD CPUs, but Nvidia’s teaser suggests it’s ready to roll out the necessary driver support, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puo9ee"&gt;Nvidia is holding its CES press event at 9AM PT / 12PM ET on January 12th, and we’ll be covering all of the announcements as they happen.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HyperX made its first 60-percent mechanical gaming keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HyperX Alloy Origins 60" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9FDEWOuBbCA63ZHQQC3M_d5PoGQ=/0x0:6300x4200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68648721/alloyorigins60.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HyperX Alloy Origins 60&lt;/em&gt; | HyperX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="spLPz4"&gt;Most major gaming peripheral companies have already introduced 60-percent mechanical keyboards, which are more compact than full-sized versions and have become trendy in recent years for aesthetic and size reasons. But at CES 2021, HyperX is finally following suit by debuting its first compact model called the Alloy Origins 60. There are fewer keys here than one of its full-sized options, but not necessarily fewer functions; you’ll find most of the keys available have secondary functions that can be activated by holding down the function button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dA16Nu"&gt;This isn’t the first time a 60-percent keyboard has donned HyperX’s name. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248389/hyperx-ducky-one-2-mini-limited-edition-colloboration-pricing-release-date"&gt;The company collaborated with enthusiast brand Ducky on a limited release of that company’s One 2 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, injecting it with some HyperX branding and its in-house Red linear mechanical switches. Similarly, the Alloy Origins 60 features those same switches, with a USB-C port for connecting it to your computer. It can store up to three profiles with its onboard memory, which you can switch on the keyboard itself or through HyperX’s Windows 10 app. The app also enables some extra features, like letting you customize the LED lighting and set your own macro commands for the keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0BGh9"&gt;HyperX says that its keycaps included are PBT double-shot, which means that they’re far more resistant to getting shiny and having the lettering wear away after lots of use. This model will release in the US on February 22nd for $99.99. On the topic of availability, HyperX also announced during CES 2021 that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21536991/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-lightweight-wired-gaming-mouse-honeycomb-hex-design"&gt;Pulsefire Haste wired gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519747/hyperx-cloud-ii-wireless-pc-gaming-headset-ps4-ps5-nintendo-switch-usbc-review-release-date-price"&gt;Cloud II Wireless gaming headset&lt;/a&gt;, and the Cloud Revolver 7.1 wired gaming headset are all available globally.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Chamberlain built a $3,000 automatic garage door for your dog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_bf8-3uRnkmi-TWE8cZxH487IuM=/52x0:589x358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68648697/doogy_autodoor.13.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;door, dog,chamberlain&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The myQ Pet Portal&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XHwY0S"&gt;My garage door opener is one of the most boring pieces of tech in my house, made by a company that’s 67 years old. The one I bought last year looks almost identical to the ones it released a decade ago. But for the past 16 months, a small band of developers at Chamberlain has been quietly working on a gadget like nothing else on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VrcN8M"&gt;They’ve built a fully-automated, internet-connected pet door for your dog, one that gives them the freedom to go outside whenever they want, or lets you remotely activate it yourself. Your pet can approach the door to ask you for permission while you monitor its cameras from an app — one that’ll also automatically track your pet’s comings and goings in a diary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="y7n7eR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/COcqFXOwlTc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NXFWYt"&gt;It’s called &lt;a href="https://www.myq.com/ces/pet-portal"&gt;the myQ Pet Portal&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s packed with tech, including twin 1080p cameras that beam encrypted video to your phone anywhere in the world via Amazon S3 servers, IR and light-touch safety sensors to avoid pinched tails, microphones and speakers to talk to your pet, plus the encrypted Bluetooth Low Energy beacon that goes around your dog’s neck. The door won’t open until your pet is stationary for a few seconds to make sure they actually want to go out, and it closes automatically behind them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjZYoN"&gt;Preorders for the myQ Pet Portal start today at an eye-watering $3,000 and up, which at first blush makes it seem like exactly the kind of ostentatious, far-out product concept that graces the CES show floor in Vegas every year — an awesome idea to gawk at, but not something anyone actually needs. After all, can’t you already buy a simple pet flap for well under $100?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ioxHzg"&gt;But the world’s largest garage door opener company seems dead serious about building the best doggie door ever made. During the COVID-19 pandemic, roughly a dozen staffers have been toiling away in their own homes — guided by extensive surveys, focus groups and testimonials about what pet owners might need to actually&lt;em&gt; trust&lt;/em&gt; a product that lets their furry companions in and out of the house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J5PZDIOq1HSuKpaGYDVmKhOdru4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227161/chamberlain_myq_pet_portal_dog_door_research.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4f4uj2"&gt;Today, says product lead Beril Altiner, pet doors don’t necessarily have that trust. Only 34 percent of pet owners who let their pets outside have a pet door, according to a national survey conducted by the company. That means 68 percent are doing without — forcing pets to wait for humans to let them outside, forcing themselves to schedule their lives around their pets, or both. “There’s a lot of guilt among pet parents in their ability to tend to pets’ needs in a timely fashion,” says Altiner, showing me both survey results and video testimonials from individual pet owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iz8Nt4"&gt;The team thinks that’s partially because most of today’s pet doors involve making a visible hole in your house. Some make you actually cut a hole in your door. Others slide into your sliding glass door track, generally requiring you to add weather sealing to keep the breeze out. &lt;a href="https://www.petwalk.at/dog_door_instead_of_pet_flap"&gt;And&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.petsafe.net%2Felectronic-smartdoor&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22195916%2Fchamberlain-myq-pet-portal-dog-door-price-date#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.solopetdoors.com/"&gt;but&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.hitecpet.com/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://autoslide.com/pet-sliding-doors/"&gt;handful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://wayzn.com/"&gt;involve&lt;/a&gt; a flap light enough for your dog to push it out of the way, potentially allowing the cold or stray animals to get in. Many pet owners that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; buy pet doors wind up abandoning them, says Altiner. (I have some personal experience there.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Io5x7i"&gt;So instead of building yet another flap, the garage door opener company set out to build an entire door of its own — with a doggie portal that would completely seal and lock when it closes. Preferably, it’d be a pet door you wouldn’t even know was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="One of the four panels in a wooden door slides up to reveal a hidden opening for a dog." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3DtKfC1MogxEmv_ajMkljQQvOVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227137/myq_concept_vert_pet_door_2.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Video by Chamberlain&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;An early concept for how the myQ Pet Portal might have worked.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kIR18A"&gt;An early concept video shows off what that might look like, and Chamberlain actually prototyped a rough working version last January, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A working prototype of a hidden, vertically sliding dog door." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/07WNmO53-0ijRxs2HD1bW5qvfe0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227130/myq_concept_vert_pet_door_4.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Video by Chamberlain&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pcHyTD"&gt;At this point, they knew they could build a motorized, solid, weather resistant barrier that’d meet building codes and UL requirements… but in order to create an opening big enough for large dogs, they found, the stealthy vertically closing door wouldn’t have enough room left for a window. By June, an additional survey of over 500 homeowners showed the team going windowless wouldn’t be wise: 29 percent of hinged doors used by pets are &lt;em&gt;full glass&lt;/em&gt;, and 76 percent of doors dedicate at least a quarter of their height to a window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oBlaybBhJd_yJcnrmr2G9r5IrqM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227154/beril_altiner.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Beril Altiner, product lead and Chamberlain director of marketing, measuring boxes to cut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kdsnpE"&gt;Some respondents said they’d give up their glass, but enough people valued the light that the vertically sliding concept had to be shelved. “They are too big for us to ignore as a target,” reads one of Altiner’s notes in an internal presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWtjv3"&gt;The next phase was low-tech: the team cut holes in cardboard boxes and ushered some dogs through. Chamberlain still had five different mechanical openings on the table that left room for a window, but since survey respondents didn’t seem to have a preference, they used cardboard cutouts to test with actual dogs. A mechanically lifting flap left room for a 125-pound dog, it turned out, but it’d be more complicated and less safe than the alternative they eventually picked: a pair of elevator doors that could use the same infrared safety sensors &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/gadgets/the-consumer-electronics-hall-of-fame-liftmaster-garage-door-opener"&gt;that Chamberlain invented in the ‘80s&lt;/a&gt; and uses in all its garage door openers today. The design meant they’d have to settle for up-to-90-pound dogs, but they were now ready to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZcZrNi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10277326"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dcrppK"&gt;By now, well into the pandemic, the Chamberlain team had to send out jury-rigged test kits to its firmware and app developers, consisting of a board with only the raw sensors, motors and switches they’d need to manipulate, because those developers would rarely get to see a real door. In fact, it wasn’t until July that the company found a door-making partner — Kolbe — and September until they tried to put one inside an actual slab. “We worked with our partner for the longest time without ever meeting them in person,” Altiner says, recalling one day she had to wake up at 4:30 in the morning, drive four hours from Chicago to Kolbe’s facilities in Wausau, Wisconsin... then back again at 10:30 in the evening because COVID restrictions meant she couldn’t stay in a hotel overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16LUCPXdVmgZlrZkkqLMdVanU0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227150/test_rig_3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YU8yav"&gt;The team had a handful of other in-person, socially distanced meetings for big tests, but it was largely Slack, Microsoft Teams, and a whole lot of video calls and emails to put it together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1tH3h"&gt;Things didn’t always go smoothly. In September, the first real door failed its Air, Water and Pressure test, leaking liquid into the wooden slab. A Very Good Girl bumped into the too-high step in an attempt to get through. The door’s differential-driven gears churned like an overzealous egg beater. The team had to change the entire way it sealed the module to keep the water out, and switched the noisy gearbox out for a quieter direct-drive for the sequel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5lgND"&gt;The second set of doors (Alpha 2), the first to hang in actual testers’ homes, didn’t fit properly when they arrived in October — apparently the distant teams weren’t quite on the same page about measurements. They also had conspicuously dangling power cables, because they hadn’t yet routed power across the door’s hinge itself. But by December, the third set passed all the tests, and last week Chamberlain was ready to show me — via live video chat, of course — how it actually works in the field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="GgiAS3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/joojUF7OpoA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="50wndB"&gt;This is the part where I tell you I haven’t seen this door in person, so I can’t truly say, but I didn’t get the sense there was anything to hide. There are still loads of seams that make it pretty clear there’s a dog door in there — RIP, vertical sliding panel — but it looks like a real door with a big window, the elevator doors slide right open, and it seems nice and quiet. Chamberlain product manager Greg Martel had to point his phone right up close before I could hear the motors engage and the doors slide along their tracks. Fenway, a 9-year-old, 45-pound Lab Collie Spaniel mix, seemed to have no trouble opening it by herself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYKs2l"&gt;The app doesn’t do a lot right now, though. Like Chamberlain’s myQ garage door openers, the app shows you how long the door has been open, and the video and audio streams work, but tracking your pet’s outings, video recordings, even the notifications that let you know when your dog wants to go out are still to come. Here’s what the company wants the app to look like when it’s done: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LCZv6i"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10277322"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4a0MMD"&gt;And as you might expect from what I’ve described of Chamberlain’s CES sprint so far, it’s not the only thing the team needs to finish before it starts shipping to the first batch of buyers, tentatively around April. Last I checked, they were still figuring out whether it’d be rolling out nationwide or just regionally, because it wants to hire a set of trusted installers to put this door in your home. “This is going to be a pro installation only,” program leader David Schuda tells me, partially since the Pet Portal requires power through the hinge, but also because you can opt for a pre-hung door that comes with a doorframe. Installation isn’t included in the price, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wmScG"&gt;Speaking of pricing, it’s only recently that the company finalized how much you’ll pay — originally, Chamberlain told me the starting price would be closer to $1,800, before raising that 66 percent to the $3,000 it’s asking now. That’s because originally, the entry-level door would be an unpainted, windowless model, something the team changed their minds about when they remembered how few homeowners had solid doors leading to their yards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/awfbnmAmCOTLO6JYYQMGfAYRTso=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227140/myq_pet_portal_pricing.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xGor8P"&gt;For now, the fiberglass door will start with a 36 x 21-inch pane of glass, with a slightly larger one in the pricier wood model. And while $3,000 is pricier than anything else on the market, there’s nothing else that quite compares. The company justifies it saying it’s half the price some pay a dog walker each year, which — at 252 business days per year, assuming one walk per day at $20 each — seems like it could be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dfoz8i"&gt;There’s a pretty simple reason I won’t be buying a myQ Pet Portal, though, even though I love smart home gadgets and have a dog whose schedule often doesn’t meet our own: I’m in the 16 percent of doggy homeowners with sliding glass doors instead of swinging ones, a group Altiner and co admit they’re not going to be able to serve right now. But I came away fairly convinced this is both a good idea and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a piece of vaporware, which is pretty remarkable for a one-of-a-kind, multi-thousand-dollar CES product announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xC22XD"&gt;Just to cover my bases, though, I asked Chamberlain president and COO Jeff Meredith to commit to that on the record. “I want the notoriety of the product, but I also need the revenue of the product,” he told me. “It’s going to ship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vnJC2lmgWGSwoOm9nKo58i0s_zQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227155/Shot_11_DogDoorInside_388_r3.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x82QRF"&gt;If this works out, I’m curious what Chamberlain might do next. The garage door opener company might not be the most exciting tech firm in the world, but it’s had its moments, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dcA1yyfJig"&gt;like roughly a decade ago&lt;/a&gt; when it introduced the first one you could open from anywhere in the world, and more recently when it partnered with Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512509/amazon-key-for-garage-launches-us-delivery-drivers-prime"&gt;to deliver packages to your garage.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTX1YL"&gt;It might be lip service, but Schuda tells me that over 20 years with the company, he’s never seen Chamberlain spend as much time researching what people might actually want and need when building new products. Before, “we had featureitis, we’d just add features that we came up with,” says Altiner. They credit Meredith for pushing the research-driven approach, something that might sound familiar if you’re a long-time &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; reader — we wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/31/12713442/lenovo-yoga-book-tablet-design-interview-android-windows"&gt;his similar initiative at Lenovo in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, though that idea &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18019840/lenovo-yoga-book-c930-review-e-ink-tablet-laptop-windows"&gt;didn’t necessarily work out&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="utKYfK"&gt;“This is technology aimed at solving real people’s problems,” says Meredith, of the kinds of things he now wants Chamberlain to build. How many real people’s problems can you solve at $3,000? We’ll see. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ first wearable is a budget fitness tracker with two week battery</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Source: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZLg51V"&gt;OnePlus has announced its first fitness tracker, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2Foneplus-band&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22224469%2Foneplus-band-release-date-price-features-india-heart-rate-battery-life-exercise-modes#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus Band&lt;/a&gt;, featuring heart rate and blood oxygen saturation monitors, fitness and sleep tracking, and a battery life of up to two weeks. It works with Android at launch but not iOS; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2Foneplus-band%3Firclickid%3DT70wmfwOxxyLWrVwUx0Mo3EtUkEUUoQgb0AAy80%26irgwc%3D1%26utm_source%3Dimpact%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%23features%3A%7E%3Atext%3DSupport%2520for%2520iOS%2520and%2520corresponding%2520OnePlus%2Cwill%2520be%2520shared%2520on%2520later%2520date.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22224469%2Foneplus-band-release-date-price-features-india-heart-rate-battery-life-exercise-modes#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus says&lt;/a&gt; compatibility with iPhones will be added later.  The OnePlus Band will be available in India starting January 13th for ₹2,499 (around $34), but a global release is yet to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Czy8bR"&gt;The OnePlus Band is the company’s latest foray outside of smartphones, which has also included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/26/20884862/oneplus-tv-announced-specs-india"&gt;TVs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21331910/oneplus-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-price-design-sound"&gt;true wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt;. The wearable appears primarily designed for fitness, thanks to its ability to track heart rate and blood oxygen levels, and its support for 13 built in exercise modes. However, it also features sleep tracking and can act as a phone accessory with support for displaying notifications, as well as music playback and camera shutter controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TII4cSfmZMJFufxnfLhsEOdnrwE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227168/04.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Band is available in black, navy, and “tangerine gray.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGS1J"&gt;In terms of hardware, the OnePlus Band includes a rectangular 1.1-inch OLED display with a resolution of 126x294 and a silicone watch strap. It’s available in black, navy, and “tangerine gray,” and it’s got a dust and water resistance rating of IP68. Its 5ATM rating means it’s water-resistant at a depth up to 50 meters for 10 minutes. Internally there’s a 100mAh battery, which OnePlus says should offer up to two weeks of battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilRTd6"&gt;The OnePlus Band is managed via the OnePlus Health app, which is &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oneplus.health.international"&gt;available now for Android&lt;/a&gt;, and which OnePlus advertises can analyze health data and be used to set personal fitness goals. However, for the “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2Foneplus-band%3Firclickid%3DT70wmfwOxxyLWrVwUx0Mo3EtUkEUUoQgb0AAy80%26irgwc%3D1%26utm_source%3Dimpact%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%23features%3A%7E%3Atext%3Dbest%2520experience.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22224469%2Foneplus-band-release-date-price-features-india-heart-rate-battery-life-exercise-modes#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best experience&lt;/a&gt;” OnePlus says you should pair the Band with a OnePlus smartphone. A OnePlus Health app for iOS is due to arrive after the band’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP announces Snapdragon-powered Elite Folio convertible</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FeUdzu6b4gi7ozncmL3SXEbrE7w=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68648600/HP_Elite_Folio_Front_Left_Forward.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="anIhYS"&gt;HP has announced the Elite Folio, a new convertible laptop with an Arm CPU. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18196266/hp-spectre-folio-leather-laptop-convertible-2-in-1-review-specs-price-features"&gt;2019’s Spectre Folio&lt;/a&gt;, this device has a design that lets you pull the screen forward to rest between the keys and the trackpad for media consumption or touch-first work, or it can lie flat on top of the bottom shell for tablet-style use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SK6A4E"&gt;The Elite Folio has a 13.5-inch 3:2 1920 x 1280 display, which is a nice upgrade over the Spectre Folio’s 16:9 panel. HP has made use of some of the extra height by including a stylus silo above the keyboard. While the Spectre stood out for its leather finish, the Elite Folio now uses “vegan leather,” which is to say it’s not leather. But it should feel better than regular plastic, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MGpGAIzR_0tcxfN2P03WER5og8k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227156/HP_Elite_Folio_Workspace_3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3Qea4u"&gt;The processor is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020"&gt;Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s also LTE and 5G connectivity through the X20 and X55 modems. The Folio can be configured with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There are two USB-C 3.2 ports and a headphone jack. HP is claiming up to 24.5 hours of battery life when watching locally stored video files, but we’ll have to see for ourselves how that plays out in more realistic workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBy64M"&gt;The Spectre Folio was a unique product with a few clear flaws: the screen’s aspect ratio, some bad speakers, and an unreliable trackpad. We know the first one has been fixed with the Elite Folio, at least — hopefully we’ll be able to find out about the others soon enough. It’ll be out next month, and HP hasn’t announced pricing information yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/etVLS6exWiOOoKaA4XiNytCrCSI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227159/HP_Elite_Folio_Pinwheel.jpg"&gt;

    <title>Parler is gone for now as Amazon terminates hosting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-LIFESTYLE-MEDIA-POLITICS-PARLER" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3i_F4Eg6ZlMTQaAXK1I89g16EjQ=/6x0:3995x2659/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68648550/1225872885.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parler has been taken offline&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HH3EVI"&gt;After Parler was banned on both the Apple and Google app stores for failing to curb violent and threatening content on its platform, the social media site is now completely offline as a result of Amazon terminating Parler’s web hosting services. The official Parler website now returns a 403 error, while its app is showing networking errors and can’t load content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oij1R5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222637/amazon-workers-aws-stop-hosting-services-parler-capitol-violence"&gt;Amazon told Parler of its decision&lt;/a&gt; late Saturday, in a letter to chief policy officer Amy Peikoff. Its Amazon Web Service (AWS) “cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others,” &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws"&gt;the letter to Peikoff states&lt;/a&gt;, adding that Parler “poses a very real risk to public safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idJlPKDKDtg5Y6-ZthZ4Tw5JyY8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227121/File.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Parler&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parler’s iOS app, which now can’t load content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ApEuFA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cbluedreams/status/1347405890505252864?"&gt;Posts on Parler that encouraged violence&lt;/a&gt; leading up to the Wednesday attack on the Capitol that left five people dead were circulated on other platforms in the wake of the riot. An example:  “take zip ties with you, sneak up on them like ninjas and zip tie their hands and feet,” to which another poster replied: “around their neck, can’t get it off in time, they die.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81ruz0"&gt;According to the AWS &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup/?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21986678%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;acceptable use policy&lt;/a&gt; customers may not use its services “for any illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgLpkL"&gt;Parler launched in 2018 presenting itself as a free-speech haven and an alternative to other social media sites. The site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;saw its user numbers spike&lt;/a&gt; in recent months, as Twitter and Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552763/election-2020-tech-social-platforms-facebook-twitter-youtube-misinformation"&gt;tightened their moderation policies&lt;/a&gt;, especially around election and coronavirus information. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552752/facebook-stopthesteal-ban-twitter-parler-discord-trump"&gt;“Stop the Steal” campaign&lt;/a&gt; challenging President Trump’s loss gained momentum among Parler users, as did other conspiracy theories around the election. Parler’s less-strict moderation policies were part of its appeal for many users, but the lack of content moderation is a big part of why companies suspended their services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mW8lXP"&gt;When it pulled Parler from the Play Store, Google said while reasonable debate about content policy was possible, and it can be hard for apps to remove violative content immediately, “for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content.” Apple told the company that “the processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient. Specifically, we have continued to find direct threats of violence and calls to incite lawless action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XKD0V"&gt;Even with the app removed from the Play Store users could still install Parler on their Android devices by downloading it directly from Parler’s website and sideloading it. However, with its AWS services now disabled, the website and apps no longer work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytelNk"&gt;Parler CEO John Matze — who, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjmatze%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22223335%2Fparler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to his LinkedIn page&lt;/a&gt; worked for AWS for three months in 2017 — wrote in a post on Parler late Saturday that he believes Amazon, Google, and Apple “worked together to try and ensure they don’t have competition,” adding “They will NOT win! We are the worlds [sic] last hope for free speech and free information.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSELOn"&gt;Matze said in &lt;a href="https://parler.com/post/009ba435b68c46d4955e1cd7737fa27c"&gt;a separate post&lt;/a&gt; that the Parler could be offline for up to a week “as we rebuild from scratch.” Matze added, “You can expect the war on competition and free speech to continue, but don’t count us out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyhCUf"&gt;Perhaps the best-known recent instance of a site being deplatformed for violent content was social network Gab. After a gunman killed &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/us/pittsburgh-funerals-synagogue-shooting.html"&gt;eleven people in a Pittsburgh synagogue&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/27/18032930/paypal-banned-gab-following-pittsburgh-shooting"&gt;PayPal banned Gab&lt;/a&gt; from its platform, when it was revealed that suspect Robert Bowers had posted anti-Semitic threats on Gab ahead of the shooting. &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/gab-apple-inauguration.html"&gt;Apple rejected&lt;/a&gt; Gab’s application to appear in its App Store in 2016, and Twitter removed Gab’s access to its API. Google booted Gab app from its Play store in 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16166240/gab-google-play-removed-hate-speech"&gt;for violating its hate speech policy&lt;/a&gt;, and AWS &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/far-right-haven-gabcom-had-its-fundraising-site-shut-down"&gt;cut ties with Gab&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, for violating its policy against hateful content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZjE3X"&gt;Parler has not responded to multiple requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>V-Moda’s classic headphone design finally gets active noise cancellation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rOmBRIVx2y58IAOm8_LeY-rm1Sw=/0x135:2208x1607/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68648543/Screen_Shot_2021_01_10_at_8.13.08_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ymYbTF"&gt;V-Moda has announced a new version of its M-200 headphones at CES 2021 — the M-200 ANC, which bring both Bluetooth and active noise cancellation to the classic V-Moda design. Those additions come with a jump in price, though, with the M-200 ANC starting at $499.99, a jump of $150 over the wired, non-noise cancelling version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLjNda"&gt;From the outside, the M-200 ANC look extremely similar to their wired cousins, with the same iconic hexagonal design elements that have been emblematic of V-Moda’s headphones for years. Unlike the wired version, though, the drivers have been swapped out to 40mm (from 50mm ones), and there are some new buttons for controlling playback, power, and pairing, as well as a USB-C port for charging. The M-200 ANC headphones are also a touch heavier at 320g (compared to 290g on the wired model.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EQbW1iISiAnrF8E4NV2Dx2humxA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226616/Screen_Shot_2021_01_10_at_8.15.28_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KpLdWP"&gt;As for the noise cancellation, we won’t know how the M-200 ANC measure up to mainstays like Sony and Bose until we get to try them for ourselves, but V-Moda is offering what it calls “hybrid active noise cancellation,” with the option to adjust the level of noise cancellation in a companion app. V-Moda is also offering a “Voice In” feature that allows users to cover the left earcup with their hand to automatically lower volume and pause noise-cancellation. As for battery life, V-Moda says that users should get up to 20 hours off a charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnfpGp"&gt;And of course, given V-Moda’s style, there’s the option for customers to order their own custom aluminum shields in a variety of colors with their own logo or artwork engraved on it for a personal touch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffxDia"&gt;The new M-200 ANC headphones should be available today for $499.99. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;LG Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kcjSV5"&gt;LG Display has provided some details on the OLED panels it’ll be shipping to TV manufacturers this year. The lineup includes a 42-inch panel, the smallest TV-sized OLED yet from LG Display, as well as a new 83-inch panel size that likely features in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218693/sony-tv-lineup-8k-4k-z9j-a90j-a80j-x95j-x90j-ces-2021"&gt;the Bravia lineup that Sony unveiled a few days ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaKLDO"&gt;That means that OLED TVs this year will be available in sizes of 42, 48, 55, 65, 77, 83, and 88 inches. LG Display says it’s also shipping a “next-generation” 77-inch panel that’s said to be around 20 percent more efficient and therefore capable of higher brightness than before, which has been a relative disadvantage of OLED TVs to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5qGwo"&gt;LG Display is a components manufacturer and doesn’t release consumer products itself, so it’s unclear who’s actually going to put a 42-inch TV on sale this year. The larger LG Electronics company is yet to fully unveil its 2021 range of OLED TVs, but &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210110001100320"&gt;according to a report in Yonhap&lt;/a&gt;, it’ll be using “OLED evo” branding for the new panels in its 2021 “G1” series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbSF5k"&gt;LG Display has already made news at this year’s virtual CES, announcing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223774/lg-transparent-oled-tv-display-55-inch-smart-bed-ces-2021"&gt;“Smart Bed” concept&lt;/a&gt; with a transparent OLED panel that rises out of the foot, along with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223753/lg-flexible-gaming-tv-bend-oled-flat-curved"&gt;48-inch flexible panel&lt;/a&gt; that can shift from a flatscreen TV into a curved gaming monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s new Elite Dragonfly laptops come with Intel’s 11th Gen processors and 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qv2gkpDWNSp4lCqiLATFQsIvxPQ=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68647661/HP_Elite_Dragonfly_Max_Dragonfly_Blue_Workspace_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HP’s new Elite Dragonfly Max laptop.&lt;/em&gt; | HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wpszPV"&gt;HP is refreshing its business-focused Elite Dragonfly range this year with an updated G2 model and a new Dragonfly Max option. Both laptops will include Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors, and optional 5G connectivity. The Max model even improves the built-in webcam, and adds a second black color option for the range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SifBO3"&gt;Both the 13.3-inch Dragonfly G2 and Dragonfly Max will ship with 11th Gen Intel processors, with the i3 only available on the G2 and i5 and i7 processor options available on both. Both can also be configured up to 32GB of RAM and up to 2TB of M.2 SSD storage space. Both models will also include a single USB 3.1 charging port, two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, a single HDMI 1.4b port, and Nano SIM support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SpQokb5Hr0VPIxr9E3z5Wg-SVqU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22225948/HP_Elite_Dragonfly_Max_Front_Right.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PByBFd"&gt;Where the models really differ is in display configurations and webcams. The Dragonfly Max will only be available with a 13.3-inch HD (1920 x 1080) display, while you can configure the Dragonfly G2 with HD or 4K panels. Both will still include options for HP’s privacy-oriented screen that includes technology to tint the screen so that people passing by can’t snoop on what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5o8Y8"&gt;The Dragonfly Max will also include a 5-megapixel webcam, up from the 1.2-megapixel one found on the G2. It’s an essential change in an era of remote working where traditional laptop webcams are often falling short. The Max also has four wide-array microphones for better video and audio calls, and keeps the dedicated webcam privacy slider found on last year’s Dragonfly laptops. HP has removed this manual slider on the G2 this year, and replaced it with a button on the keyboard that activates the webcam shutter.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I0NHA5"&gt;Both the Dragonfly G2 and Max will include 5G options, with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile networks supported in the US. HP is also keeping the built-in Tile tracker it introduced with the 2020 models. You can track the laptop just like any other Tile device, as long as it has some battery life left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JZoon"&gt;HP says it expects both the Dragonfly G2 and Max to be available in January, but the company isn’t announcing pricing details just yet. Given the base model of the 2020 Dragonfly G2 was $1,500, this year’s models are bound to be pricey options for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler CEO says even his lawyers are abandoning him</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter Alternative Banned From App Store And Google Play" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bMgvskFm8nf2xD_oxTB3gyv50cc=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68647523/1230524287.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ByZt79"&gt;The CEO of the conservative-friendly social app Parler said that all of its vendors have abandoned the company following recent bans from Google, Apple, and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyrbkE"&gt;“Every vendor, from text message services to email providers to our lawyers, all ditched us too, on the same day,” Parler CEO John Matze said in an interview with Fox News &lt;a href="https://video.foxnews.com/v/6221679825001#sp=show-clips"&gt;on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lPzL9"&gt;Google banned Parler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, Apple removed Parler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, and Amazon has informed Parler it will be kicked from the company’s web hosting services &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222637/amazon-workers-aws-stop-hosting-services-parler-capitol-violence"&gt;Sunday evening&lt;/a&gt;. Each company cited threats of violence posted on Parler in their reasons for removing the app. Screenshots from the app shared by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220366/apple-google-parler-pressure-deplatform-violence-capitol"&gt;activist group Sleeping Giants&lt;/a&gt; showed users calling for violence against Mike Pence and threatening further activity at the Capitol on January 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpcyqN"&gt;In a post on Saturday night, Matze said that the service “will be unavailable on the internet for up to a week as we rebuild from scratch” and that “we have many competing for our business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adWDtX"&gt;But in Sunday’s interview, Matze said that it was having difficulties finding a new vendor to work with. “We’re going to try our best to get back online as quickly as possible, but we’re having a lot of trouble because every vendor we talk to says they won’t work with us. Because if Apple doesn’t approve and Google doesn’t approve, then they won’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
