    <title>My mad dash to catch up in time for Final Fantasy XIV’s Endwalker expansion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xFwFQbLUcp0lxD_NcSbDzMIDtHI=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70221383/stormblood.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kPgkdN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; is coming, and I’m not ready for it. I came to &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; only this year, ravenously tearing through &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Heavensward&lt;/em&gt; before abandoning the game somewhere in the middle of &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt;, which is generally considered to be inferior to the other FFXIV expansions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeCH33"&gt;Then news of a new expansion hit, rekindling my desire to restart my journey, hopefully finishing in time for &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s launch. I harbored no illusions about my ability to power through one-and-a-half expansions’ worth of content before December 8th, but I could try, and trying meant getting through &lt;em&gt;Stormblood &lt;/em&gt;first. So I proposed an experiment: &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; will go down for maintenance at 4AM EST in preparation for a new patch and to open up &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; early access for the lucky chosen. If I could finish &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt; before the servers go down, I’d be in a good spot to get close to the end of &lt;em&gt;Shadowbringers&lt;/em&gt; in time to start &lt;em&gt;Endwalker,&lt;/em&gt; if not by launch day, then that same week. Could I do it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZtAls"&gt;Without knowing where I was in the &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt; main story questline and dedicated to the foolish idea of keeping my tank and healer jobs evenly leveled, I said yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k9ddYo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Could I finish Stormblood before the servers go down at 4AM?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gkXXyk"&gt;One thing I appreciate about &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; is that it respects your time. If you want to play multiple classes in other MMOs — like &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; —  you have to level different characters for each class, often forcing you to repeat content. &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;’s job system lets you level as many classes as you want on the same character seamlessly. I can bounce between my gunbreaker tank and astrologian healer while progressing through the main story quest with relative ease. I’ve even developed a method by which I kept those two classes close in level. I’d gain two levels on my gunbreaker, then switch to my astrologian and catch up, rinse and repeat. It’s not a perfect system. Sometimes I’d get too far ahead in the main story quest on one class such that when I switched to the other class, I didn’t meet the level requirement to continue, forcing me to stop progression and grind a little bit to make up for lost XP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQuYV2"&gt;Now you’d think in the mad dash to finish &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt; before server maintenance locks me out of the game that I’d give up this quirky leveling dance in favor of picking one class and powering through. You would be wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBcs1r"&gt;I, like Thanos, am a creature of balance. If my class levels fall too far out of sync, there’s a greater chance that one class would be left behind to toil in meaningless side-quests to catch up. I hate grinding with a passion. There’s a reason I’ve only created one character in a decade of playing &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;. I enjoy both classes too much to leave one behind because of my stubborn refusal to grind, and that rule stuck even when time was of the essence. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PN5T4hUjTMmZdhFcYul6mTnTg5M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23059180/2021_12_01__6_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;My gunbreaker, cute as a button she is.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lEEg04"&gt;At around midnight, I had about 700,000 XP to go to even out my class levels and unlock the next main story quest. I decided to hop across the map completing fates, which are timed quests with large XP rewards anyone can participate in. I was alone, finishing a fate, when a player joined me. I didn’t catch their name, but when we finished the fate, they performed the kiss emote in thanks. I went to the next fate, and there they were again, and again for the fate after that. I loved it. Our purposes were temporarily aligned (they were probably in need of a quick grinding session like I was), and we had this very human connection and cooperation while never actually speaking to each other, communicating only in emotes. For a moment, there was a bond forged — and just as quick as it came, it was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7jO2g"&gt;Most of my MMO-playing life has been dedicated to being a damage dealer because I didn’t think I was capable of handling the responsibility that comes with being a tank or a healer. You can generally muddle through with a bad damage dealer, but if the tank or healer sucks, it’s game over. I decided to step out of my comfort zone by playing those classes in&lt;em&gt; FFXIV&lt;/em&gt;, and while my confidence in these roles has improved, I still get anxious when it’s time to do a story dungeon. I spent an incredible amount of time last night trying to level my healer to 70 because, even though my tank was already at level 70 and could go on to finish the final dungeon, thereby finishing &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt; with time to spare, I was &lt;em&gt;terrified&lt;/em&gt; of tanking that dungeon. &lt;a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Royal_Menagerie"&gt;The dungeon’s&lt;/a&gt; single boss fight was so complex with so many mechanics to remember and watch out for that I thought there was no way I’d get through it without killing the party, wasting precious time. I spent a lot of time I couldn’t really afford to spare getting my healer to 70 so I could do the much easier (but still incredibly stressful) job of healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2CSPKc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For a moment, there was a bond forged — and just as quick as it came, it was over&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SgDnkZ"&gt;I reached 70 on my healer by 3AM. The servers go down in an hour, I’m bleary-eyed and hunched over my keyboard, but I made it. Once I finish this dungeon, I’m done. And that should be a quick task because while damage dealers have to wait exceedingly long times to get into a dungeon, healers don’t, as they are generally in higher demand with a lower supply. I entered the queue, and I waited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNvIAq"&gt;And waited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJAIo4"&gt;Oh shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWAY3Z"&gt;What I thought would be an instantaneous queue stretched on and on because my dumb, sleep-deprived ass didn’t realize that most people still playing &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; an hour before server maintenance probably have better things to do than queuing for a dungeon from an expansion ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E3I5ch"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;lol i really did think i could slide in at the buzzer&lt;br&gt;man plans&lt;br&gt;rhalgr laughs&lt;/p&gt;— Ash Piss-mad Bear Parrish (@adashtra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adashtra/status/1466318211549483012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JDICji"&gt;I waited 20 minutes — an unimaginable amount of time as a healer — thinking that my quest to finish &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt; before time ran out would end here in failure. Of course, I could come back after maintenance and try again, but I was disappointed because I had come so close to achieving my absolutely bonkers goal. I looked away to tweet my failure, my hand moving toward the escape button as I finished so I could log out in shame. I almost missed the “Duty Commenced” box letting me know the party was full and the dungeon awaited. I very nearly clicked “withdraw” in surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/02wWhIK-h3iOpuD_rSo3q5wW4_s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23059175/2021_12_02__7_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Queue popped at 3:17 AM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yqKljk"&gt;Turns out, my fears about this dungeon were unfounded. My group made light work of the boss, Shinryu, with barely a scratch, let alone a death. We just blew through it like wet tissue paper, even though &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/nOaV_O97uzM"&gt;the dungeon guide video&lt;/a&gt; I watched made me believe this boss would wipe the party for the tiniest mistake. To the seven of you who queued for a &lt;em&gt;Stormblood &lt;/em&gt;dungeon in the final minutes before server shutdown, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9uI8T"&gt;Once Shinryu lay dead, and after several dramatic cutscenes, I arrived at &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt;’s end with less than 30 minutes to spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsWqCp"&gt;I won’t miss &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt;. It was a typical revolution story that didn’t seem to match the grandioseness of the stories that came before it. And while &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt; didn’t move me the way &lt;em&gt;Heavensward&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt; did, this experience definitely improved my overall impression of it. For me, &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt; was an expansion about the journey, not the destination, and this time, the end of the journey was the best. I will look back on the traveling companions who accompanied me through the final minutes of &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt; fondly, even though I’ll never remember their names nor much else of what happened in this expansion. Now only &lt;em&gt;Shadowbringers&lt;/em&gt; stands between me and my trip to the moon in &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, and from what I hear, it’s the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZUpj3"&gt;Will I make it through &lt;em&gt;Shadowbringers&lt;/em&gt; in time for &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;? Probably not. But I’ve made &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/my-nine-day-final-fantasy-xv-blitz-commences-tonight-1846096788"&gt;ill-advised sprints through &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; content&lt;/a&gt; before, and &lt;a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/The_Twelve"&gt;by the Twelve&lt;/a&gt;, I can do it again. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new always-on smartphone camera is a potential privacy nightmare</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lACklgffxG8nz2hmhVQIaneWy-g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70214589/akrales_190819_3594_0298.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The front-facing camera on a Samsung smartphone. Next year’s Qualcomm processor will allow these cameras to always scan for your face, even when you’re not using the phone.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CytRJa"&gt;“Your phone’s front camera is always securely looking for your face, even if you don’t touch it or raise to wake it.” That’s how Qualcomm Technologies vice president of product management Judd Heape &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3H6tfcZLHfg?t=10758"&gt;introduced the company’s new always-on camera capabilities&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809687/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-chip-smartphone-processor-specs-details"&gt;Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor&lt;/a&gt; set to arrive in top-shelf Android phones early next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nmar7"&gt;Depending on who you are, that statement can either be exciting or terrifying. For Qualcomm, it thinks this new feature will enable new use cases, like being able to wake and unlock your phone without having to pick it up or have it instantly lock when it no longer sees your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzXm3P"&gt;But for those of us with any sense of how modern technology is used to violate our privacy, a camera on our phone that’s always capturing images &lt;em&gt;even when we’re not using it&lt;/em&gt; sounds like the stuff of nightmares and has a cost to our privacy that far outweighs any potential convenience benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TBcjBh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A camera that records your image even when you’re not using it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eyu2fQ"&gt;Qualcomm’s main pitch for this feature is for unlocking your phone any time you glance at it, even if it’s just sitting on a table or propped up on a stand. You don’t need to pick it up or tap the screen or say a voice command — it just unlocks when it sees your face. I can see this being useful if your hands are messy or otherwise occupied (in its presentation, Qualcomm used the example of using it while cooking a recipe to check the next steps). Maybe you’ve got your phone mounted in your car, and you can just glance over at it to see driving directions without having to take your hands off the steering wheel or leave the screen on the entire time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrZO2W"&gt;The company is also spinning it as making your phone &lt;em&gt;more secure&lt;/em&gt; by automatically locking the phone when it no longer sees your face or detects someone looking over your shoulder and snooping on your group chat. It can also suppress private information or notifications from popping up if you’re looking at the phone with someone else. Basically, if you’re not looking at it, your phone is locked; if it can see you, it will be unlocked. If it can see you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; someone else, it can automatically lock the phone or hide private information or notifications from displaying on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngEJ0r"&gt;But while those features may sound neat and perhaps even convenient, I’m not convinced that having an always-on camera is worth the tradeoff in privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V6biDe"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3H6tfcZLHfg?rel=0&amp;amp;start=10758" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xrqwzE"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The always-on camera features are discussed at hour three of Qualcomm’s four-hour presentation introducing the Snapdragon Gen 1 system-on-chip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwLEwb"&gt;Qualcomm is framing the always-on camera as similar to the always-on microphones that have been in our phones for years. Those are used to listen for voice commands like “Hey Siri” or “Hey Google” (or lol, “Hi Bixby”) and then wake up the phone and provide a response, all without you having to touch or pick up the phone. But the difference is that they are listening for specific wake words and are often limited with what they can do until you do actually pick up your phone and unlock it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xePhtk"&gt;It feels a bit different when it’s a camera that’s always scanning for a likeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vTo21a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An always-on camera is a step beyond the always-on microphones already in our phones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wRk5tL"&gt;It’s true that smart home products already have features like this. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Google’s Nest Hub Max&lt;/a&gt; uses its camera to recognize your face when you walk up to it and greet you with personal information like your calendar. Home security cameras and video doorbells are constantly on, looking for activity or even specific faces. But those devices are in your home, not always carried with you everywhere you go, and generally don’t have your most private information stored on them, like your phone does. They also frequently have features like physical shutters to block the camera or intelligent modes to disable recording when you’re home and only resume it when you aren’t. It’s hard to imagine any phone manufacturer putting a physical shutter on the front of their slim and sleek flagship smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgoU53"&gt;Lastly, there have been many reports of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22322122/verkada-hack-150000-security-cameras-tesla-factory-cloudflare-jails-hospitals"&gt;security breaches&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21028092/amazon-ring-camera-hack-password-security-privacy-access-2fa"&gt;social engineering hacks&lt;/a&gt; to enable smart home cameras when they aren’t supposed to be on and then send that feed to remote servers, all without the knowledge of the homeowner. Modern smartphone operating systems now do a good job of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634128/privacy-android-12-dashboard-apps-sensors"&gt;telling you when an app is accessing your camera or microphone&lt;/a&gt; while you’re using the device, but it’s not clear how they’d be able to inform you of a rogue app tapping into the always-on camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3UlWw"&gt;In his presentation, Heape said that “always-on camera data never leaves the secure sensing hub while it’s looking for faces,” implying that the data isn’t sent to the cloud and that apps on the phone won’t be able to access it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXVxf3"&gt;In a follow up conversation after this article was originally published, Heape further clarified how the system works on a technical level. The always-on camera is part of a chain that includes a new low-power image signal processor (ISP) and a machine learning step. All three stages — the camera, the ISP, and the machine learning — are “hardened”, according to Heape, he says that it isn’t possible to inject code into the chain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPTcLp"&gt;The always-on camera is limited to a VGA (640 x 480 pixel) resolution, even though it uses the phone’s existing front-facing camera, and the rest of the phone’s systems — the main processor, cellular radios, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc — are turned off. Heape said this low-power ISP “cannot capture photos or video” and  “no image or video is stored” in this process, it only scans to detect if there is a face or not. If the machine learning algorithm determines a face is detected, the rest of the phone’s systems are awakened to authenticate the user and unlock the phone or deny access to it. “It is impossible in the low power state to get an image out of it,” says Heape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6VI9c"&gt;The system does not have a way to inform you that its always-on camera is running, like other facial recognition systems use. Heape said that an OEM could choose to add an indicator such as an LED light if they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjTYfM"&gt;Another Qualcomm Technologies vice president of product management Ziad Asghar told my colleague Chaim Gartenberg that users will also be able to disable the always-on camera feature or possibly even select which features they want to use and which they don’t. “The consumer has the choice to be able to pick and choose as to what is enabled and what’s not enabled,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TP4UtH0DVT_0Q539UAZ_GsuJDKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16257180/vpavic_190510_3415_0161.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 7 Pro hid its entire camera system in a motorized pop-up module. Perhaps it’s time to bring this idea back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SFe78n"&gt;It’s also possible that the smartphone manufacturers using the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 won’t even enable this feature at a hardware level. Since Qualcomm doesn’t actually make the smartphones its chips go in (outside of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568641/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-technology"&gt;one-off novelties&lt;/a&gt; that aren’t widely purchased), companies like Samsung, OnePlus, and Xiaomi can customize which features are enabled on their phones and which aren’t. Heape said that an OEM can request a Snapdragon chip with the feature disabled at the hardware level. Some of those companies already bypass Qualcomm’s image processing components in favor of their own solutions — it’s not hard to see them just skipping the criticisms of privacy concerns and forgoing this feature as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="0jhcqA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An unsettling and uncomfortable precedent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UPTiXp"&gt;But even if it’s not found in every phone next year, the mere presence of the feature means that it will be used by someone at some point. It sets a precedent that is unsettling and uncomfortable; Qualcomm may be the first with this capability, but it won’t be long before other companies add it in the race to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5e4X5"&gt;Ultimately, it comes down to a level of trust — do you trust that Qualcomm has set up the system in a way that prevents the always-on camera from being used for other purposes than intended? Do you trust that the OEM using Qualcomm’s chips won’t do things to interfere with the system, either for their own profit or to satisfy the demands of a government entity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJm86m"&gt;Even if you do have that trust, there’s a certain level of comfort with an always-on camera on your most personal device that goes beyond where we are currently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lugMRK"&gt;Maybe we’ll just start having to put tape on our smartphone cameras like we already do with laptop webcams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naQ17K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 5:15PM ET, December 2nd, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; After this article was published, Qualcomm vice president of product management Judd Heape gave further information about how the always-on camera system works on a technical level. The company also clarified that the system does not identify the faces it detects; that is handled by the phone’s existing facial identification authentication systems. The article has been updated with this new information and the headline has been changed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ulAUkJ"&gt;Hackers were able to access files containing personal information for hundreds of thousands of Planned Parenthood Los Angeles patients with a ransomware attack that occurred in October, according to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/12/01/los-angeles-planned-parenthood-hack/"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/EXPERIAN_H1202_Planned%20Parenthood%20of%20Los%20Angeles_L01_SAS_1.pdf"&gt;letter sent to affected patients by Planned Parenthood&lt;/a&gt; explained that the files contained patients’ names and “one or more of the following: address, insurance information, date of birth, and clinical information, such as diagnosis, procedure, and/or prescription information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5iQsm"&gt;Planned Parenthood says the ransomware was installed on its network some time between October 9th and October 17th. On the 17th, the organization noticed the intrusion, took its systems offline, and contacted law enforcement and cybersecurity investigators. By early November, it had determined what the hackers had access to but is still in the dark about the attack’s perpetrator, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/01/tech/ransomware-planned-parenthood/index.html"&gt;according to CNN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GExkxa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Planned Parenthood is still investigating the hack&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZcgWd"&gt;A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood LA told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; that it didn’t seem like the information had been “used for fraudulent purposes” and told CNN that it didn’t appear to be a targeted attack. But the data could be valuable if hackers choose to sell it, given its extremely sensitive nature — Planned Parenthood not only provides abortions but birth control, STD testing, and hormone therapy for trans patients, along with a host of other medical services. According to CNN, the data was limited to Planned Parenthood Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WguvL2"&gt;The cyberattack and data leak come at a time when abortion rights are especially fraught in the US. The Supreme Court is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/01/us/politics/supreme-court-mississippi-abortion-law.html"&gt;currently considering a case&lt;/a&gt; to determine the legality of a Mississippi law that bans abortions 15 weeks into pregnancy (as opposed to the 23 weeks set by &lt;em&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/em&gt;), and earlier this year Texas &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1033202132/texas-abortion-ban-what-happens-next"&gt;made it illegal&lt;/a&gt; to get an abortion after just six weeks of pregnancy. Texas’ law means that abortions won’t be a legal option by the time most people find out they’re pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PM23a0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This incident blends rising tensions regarding abortion, privacy, and ransomware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="deh26j"&gt;Ransomware attacks have also been a major issue this year, with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728765/us-treasury-ransomware-payout-numbers-reports-2021-first-half-cybercrime"&gt;US Treasury reporting&lt;/a&gt; that payouts from the attacks could be on track to top a billion dollars for 2021 alone. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/01/tech/ransomware-planned-parenthood/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood LA didn’t answer questions about whether there was a ransom demand made in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to arrange for your digital legacy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="cemetery (SHUTTERSTOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L21amYXQFewHblgYg9I43krU7Jo=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70221033/shutterstock_13456018.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BiAC84"&gt;I’m about to introduce a topic that most of us would rather avoid: our digital legacy. In other words, what happens to all our digital stuff after we die? (And if your answer is “That’s not gonna happen,” you haven’t been paying a lot of attention lately, have you?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOzpkg"&gt;If you’re reading this, odds are that you’ve got a lot of digital stuff, both on your own devices and floating around in the cloud: backups, photos, tweets, Facebook messages, texts, you name it. If you’re no longer around to pay attention, these can hang around for a very long time — and some of it may be important to your survivors. (For example, who else has the passwords to your bank accounts and credit cards?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgTTqR"&gt;So let’s take a deep breath and discuss how to make things easier for your friends and relatives should something happen to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R7BP3Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What happens to all our digital stuff after we die? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7dZmIj"&gt;To begin with, if you’re old enough (or wise enough) to have arranged for a will, then your executor (the person who is assigned to see that the terms of the will are carried out) will also have legal standing to access your digital assets: online accounts, websites, etc. This is specified by the &lt;a href="https://www.uniformlaws.org/committees/community-home?CommunityKey=f7237fc4-74c2-4728-81c6-b39a91ecdf22"&gt;revised Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act&lt;/a&gt;, which has been enacted by the majority of the states in the US. (As of this writing, it had not been passed by California, Oklahoma, or Louisiana; it has been introduced by not yet passed in Massachusetts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ux7j0L"&gt;Since it doesn’t do your relatives or friends any good to have the right to take care of your data if they don’t have your passwords, you might want to think about entrusting at least one person with the passwords to your computer and / or your password manager — or think about putting that information in a secure place and let at least one person know where that place is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoXb0c"&gt;However, the Act does not apply to social media sites — which could be a problem. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; include whom you want to entrust with all your social media accounts in your will, which can make things somewhat easier for them — but will still involve a lot of back and forth as they prove their right to handle those accounts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5jpXx"&gt;There are a few companies that have added features to let you plan ahead of time who is authorized to handle your cloud and / or social media accounts if you’re not able to. Listed here are how some of the major online services are (or are not) handling the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zbgz1o"&gt;Apple iCloud Digital Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RbREc2"&gt;Until recently, getting access to the iCloud account of a deceased family member could be extremely difficult, especially if you didn’t have that person’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208072"&gt;recovery key&lt;/a&gt;. However, Apple has recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;added a Digital Legacy program&lt;/a&gt; to its iCloud accounts, which lets you name up to five Legacy Contacts who will have access to your account. The program is available starting with iOS 15.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fY6lU7"&gt;To set up your Legacy Contacts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xE6VMc"&gt;Go to Settings and tap on your name at the top of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5thDh1"&gt;Select Password &amp;amp; Security &amp;gt; Legacy Contact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="65b3l2"&gt;This is where you can add the names of people who will be able to access and download your data after your death; it will also list anyone who has listed you as a Legacy Contact. Tap on Add Legacy Contact to add a name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A trusted friend or family member can access your iCloud account." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tbjCTrerbFBnHb9YNQnXw7m5YQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058282/IMG_336C1C7F4E9D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A trusted friend or family member can access your iCloud account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can add up to 10 Legacy Contacts." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m8XlGcXACpJpGrq7p5FwWDOHNkc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058283/IMG_46BBD3E4A094_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can add up to 10 Legacy Contacts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XkyQ1i"&gt;The next page explains that you should choose someone you trust, and that the person will need to have your access key and a copy of your death certificate. Tap on the Add Legacy Contact button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="86OtX9"&gt;You will be presented with a list of your contacts. Choose one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BP5Cg5"&gt;Again, a page will explain what info the contact will have access to. Tap on Continue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your access key can be shared via message or print / PDF." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fRH42kkkFepawmEQ89F6dthHzY4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058295/IMG_86EF6F6C0BD0_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your access key can be shared via message or print / PDF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If your contact is an iOS user, they can be messaged the access key." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4fCQQEqvXgNaobHa4kVQoZUsXdg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058296/IMG_8DF1D0ECCD4F_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your contact is an iOS user, they can be messaged the access key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="LmabEL"&gt;You can now choose how to share you access key (which is a very long string of numbers and letters). If you message your chosen legacy contact with the access key &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; if they accept it, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; if they have iOS 15.2, the key will be stored in their Apple settings. Otherwise, you can print out a copy for them in hard copy or as a PDF.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9r0gpE"&gt;Google Inactive Account Manager&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TMOPg2"&gt;Google’s Inactive Account Manager is one of the more complete tools for taking care of your digital legacy — even if you’re just temporarily too ill to handle things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="exTeZc"&gt;Begin by going to the &lt;a href="https://myaccount.google.com/u/2/inactive"&gt;Inactive Account Manager&lt;/a&gt; and clicking on Start. You’re going to go through three setups: when the inactive account manager will kick in, who to notify, and whether everything should be deleted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google’s Inactive Account Manager offers a variety of options for what to do with your data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cdOdnUfXRKSvNvgpNbKwH-vLNJ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058171/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_2.41.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Inactive Account Manager offers a variety of options for what to do with your data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="HDcEf0"&gt;First, you decide whether the manager should activate if your account is inactive for three, six, 12, or 18 months. You’re also asked to verify a phone number and / or one or more email accounts where you can be contacted. If you haven’t gone into the account, Google will then use the phone number or email addresses to contact you a month before your set time is up to make sure that you’re really no longer around (and haven’t simply forgotten you had that account). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can decide how long Google should wait before deciding you may no longer be around." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KmCnRs6gjS6UnAfH84h_trS2LWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058235/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_2.46.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can choose how long Google should wait before deciding you may no longer be around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="T8eU9O"&gt;The next page lets you list up to ten people who should be notified by Google that your account hasn’t been used. For each person, you can specify exactly which apps they should have access to, ranging from your calendar and contacts to your Google account and purchases. You can also simply let them have access to all your apps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can specify what data can be shared with your legacy contacts." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/87g9LZWwcbouJWBvk6yWUiYHfUI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058236/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_3.15.13_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can specify what data can be shared with your legacy contacts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6M83ad"&gt;If you want, you can add their phone number so that Google can use it to verify their identity (and, rather eerily, you can include a personal message to send them). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OqrVrT"&gt;You can also activate a Gmail message to anyone who emails you after the manager kicks in, telling them that the account is no longer active. You can have the message sent to everyone who emails you or only to people in your contact list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you want, you can arrange to send a message in reply to emails." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Le5XrUDdvkkPpitbrQ05mF98TYs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058237/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_3.37.53_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want, you can arrange to send a message in reply to emails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="jT7MjM"&gt;Lastly, you can arrange for your entire account to be deleted three months after it is declared inactive. This will also include, according to Google, any shared public data such as YouTube videos. (If you’ve named someone who will have access to your account, this will give them three months before the account is pulled to save anything they want to.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If requested, Google will delete your entire account after three months." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lLPvWnHP3N7FswAng_iyl6yRdSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058241/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_3.38.26_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If requested, Google will delete your entire account after three months.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZgPOL0"&gt;Finally, you’ll be given the chance to look over your plan and confirm that this is what you want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6GMZRa"&gt;Facebook Memorialization Settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NRpASA"&gt;Facebook calls its digital legacy feature Memorialization Settings. It’s similar to Google’s and Apple’s — it gives a chosen person access to your account after your death. The only difference is that, because Facebook is often used to memorialize people who have died, there are some extra things of which to be aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="kdWY3s"&gt;To begin with, on the Facebook site, click on the downward arrow in the upper right corner, and go to Settings &amp;amp; Privacy &amp;gt; Settings. Make sure you’re in the General section (the first category in the left hand column) and select Memorialization Settings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook lets you choose a friend to manage your account posthumously." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yPYh1ZeMBhnSPL83JlCTAIY9KQ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058172/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_3.46.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook lets you choose a friend to manage your account posthumously.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gCNkwr"&gt;The page will open up to explain that you can choose a legacy contact who will be able to manage tribute posts on your site, delete your site, accept new friends, and update your profile. The person you choose will be contacted by Facebook, so it’s probably a good idea to talk to them about it beforehand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="abtQSz"&gt;You can also choose to have your account permanently deleted via a link at the bottom of that page. If you don’t choose that, then as soon as Facebook finds out you’re no longer alive, it will “memorialize” your account. That means that the word “Remembering” will be placed on your page, your content will remain, and friends can leave messages on the timeline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PXZYza"&gt;Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yEkyHW"&gt;Twitter doesn’t provide any way to posthumously transfer your account to a family member or friend. Somebody who wants to close down the account of a deceased Twitter user will have to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/contact-twitter-about-a-deceased-family-members-account"&gt;fill out a form&lt;/a&gt; and then send in a pile of paperwork, including their own ID and a death certificate. They will not be allowed access to the account.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twitter will let a survivor delete your account assuming they have the right paperwork." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rdgO0tiShN0fogTSOkycuGwJ8A0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058247/Screen_Shot_2021_12_02_at_11.48.05_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter will let a survivor delete your account assuming they have the right paperwork.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NyOTvr"&gt;Instagram&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="19RHFA"&gt;Like Twitter, Instagram offers no way to plan ahead of time who will have access to your account or what they’ll do with it. Instead, &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/264154560391256/"&gt;the site will memorialize the account&lt;/a&gt; once it receives proof, such as a newspaper clipping or a death certificate. Family members can also request that an account be closed if they have &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/contact/1474899482730688"&gt;the proper proof&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fill out this form to turn someone’s Instagram account into a memorial." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fGNpnlsWab57F7zAXn2YVg4sfT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058250/Screen_Shot_2021_12_02_at_11.49.55_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fill out this form to turn someone’s Instagram account into a memorial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9qY3wa"&gt;As of this writing, there are no other social media sites that I know of that have any specific features for what happens when a user is no longer around. Instead, executors, family members, or others with legal standing will have to provide the paperwork needed to enable an account to be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WSaqgN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="pWKOj0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;Nvidia’s $40 billion acquisition of Arm&lt;/a&gt; just ran into another massive hurdle: the Federal Trade Commission, &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger"&gt;which announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s suing to block the merger from going through due to concerns that the combined companies would “stifle competing next-generation technologies.” The suit comes after an FTC investigation into the deal following complaints from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns"&gt;Google, Microsoft, and Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the merger was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXgnue"&gt;“The FTC is suing to block the largest semiconductor chip merger in history to prevent a chip conglomerate from stifling the innovation pipeline for next-generation technologies,” said FTC Bureau of Competition director Holly Vedova in a statement. “Tomorrow’s technologies depend on preserving today’s competitive, cutting-edge chip markets. This proposed deal would distort Arm’s incentives in chip markets and allow the combined firm to unfairly undermine Nvidia’s rivals. The FTC’s lawsuit should send a strong signal that we will act aggressively to protect our critical infrastructure markets from illegal vertical mergers that have far-reaching and damaging effects on future innovations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="l07HMq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Another major regulatory roadblock for Nvidia and Arm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I0QpzA"&gt;The FTC’s complaint notes that Nvidia already uses Arm-based products for several areas, including high-level advanced driver systems for vehicles, Arm-based CPUs for cloud computing, and DPU SmartNICs (networking products used in datacenters). The concern is that by acquiring Arm, Nvidia would gain an unfair advantage in those markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="He1tVT"&gt;Additionally, the FTC raises concerns that Nvidia would gain access to sensitive information from Arm licensees who already compete with Nvidia, in addition to de-incentivizing Arm from working on new products and designs that would conflict with Nvidia’s own interests by benefiting competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQY0nR"&gt;For its part, Nvidia has promised that it would keep Arm’s existing open licensing model, which sees the company provide semiconductor designs to a massive list of companies, including Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, Amazon, and more. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wrote at the time in a &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a3adccc9-678e-44ef-bdb5-e847ecb7de8c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; editorial&lt;/a&gt; that he could “unequivocally state that Nvidia will maintain Arm’s open licensing model. We have no intention to ‘throttle’ or ‘deny’ Arm’s supply to any customer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="w4mCsj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nvidia is acquiring Arm for $40 billion ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"},{"title":"Nvidia’s $40 billion Arm acquisition is about bringing AI down from the cloud","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435890/nvidia-arm-acquisition-40-billion-ai-cloud-edge-why"},{"title":"EU opens formal investigation into Nvidia’s Arm acquisition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22266504/nvidia-arm-deal-eu-formal-investigation-merger"},{"title":"Nvidia’s Arm acquisition undergoes more scrutiny by the UK government ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785832/nvidias-arm-acquisition-scrutiny-uk-government"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DkU8XJ"&gt;The FTC isn’t the only regulator closely examining the $40 billion deal: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22266504/nvidia-arm-deal-eu-formal-investigation-merger"&gt;the European Union opened a formal investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the deal in October, while the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785832/nvidias-arm-acquisition-scrutiny-uk-government"&gt;started a more in-depth examination&lt;/a&gt; of potential national security risks and competition concerns last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ek2fOT"&gt;Huang &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632017/nvidia-acquisition-arm-timeframe-18-months-schedule-regulatory-scrutiny"&gt;acknowledged back in August&lt;/a&gt; that the regulatory review would likely take longer than the company’s originally estimated 18-month timeframe but &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3758929d-66f0-4095-94f3-ea62b92f9480"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “[we’re] confident in the deal, we’re confident regulators should recognize the benefits of the acquisition.” The original plan was for the merger to be completed by March 2022 (although Nvidia’s deal with Softbank gives it until the end of the year to clear things with regulators). But with the FTC now suing to block the deal, it seems that Nvidia and Arm’s list of hurdles has just gotten much longer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA puts Apex Legends boss in charge of Battlefield as part of internal shakeup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Electronic Arts Inc. Event Ahead Of 2019 E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mPcLpNjP25-drNA9KO4inO-pqlQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70220752/1148645918.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I2kMz3"&gt;EA is making a big change to the management of the &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; franchise by putting Vince Zampella, the CEO of &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends-&lt;/em&gt;maker Respawn Entertainment, in charge of the series, according to &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-franchise-undergoes-major-shake-up/1100-6498521/"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt; article published Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBvkiI"&gt;Alongside Zampella’s new oversight of the franchise, EA plans to build an &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-to-build-a-connected-battlefield-universe-more-experiences-on-the-way/1100-6498518/"&gt;interconnected &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; universe&lt;/a&gt;, he told &lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt;. To help support that, EA is creating a new Seattle-based team focused on “injecting more storytelling into the &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; universe” headed up by &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; veteran Marcus Lehto, while Ripple Effect, which made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587667/battlefield-2042-portal-custom-game-modes-vehicles-weapons-maps-ea-play"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042’s &lt;/em&gt;customizable Portal mode&lt;/a&gt;, is working on a “new &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; experience in the &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; universe.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5DVbmA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The changes arrive shortly after Battlefield 2042’s rocky launch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OnVi1r"&gt;The changes arrive shortly after the November 19th worldwide launch of &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;, which has been rocky. The multiplayer-only game released with &lt;a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-2042-bugs-fixes-known-issues"&gt;some significant bugs&lt;/a&gt;, and EA has released &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-1"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-2"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-3?isLocalized=true"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to clean things up. But the &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042’s&lt;/em&gt; Steam player count has already &lt;a href="https://screenrant.com/battlefield-2042-player-count-steam-drop-70-percent/"&gt;dropped 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; since the launch, which could be a worrying signal that people are already moving on from one of EA’s biggest titles of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptoyGH"&gt;Zampella’s new role could indicate that EA wants to inject some of what’s made the free-to-play battle royale shooter &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/apex-legends-is-crushing-its-concurrent-playercount-record-on-steam/"&gt;so successful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;into the &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; franchise. While Zampella didn’t confirm to &lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; will be going free-to-play, he did say EA is “exploring every possibility.” And as both &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391634/apex-legends-mobile-beta"&gt;coming to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396717/ea-battlefield-mobile-smartphones-tablets-2022"&gt;smartphones&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps EA is considering similar strategies for expanding each series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibNbvT"&gt;As part of the shakeup, Dice’s GM, Oskar Gabrielson, is departing the company to “pursue a new endeavor outside of EA,” according to &lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt;. “I’ll be here to support the transition over the next few months before I head out on my new adventure,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ogabrielson/status/1466452724258590726"&gt;Gabrielson said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="64pF2l"&gt;If you didn’t know that tool manufacturer DeWalt made wireless headphones, don’t worry — we hadn’t either until they started catching on fire. The DeWalt-branded Jobsite Pro Wireless Earphones are being &lt;a href="https://www.efilliate.com/notices/DXMA1902091/"&gt;recalled&lt;/a&gt; by manufacturer E-filliate for safety concerns of overheating. The company said the recall affects about 301,000 units, which were were sold in stores including Home Depot and Lowes between December 2019 and July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcfoV7"&gt;The US Consumer Product Safety Commission &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2022/E-filliate-Recalls-DEWALT-Wireless-Earphones-Due-to-Burn-and-Fire-Hazards"&gt;announced the recall&lt;/a&gt; on December 1st and said there had been 61 reports of the headphones overheating, including five fire incidents and four minor burn injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOaq7s"&gt;E-filliate says customers can &lt;a href="https://www.efilliate.com/notices/DXMA1902091/CustForm.aspx"&gt;contact the company&lt;/a&gt; for a free replacement of its $60 headsets but did not mention what the replacements would be. E-filliate didn’t reply to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge &lt;/em&gt;seeking details about whether the headphones would be remanufactured with design corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yUQieP"&gt;

    <title>Google is making its first in-house smartwatch that could launch in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zSj6AWH51d9fuXAwcg0q_NOLAK0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70220489/akrales_190822_3612_0135.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not the new watch; we have not seen the new watch yet.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5qfq83"&gt;Google is finally making its own in-house smartwatch that’s set to launch in 2022, according to a person familiar with the matter and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-pixel-watch-rohan-android-smartwatch-development-fitbit-launch-2021-12"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGr9L4"&gt;While Google has made its own smartphones for years under the Pixel line (which has since extended to other accessories, like wireless headphones), the company has never designed its own smartwatch, despite the fact that Google has had a companion wearable platform for Android since 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZHV5Mj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"It’s time for the Pixel Watch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736665/google-pixel-watch-smartwatch-hardware-fitbit-wear-os"},{"title":"The Galaxy Watch 4 is still more a Samsung wearable than a Google one","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22620869/galaxy-watch-4-wear-os-3-samsung-wearable-google-smartwatch-tizen-one-ui"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="79NONM"&gt;The watch is being worked on by Google’s Pixel hardware group separately from Fitbit, which Google bought for $2.1 billion earlier this year. According to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;’s report, the new upcoming Google watch — it’s not clear whether Google will actually be calling it a “Pixel Watch” yet — will serve much the same role as the Pixel phones do for Android: an example for both consumers and hardware partners of what Google’s software is truly capable of when given the right hardware. The device is expected to cost more than a Fitbit and compete more directly with the Apple Watch, according to &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5VMxeY"&gt;The watch will have basic fitness tracking features, including step counting and a heart rate monitor, with Google also reportedly working on debuting a Fitbit integration into Wear OS (codenamed “Nightlight”) with the new watch when it launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJ6auo"&gt;Google is currently in the middle of the latest reinvention of its smartwatch platform with Wear OS 3. Unlike the earlier versions of Wear OS (or Android Wear), Wear OS 3 was developed as a partnership with Samsung, merging the Tizen platform into Google’s own. But so far, Wear OS 3 has only launched on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt;, which runs a heavily customized version of the new operating system that eschews most of Google’s services and apps for Samsung’s own. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Most of the pre-installed apps on the Galaxy Watch 4 come from Samsung." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YrznZlqdrp50UtpFcuoRBVtmXaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787996/dbohn_210816_4717_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7oXpaT"&gt;Google nearly had a “Pixel Watch” in the past, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872740/google-pixel-smartwatch-flagship-why-it-failed-wear-os"&gt;according to a 2019 report&lt;/a&gt;. The LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style, released in 2017, were originally supposed to be marketed as part of the Pixel brand, but an employee told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that Google hardware boss Rick Osterloh axed the idea because they “didn’t look like what belonged in the Pixel family.” Both devices didn’t impress us when they came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBnmGJ"&gt;The news of a Google-built smartwatch isn’t a complete surprise, however. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"&gt;Osterloh told&lt;em&gt; The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Dieter Bohn&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that an in-house Wear OS wearable was already on the horizon, noting at the time that Google’s acquisition of Fitbit was still “pretty early in the integration.” Osterloh did mention that “you’ll see them [the Fitbit team] build wearables on Wear OS in the future,” with the team already “hard at work at that,” — although it’s not clear whether Osterloh was referring to the Rohan watch or a different, future product. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="74wCWZ"&gt;Following the news that Square is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812752/square-changing-name-block-jack-dorsey-cash-app-tidal-crypto-spiral"&gt;changing its name to Block&lt;/a&gt;, people started noticing (read: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mslopatto/status/1466273784894132227"&gt;making fun of&lt;/a&gt;) the company’s new &lt;a href="https://investors.block.xyz/governance/leadership/default.aspx"&gt;leadership&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://investors.block.xyz/governance/board-of-directors/default.aspx"&gt;board of directors&lt;/a&gt; pages. While Block is still the same financial company that operates Cash App and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313108/square-inc-tidal-majority-stake-jack-dorsey-jay-z"&gt;Tidal&lt;/a&gt; and still has Jack Dorsey as its CEO, the leadership pages now feature each person’s portrait projected onto cubes. Now, Twitter user @tarngerine has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tarngerine/status/1466288061034156033?s=20"&gt;pushed this developing meme even further&lt;/a&gt; by creating &lt;a href="https://blockify-xyz.glitch.me"&gt;a tool that lets you create your own blockhead image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vQ6ny"&gt;Using Blockify Yourself is pretty simple — you select an uncomfortably close-up image of your face (or any image, I suppose, but if you’re looking for the best results...), and the site will turn it into a cube. You can also mess around with the colors used to tint each side if you want to make the nightmare look &lt;em&gt;juuuust&lt;/em&gt; right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1e3ZwzGm_tBH4lqIjYqlJ33xNxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058457/Screen_Shot_2021_12_02_at_10.06.23.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My beautiful creation, versus...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4OabrOjGB1SjPRZ-LndA3_WrL18=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058466/Screen_Shot_2021_12_02_at_10.06.40.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;... the real thing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mKYJB3"&gt;When you’re done with your cubist masterpiece, you can use the Save button to get it as a PNG. (Cubism is the one where artists just stick random images on cubes, right? I’m pretty sure that’s right.) I’m not sure there’s anything responsible you can do with that file except stare at it in despair, wondering what you’ve wrought upon the world. Oh, who am I kidding — just make it your Twitter profile picture, and change your display name to some geometry-shaped pun. People will wonder what the heck you’re doing, and you may catch a block or two, but it’ll be funny for those who get it. Or just use it to make hilarious jokes. Either way, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blocks/status/1466467520337137668"&gt;Block itself seems into it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ATcWVU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zq0sez"&gt;Oh, and PS — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Square/status/1466158911413760004?s=20"&gt;Square tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that the name Block is partially inspired by blockchains (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22617551/jack-dorsey-bitcoin-unite-country-world-peace-cryptocurrency"&gt;something Jack Dorsey is a fan of&lt;/a&gt;), as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761305/tungsten-cube-meme-nft-crypto-midwest"&gt;the tungsten cubes&lt;/a&gt; that became a fad amongst crypto fans. That’s letting me imagine that Jack has a tungsten cube with his portrait laser-engraved on it, which is a gift in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Polestar teases its upcoming electric SUV, the Polestar 3, set for release in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G856A_H0duzv31xp_yKELA_whMs=/0x359:8609x6098/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70220297/642080_20211202_Polestar_3_preview.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2uxtII"&gt;Polestar offered a glimpse of its upcoming electric SUV, the Polestar 3, which will be the Volvo performance sub-brand’s first car manufactured in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dq86OV"&gt;The SUV, which is expected to roll out in 2022, will slot into the premium category, putting it in competition with EVs like the Tesla Model X, Audi E-tron, Mercedes-Benz EQC, Rivian R1S, and Fisker Ocean. Notably, the Polestar will be assembled at Volvo’s factory in Charleston, South Carolina, giving it the distinction of being the company’s first EV made on US soil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cQq65X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We will build in America for Americans”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QDqmnZ"&gt;“We will build in America for Americans,” says Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlTAoG"&gt;In addition to be being a higher-riding vehicle than the Polestar 2 fastback sedan, the Polestar 3 will also include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248415/volvo-luminar-lidar-self-driving-highway-pilot-spa2"&gt;partially autonomous driving system for highway driving&lt;/a&gt;. That will be thanks to the inclusion of a lidar sensor from supplier Luminar, which is also providing components for hands-free highway driving to Volvo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWmqRv"&gt;Volvo has said that it will roll out Highway Pilot as part of its next big platform update, the Scalable Product Architecture (SPA2), which will arrive with the next-generation XC90 SUV and Polestar 3 in 2022. SPA2 will also underpin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917697/volvo-xc40-recharge-electric-ev-photos-hands-on"&gt;the XC40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22307699/volvo-c40-recharge-electric-vehicle-ev-specs"&gt;C40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hr9wRb"&gt;Polestar, which started out as the performance sub-brand of Volvo, has emerged as one of the more interesting EV companies on the market in recent years. The company, which is jointly owned by Volvo and Volvo’s parent company, Geely, recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696139/polestar-spac-public-value-ev-startup-volvo-geely"&gt;plans to go public&lt;/a&gt; by merging with a special acquisition company, or SPAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmnv0c"&gt;Polestar has only released two vehicles so far: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487290/polestar-volvo-hybrid-electric-revealed"&gt;the $155,000 hybrid coupe Polestar 1&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;all-electric fastback sedan Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt;. That lineup will grow with the release of the Polestar 3 SUV in 2022, the Polestar 4 compact SUV in 2023, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798880/polestar-5-precept-electric-sedan-tease-2024"&gt;the Polestar 5 (née Precept) sports sedan&lt;/a&gt; in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nymueh"&gt;We still don’t have the relevant specs for the Polestar 3, including price, battery size, range, and motor configuration. For what it’s worth, the Polestar 2 sports a 78kWh battery pack, which enables 291 miles (470 kilometers) of range. The electric motor puts off 408 horsepower, allowing for a 0–60 time in under five seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xs6mq"&gt;The vehicle was teased during a Manhattan event updating investors on Polestar’s three-year business plan.&lt;/p&gt;
