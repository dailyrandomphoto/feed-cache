    <title>Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra review: the real deal</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;More phone, less money&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="5nU2FD"&gt;Samsung’s “Ultra” phones are meant to be the absolute pinnacle of the company’s (non-folding) mobile technology. And so the Galaxy S21 Ultra — the third Ultra phone after the S20 and Note 20 Ultras — spares very few expenses. The price is lower than before, starting at $1,199.99, but the phone itself is a perfect example of what happens when Samsung goes all-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7yZKC"&gt;It’s also a perfect example of how Samsung often whiffs on its first attempt at something but presses on anyway, eventually achieving the original vision it couldn’t the first time. The original Galaxy S20 Ultra from last year promised much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155012/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-review-5g-screen-camera-space-zoom-price"&gt;more than its parts could achieve&lt;/a&gt;. The Note 20 Ultra fixed the worst bugs but didn’t improve image quality. Thus far, the “ultra” line hasn’t been especially ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcKQIL"&gt;This year, I’m hard pressed to find major faults with the Galaxy S21’s hardware. (Software, unfortunately, is another story.) The S21 Ultra is a huge phone and an expensive one, so it won’t appeal to many — but if you’re okay with those qualities, then it is also the best Android phone right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTFr8V"&gt;I guess third time’s the charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mxblBx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10294570"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Galaxy S21 Ultra, in Phantom Black" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b1pRvJgZl0Ynhub4j7_nMUn0Zt0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248961/vpavic_210119_4377_0170.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra in phantom black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PjLD7I"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KioJJN"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra is another in a long line of truly massive Samsung phones. The screen measures 6.8 inches diagonally, which is basically tablet territory. If you are keeping score — and you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that Samsung is — the S21 Ultra’s screen spec is 0.1 inches bigger than the 6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro Max. (If you account for the curved corners on the screen, the viewing area on both phones is technically smaller.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung kept the curved edges on the screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RKgjuWQSuSLSAjZE6Kg-QjO2-c0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248905/vpavic_210119_4377_0166.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung kept the curved edges on the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The metal rail blends into the camera bump" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ivfLCxn2W8CRBF9K9adeE_6i_P0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248963/vpavic_210120_4377_0171.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra vs. the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The Galaxy is narrower and easier to hold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ub7Vke"&gt;Big Android phones are common now, though, so Samsung’s job is to not only make a powerful phone but to make one that feels well-made. Mission accomplished: the S21 Ultra looks great and feels better. It’s much more comfortable to hold than the iPhone 12 Pro Max because it is a little narrow and because it has curved edges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4P3DSB"&gt;Samsung’s main design change was to blend the metal rails on the sides into the camera array on the back. It looks as good as last year’s mesa-like camera bump looked bad. I’d become a little blind to just how weird and bad most camera bumps look, and the Ultra is a reminder that they can be better designed. Though, of course, there are five big holes (four cameras, one for the laser-focusing system) which are kind of a lot to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vf1R7"&gt;There’s no getting around that this is a massive, relatively heavy phone. But Samsung also has a ton of experience making gigantic phones, and it has applied everything it has learned here. For example, contrary to the current trend, the screen is still just a little curved on the sides. I think it was the right call — it narrows the bezels on the left and right just that much more, making the phone easier to hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWC08e"&gt;As you may have heard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230934/samsung-galaxy-s21-phantom-black-phone-color"&gt;Samsung is proud&lt;/a&gt; of its new, matted “phantom black” finish on the Gorilla Victus Glass on the back of the phone. It is indeed very black and it repels fingerprints well. However, I am a little worried about its durability. We have already put a tiny scratch on ours that shows through as silver simply by setting the phone down on concrete to take a photo of it. Something to watch out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung’s One UI on the Galaxy S21 Ultra" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pX_ejb1HyyfivDvmB1skcna7Ip0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248904/vpavic_210119_4377_0157.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s One UI on the Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WyL0Dn"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra specs and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PwU1iw"&gt;Funny story: usually when Samsung introduces a new flagship phone, its reps will talk my ear off about the technology and quality of its new, big screen. This year, the company simply pointed out that it supports an adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz at its native 3200 x 1440 resolution and left it at that. If there had been a mic to hold on the video conference call, it could have been dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="gkodi8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10294644"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="voXCV1"&gt;Left unsaid because Samsung rightly knew it could be assumed: this is the best screen on a smartphone. Samsung’s default color balance choice is a little intense, but there’s a Natural option and even the ability to custom tune the Vivid option to your liking. It can reach up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness in HDR video, as well. Samsung’s “Eye Comfort” setting for turning down blue light at night is still a little ham-fisted compared to the iPhone, but that’s my only real complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxYFFS"&gt;Internally, the S21 line is the first set of mass market phones with Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 processor. Samsung says it is utilizing the extra features in this chip to improve image processing and add the variable refresh rate (which runs from 10Hz up to 120Hz) at full resolution. It also supports Wi-Fi 6E and both flavors of 5G. The chip doesn’t benchmark as well as the iPhone’s A14 Bionic, but in single core marks it beats other Android phones with the older 865 chip handily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEnRZB"&gt;More important to me is that it feels fast. I never perceived any major lag anywhere in the phone. It also might be providing some battery efficiency improvements. For my testing, I turned on every bell and whistle: max resolution, adaptive refresh rate, high brightness, always-on screen. Even when shooting a ton of photos, 4K and 8K video, and playing games, the 5,000mAh battery lasted through the next morning consistently. With less intense usage this is easily a two-day phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmX1JV"&gt;If you’re looking at this phone, you will want to step up from the default 128GB of storage. The 256GB option only costs $50 more, while 512GB (which also has 16GB of RAM instead of 12) costs $180 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5QYh7"&gt;Getting more storage on this phone is important because unlike previous S-series phones, there’s no microSD card slot on the S21 Ultra. Perhaps it was inevitable as a cost-cutting measure (along with nixing the AC adapter and MST payment tech that worked with standard credit card readers), but it’s a bummer nonetheless. A phone that encourages you to take 8K video and 108-megapixel photos needs more than 128GB of storage, at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Waqhzv"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra is also the first S-series phone to get support for Samsung’s S Pen stylus, though it’s sold separately and you’ll need to figure out a way to carry it (Samsung will happily sell you a bundle with a case). Later this year, Samsung will sell an S Pen Pro that adds in Bluetooth so you can use it as a remote for you phone if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaOBGT"&gt;I didn’t get the S Pen to test so I can’t speak to whether it’s any good, but I don’t have any reason to expect it would be too different from the stylus experience on the Note line of phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUxWWM"&gt;But of all the specs I’ve listed — both good and disappointing — the one that had the biggest tangible effect on my experience was the new in-screen fingerprint sensor from Qualcomm. It’s both bigger and faster, and it means I can just quickly tap to unlock the phone without needing to aim that carefully. Because we unlock our phones so often, even tiny changes make a huge difference in reducing a sense of friction. It finally feels on par with rear-mounted fingerprint sensors. And of course, it works when you’re wearing a mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are five cameras on the S21 Ultra, plus a laser autofocus sensor on the back" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qoWSDaQkXbibQNYSNs1u0nCpZ5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248894/vpavic_210118_4377_0068.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are five cameras on the S21 Ultra, plus a laser autofocus sensor on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qTt71x"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="aUvczA"&gt;It should come as no surprise that Samsung can make a big phone with good specs and a great screen. What is really supposed to make the Galaxy S21 Ultra “ultra” is the camera system — it’s the most important differentiator from the other Galaxy S phones and the place where Samsung wants to rack up the biggest numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXrdLm"&gt;However, racking up megapixels and zoom lenses does not guarantee either good photos or a good experience. Look no further than the original Ultra phone, last year’s Galaxy S20 Ultra. It suffered from serious focusing issues and generally didn’t justify its higher price. The Note 20 Ultra added laser autofocus, but it still didn’t do as much as it should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eOnsL"&gt;To justify its price and size, the Galaxy S21 Ultra needed to overcome years of stasis and finally bring Samsung up to par with the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGCJVH"&gt;It has. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S21 Ultra’s color is usually accurate, but sometimes a little brighter than the scene" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hRLQcWk_QOs2kA5dXrdDNe9AJY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248967/05_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_20210115_20210115_161844.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21 Ultra’s color is usually accurate but sometimes a little brighter than the scene.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ACRGWL"&gt;The camera system on the Galaxy S21 Ultra is the best I’ve used on any Android phone and is extremely competitive with the iPhone 12 Pro Max. And with telephoto shots, it usually wins outright. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Surprisingly, the S21 Ultra’s focal plane doesn’t seem as narrow as the S21, allow more of close subjects to stay in focus" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ImqZR9Bd1SiyT7ztkDMKk4_dt60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248971/01_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_20210115_20210115_150250.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surprisingly, the S21 Ultra’s focal plane doesn’t seem as narrow as the S21, allowing more of close subjects to stay in focus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YyLohX"&gt;I came into this review with a lot of skepticism. Anytime a company promises camera improvements — especially when they are promised on the back of more megapixels and more cameras — skepticism is the right attitude. On both of those fronts, Samsung is not shying away from promises. There are five image sensors, none of them throwaways: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="m4U46A"&gt;Main wide angle: 108-megapixel, OIS, f/1.8, 0.8μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6LTiHt"&gt;Ultrawide: 12-megapixel, 120-degree field of view, f/2.2, 1.4μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E20Cfr"&gt;Telephoto 1: 10-megapixel, Optical 3X, OIS, f/2.4, 1.22μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dKvA2i"&gt;Telephoto 2: 10-megapixel, Optical 10X, OIS, f/4.9, 1.22μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mFSNmO"&gt;Selfie camera: 40-megapixel,  80-degree field of view, f/2.2, 0.7 μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="k8JYGg"&gt;The fifth hole on the back of the phone is for the laser autofocus sensor, which was added to help with some of the focus issues on the main sensor. That main 108-megapixel sensor is also a second-generation sensor, capable of 12-bit color and featuring what Samsung says is a new “remosaicing” process for converting 108-megapixels into the default 12-megapixel images. (Getting 12-bit color requires diving into the settings and using Pro mode.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The San Francisco skyline, shot on S21 Ultra" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-i2k1W8B-bukc8aH95jdokoLNfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248987/20210116_20210116_144203.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Francisco skyline, shot on S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1nvMyM"&gt;I am happy to report that nearly every problem I had with the original Galaxy S20 Ultra’s camera system has been resolved. Focusing is fast and accurate, the focal plane seems bigger, there’s no discernible shutter lag, and most of all: the pictures look better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRuNy3"&gt;The main sensor also simply feels more predictable. It focuses where I tap, and parts I’d expect to get some bokeh have a nice blur. In the dark, it switches over to night mode and produces images that have significantly less noise than before (though a touch more noise than the iPhone 12 Pro Max). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qdfmu0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10294696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VDc9ce"&gt;Samsung continues to tune photos differently than I prefer. Compared to the iPhone, it aims to make things a little brighter and the colors a little more intense, while Apple seems to more confidently let shadows be shadows. However, the S21 Ultra often provides better sharpness and detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RokZzh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10294723"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BALGwk"&gt;Where the S21 Ultra really shines is on zooming. It has two telephoto lenses and I found myself believing in the utility of having both. Proper optical zoom at 3X makes a big difference, and Samsung uses data from multiple lenses up to 10X. Samsung still has its gimmicky “Space Zoom” that works up to 100X, but I couldn’t get anything usable beyond 30X and even then it required a lot of light to create something passable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gklCV5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10294711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s2rJyX"&gt;As for video, we are equally impressed. The S21 Ultra does a very good job with dynamic range and adjusting exposure on the fly as you pan the camera through a scene. Stabilization is improved, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccDt9N"&gt;Some of you might be surprised that I haven’t mentioned the Pixel 5 yet. Well, it has fallen behind. Both the S21 Ultra and the iPhone 12 Pro Max have switched to physically larger sensors and it has revealed the limits of computational photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cSoRMu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10294732"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WufM3c"&gt;As for the head-to-head with the iPhone 12 Pro Max, here’s where I have landed. If you were to take 50 photos or videos, 30 of them would be a toss-up based on your personal preference, seven or eight would be clearly better on the S21, and 12 or 13 would be better from the iPhone. They’ve very close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcGQ70"&gt;But Samsung has those telephoto options. And it also has compensated for the relative dearth of high-quality third-party Android photo apps by building in its own features. Samsung has added a “director’s mode” that lets you switch lenses on the fly while shooting video in 1080p, but I found that I preferred shooting in 4K. You can shoot in 8K and pull out a still photo, you can use “Single Take 2” to let the AI try to make a bunch of amusing photos and video effects. Samsung’s Pro modes for both photo and video are excellent. You can shoot in RAW, too, although it is a standard RAW, not an Apple-style ProRAW that has some of the benefits of HDR mixed in. (I’ll leave a full Samsung RAW vs. iPhone ProRAW competition for others.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Even in Portrait Mode, face smoothing can finally be fully disabled." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vjxf2Pc6F-HxO9kAmY_1u7Xe9kE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22249027/31_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_20210118_20210118_113001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even in Portrait Mode, face smoothing can finally be fully disabled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uYFCT9"&gt;Overall, there are just a thousand different ways you can work with this camera, and it can be a little overwhelming. But the good news is that the experience of just snapping a photo will yield better results than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWajv1"&gt;I’ve saved my favorite news for last: Samsung has finally, &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; given us the option to &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; turn off face smoothing. Behold, my wrinkles and blemishes. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;No more Hamcam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Aw49cl"&gt;Here’s how Samsung’s versions of Android work: they get way way too messy and complicated, everybody complains, and eventually Samsung simplifies things. Then the cycle starts again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLX0xk"&gt;Right now, we’re still heading toward the land of complication. Samsung’s One UI interface is still good for big screens, but there are just so many options in quick settings, many of which mean nothing to the average person. Unforgivably, there are still ads built into Samsung’s default apps. The biggest thing on the default home screen is a weather widget. Tap it and the next biggest thing you’re likely to see is the kind of ad that’s normally at the bottom of a crappy, overloaded website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7eHWoK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If the Galaxy S21 Ultra has a downfall, it’s in how Samsung’s version of Android has become messy and displays ads in some apps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CvhqQQ"&gt;Bixby, Samsung’s digital assistant, is still the default, and it’s difficult to switch away from it (you need third-party software). Surprisingly, it’s somewhat better than the last time I used it, but it’s still brittle. When I asked it to set a second alarm for 15 minutes, it consistently canceled my first alarm and set one for one second. If you set it up and set SmartThings up for your smart home and live an entirely Samsung-based life, Bixby is passable. But it’s also not necessary. The Google Assistant is still here and still better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jE6yOU"&gt;Then there’s texting. In the US, Samsung ships these phones with Samsung Messages by default, whereas everybody else in the world gets Android Messages and therefore RCS. Some US carriers support RCS on Samsung Messages, but badly. AT&amp;amp;T’s version of RCS doesn’t interoperate with other carriers yet, for example. I know Samsung isn’t to blame for RCS’s problems, but as the biggest Android seller in the US, you’d like to think the company would try to fix this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3OPDt"&gt;But if you know your way around Android, you can make the S21 Ultra a really amazing and powerful phone. Dodge or disable all those ads and install all the non-Samsung versions of software, and it’s a powerful and sometimes elegant experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8fd0L"&gt;Samsung is also better at letting customers customize its software for gigantic phone screens than Apple is. You can split-screen apps, convert apps to little pop-up floating windows, turn on a slide-over bar with access to your clipboard and calendar, and much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYtUfN"&gt;Getting to all that power requires wading through a lot of complexity, but I’ve always found it to be worth the effort. I just wish Samsung wouldn’t make it so difficult in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5oxfkCuVQEPp3NmhYJqj8Jl5nLU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248892/vpavic_210118_4377_0058.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="t2V5QP"&gt;Usually, a review of a superpowered phone from Samsung consists of a bunch of promises and then a bunch of reality checks on those promises. With the Galaxy S21 Ultra, there are fewer caveats than before. The battery lasts beyond a full day. There’s a beautiful new design. It has the fastest speeds, best camera system, and nicest screen of any Android phone right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWSJ51"&gt;If you’re wondering how the smaller Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus compare, we’ll have follow-up reviews on those — but as a spoiler, I’ll just tell you both are much more iterative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rLSVCS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The best Android phone right now, if you don’t mind the size and the price&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kfLF1x"&gt;The biggest reality check is the software, which suffers from Samsung’s heavy-handed attempts to build its own ecosystem and further monetize an already expensive phone. I doubt that the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra will convince many iPhone users to switch — the ecosystem lock-in on iOS is too strong for that and getting the most out of Samsung’s version of Android is daunting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Wif2B"&gt;If you can navigate the software, the size, and the price tag, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is the best Android phone available today. I don’t know how long it will be able to hold on to that crown, but it’s got it now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="YGWnV0"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is finally worthy of the name.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Counter-Strike pros agree to safety protocols so they can return to LAN competition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Intel Extreme Masters 2020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y4-QVHW6W7HDUyPmqRMFAhz3Hno=/0x66:3887x2657/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68699807/1204526866.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tweet-user-name"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; players could be returning to in-person competition soon thanks to a new agreement on safety protocols. The &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; Professional Players’ Association announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CSPPAgg/status/1352257719537979396"&gt;a new series of protocols&lt;/a&gt;, created in conjunction with two major tournament organizers — the ESL and DreamHack — that could see players return to LAN tournaments early this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmiMIK"&gt;“The players are eager to play LAN events again, but only if it can be done in a safe and responsible manner based on clear protocols approved by the players,” Mads Øland, CEO of the CSPPA, said in a statement. “With this protocol now in place, we move one step closer towards returning to LAN.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OCAa0C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The players are eager to play LAN events again.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bzp4NC"&gt;According to the announcement, the protocols were created in part after observing how player unions in the NBA, NFL, and elsewhere adapted to competing amid the pandemic. The announcement includes what appears to be a fairly straightforward list of rules on testing, travel, creating controlled environments, and ensuring plans are in place in case players do test positive for COVID. The CSPPA also says that these protocols will be updated “on an ongoing basis” as the situation changes and depending on the country in which the event takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwXXsh"&gt;Last year, most esports leagues — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21196237/esports-leagues-online-coronavirus-call-of-duty-overwatch-league-of-legends"&gt;including those for &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — quickly shifted from in-person events to online competitions. &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; is one of the first to outline safety protocols for a return to LAN events, in large part because few other esports have player-driven associations to look out for their best interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lR7eKk"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.eslgaming.com/article/esl-x-dh-unveiling-our-direction-and-event-calendar-2021-4392"&gt;a separate announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the ESL said that it plans to host the majority of its &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt; events in controlled studio environments without an audience present. “Our expected return to regular live events with audiences is slated for November, however the general guidance may change depending on how local and global guidelines change throughout the year,” the organization says. The first major ESL competition of the year will be IEM Katowice, which will be held online starting February 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9YDYX"&gt;Elsewhere in esports, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22228929/league-of-legends-championship-series-2021-season-esports-chris-greeley-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; competitions across the world are already underway&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226670/call-of-duty-cod-league-cdl-esports-2021-season-start-date-youtube"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; League plans to kick off next month&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230728/overwatch-league-2021-season-april-start-date-youtube-esports"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League is due to begin in April&lt;/a&gt;. Epic also recently unveiled its plans for competitive &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22239161/fortnite-esports-fncs-prize-pool-2021"&gt;including a prize pool of $20 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio’s 65-inch P-Series Quantum X 4K TV is over $400 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vizio P-Series Quantum X" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TbQTRdbsMzM9IYzUEb8f0gPyiZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68699444/vizioqled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QSKsLm"&gt;The 65-inch P-Series Quantum X from Vizio is the company’s flagship 2020 model, sitting just beneath its debut OLED in terms of picture quality. You can snag one today for $1,080 at Costco and Sam’s Club or for $1,100 from B&amp;amp;H Photo. This size usually costs $1,530, so presumably, this is Vizio’s discount for the Super Bowl on February 7th. One quick note: you don’t need a membership at Costco to get this deal, but you’ll be charged a 5 percent non-member surcharge that’ll add about $50 to the total, whereas Sam’s Club requires a membership. B&amp;amp;H Photo has no strings attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggf856"&gt;Getting into the specs, this LED panel can deliver near-OLED levels of contrast and good color and lighting accuracy. It has support for HDR10, Dolby Vision, and HLG HDR, and its 384 local dimming zones mean you likely won’t notice areas of the screen that look splotchy with light during any scene. And impressively, it can go up to 3,000 nits of brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFZPiG"&gt;The P-Series Quantum X is also compatible with AirPlay and can serve as a Chromecast. Notably, gamers should get a lot of value out of this model since it has HDMI 2.1 ports that allow for 4K resolution while pushing up to 120Hz if your console or PC can reach those heights. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224956/vizio-firmware-update-oled-p-series-quantum-x-xbox-series-x-ps5-pc-nvidia-variable-refresh-rate-4k"&gt;This model was recently updated with better support for high-end gaming gear&lt;/a&gt;, including PCs with Nvidia GPUs, the PS5, and the Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iCXGG9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295302"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="wfWd4V"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro review|75664" data-volume-uuid="0d2a0cdfb" data-volume-id="75664" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-867" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OfbhTi"&gt;If you have an 11-inch iPad Pro or the latest iPad Air (also released in 2020, with USB-C charging), you might be interested in this $100-off deal on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; that will grant your tablet its very own dedicated keyboard and trackpad. It essentially provides a laptop-like experience, in case you’re trying to get more done and don’t want to lug around too many devices. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Magic-Keyboard-for-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2nd-generation%2F984505060&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is hosting this deal&lt;/a&gt;, and as mentioned, it’s $100 off the usual price. That’s a steep, rare discount, and I’m not sure how long it will last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YAIvvZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x7inSxMBbf3QMuwJ3TfnnEcCanA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19923286/bfarsace_200424_3992_0012.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Pc4uCl"&gt;You can still get $30 off the “clearly white” Google Pixel Buds truly wireless earbuds at Antonline. Those usually cost $179, &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Google/Electronics/Audio_Electronics/Headphones+Earphones/1389562"&gt;but &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers can check out for $149&lt;/a&gt; by using the code &lt;strong&gt;VERGE30 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. This deal will last until Monday, January 25th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify is paying podcasters tens of thousands of dollars to buoy its own sponsorship tool</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xDmB6Www618mBxLN3tcCJAhx8gA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68699204/acastro_200914_1777_anchor_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Anchor promised to find sponsors for small podcasts, but Spotify is footing the bill&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GtV77X"&gt;John Newman is the type of person companies like Spotify want to get involved in podcasting. He has a niche interest — collecting sports playing cards — and is passionate and knowledgeable about the topic. When he went looking for a way to start his own show, &lt;em&gt;Sports Card Nation&lt;/em&gt;, in 2018, Anchor stood out. The podcast creation app, now owned by Spotify, makes it easy to record an episode, and it offers a novel feature for new podcasters: sponsorship opportunities for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="voS030"&gt;What Newman didn’t expect, however, was that the main advertiser using Anchor’s sponsorship feature would be Anchor itself. Newman says over the course of two and a half years on the platform, he’s had only three sponsors through Anchor: Anchor, Pocket Casts, and a company called The Black Tux. One of those companies, Pocket Casts, didn’t even pay for its sponsorship, a source close to the company confirms — instead, Anchor covered its costs to promote the feature. Newman says both the Pocket Casts and Black Tux sponsorships lasted less than a month and netted him no more than $50 total. Anchor, on the other hand, has paid him around $2,500 to advertise its own service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReDBus"&gt;“It’s just a blip compared to Anchor,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1kdpgd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s just a blip compared to Anchor.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gsq41H"&gt;Nine podcasters tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the same story: Anchor’s sponsorship feature seems to be seriously lacking in sponsors, and they’ve received few, if any, opportunities beyond Anchor or Spotify itself. Three people say they’ve earned thousands from Anchor and Spotify alone. Three also say they have now left or are looking to leave Anchor’s platform because they’re not receiving new sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZ883F"&gt;Anchor’s software is designed to let anyone start a podcast just by recording into their phone. It promised to help podcasters monetize those shows through a feature called Anchor Sponsorships, which launched &lt;a href="https://medium.com/anchor/introducing-anchor-sponsorships-the-podcast-advertising-platform-for-everyone-512870baa32b"&gt;in November 2018&lt;/a&gt; in the US, just months before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition"&gt;Spotify acquired the company&lt;/a&gt; for $140 million. The functionality is akin to something like YouTube ads — advertisers are automatically matched with podcasts that fit their target demographic, and the hosts can then do ad reads for the sponsors and make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDmleC"&gt;It’s a radical idea, especially for smaller creators. Typically, advertisers only work with shows that reach tens of thousands of listeners. With Anchor’s approach, sponsors can distribute their ad impressions across many shows, rather than focusing on one or two in a specific network. The hosts can always pass on a sponsorship opportunity, too, if they’re not interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oyq0Kk"&gt;“We’re determined to level the playing field for podcast monetization by enabling new creators to get paid and new brand dollars to enter the market,” Anchor said when it announced the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="W1t2k5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smaller podcasters say they’ve lost their Anchor sponsorship in recent months&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CoI8MC"&gt;But it now seems that the grand vision isn’t panning out, and it may in fact be costing Anchor money to keep running. Sponsorships is becoming more of a marketing avenue for Spotify to entice new creators to join its platform and to keep them there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxMg5I"&gt;Most of the podcasters &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;spoke with signed up for Anchor’s sponsorships feature last year and received Anchor itself as their first sponsor. They received $15 for every 1,000 people they reached. These podcasters say their Anchor sponsorships ended in the second half of 2020, and they weren’t offered a possible renewal date or a new sponsor to replace it. Three hosts say they only made around $50. Newman said his sponsorship briefly ended around three months ago, but he emailed with the company, and Anchor switched it back on at a different CPM, or cost per 1,000 listeners. It’s unclear why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxI7wy"&gt;Newman says he hasn’t had a sponsor other than Anchor for the past two years, even though his show has grown and now reaches anywhere from 1,500 to 3,000 people per episode. He estimates Anchor has paid him around $2,500 over his nearly two and a half years on the platform. He currently still runs his Anchor sponsorship at a $17 CPM, along with other ads he obtained on his own outside of Anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oSmPWZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Anchor is paying some podcasters thousands of dollars to advertise the app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="emnIX1"&gt;Blake Chastain, a podcaster who creates two shows including one called &lt;em&gt;Exvangelical &lt;/em&gt;about “coming to terms with the messed up subculture of evangelicalism,” says both his shows lost their Anchor sponsorships last year. His spirituality podcast reliably reaches 2,000 or more people per episode, he says, while the other is nascent. He says he and five other podcaster friends haven’t been matched with a sponsor in months, since the Anchor sponsorship ended, and they’re now looking to move over to Megaphone, a hosting company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion"&gt;recently acquired&lt;/a&gt; by Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KOz4qh"&gt;Megaphone costs money to use as a hosting provider, but in exchange, it offers an &lt;a href="https://www.megaphone.fm/megaphone-targeted-marketplace"&gt;advertiser marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, which allows companies to have their ads inserted into shows that fit their target demographic, similarly to Anchor’s offering. Hosts don’t read the ads, however. The main barrier to entry is that Megaphone only offers its services to shows or networks with 20,000-plus listeners &lt;a href="https://www.megaphone.fm/pricing"&gt;per episode&lt;/a&gt;, which is why Chastain would have to coordinate with other podcasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6D1dfF"&gt;“I feel like Spotify is well-positioned to offer things to indie podcasters, just as much as they are to develop their own in-house stuff by buying outlets like Gimlet, but it just hasn’t materialized yet,” he says. “So that’s sort of why when you’re smaller, you’re just doing stuff on your own, just sort of keep your options open. That’s why we’re exploring that [move to Megaphone].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="26D2bc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Anchor wants to spread the wealth in podcast advertising, but money is seemingly only going to top shows&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DqSmRs"&gt;Two other podcasters mentioned receiving sponsorships, in addition to Anchor’s own, including one for a sleep podcast called &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep Sounds&lt;/em&gt; and one for Spotify itself. The podcaster who received the Spotify sponsorship, Dalton Trigg, says he and his co-host made $1,700 from Anchor and $900 from Spotify while on the platform for approximately a year and a half. They’ve since left Anchor and joined the Blue Wire podcast network with their basketball show, &lt;em&gt;Mavs Step Back&lt;/em&gt;, and use Simplecast for hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIwLCy"&gt;“We made the switch because after nearly two years of having somewhat consistent ad money, we went two to three straight months at the end of last year where we had no sponsors at all,” he texted &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And the NBA offseason is our busiest time of the year for the pod, so that was frustrating for us — that it just all of a sudden cut off. Anchor support kept preaching patience and saying that they’d keep trying to pair us with new sponsors, but it got to the point where we had to make the move so we could continue to grow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSseMe"&gt;The fact that Anchor seems to be bankrolling its own sponsorship feature doesn’t bode well for Spotify, especially considering the critical role Anchor plays in the company’s growth strategy. Anchor offers its software and hosting service for free, which brings new podcasters into the field. It also beefs up Spotify’s own show catalog. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21755151/spotify-podcasts-anchor-stats-data-wrapped-2020"&gt;told&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Anchor launched 1 million new shows in 2020 alone and powers 70 percent of Spotify’s podcast catalog. Spotify has signed Anchor creators to exclusive deals, too, and a spokesperson said last month that 100,000 creators had generated revenue through Anchor’s sponsorships product to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SJdQOk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Anchor Sponsorships is only available in the US, and 100,000 podcasters have made money through it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UwMGbt"&gt;Still, the situation all these podcasters depict suggests that while Anchor is attracting creators, it might not be making much money through selling advertisements. In fact, it’s seemingly just spending it. Plus, the success some of these podcasters have had in attracting outside advertisers demonstrates that once they reach a certain audience threshold, they’re sometimes willing to leave Spotify behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0zebh"&gt;We reached out to Spotify for information about which other advertisers currently use Sponsorships, as well as how much money the company has spent on these ads, but it declined to comment on the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhdYH9"&gt;Spotify did put us in touch with the podcast &lt;em&gt;How Long Gone&lt;/em&gt;, however, which launched in March 2020 and is distributed through Anchor with most ads coming from Anchor Sponsorships. The hosts, Jason Stewart and Chris Black, say the majority of their ads market Spotify, Anchor, and Anchor-made shows. Spotify and Anchor have paid them “tens of thousands” of dollars in ad revenue in less than a year, they say. (They also host a separate, Spotify-exclusive show that highlights Anchor’s newest feature — the ability to include music in shows — called &lt;em&gt;How Long Gone Radio&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKZs5M"&gt;“It’s kind of like an interesting ecosystem,” Stewart says. “It’s like a garden that waters itself, as long as you have the good ol’ Spotify deep pockets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAxBdH"&gt;They’ve had three other sponsors over the show’s existence that came from Anchor Sponsorships, including Manscaped, Solaray, and Roman. All three, they say, ran for around a month each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LctTNm"&gt;“It’s good to just be able to have that Spotify and that Anchor as your baseline to where even if you’re making a dollar a day off of it, or whatever, at the beginning, it’s nice to just see that,” says Stewart. “It’s kind of like gambling or something like that. You look into your wallet, and you get to see every day how much more money you’re making, and then it helps you kind of track your growth and your goals, and having Spotify and Anchor there throughout the entire time was an amazing foundation to build on top of.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15vujx"&gt;Analysts at Citi &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/spotifys-big-bet-on-podcasts-is-failing-citi-says.html"&gt;sent a note&lt;/a&gt; to clients last week advising them to sell their Spotify stock, particularly because its podcasting endeavors hadn’t yet resulted in a meaningful uptick in premium subscribers or app downloads. Anchor has, so far, been a creation success story for the company. Even these podcasters, when asked, all say they don’t regret using the app and found it made podcasting approachable. Receiving money from Anchor didn’t hurt, either, and was like a cherry on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="mC2V1T"&gt;But did Spotify enter the podcasting space to subsidize creators in making new shows, or to help itself make more money? Anchor’s sponsorship situation seems to be testing that choice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These wireless gaming earbuds deliver less lag but not much more</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Almost a great gaming gadget&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="3jd5gG"&gt;The $199 GTW 270 Hybrid earbuds from audio company EPOS are, to my knowledge, the first truly wireless earbuds made for gaming — but the buds themselves aren’t the biggest selling point. The USB-C Bluetooth receiver that comes with the earbuds gets that distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPafR5"&gt;It’s much more compact than the standard flash drive-sized USB dongles included with many headsets. It’s more capable, too, operating with the aptX low latency (aptX LL) codec that delivers good-sounding audio with no perceivable lag. Using the receiver, the GTW 270 Hybrid can be especially great for fast-paced games where sound cues count for success; but really, it’s nice to have for any title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5srGRy"&gt;However, there is one problem: the microphones don’t work when you’re listening to audio via the USB-C receiver. (The earbuds’ built-in microphones do work, however, when they’re paired to a device via Bluetooth.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EPOS GTW 270 Hybrid" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ORFC4K6Lezv5xKvsviZb60aZ_6g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247792/cfaulkner_210114_4373_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the star of the show.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qbrj5B"&gt;This falls more on the technical limitations of aptX than EPOS’s decision-making. In an effort to prioritize bandwidth for sound quality and responsiveness, only the playback channel is active when you’re listening using the USB-C dongle. That’s a potential deal-breaker for some gamers who might want to be able to jump into a voice chat with friends on their consoles. But to EPOS’s credit, the latency between the dongle and the earphones &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;does seem&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;nonexistent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wzjl72"&gt;These gunmetal-colored buds have a simple, understated design so that they don’t poke out too much from your ear. They aren’t too heavy, and the fit is comfortable, thanks to swappable silicone ear tips that help to get a good seal in your ear. As for controls, they have just a single multifunction button that handles pausing and resuming music, changing tracks, as well as picking up phone calls. In other words, without the USB-C dongle, these aren’t that special. (EPOS does make a $169 version sans dongle.) For general use — such as phone calls or music — you can get more by spending less if you check out some of the options in my colleague Chris Welch’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"&gt;affordable wireless earbud buying guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pcSqcm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10294264"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7EfIqn"&gt;Outside of gaming, these earbuds can be used like any other wireless set to connect to your phone, tablet, or laptop via Bluetooth. They support Bluetooth 5.1 (with the SBC or aptX codec, depending on the device you connect to) for music, videos, games, and phone calls, and EPOS says you can pair them with up to eight devices. Pairing is done by holding down the button on the charging case. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EPOS GTW 270 Hybrid" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E-2LUh-JKNl-S0bF430gIO1vIbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247789/cfaulkner_210114_4373_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The GTW 270 Hybrid’s only button is on the left earbud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c3R2Rt"&gt;Speaking of the charging case: it has an all-metal design that’s unfortunately very easy to scratch. It charges via USB-C; with a full charge, EPOS says it can deliver up to 15 hours of extra battery life to the earphones. During the review period, the GTW 270 Hybrid earbuds made it to the five-hour mark for battery life, which matches the company’s claim. And if you’re someone who goes on the occasional sweaty jog or just doesn’t want to get caught in the rain, these are IPX5 water resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYhNVH"&gt;I’ve spent the past few weeks using the earbuds to play games alternately on my PS5, my Switch, and my work laptop several times each day. (In case you’re curious, there’s an adapter included that lets you plug the dongle into a device that has USB Type-A ports.) The GTW 270 Hybrid works like any wireless gaming headset, but the truly wireless form factor has some obvious advantages. I like that they let me move around uninhibited by wires, and using them doesn’t isolate me (or mess up my hair) as much as bulky over-ear cans. The receiver is pre-paired to the buds, and they connect almost instantly. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EPOS GTW 270 Hybrid" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/__j7V3C7h9-P_C1JzfzGzEAB-b4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247791/cfaulkner_210114_4373_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each earbud charges via contact points, and the LEDs indicate remaining battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nRmKDf"&gt;I also love the convenience of being able to use just the right earbud (the right one controls the Bluetooth transmission, so listening through the left earbud alone doesn’t work), so I can keep an ear available to listen for packages being dropped off. This, of course, is nothing new for people who already use truly wireless earbuds. It just feels new to experience this freedom with a gaming headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2bp8q"&gt;I sampled the &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; remake, 2018’s &lt;em&gt;God of War, Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt;, along with a few other games, during the review period. While they don’t have the widest soundstage or the clearest frequency separation I’ve heard for listening to music, they shine with game audio — in particular, with surround sound effects and bass delivery. The overall sound quality isn’t explosively robust, and there’s a limit to how immersive the surround sound effects can be, given the earbuds’ small drivers. But the sound isn’t too compromised. Unless you’re a hardcore gamer who needs to hear every detail in crystal-clear presentation, these will likely suit you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EPOS GTW 270 Hybrid" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8f0cSVrV14pGvIeyGcmkhA82cYI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247793/cfaulkner_210114_4373_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These work gloriously with the PS5 as well as the Switch. A USB-C to USB Type-A adapter is included to expand compatibility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PXUK2C"&gt;The GTW 270 Hybrid would be very close to ideal if the microphones worked while connected using the USB-C dongle. Alas, they don’t, so using the dongle will be next to useless for those who frequently play multiplayer games with friends. (It’s a slightly different story if you play lots of single-player games and don’t mind not having a microphone for gaming.) Since the earbuds are not all that useful for gaming without the dongle, that means you’re making a big compromise, and it’s one that none of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy#:~:text=Best%20wired%20gaming%20headset%3A%20Bose%20QC%2035%20II%20gaming%20headset&amp;amp;text=Despite%20costing%20more%20than%20an,and%20wired%203.5mm%20connectivity."&gt;best gaming headsets I’ve tested&lt;/a&gt; (most of which are cheaper than this) ask you to make. It’s your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pebble founder promises iMessage on Android and Windows with universal chat app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I1wZFTB046HpKA-ZWB_QfputIBo=/0x0:1715x1143/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698998/msedge_cx5MYIw6nR.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beeper’s website promises “a single app to chat on iMessage, WhatsApp, and 13 other networks.”&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: BeeperHQ.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vJaaDX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.beeperhq.com/"&gt;Beeper&lt;/a&gt; is a new universal chat app that’s an attempt to unify 15 different chat platforms into a single interface. The app is the work of a team that includes Eric Migicovsky, the CEO and founder of former smartwatch manufacturer Pebble, who announced its launch on Twitter. Beeper’s site notes that the project was previously known as NovaChat, and requires a $10 per month subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3OMhW"&gt;Although Beeper integrates with world’s most popular messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Slack, Twitter, Discord, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger, it’s the support for Apple’s iMessage that’s perhaps most interesting. iMessage is only officially available on Apple devices, and it’s often cited by users as something that prevents them switching to Android. Migicovsky says Beeper should allow iMessage to work on Android, Windows, and Linux, but admits that it’s “using some trickery” in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e7mXgX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And yes, iMessage works even on Android, Windows and Linux using some trickery :)&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Migicovsky (@ericmigi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1351932357201154048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glUzzv"&gt;An FAQ on Beeper’s website gives a more in-depth explanation of exactly what this trickery involves. If you’ve got an always-online Mac, then you can install the Beeper Mac app to act as a bridge, similar to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/04/02/imessages-on-android/"&gt;the approach AirMessage uses&lt;/a&gt;. But things get really wild if you don’t have access to a Mac, at which point Beeper says it’ll literally send each of its users a “Jailbroken iPhone with the Beeper app installed” in order to act as a bridge. At this point we should probably mention that using Beeper involves paying a $10 a month subscription, which may or may not include the cost of the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5nS9e"&gt;Just in case you thought Beeper was joking, in a followup tweet, Migicovsky said that he currently has 50 old iPhone 4S’s at his desk, ready to be upcycled for use with Beeper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DZqpVf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/fQ960gU7Xm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fQ960gU7Xm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Migicovsky (@ericmigi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1351936829017083906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6zcLez"&gt;If the workaround works as Beeper claims, then the result should be a universal chat app that works across MacOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android, offering a unified inbox, and the ability to search across messages from each of the 15 services. It’s built on the open source Matrix messaging protocol (Migicovsky &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/the-universal-communication-bus-42dfb9a141ad#315f:~:text=The%20only%20downside%20to%20Matrix%20is,the%20waiting%20list%20to%20use%20it."&gt;previously described&lt;/a&gt; NovaChat’s relationship to Matrix as akin to Gmail’s relationship with email), and although the client app itself isn’t open source, the bridges connecting it to other chat services are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbZT0G"&gt;Oh, and there’s a dark mode coming in Beeper’s next update, naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3taZS3X_tQWFDqp5nn7mbulfSZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22249728/6006a93e8082353374b0cd22_beeperSearch.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beeper&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beeper’s interface can include chats from multiple different services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W4JSXX"&gt;While the short-term aim is to make it easier to chat to people across different chat apps, eventually Migicovsky has talked about the prospect of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/the-universal-communication-bus-42dfb9a141ad#e362:~:text=These%20bridges%20are%20actually%20just%20an,need%20for%20bridges%20gradually%20over%20time."&gt;everyone using Matrix itself&lt;/a&gt; to chat with friends and colleagues, rather than simply using it as a bridge between services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOpjih"&gt;Although Migicovsky says he’s been using Beeper as his default chat client for the past two years, it doesn’t appear to be widely available just yet. Instead, Beeper asks prospective users to fill out a form on its website for an invitation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpXTUd"&gt;Here’s the full list of chat services that Beeper currently supports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WXWYqb"&gt;Whatsapp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Qxrw5I"&gt;Facebook Messenger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vQZ1eg"&gt;iMessage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Phn8Xh"&gt;Android Messages (SMS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Wa0ikm"&gt;Telegram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5dL2i7"&gt;Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UZnJXG"&gt;Slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XyQ9da"&gt;Hangouts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QvDOmp"&gt;Instagram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aDk10y"&gt;Skype&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NX1KQr"&gt;IRC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4GZTjq"&gt;Matrix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kKCCjk"&gt;Discord&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vIljWB"&gt;Signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KSr2xk"&gt;Beeper network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Apple’s first VR headset reportedly includes a fabric design, a fan, and expensive price tag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/--mchtKKykT_pIeLMrTf_7Q5150=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698961/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IZTva7"&gt;Apple is reportedly working on a VR headset that will include a fabric design, a fan, and an expensive price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s first VR headset may launch as soon as 2022 as a standalone device that operates through batteries, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is reportedly working on “some of its most advanced and powerful chips” for this unannounced VR headset, with some chips reportedly beating its own M1 Mac processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjaoPC"&gt;Apple has reportedly faced challenges in the development of this headset, with some prototypes ending up too big and heavy. Apple is reportedly using a fabric exterior to reduce the headset weight, but the company is also using a fan — an unusual move for Apple given its emphasis on fan-less design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tii31X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the size of Apple’s VR headset, which is codenamed N301, is similar to the Oculus Quest, and some prototypes being tested include external cameras to enable some AR features. Apple is also reportedly testing the ability to use these cameras to track hand movements, and include software features like a virtual keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tT2Mk"&gt;It’s not clear exactly when Apple’s VR headset will launch, but it could be as soon as 2022. It will reportedly be an expensive and niche device, with some at Apple rumored to be anticipating that the company may sell only one headset per day at each of its retail stores, or less than 200,000 units per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frWB0X"&gt;Apple has been working on VR and AR headsets for years, according to various reports. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; also published a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296674/apple-vr-ar-headset-glasses-external-hub-jony-ive-bloomberg-go-read-this"&gt;detailed look at Apple’s VR and AR ambitions&lt;/a&gt; last year, noting that the company has around 1,000 people working on AR and VR.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Linux has been ported to run on Apple’s M1 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: MacBook Pro 13 (late 2020)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-IpwDW3GHZj5o-3J6zhfJoB6t0o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698905/vpavic_4291_20201113_0326.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8tKNyW"&gt;A new Linux port allows Apple’s M1 Macs to run Ubuntu for the first time. Corellium, a security firm that offers a virtualized version of iOS for security testing, has successfully ported Ubuntu over to M1 Macs and released a tutorial for others to follow. The modified version of Ubuntu boots into the regular user interface and includes USB support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yav1NU"&gt;The team at Corellium have &lt;a href="https://corellium.com/blog/linux-m1"&gt;detailed exactly how&lt;/a&gt; they managed to get Ubuntu running, and it’s a good in-depth read if you’re interested in the details. While a number of M1 components are shared with Apple’s mobile chips, the non-standard chips made it challenging to create Linux drivers to get Ubuntu running properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtsFHk"&gt;Apple hasn’t designed its M1 Macs with dual-boot or Boot Camp in mind. Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302213/apple-silicon-mac-arm-windows-support-boot-camp"&gt;has previously ruled out official support&lt;/a&gt; for natively booting alternate operating systems like Windows or Linux. Virtualization seems to be Apple’s preferred method, but that hasn’t stopped people from making their own ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eFKgh1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Linux is now completely usable on the Mac mini M1. Booting from USB a full Ubuntu desktop (rpi). Network works via a USB c dongle. Update includes support for USB, I2C, DART. We will push changes to our GitHub and a tutorial later today. Thanks to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CorelliumHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CorelliumHQ&lt;/a&gt; team ❤️  &lt;a href="https://t.co/uBDbDmvJUG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uBDbDmvJUG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Wade (@cmwdotme) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cmwdotme/status/1351838924621099008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v56Gaz"&gt;Hector Martin, a developer who regularly gets Linux running on a variety of hardware, is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1333459867323957251?s=21"&gt;also porting Linux to M1 Macs&lt;/a&gt;. Developers seem to be enticed by the performance benefits offered by Apple’s M1 chips, and the ability to run Linux on a silent ARM-based machine. “I’ve been waiting for an ARM laptop that can run Linux for a &lt;em&gt;long &lt;/em&gt;time,” said Linux creator Linus Torvalds &lt;a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=196533&amp;amp;curpostid=196570"&gt;back in November&lt;/a&gt;. “The new Air would be almost perfect, except for the OS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gz7P96"&gt;Corellium CTO Chris Wade describes this new port as “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cmwdotme/status/1351838924621099008"&gt;completely usable&lt;/a&gt;” on a Mac Mini M1, and it works by booting the full Ubuntu desktop from USB. You will need a USB-C dongle to get networking working, though, and the process to get the port running will require some familiarity with Linux and custom kernels. Corellium has posted a &lt;a href="https://corellium.com/blog/linux-m1"&gt;tutorial on the process&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re interested in trying this beta project out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmANmX"&gt;Corellium has some experience in working around Apple’s operating system protections. Corellium offers security researchers a virtual iPhone to help with vulnerability exploration. It’s a process that has angered Apple enough to file lawsuits against Corellium. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22205130/apple-corellium-dismissed-copyright-dmca-fair-use"&gt;Apple lost an early challenge&lt;/a&gt; against Corellium late last year, after initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/16/20809109/apple-corellium-startup-company-lawsuit-court-virtual-iphone-software-copy"&gt;filing a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the company on copyright grounds back in August 2019. Apple later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047275/apple-corellium-dmca-lawsuit-copyright-research-jailbreak-security-copyright"&gt;alleged DMCA violations&lt;/a&gt; in January 2020, and a judge dismissed the copyright infringement claims in December. A ruling on the separate DMCA allegations has been deferred.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter locks out China’s US embassy after ‘baby-making machines’ tweet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UyByA7wbJWkCFf5PN-MTBqnQmWY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698794/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uTzSVD"&gt;Twitter has locked the official account for China’s US embassy, over a tweet it said violated its policy against dehumanization, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-20/twitter-locks-out-chinese-embassy-in-u-s-over-post-on-uighurs?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The tweet, which was originally shared on January 7th, referred to Uighur women as “baby-making machines” prior to government intervention. Twitter removed the tweet and replaced it with a notice saying it’s no longer available. However, Twitter requires account owners to manually delete tweets that violate its rules before unlocking accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7NcFA"&gt;Twitter confirmed the account’s locking in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “We have taken action on this Tweet for violating our policy against dehumanization,” and said the platform prohibits dehumanization of a group of people based on their “religion, caste, age, disability, serious disease, national origin, race, or ethnicity.” As of this writing, the last tweet from the Chinese Embassy in US account was from almost two weeks ago on January 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z6XUc3AXOSIUlZJaFi8Tx7IFrXk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22249693/msedge_mbKakxD6xa.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Twitter.com&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jan 7th tweet is no longer visible on the account, but must be manually deleted for the account to be unlocked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4xqyQJ"&gt;China has faced fierce criticism of its treatment of minority Uighur Muslims living in the Xinjiang province, with critics alleging that it is forcibly sterilizing Uighur women. The United Nations estimates that as many as 1 million Uighurs may be held in camps in the region, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. On Tuesday, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China’s treatment of the Uighurs amounts to “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/19/mike-pompeo-china-uighur-genocide-sanctions-xinjiang"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwvTss"&gt;At a briefing in Beijing, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that the embassy was “puzzled” by the account lock, and said the embassy was attempting to correct “fake reports and information related to Xinjiang.” In tweets that are still visible on its US page, the Chinese Embassy has shared reports and infographics relating to population growth and its policies in Xinjiang. The embassy joined Twitter in 2019, as part of a broader effort by China to counter criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4HrlK"&gt;Twitter has previously been criticized by former President Donald Trump and his allies who claimed the social network was unfairly targeting Republicans while allowing foreign governments to violate its policies. In May 2020, in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271207/twitter-donald-trump-fact-check-mail-in-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-california"&gt;warning labels being placed on his tweets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52846679#main-heading:~:text=Twitter%20is%20doing%20nothing%20about%20all%20of%20the%20lies%20%26%20propaganda%20being%20put%20out%20by%20China%20or%20the%20Radical%20Left%20Democrat%20Party.,Until%20then%2C%20it%20will%20be%20regulated!"&gt;Trump claimed&lt;/a&gt; the social network was “doing nothing about all of the lies &amp;amp; propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXUO4l"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52846679"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter had previously removed a tweet by Iranian Leader Supreme Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and suspended accounts associated with Cuban President Raul Castro and members of his government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uplxpd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RAwhJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Display is mass-producing 90Hz OLED screens for laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csL2IYbtyWjz_9k55HsnJzN7_38=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698695/mchin_200402_3957_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VZSazv"&gt;Samsung Display has announced plans to mass-produce the world’s first 90Hz OLED screens designed for laptops and says that “several global IT companies” are expected to release models with the new panels this year. Manufacturing will begin in March in “very large quantities,” the company says in a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210120005673/en/Samsung-Display-to-Introduce-First-90Hz-OLED-Laptop-Display/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-Q-tiwWZwkcswR1UZtV7eGe24xL9TZOyQUMS3J72mJlQ7fxFuNFTHSunhvli30RlBNXya2izy9YOgHlBiZQk2LOzmn6JePCpHPCiYGaEx4DL1Rq8pNwkf3AarimpDzQGuQ=="&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; attributed to CEO Choi Joo-sun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwwynE"&gt;The panels are 14-inch in size, though Samsung Display hasn’t given details on specs like aspect ratio or resolution; it’s possible that there will be multiple versions available. Samsung does cite the faster response time of its OLED panels, claiming “practically” the same amount of blurring as a 120Hz LCD when displaying fast-moving content. No potential laptop OEM partners were named in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9WOr5"&gt;OLED displays aren’t unheard of in laptops, but they’re not at all commonplace. While quite a few gaming laptops offer them as an option, the tradeoff there is that you’ve had to give up on high refresh rates. And despite Samsung itself launching an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;OLED-equipped Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; last year, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;2021 followup&lt;/a&gt; uses a cheaper QLED-branded LCD display instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="il4SQ9"&gt;Samsung is the world’s biggest vendor of OLED display panels, so the announcement today suggests that OLED laptops are likely to become much more of a common sight this year. &lt;/p&gt;
