    <title>Go read this story about Amazon workers fighting the company’s robotic HR response to COVID</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MHLsd1"&gt;NBC News has published &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/ailing-amazon-workers-struggle-find-covid-tests-rcna11942"&gt;a great report&lt;/a&gt; on the struggles Amazon employees face trying to get tested for COVID after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22584386/amazon-end-onsite-covid-19-testing-us-warehouses"&gt;stopped onsite testing last summer&lt;/a&gt;, and the HR quagmire they could end up in when reporting their results or dealing with illness-related PTO. The story is well worth a read, as it delves into Amazon’s policies and systems, and gives a voice to the employees they affect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChnNLI"&gt;The author of the report spoke to workers who faced breakthrough cases and unexpected costs as they tried to get tested for COVID, struggling with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632378/pandemic-ransomware-health-risks"&gt;overburdened&lt;/a&gt; and difficult-to-navigate healthcare system. “I really wish they would bring free COVID testing back to us,” says one employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8sy6rk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One employee says Amazon’s systems “take the human out of human resources”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aTbwDm"&gt;The story also shows the problems they could face if they test positive, or start developing symptoms. Amazon’s workers are supposed to get 40 hours of paid leave after a positive test or exposure, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/7/22872866/amazon-coronavirus-changed-pto-policy-cdc-guidance-update"&gt;an updated Amazon policy&lt;/a&gt;. But many of those that spoke to NBC reported that they ran into difficulties or errors trying to get time off. One worker said that the company’s “self-service kind of H.R. system” seemed designed to “to kind of take the human out of human resources.” That system has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745029/amazon-warehouse-hr-new-york-times"&gt;faced criticism in the past&lt;/a&gt; for everything from underpaying employees to mistakenly firing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTdYMh"&gt;But if the system is robotic, it seems to have broken down — workers told NBC News that they found it nearly impossible to get help if they test positive, and talked about systems improperly marking them as having use paid time off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECsC67"&gt;Trying to contact an actual human isn’t much better. One employee quoted in the report talked about how the company’s phone lines were swamped: “I could not reach a live person no matter how hard I tried.” She ended up speaking to someone in person about how she needed to get tested after finding out one of her close co-workers had COVID. A contractor that works at Amazon’s COVID-19 hotline told NBC News there were 1,700 calls on hold at one point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzuxZJ"&gt;The company told NBC that it was looking into reports of the time-off issues, and that it offers incentives and events to help employees get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imMaWp"&gt;If you’re interested in the saga of how Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465357/amazon-industrial-athlete-warehouse-worker-wellness-pamphlet"&gt;manages the health of its massive workforce&lt;/a&gt;, the report is &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/ailing-amazon-workers-struggle-find-covid-tests-rcna11942"&gt;absolutely worth a read&lt;/a&gt;. It provides some great insight into the results of Amazon’s workplace protection policies, which have sparked employee protests and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22810754/amazon-new-york-ag-reinstate-fired-worker-health-safety-covid"&gt;legal pressure&lt;/a&gt; in some cases. Even if you’re not interested in Amazon specifically, you’ll probably get something out of reading the words of the employees having to deal with these systems while also making sure Amazon’s packages keep moving.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>School employee stole 3,000 Apple iPods earmarked for Native American kids</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPod stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cx0wmx8o8BXuRQ0XGC74E1FXdeE=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70385965/IMG_6762.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BaYfWr"&gt;She ran a program that used iPods to teach reading and math to underprivileged Native American schoolkids living on tribal land. Now, 46-year-old Kristy Stock of New Mexico is getting 18 months in prison for stealing 3,000 of them, which she resold for a personal gain of over $800,000 between 2013 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Td7egN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/former-new-mexico-school-district-employee-sentenced-18-months-federal-prison-stealing"&gt;That’s according&lt;/a&gt; to the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland (via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/woman-sentenced-to-prison-for-stealing-over-3000-ipods-intended-for-native-american-students-194009681.html?src=rss"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and Stock isn’t the first who’s been sentenced as part of this scheme — it all seems to center around around 36-year-old Colorado resident Saurabh Chawla, who bought up stolen electronics and other goods and resold them on eBay and Amazon. Law enforcement raided him in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/former-eastern-shore-resident-sentenced-more-five-years-federal-prison-conspiring-sell"&gt;according to an earlier press release&lt;/a&gt;, and he bought stolen iPads from another New Mexico school district as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIMM60"&gt;Perhaps even more significantly, Chawla worked with a FedEx distribution center manager from Delaware named Joseph Kukta to steal packages before they made it to customers like Walmart, with Chawla paying him $1.5 million according to court documents. Those thefts included shipments of Nike sneakers and devices from Apple, Epson, Kenwood, and Magellan, among other merchandise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZ7s0N"&gt;“Kukta selected specific packages which he believed, based on the shippers of the packages, contained high-end electronics or other merchandise of value that could be easily resold,” reads a portion of &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/delaware-facility-supervisor-sentenced-more-three-years-federal-prison-tax-evasion-and"&gt;yet another press release&lt;/a&gt;, which continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5iVz8w"&gt;In 2018, Kukta began to also steal packages from FedEx trailers that were loaded for delivery to a retail Store in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5eT1cM"&gt;Kukta went to the FedEx facility on Sundays, holidays, or other times when employees were not at the facility, and removed the packages he previously identified from the FedEx trailers. Kukta attempted to avoid detection by turning off the lights at the facility and blocking certain surveillance cameras with cardboard boxes and other objects. Kukta loaded the stolen packages into his truck or into vehicles operated by FedEx contractors and parked at the facility, then drove the vehicles to his rented storage unit in Seaford, where he unloaded and stored the items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="V9HP0w"&gt;It’s not clear if Stock, the school district employee, took iPods away from Native American schoolkids who needed them, or simply ones that went unused. One court document states that the iPods were purchased in bulk with federal grant money, and the school district stored unused ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1955x"&gt;In November 2018, Stock allegedly told Chawla that she would check “the school’s iPod inventory and let you know what I can get headed your way” for “Black Friday,” but was apparently only able to steal 30 that time, saying that she had “to keep some on hand through year end for the students.” I suppose that’s nice of her?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RGHx5f"&gt;Chawla was sentenced to 66 months in prison; Kukta got 42 months; James Bender of Maryland, who let Chawla use his eBay and PayPal accounts to sell the stolen goods, was sentenced to a year and a day. Chawla also agreed to forfeit at least $3.5 million worth of assets, with the court seizing seven bank accounts, a 2013 Tesla Model S, and forcing him to sell &lt;a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/25835-E-Dry-Creek-Pl-Aurora-CO-80016/87622999_zpid/"&gt;a two-story, five-bedroom home in Aurora, Colorado&lt;/a&gt; that he purchased with fraud money. Kukta will pay $1.1 million and forfeit an additional $1.88 million in assets, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/delaware-facility-supervisor-sentenced-more-three-years-federal-prison-tax-evasion-and"&gt;according to the DA’s office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oktVmL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96QZy5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Orbit launches first satellite mission after SPAC merger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rp1PM_CUIxFOiXuj8IasSTUJHAI=/179x0:2030x1234/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70385949/Virgin_Orbit_88.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virgin Orbit’s Cosmic Girl and LauncherOne just after rocket separation on a previous flight&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Virgin Orbit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vsuzvK"&gt;This afternoon, small satellite launcher Virgin Orbit successfully lofted seven tiny satellites into orbit around Earth, marking the third successful mission for the Virgin Galactic spinoff company. The payloads consisted of &lt;a href="https://virginorbit.com/above-the-clouds/"&gt;various research satellites&lt;/a&gt; for the Department of Defense, along with three small satellites from companies SatRevolution and Spire Global.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQU1fJ"&gt;The launch comes less than a week after Virgin Orbit’s stock began publicly trading for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637711/richard-branson-virgin-orbit-public-spac-satellite-launch"&gt;Virgin Orbit announced in August its plan to go public&lt;/a&gt; through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, making it one of three small rocket launch companies to follow the trend in 2021. On Friday, January 7th, Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart rang the Nasdaq opening bell, while the company put a model of its primary rocket, LauncherOne, on display in New York City’s Times Square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J3fmbE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;less than a week after Virgin Orbit’s stock began publicly trading for the first time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ON7DJ2"&gt;Virgin Orbit is one of many rocket companies that have cropped up in the last few decades, aimed at specifically launching small- to medium-sized satellites into orbit. However, the company’s approach to getting these satellites into space is a bit unique compared to its competitors. Instead of launching vertically from the ground, Virgin Orbit’s LauncherOne rocket is designed to take off from underneath the wing of a carrier aircraft, a refurbished Boeing 747 called Cosmic Girl. The plane is meant to take LauncherOne up to an altitude of approximately 35,000 feet, where the rocket is then released. In mid-air, LauncherOne ignites its main engine and propels its payloads the rest of the way into Earth’s orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfHGCZ"&gt;Today’s flight, called “Above the Clouds,” began at 4:39PM ET, when Cosmic Girl took off from a runway at the Mojave Air and Space Port in California, where Virgin Orbit has a testing facility. The plane flew out west over the Pacific Ocean, where LauncherOne was released at 5:52PM ET. Flying the plane for this mission was Virgin Orbit’s pilot, Eric Bippert. He was accompanied in the cockpit by Matthew Stannard, or Stanny, a test pilot for the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom who has been seconded to Virgin Orbit. Stanny was &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59972909"&gt;the one to initiate LauncherOne’s release&lt;/a&gt; from underneath Cosmic Girl’s wing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4phaI"&gt;Virgin Orbit’s launch occurred on the same day as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1481699225675067395?s=20"&gt;SpaceX’s second launch of the year&lt;/a&gt;, which also sent a crop of small satellites into orbit on the company’s Falcon 9 rocket out of Cape Canaveral, Florida. SpaceX’s launch, called Transporter-3, hoisted a whopping 105 small satellites into orbit, deploying them one by one into space. Such a flight is often referred to as a rocket rideshare, and it’s another option for small satellite manufacturers to get their payloads into space. Since SpaceX’s Falcon 9 has a bigger capacity than a smaller rocket like LauncherOne, it can carry a bunch of small satellites at once into space, a bit like a cosmic carpool. SpaceX aims to launch at least three dedicated rocket rideshares a year through its Smallsat Rideshare Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="JBOPgj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Today’s flight was called “Above the Clouds”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h1yZWy"&gt;Rocket rideshares have their downsides, though. For one thing, small satellite manufacturers often need to wait until enough satellites are packed onto one rocket in order to launch. There are also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18277344/space-situational-awareness-air-force-tracking-sso-a-spaceflight-cubesats"&gt;some logistical issues that can come with launching so many satellites at once&lt;/a&gt;. Dedicated small launch providers like Virgin Orbit can tailor their missions to just a few customers and can, in theory, provide a quicker route to the launchpad. In fact, Virgin Orbit claims that Spire’s satellite was added relatively last minute to today’s flight. “In just under two weeks, we got them on board,” Tony Gingiss, Virgin Orbit’s COO, said during a press conference ahead of the launch. “Within 24 hours of signing the contract, we already had them integrated into the fairing” — the nosecone on top of the rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DykOGc"&gt;Of course, Virgin Orbit will need to up its launch cadence in order to offer a rapid path to space for customers. So far, the company is averaging about six months between launches. But Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart says the company is targeting six launches this year, which would double the launch cadence. Two of those launches are supposed to take place out of Spaceport Cornwall in the UK, established at the Cornwall Airport Newquay. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Paramount Plus cancels 60 Minutes Plus streaming series after one season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration, Paramount+ (Paramount Plus) logo..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KAi9IRG7GILwAT-ySI78F1IYaDo=/0x0:3888x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70385782/1233727583.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rgNPY2"&gt;ViacomCBS has canceled &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes Plus&lt;/em&gt; at its tentpole streaming service Paramount Plus, axing a title that was touted as one of the service’s premium exclusives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdzOfS"&gt;The company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it will no longer produce &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes Plus&lt;/em&gt;, a spinoff of its award-winning broadcast news magazine &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;. The series had only streamed one, 30-episode season as of the cancellation announcement, which was shared with staffers Thursday morning, &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/60-minutes-streaming-spinoff-canceled-paramount-plus-1235153381/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt;, citing sources familiar with the situation. In a statement, the company said that the content the series produced will remain on Paramount Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P68h8q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The excellent work that has been done by the 60+ team will continue to be on Paramount+.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ymxMWq"&gt;“We are proud of the team at 60 Minutes+ and of the stories they produced, which informed the audience about some of the most important issues of our time,” the company said in a statement shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Their journalism was recognized with several awards, including a Gracie, National Headliner and NABJ Salute to Excellence Award. The excellent work that has been done by the 60+ team will continue to be on Paramount+.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6cwgq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; reported that news — a key component of the Paramount Plus content pitch — will remain core to the service’s programming lineup. The company is reportedly planning to help &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes Plus&lt;/em&gt; employees find other roles within the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oh4G0r"&gt;The series kicked off in March of last year with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300993/paramount-plus-streaming-wars-netflix-disney-launch-date-price"&gt;rebrand of Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; from its CBS All Access streaming predecessor. The series tackled topics as wide-ranging as the Capitol riot and the metaverse, and episodes ran anywhere from 15 minutes to over 20 minutes. The series was hosted by correspondents Seth Doane, Wesley Lowery, Enrique Acevedo, and Laurie Segall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djtZDN"&gt;Currently, &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; is available pretty much everywhere — including through podcasts, YouTube, Facebook, and its website — and its webcast 60MinutesOvertime.com gives viewers access to behind-the-scenes video and archival programming. The company did not share comments on its decision to kill the program’s standalone streaming sibling, &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes Plus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve says the Steam Deck is on track to ship by the end of February</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ETpTiJuB49MY5PTDMHd-z1S9s2w=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70385660/steam_deck_hades.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EKtGPY"&gt;In November, Valve gave everyone some bad news, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;revealing a two-month delay for the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s starting off 2022 on a better note. &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675180/announcements/detail/3122683923029138793"&gt;In its latest update&lt;/a&gt;, the company says it “looks like” Steam Deck shipments will start by the end of February. Of course, we’re in a pandemic, and things can always change, but the preorder windows for &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers are holding steady with their original projections — you can check your status &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="K30FOB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Happy January! We have a small update for you today -  tl;dr - we're still on track to ship in February.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check it out here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/pQXC101JCV"&gt;https://t.co/pQXC101JCV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steam Deck (@OnDeck) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1481754241182044160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JlAaW4"&gt;Just as important as the hardware, however, is the games that you’ll try to play on the thing. Valve apparently shipped out “hundreds” of Steam Deck units to developers last month so that they can make sure their PC games are fully compatible with its software environment and AMD-powered hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Ed9Gy"&gt;Testing is required to get a green&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733408/steam-deck-compatibility-verified-pc-gaming-valve"&gt; “verified” checkmark in Steam&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ve already seen posts on social media showing the makers of the most popular titles trying their games out on the Steam Deck. The only thing we still don’t have, oddly, is a price for or picture of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22779252/steam-deck-things-we-learned-from-valve-developer-summit"&gt;Steam Deck dock&lt;/a&gt; that’s supposed to help you put those games on the big screen. Hopefully, we’ll get a look at that, and some time with Valve’s latest hardware project, in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Congress subpoenas Meta, Alphabet, Twitter, and Reddit over January 6th Capitol attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Trump Supporters Hold “Stop The Steal” Rally In DC Amid Ratification Of Presidential Election" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4U3Bc0r4dqgPNJTVDOVrwIY0RnE=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70385640/1230728339.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4SEYE3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://january6th.house.gov/news/press-releases/select-committee-subpoenas-social-media-companies-records-related-january-6th"&gt;Congress has sent subpoenas&lt;/a&gt; demanding information from Meta (formerly Facebook), Twitter, Reddit, and Alphabet concerning the January 6th, 2021 attack on the US Capitol. The House of Representatives Select Committee that’s investigating the attack wants each company to disclose moderation policy details and other information that could illuminate how participants organized their efforts or spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKePt2"&gt;The committee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652392/google-facebook-microsoft-january-6-data-request"&gt;requested records&lt;/a&gt; from dozens of companies on a voluntary basis last year, but it says the response from the aforementioned four has been “inadequate” so far. “Two key questions for the Select Committee are how the spread of misinformation and violent extremism contributed to the violent attack on our democracy, and what steps — if any — social media companies took to prevent their platforms from being breeding grounds for radicalizing people to violence. It’s disappointing that after months of engagement, we still do not have the documents and information necessary to answer those basic questions,” said committee chairman Bennie Thompson (D-MS) in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vZ5mM5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“After months of engagement, we still do not have the documents and information necessary”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SfpRUJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/2022-1-13.BGT%20Letter%20to%20Alphabet%20-%20Cover%20Letter%20and%20Schedule_Redacted.pdf"&gt;Alphabet’s subpoena letter&lt;/a&gt; asks for information about YouTube, which hosted livestreams of the attack but also suspended former President Donald Trump for inciting violence during it. It claims Alphabet has “significant undisclosed information” concerning how it developed and reviewed its moderation and demonetization rules, as well as details about how it developed policies around false election claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUlHvr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/2022-1-13.BGT%20Letter%20to%20Twitter%20-%20Cover%20Letter%20and%20Schedule_Redacted.pdf"&gt;Twitter’s letter&lt;/a&gt; says the company hasn’t released details of warnings it received about extremists organizing on its platform or “internal company analyses of misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation” relating to the election. It’s also supposed to deliver more information about its decision to suspend Trump’s account on January 8th. Twitter declined to comment on the subpoena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QURmYX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/2022-1-13.BGT%20Letter%20to%20Zuckerberg%20re%20Meta%20Document%20Production%20-%20Cover%20Letter%20and%20Schedule_Redacted.pdf"&gt;Meta is supposed to&lt;/a&gt; produce documents about its decision to disband a team that dealt with election misinformation as well as “critical internal and external analyses conducted by the company regarding misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation relating to the 2020 election, efforts to challenge or overturn the election, and the use of Meta by domestic violent extremists to affect the 2020 election.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmX6Oi"&gt;Reddit, which has by far the smallest of the platforms involved, &lt;a href="https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/2022-1-13.BGT%20Letter%20to%20Reddit%20-%20Cover%20Letter%20and%20Schedule_Redacted.pdf"&gt;has been asked&lt;/a&gt; to commit to a “thorough review of its records” that could reveal details about whether it played a role in the attack. “We received the subpoena and will continue to work with the committee on their requests,” Reddit said in a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by Sandra Chu.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FCC proposes new data breach rules for phone companies </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bXnEr5kcWkacDye7YHqmHrSEAS0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70385426/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Jb3dz"&gt;Phone companies could have to follow new rules about how they notify customers and the government following a data breach if a proposal from the Federal Communication Commission’s chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel passes. The &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/chair-rosenworcel-circulates-new-data-breach-reporting-requirements"&gt;notice of proposed rulemaking&lt;/a&gt;, released on Wednesday, cites the “increasing frequency and severity of security breaches involving customer information” as a risk to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cC9s2f"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/64.2011"&gt;The current rules&lt;/a&gt; give telecommunication providers seven business days to notify the FBI and Secret Service of data breaches that leak customer proprietary network information, or CPNI. In most cases, the company cannot notify customers about the breach until seven business days after information has been relayed to federal law enforcement. The proposal suggests doing away with that mandatory waiting period and adds the FCC to the list of agencies that companies will have to notify in the case of a data breach. It also says that they would have to send out notifications even in the case of inadvertent breaches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RmtJqp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;News of a breach currently has to go to law enforcement before it can be sent to consumers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7ExrEv"&gt;CPNI is “some of the most sensitive personal information that carriers and providers have about their customers,” &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/customer-privacy"&gt;according to the FCC&lt;/a&gt;. It can include data like who a customer made calls to and when and where those calls were made. It can also include customers’ billing account name, phone and account number, and info about their plan. The proposed update would “better align the Commission’s rules” with the ones that have recently been put in place for other industries by federal and state governments, according to the notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8Fphs"&gt;This proposal isn’t being made in a vacuum. In late December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22857619/t-mobile-cyberattack-data-breach-december-2021-cpni-sim-swap"&gt;news broke&lt;/a&gt; that a data breach had exposed some T-Mobile customers’ CPNI. The carrier had also suffered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22646439/t-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg"&gt;much larger cybersecurity incident&lt;/a&gt; earlier in 2021, which affected over 50 million people and was already the carrier’s fifth breach in four years. While T-Mobile says it informed affected customers after the December breach, the FCC’s proposed rules would’ve placed stricter requirements on how and when those notifications went out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lysvz5"&gt;It may be a while before we see these requirements actually apply to phone companies — the FCC is currently in a political deadlock, with two Democrat members (including Rosenworcel) and two Republican members. The White House has nominated Gigi Sohn to fill the commission’s fifth seat, which would tip the scales, but there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22876628/fcc-biden-ftc-gigi-sohn-alvaro-bedoya-rosenworcel-net-neutrality"&gt;currently a stalemate with the Senate&lt;/a&gt; on actually getting her confirmed. Even if the Senate manages to confirm Sohn despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787261/biden-fcc-net-neutrality-jessica-rosenworcel-gigi-sohn-broadband"&gt;some Republican senators’ vows to block her nomination&lt;/a&gt;, the proposal is just the beginning of the rule-changing process.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Second Life joins the metaverse discussion with the return of its founder — and some key patents</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="POUR ILLUSTRER LE PAPIER : “ENTRETIENS D" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_gTqvK5kaKs90AHrc1ANCF8RJsI=/12x0:3500x2325/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70385420/103009616.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A recruiter works on a computer, 19 June 2007 at the cyber cafe “Le Milk” in Paris, during the Neo Job-Meeting (NJM) event, the first virtual job fair on the 3-D “Second Life” on-line game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt; | Photo credit should read STEPHANE DE SAKUTIN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9jd8Zv"&gt;Throughout months of metaverse hype, with all the new names and virtual real estate speculation, I can’t count how many times I’ve thought, “Didn’t &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; already do that?” Apparently, the people behind &lt;em&gt;Second Life &lt;/em&gt;agree and are trying to pull our attention back to their virtual world that (rather helpfully) exists somewhere you can visit on your existing computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="YV74BM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;BIG NEWS!   &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HighFidelityXR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@HighFidelityXR&lt;/a&gt; Invests in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SecondLife?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SecondLife&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/philiprosedale?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@philiprosedale&lt;/a&gt; Returns as an Advisor, Along with Key &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Metaverse?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Metaverse&lt;/a&gt; Assets to Help Fuel Growth. Read the full announcement   &lt;a href="https://t.co/WqPS4V9WPv"&gt;https://t.co/WqPS4V9WPv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— High Fidelity (@HighFidelityXR) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HighFidelityXR/status/1481629589356961799?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YcQeB0"&gt;A strengthened “commitment to growing an innovative, inclusive, and diverse metaverse” includes &lt;em&gt;Second Life &lt;/em&gt;founder Philip Rosedale rejoining the project as a strategic adviser. After launching &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt;, he’s been involved in a number of other efforts, popping up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/1/2529670/coffee-power-launch"&gt;a virtual marketplace&lt;/a&gt; for people to sell their skills and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/22/5536914/second-life-creator-wants-to-look-inside-your-brain-with-oculus-rift"&gt;a neuroscience collaboration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tAd2bs"&gt;However, his VR project High Fidelity, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/19/5732386/high-fidelity-philip-rosendale-telepresence-second-life-hands-on"&gt;a telepresence-focused experiment&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/high-fidelity-shifts-focus-towards-non-vr-due-slow-growth/"&gt;took a step back from developing its tech for head-mounted displays&lt;/a&gt;, will invest in &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; owner Linden Research with cash and “distributed computing patents.” Speaking to &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/second-life-founder-returns-to-revamp-his-original-metaverse/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Rosedale said High Fidelity is shifting seven people to work on Second Life. The deal also includes patents, like two covering community moderation in decentralized environments. As we’ve seen with companies like TiVo and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/28/16058868/apple-nokia-patent-dispute-settlement-2-billion-dollars"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt;, an early presence in a space could include ownership over technology that becomes much more valuable later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jMCAIA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"TiVo receives $215 million patent settlement from AT&amp;amp;amp;T ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2012/1/3/2680505/tivo-receives-215-million-patent-settlement-from-at-t"},{"title":"TiVo to merge with Xperi to create ‘one of the largest licensing companies in the world’ ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21029945/tivo-xperi-merger-dvr-rovi-deal-patent-licensing"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LQ8mad"&gt;Linden Research launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/18/13501492/linden-lab-project-sansar-vr-second-life-hands-on"&gt;Sansar&lt;/a&gt;, a VR successor to Second Life, a few years ago but sold the project in 2020 to focus on its main title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZkplx"&gt;An executive with Linden said to the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/second-life-founder-returns-to-take-on-the-metaverse-11642080602"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that upgrades for &lt;em&gt;Second Life &lt;/em&gt;would focus on tweaking the social and economic aspects of the game to try and drive user growth. However, they also noted that Second Life already allows withdrawing money from in-game sales to their real-world accounts and thinks it can win over younger users with better avatars and a lack of the kind of ad tracking platform we associate with Meta / Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaSZ49"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; launched in 2003, and Rosedale admitted to its technological limitations, like its inability to have more than 100 or so people in one space, but tells &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; that its current state could serve as an advantage over what VR-first “metaverse” projects are trying to build. Besides skepticism of NFTs and pie-in-the-sky ideas about interoperable platforms, he suggests that making &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; usable via phone or using your webcam to animate your avatar’s facial animation would help it grow more than anything that requires users to wear a virtual reality headset. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What works (and doesn’t) in an NFT-backed newsletter</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QPyZc1"&gt;Funding a media outlet is a tricky business, and in recent years, some journalists have looked toward the cryptocurrency world to do it. That includes &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt;, an entertainment newsletter co-founded by Kyle Chayka and Daisy Alioto in late 2020. &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/10/think-of-it-as-a-kickstarter-tote-bag-but-much-much-better-dirt-an-entertainment-newsletter-is-funding-itself-with-nfts-not-subscriptions/"&gt;raised money since launch&lt;/a&gt; by selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-introducing-dirtdao"&gt;it announced&lt;/a&gt; plans to work those NFTs into a decentralized autonomous organization or DAO — giving its audience input into where &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; spends its money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJR3iq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the first blockchain-based media outfit. In 2017, for instance, a project called Civil funded a panoply of websites using its own cryptocurrency token. But &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/02/media-startup-civil-shuts-down-team-absorbed-into-decentralized-id-efforts-at-consensys/"&gt;Civil collapsed&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/how-civil-didnt-37037075"&gt;a difficult launch&lt;/a&gt; and initial funding that quickly ran dry. Meanwhile, lots of cryptocurrency enthusiasts have created DAOs where token owners can vote like shareholders in a business, but many are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution"&gt;chaotic experiments like ConstitutionDAO&lt;/a&gt;, an attempt to buy a copy of the US Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1N5CM"&gt;Kyle Chayka readily describes DirtDAO as an experiment, but it’s got a comparatively modest goal: letting a small community vote on pitches for future &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; longform stories. On January 14th, it will conduct its first vote with people who previously bought one of its NFTs, which are minted on the Ethereum blockchain. (Ethereum is a common choice for NFT creators, but it’s currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;more environmentally damaging&lt;/a&gt; than some alternatives.) In advance of the sale, I spoke with Chayka about the promise — and the limits — of using DAOs for journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tTIcY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interview has been condensed and edited for clarity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4T7Sf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The announcement describes DirtDAO letting token holders vote on stories and shape the editorial process. I’m curious what the extent of that is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4P7Tw"&gt;How we’re dealing with the token voting is that Daisy [Alioto] is working with writers who we’ve already worked with, who we’ve already published in &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; and who we’re familiar with. And then she’s coming up with a slate of stories that we know that we would be happy to run. I’m not sure how many we’re doing right now, but maybe like five or six options. And then the token holders will be able to vote doing ranked choice on those options. So in the end, they’re all stories that we would be happy to run and writers we would be happy to work with. The input is, what do the token holders wants to prioritize? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrOx0v"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the obvious question for me is, why not run a crowdfunded, non-crypto system that lets backers vote on coverage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fH5E4"&gt;To me, the biggest benefit of blockchain stuff here is the record-keeping. So essentially, by creating a token, we have a really easy way of looking at who has supported us, like who has participated in funding &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt;, essentially. And then that record also means that the token holders can express their interest by voting really easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yra7GH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you theoretically don’t know who owns the tokens, how do you prevent some company from buying up all your tokens and using that to influence your editorial process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFq2Ph"&gt;We’re doing this experiment in order to figure out those questions. But at this point, &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; is small enough and the token holders are small enough that we essentially know who everyone is, at least by their wallet, even if they’re anonymous. I think the point is here that it’s small-scale enough that we do want to know who our token holders are at this point, and we do want to make sure that they’re committed and are acting in a moral way. So in that way, it’s not trustless — but I don’t think our experiment here is about reaching a huge scale or claiming that blockchain can do everything or run an entire company. It’s just a way for readers to express what they want for our publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFDcoU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you say you know people, does that mean you know their literal identities or know them as something like consistent user handles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78I5Qz"&gt;I’d say probably 60 or 70 percent of the people who are actually participating, we know them by name and we know their internet presences and stuff. And we have other token holders and NFT collectors who are pseudonymous or we just know their [crypto] wallet. But actually, the pseudonymous people or totally anonymous people don’t tend to participate as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUjVw4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It says in the announcement post that around 100 people have tokens at this point.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOBMV"&gt;Yeah, I think now it’s about 130. I expect a small portion of those to actually vote. I don’t think that every token holder is going to vote by any means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ScfyR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a maximum number of people that you feel like could be involved in voting? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oJijY"&gt;Someone asked us about this the other day, and I think somewhere around a thousand people — I don’t expect more than a thousand people to be actively voting because in our experience, a very, very small number of readers actually want to participate in governance. Like, governance is just not something that a lot of people want to do. They want to consume content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpcFnd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say you have a pitch with sensitive information — like in an extreme example, there’s an assault allegation that you don’t want to make public outside a small editorial process. How would you handle DAO members voting on that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zR6E8Q"&gt;There’s a few reasons that this works for us. And one of the reasons is that the DAO-voted features are not our only features — like, this is not our entire editorial process. This is one part of the editorial process, kind of like a column or recurring feature that’s sponsored by the DAO and the token holders. So we’re certainly allowing ourselves to do pieces that don’t go through this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8STgX"&gt;But also I think this DAO structure and the whole mechanism works for &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; particularly because we’re not doing investigative reporting. We’re doing criticism and commentary and aggregation about entertainment online. I would personally not want a publication driven by crypto that’s trying to do like, sexual assault investigations, as you said, or more consequential political reporting, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78qtMI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things Civil was interested in was having a censorship-proof record of journalism actually on the blockchain. How viable do you think that is?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XYMko"&gt;It’s not something that we’re dealing with or proposing at all. Our publishing is not really blockchain-connected — like, the newsletter itself just runs on Substack like any other Substack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npeeoH"&gt;I think what is interesting to me is less about how the writing is censor-proof than the kind of funding and decision-making that we’re doing will be public. So at this point, you could actually see every transaction that &lt;em&gt;Dirt &lt;/em&gt;has gotten funding from, so you could see the exact amount of money that we’ve made. You can see who holds our tokens, who holds our NFTs. And once the DAO votes start, you’ll be able to see how every vote happens, who voted for what. So those will all be more or less permanent records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjnUGV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you say “who voted for what,” you mean linked with wallets, which don’t necessarily tell you who owns the wallet or who is behind it, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBpczS"&gt;In our case, the majority of the token holders do connect their wallet to their real name, because they also are proud to participate and want to show their support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uq3yxS"&gt;To be very clear, I don’t think this use case works in every situation at all. I think it works because we engage with digital culture. We don’t do super hard-hitting journalism. And the process is about having fun determining the stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGldIi"&gt;I think there could be ways to apply this technology to other editorial processes that would work on investigative features or similar things like that. To me, the permanent record-keeping of blockchain is interesting. I don’t see that being applied in terms of censorship-proof writing that soon, personally. I do think it is interesting to see the governance votes and see the funding mechanisms. So I see it right now, more as a back-end for media production, and less about the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9880Xi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why specifically use Ethereum?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wr3jxJ"&gt;Ethereum is the furthest along in terms of utility for cryptocurrencies. Like, things like Snapshot, which helps you do governance, work on Ethereum-built currencies, and OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, most of the transactions are in Ethereum. &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; actually started on the publishing platform Mirror, which also uses Ethereum-backed stuff. So the short answer is, the tools are there for Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="davzDD"&gt;I am definitely a big fan of less environmentally impactful blockchain technologies, and I think we would love to see Ethereum go to layer two and use less energy. But I also think &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; in the near future will move to a less heavy blockchain like Solana or Tezos. My impression is that the record-keeping is kind of the same — Ethereum versus Solana versus Tezos versus whatever, they’re all public records, they’re all on a chain somewhere. And so I’m not sure that the Ethereum label itself will be as valuable in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jDGtY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re selling these DAO tokens, it’s more or less a one-time payment for each token. If you want to keep getting funding, do you just have to keep selling more tokens?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azR9W0"&gt;One ideal model that I’ve thought of is essentially like if Bored Ape Yacht Club was a media company — right now, they’re making millions of dollars a month on secondary sales royalties [for NFT transfers]. So there is a world in which &lt;em&gt;Dirt &lt;/em&gt;could run solely on secondary market royalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RKfRL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That seems like it might require having a pretty heavy turnover in the user base that’s engaged enough to want to vote on these things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0ZRY0"&gt;I think there’s an interesting comparison — like, the readers of a publication don’t stay the same over time. People are always cycling in and out. So I would expect that there would be some people who are in it for the long haul, definitely plenty of turnover, maybe someone buys some tokens and wants to vote for a few weeks and then gets bored of it and sells them. That would be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EaDV3i"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the big criticisms of NFT systems is that they just rely on constant expansion for funding. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYDsWz"&gt;We don’t want to go the way of constant expansion. I think our ideal situation would be patrons who want to keep participating in the long term and using their tokens and helping us fund ourselves in whatever way we choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saMd3l"&gt;I think the constant expansion is only necessary if you want to operate on a large scale like Bored Ape Yacht Club or something similar. I see a situation in which each editorial initiative could have its own token or own NFT, and then once that funding runs out, you do a different one. So it kind of becomes like special issues, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgXGqY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that would be separate from DAO voting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JK3frY"&gt;Right — it could be. We can experiment with different mechanisms for different projects, and that’s kind of cool. I don’t think anything with &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; is permanent. These are experiments that we’ll do, and then see how they work and then try something slightly different. And just repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
