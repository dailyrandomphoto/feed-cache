    <title>Apple discontinuing two configurations of its 21.5 inch iMac</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fGSntk"&gt;Apple recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22316831/apple-store-imac-pro-base-model-while-supplies-last"&gt;discontinued the iMac Pro,&lt;/a&gt; and two configurations of the 21.5-inch iMac are now joining the Pro in retirement. As spotted &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/20/512gb-1tb-ssd-imac-21-discontinued/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 512GB and 1TB SSD configurations of the 21.5-inch iMac are no longer available for purchase, with only the 256GB SSD and 1TB Fusion drive versions available to buy on Apple’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlNXBM"&gt;Both configurations appeared &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/21-5-inch-imac-ssd-upgrades-unavailable/"&gt;unavailable for purchase&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s website as of last month, but at the time it was not clear if that was a supply issue or a permanent discontinuation of the two options. But now both the 512GB and 1TB SSD options are gone from the iMac configuration page, &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugEhbO"&gt;A big iMac redesign has been rumored in the works for some time. Apple is expected to replace the 27-inch and 21.5-inch versions of the iMac with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233191/apple-silicon-redesigned-imac-mac-pro-rumor-features"&gt;redesigned iMac&lt;/a&gt; and will likely revamp the Mac Pro sometime this year. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-plans-redesigned-imac-new-mac-pro-smaller-mac-pro-cheaper-monitor?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the update would have a flat-back design and do away with the “chin” beneath the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VuOIe5"&gt;The new iMacs are expected to use Apple silicon chips, as the company continues to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;shift away from Intel chips&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Victor Santos’ new comic Paranoia Killer is a dark thriller with an unassuming cartoon look</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bRgZ_PLietEMCBiPlUtZ33-JOXw=/0x77:740x570/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68999190/paranoiakiller_01_big.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fhhc71"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comics have never been bigger: with Marvel TV shows, DC movies, and indie adaptations growing by the day, comic books have never been more prominent in pop culture. This ongoing &lt;/em&gt;Verge&lt;em&gt; column recommends comic series new and old, whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqUOWq"&gt;Sometimes the art and narrative of a comic go hand-in-hand. A horror story might be full of lots of black and reds, while a superhero comic is brighter and cleaner. &lt;a href="http://panelsyndicate.com/comics/paranoia-killer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paranoia Killer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; goes in a different direction. The series is a dark thriller, full of violence and serious subject matter, but with a visual style reminiscent of a Nickelodeon cartoon. Somehow, it still works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqTRYT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paranoia Killer&lt;/em&gt; is a brand-new series — so far, only the first of four parts is available — that centers on Nathalie Laertes, an FBI agent forced to take on a very strange undercover job: impersonating her twin brother. It turns out that her twin, who she believed to be just a slightly troubled sibling, was actually one of the world’s most infamous hitmen. Surprise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="str0oW"&gt;Nathalie learns all of this when her brother turns up dead, and her boss forces her to impersonate him in order to infiltrate a criminal organization. Part of it is that they’re identical twins, so she has the look down. But they also apparently share some kind of “aura” that makes the whole switch possible. The first issue ends just as things really start heating up, as she heads off to a criminal training facility in the middle of the desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IBo3fSpwi5wgU_trlTnAaRBNNjg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22383128/Paranoia06Pre.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0mxERs"&gt;The thriller setup has a lot of potential, and I’m hooked after just the first issue. But part of what makes &lt;em&gt;Paranoia Killer&lt;/em&gt; so interesting is its contrast in styles. The story is R-rated material; you’ll see characters shot dead in cold blood, and it opens with what appears to be a torture sequence. But it’s coupled with a surprisingly lighthearted art style, with flat colors and lots of clear, simple shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moPlBo"&gt;In the first issue’s afterword, creator Victor Santos says this contrast of styles was born partly out of stubbornness. “I went for a more exaggerated cartoon style in this book, I suppose because I’m very stubborn, and I keep reading from time-to-time some critics saying that you can’t do ‘serious things’ with that style,” he writes. Well, so far, he’s made his point; in issue one, the art doesn’t distract but instead gives &lt;em&gt;Paranoia Killer&lt;/em&gt; a very distinct vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOFFEY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is it by?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Paranoia Killer&lt;/em&gt; is the brainchild of Victor Santos, a Spanish comics creator who handled every part of the project: story, art, and design. He’s probably best-known for the series &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_(webcomic)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which also happens to be about a hitman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cb6fyH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I read it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paranoia Killer&lt;/em&gt; is the latest release on Panel Syndicate, a creator-run digital platform for comics. So far, it’s featured excellent series like &lt;em&gt;The Private Eye&lt;/em&gt; — a story about a future without the internet from Brian K. Vaughan, Marcos Martin, and Muntsa Vicente — and even a &lt;em&gt;Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; spinoff. It’s a great place to find some offbeat stories, like the incredible &lt;em&gt;Umami&lt;/em&gt; from Ken Niimura, which might not have a place at more traditional publishers. It also operates under a pay-what-you-want system, letting you support creators however you feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will set up a legal entity in Turkey to comply with controversial social media law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8KrrNL2xxcJVYi490kG9fGe53XU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68999103/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2ZpXXc"&gt;Twitter is planning to establish a legal entity in Turkey to continue operating there under the country’s controversial &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/world/europe/turkey-social-media-control.html"&gt;internet law that took effect last June&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/update-twitter-turkey.html"&gt;company announced late Friday&lt;/a&gt;. Under the law, social media companies that have more than 1 million users must store Turkish users’ data in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmHs8P"&gt;Such companies also are required to designate an official representative in Turkey, who must answer requests to take down content that violates privacy within 48 hours. If the companies refuse to comply, they could face fines, advertising bans, and eventually bandwidth reductions that could make the platforms unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPWf0M"&gt;“We remain committed to protecting the voices and data of people in Turkey who use Twitter. We will continue to be transparent about how we handle requests from government and law enforcement,” Twitter said in its statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpxUQg"&gt;Authorities in Turkey fined Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok 40 million liras (about $5.1 million) each in 2020 for failing to appoint the required local representative. Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/turkey-media-social-media-6f2b1567e0e7f02e983a98f9dc795265"&gt;have since established&lt;/a&gt; the required legal entities in the country. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-twitter/turkey-slaps-ad-ban-on-twitter-under-new-social-media-law-idUSKBN29O0CT"&gt;Twitter was among the social media companies&lt;/a&gt; that received a ban on advertising in Turkey under the new law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOySxg"&gt;The Turkish government says Internet Law 5651, as the legislation is called, is necessary to protect the rights of social media users in the country and to fight online criminal activity. But human rights organizations caution the law is censorship that risks access to information, in a country that the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/twitter-to-establish-legal-entity-in-turkey-comply-with-law/2021/03/20/fe4f501e-8959-11eb-be4a-24b89f616f2c_story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; has a history of restricting free speech. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Welcome to the age of vaccine diplomacy  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="EL SALVADOR-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M8eV4pTTkqJ_6-vvKgqimOLmKQU=/6x0:6042x4024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68998744/1231655388.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q1xbLy"&gt;Millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines currently sitting in United States warehouses are now destined for vaccination sites in Mexico and Canada, according to the White House. The donation marks one of the US’ first steps into the dawning — and deeply contentious — world of late-stage pandemic vaccine diplomacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcDZq7"&gt;The neighborly gesture is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/world/americas/usa-mexico-vaccine-coronavirus.html"&gt;reportedly a loan&lt;/a&gt; — the US expects that they will return the favor and hand over some vaccine doses in the future. The US can certainly afford to be generous with these doses. The AstraZeneca vaccine that it’s donating hasn’t been authorized in the US. The country reserved doses &lt;em&gt;just in case&lt;/em&gt; it is eventually given the green light by the FDA, but the vaccine is still being tested in the US. Results from that trial &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04516746"&gt;are expected soon&lt;/a&gt;, but functionally, the US has a whole bunch of doses sitting around that it can’t do anything with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="h3nPPJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1xVkyp"&gt;But other countries can. Many places have given AstraZeneca the all-clear, including Canada and Mexico. And the US has lined up enough authorized vaccines to innoculate the entire US populations. That’s left many people pushing the Biden administration to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine.html"&gt;let the doses go&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/us/politics/coronavirus-astrazeneca-united-states.html"&gt;countries that need them&lt;/a&gt;. Now, it seems, they are finally going to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uTPd3"&gt;(Quick aside: Complicating everything, there’s a whole mess with the AstraZeneca vaccine rollout in Europe — some weird blood clotting showed up in a few patients, causing several countries to halt vaccinations. Vaccinations resumed this week, with several regulators — and AstraZeneca — insisting that the vaccine is safe.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="FRE1zC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;functionally, the US has a whole bunch of doses sitting around that it can’t do anything with&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D7IpwA"&gt;The few million doses being handed to Mexico and Canada are a start. But on the global stage, the US is a bit late to the party when it comes to vaccine donation. China, India, and Russia, among others, have all been pushing this particular version of soft power for a while now. India, which has a massive pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/us/politics/coronavirus-astrazeneca-united-states.html"&gt;is in a prime position to donate vaccines to other countries&lt;/a&gt;. The UAE is jockeying to become a &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3123969/uae-chinas-vaccine-diplomacy-stepping-stone-its-own-geopolitical"&gt;major vaccine hub&lt;/a&gt; in the Middle East, both buying and distributing vaccines. China and Russia have both developed their own vaccines and are using them to &lt;a href="https://healthpolicy-watch.news/russia-and-chinas-bilateral-vaccine/"&gt;bolster alliances around the world&lt;/a&gt;. So now you’ve got multiple countries pushing their own vaccine supplies (and their own national agendas) to countries who can’t afford to negotiate their own deals with a limited number of manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRCizJ"&gt;Then there’s COVAX. COVAX is a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-55795297"&gt;vaccine distribution effort&lt;/a&gt; put together by international organizations including the World Health Organization. Its goal is to make sure that poorer countries &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/fair-allocation-mechanism-for-covid-19-vaccines-through-the-covax-facility"&gt;also have access&lt;/a&gt; to COVID-19 vaccines. So far, it’s shipped &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/covax-vaccine-roll-out"&gt;about 30 million vaccines&lt;/a&gt; around the world. That’s not nothing, but a small fraction of the more than 420 million vaccine doses &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/"&gt;administered worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s well short of COVAX’s goal of administering more than one billion doses to poorer countries by the end of this year.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pr5pVe"&gt;This has left COVAX &lt;em&gt;very annoyed&lt;/em&gt; at all the bilateral wheeling-dealing happening between countries, and between countries and drug companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TxNDEO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pushing wealthy countries like the US to put their doses where their wallets are&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KA67JP"&gt;“We have made great progress,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-who-covax/vaccine-hoarding-threatens-global-supply-via-covax-who-idUSKBN2AQ2O5"&gt;said in February&lt;/a&gt;. “But that progress is fragile. We need to accelerate the supply and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and we cannot do that if some countries continue to approach manufacturers who are producing vaccines that COVAX is counting on. These actions undermine COVAX and deprive health workers and vulnerable people around the world of life-saving vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2i68f"&gt;Biden has pledged &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/us-covax-initative-4-billion-donate-doses-83903faa-a6b9-44e7-b44b-90e6f28c42ee.html"&gt;$4 billion to COVAX&lt;/a&gt;, but international pressure is increasingly building for wealthy countries like the US to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/covax-why-biden-s-billions-won-t-fix-covid-vaccine-n1258816"&gt;put their doses where their wallets are&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiaDbq"&gt;“From a U.S. perspective, we’re losing a bit of the messaging war out there,” Krishna Udayakumar, director of Duke University’s Global Health Innovation Center &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/extra-vaccine-doses-america-a7b5c9ee-7ab2-4cce-b220-54899f824ba9.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. “If we look six months from now, it may well be the fact that the U.S. has donated more doses than any other country in the world. But right now the storyline is how we’re buying more and hoarding more of the supply.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="X594p4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When this is all over... the nations of the world will be left with how they treated other human beings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wfBLwj"&gt;The US appears to be trying to change that storyline — but it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/12/us-and-pacific-partners-to-flood-asia-with-vaccines-475571"&gt;taking its own diplomatic path to get there&lt;/a&gt;. In March, President Biden met with leaders of Australia, Japan, and India on a plan to boost production of vaccines, and flood countries in Asia and the Pacific with vaccines this year.  At the same time, there’s internal pressure for the US government to quickly roll out the vaccines they have to their own population, which, due to the Trump administration’s own bungling of the pandemic has &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html"&gt;suffered the highest official death toll of any country in the world&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORi9oM"&gt;As the rollout continues, this is all going to keep happening. Countries will try to vaccinate the people in their borders, and they’ll simultaneously try to make the most of any donations to the rest of the world. For now, it’s a messy political problem that’s getting tied into other international negotiations. But when this is all over and the vaccine vials are empty, the nations of the world will be left with how they treated other human beings — whether they held on to a security blanket of extra doses, or whether they handed over some of their bounty to a neighbor in need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAUDE7"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;

Then regulatory bodies came out and said that the vaccine was safe. Since then, many countries have &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-health-germany-coronavirus-pandemic-08d5b84cdd1ceddf1557f68f61332c26"&gt;resumed vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;, but the situation remains complex.

&lt;h2 id="w7NJFN"&gt;Perspectives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xh82x8"&gt;Destiny has led me into a mysterious place these last nine months: isolation. At a time in my life when I am supposed to be branching out, the COVID pandemic seems to have trimmed those branches back to nubs. I have had to research colleges without setting foot on them. I’ve introduced myself to strangers through essays, videos, and test scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="johsdl"&gt;More than Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzHy5l"&gt;To the more than &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/"&gt;420 million people&lt;/a&gt; who have been vaccinated — thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krtvPW"&gt;To the more than 122,101,187 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeseHs"&gt;To the families and friends of the 2,696,513 people who have died worldwide — 540,950 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok banning some accounts in Myanmar in attempt to stop the spread of violent videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8iVo2g"&gt;TikTok says it has “aggressively banned” numerous accounts and devices in Myanmar, in an attempt to curb misinformation and the spread of violent videos on its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLr9zD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/tiktok-is-repeating-facebooks-mistakes-in-myanmar/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that government soldiers in Myanmar have posted hundreds of videos to TikTok since its military seized power in February. The videos ranges from traditional pro-government propaganda, to misinformation meant to confuse protesters, to threats from soldiers with weapons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euwgNg"&gt;TikTok removed some of the videos earlier this month after &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-tiktok/i-will-shoot-whoever-i-see-myanmar-soldiers-use-tiktok-to-threaten-protesters-idUSKBN2AW17X"&gt;media reports&lt;/a&gt; about the rise in hate speech and threats in the southeast Asian nation. But &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; reports that the short-form video platform admitted it had not moved swiftly enough to stop the spread of the threatening videos and other violent content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rNbJK"&gt;As demonstrators continue to protest the February 1st coup, more than 200 people have been &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-idUSKBN2BC026"&gt;killed in Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjwK7x"&gt;“The promotion of hate, violence and misinformation has absolutely no place on TikTok,” a company spokesperson said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “When we identified the rapidly escalating situation in Myanmar, we quickly expanded our dedicated resources and further stepped up efforts to remove violative content. We aggressively banned numerous accounts and devices that we identified promoting dangerous content at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsQj5i"&gt;The spokesperson added that TikTok “will continue to make significant investment to respond to new threats in order to keep TikTok in Myanmar a safe platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AW31VG"&gt;Activists and rights advocates told &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; that the use of TikTok to spread government propaganda in Myanmar bore similarities to the way the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html"&gt;country’s military used Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to stoke violence and hate speech against the country’s Rohingya minority in the early 2010s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGxwgx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/an-update-on-myanmar/"&gt;In February, Facebook said&lt;/a&gt; it was banning the Tatmadaw—Myanmar’s military— and other state-controlled entities from both Facebook and Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFfXaZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQKFMA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NFT mania is here, and so are the scammers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hrVjTCxCxsuAtquCu7WoZpiEDHw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68998457/acastro_210319_1777_nft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Artists are seeing their work showing up in NFTs they did not mint themselves&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="su3n7K"&gt;The artist Derek Laufman woke up last weekend to a couple emails from his followers, who had a question for him. They wanted to know if he’d started selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt; — non-fungible tokens — of his art. But it wasn’t just email. People had DMed him on Instagram and Twitter, too. “I just replied, that’s 100 percent not me,” Laufman says when I reach him by video call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgWHGZ"&gt;On Rarible, a site where people can purchase NFTs, a verified profile had appeared that alleged to be from him — which means that someone took the time to impersonate him all the way through the &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/How-to-get-verified-on-Rarible-c6496e55ff33440bbe75ef19701a47fa"&gt;platform’s verification process&lt;/a&gt;. “I was basically kind of annoyed that somebody had, quote, unquote, verified me as on that platform,” Laufman says. “I dealt with having my art stolen for years. And I’m sort of numb to that. But when somebody is claiming to be you ... that kind of, you know, pisses me off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmUoyx"&gt;After a few people reported the theft and impersonation and Laufman fired off a few messages on Twitter about the situation, Rarible took the profile down. But not before one of his fans had bought an NFT of the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ozHYeD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is 100% NOT me. I thought the point of NFT was that the artwork and artists needed to be verified? Apparently super easy to scam people. What a joke that platform is. &lt;a href="https://t.co/FrBy4zuhQy"&gt;https://t.co/FrBy4zuhQy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Derek Laufman (@laufman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/laufman/status/1370715624058544128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t4RWUE"&gt;While you’ve probably heard of NFTs by now, you’ve probably heard more about digital art selling for exorbitant sums than about the creators who are getting ripped off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0FtCq"&gt;Which is a shame. The promise of NFTs is pretty easy to grasp: if you’re a digital creator, they represent a way to make money off of work that might not otherwise be salable. You can earn royalties from future sales of work in perpetuity — and it can be built right into the object itself. But the reality of NFTs is different, and grimmer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="6mhVkb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KXIpDW"&gt;Artists like Laufman have have had their work minted as NFTs and listed for sale without their permission; and as in that case, platforms that host stolen art only seem to moderate if the artist finds out and posts about it on social media. &lt;em&gt;Tales From The Loop &lt;/em&gt;author Simon Stålenhag &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simonstalenhag/status/1369661661146193925"&gt;found his art&lt;/a&gt; on Marble Cards, another NFT site, and Giphy has warned that people are turning user-created GIFs from its site into NFTs. Because the NFT system doesn’t require people to actually own the copyright to something to mint it, it’s a market ripe for fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flAd5w"&gt;NFTs are unique digital widgets that are typically part of the Ethereum blockchain and can be used to identify the owner of a piece of digital art. Any digital object can become an NFT, as long as it’s been “minted,” or put on the blockchain as a token. They’re sort of like trading cards, if the card was digital and pointed to the URL of a JPEG. And because these tokens are represented on a blockchain — which is predicated on burning cheap electricity to solve mathematical puzzles, which when solved pay out some amount of cryptocurrency — there is an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;as yet unspecified negative environmental cost associated with transacting them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96rHLy"&gt;The whole system is predicated on the understanding that the people minting NFTs are who they say they are. &lt;a href="https://news.artnet.com/market/nyan-cat-nft-sells-for-560000-1945679"&gt;Would you buy a GIF of Nyan Cat for $560,000&lt;/a&gt;, for example, if the creator of the meme wasn’t the person who was selling it as an NFT online? Because anything can be tokenized on the blockchain — where, by the way, the record is immutable — anything can end up as a NFT, even if the creator of an artwork isn’t the person selling it online for Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EpxbcT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;non fungible tokens (NFTs) have no inherent value and not even technologically innovative — they require the pre-existing system of violence and control to enforce a belief in the value of what is ultimately a glorified checksum&lt;/p&gt;— Chelsea E. Manning (@xychelsea) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/1371848551651741708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Df7aD"&gt;While it’s unclear whether the problem is widespread, many artists have started checking sites like OpenSea and Rarible to see if their work has been minted without their permission. “I’d seen a few posts going around of people who’d had their art stolen,” says Devin Elle Kurtz, an artist and visual developer, when I reach her by phone. So Kurtz decided to look around to see if her own work had been taken. “And I was like, you know, it probably hasn’t. You know... it’s probably fine.” As the narrator of this story, I can say: it wasn’t fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVTJoP"&gt;“I searched my name and sure enough it came up,” Kurtz says. “One of the first results was my art on this Marble Cards website.” The piece in question was around five years old, from her DeviantArt account, and it had made it to the front page of the website. “The person who turned it into an NFT had, like, put their handle all over it,” Kurtz added. “Like, all over the frame, they’d like put their watermark on it with their Twitter handle.” Which is very weird! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bZLC1y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I searched my name to make sure my art hadn't been stolen and turned into NFTs, and sure thing, an obscure old piece from my DeviantArt is randomly on the front page of the marble cards NFT website? How is this allowed... &lt;a href="https://t.co/EE1jXLuQDL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EE1jXLuQDL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Devin - Artbook Kickstarter Soon! (@DevinElleKurtz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevinElleKurtz/status/1370250777768251392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oJ4j3d"&gt;“I don’t know who that person is, and they may not have known they were doing anything wrong,” Kurtz says. “Nothing against that individual if they didn’t realize that what they were doing might not be the greatest.” It was priced at 1.03 Ether, which as of publication time works out to $1,844.03; &lt;a href="https://www.marble-cards.info/cards/69743"&gt;it’s still up&lt;/a&gt;, though Marble Cards removed the image at Kurtz’s request. But the NFT — the frame around the URL in the case of Marble Cards — will continue to exist forever, on the blockchain. (Marble Cards is unique in that it lets users mint and trade “frames” around artwork, rather than the artwork itself, theoretically avoiding copyright issues — though artists clearly disagree.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCiCYL"&gt;Kurtz’s experience is emblematic of the big problem with NFTs, generally speaking: anyone can mint anything. All you need is an Ethereum wallet and some cash for “gas fees” — in other words, the cost of doing the transaction to put whatever you’re minting on the Ethereum blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGAgyz"&gt;On OpenSea and Rarible, two major NFT platforms, you don’t have to verify you own something before putting it on the blockchain. Verifying yourself on these platforms is also not difficult; Rarible’s process involves submitting social handles for verification but doesn’t seem to check whether you own those handles, as in Laufman’s case. OpenSea, on the other hand, has foregone verification entirely. Its recommendation for buyers is now, “Do your own research.” (Neither platform had responded to requests for comment at press time.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5kMQkD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;From now on, creators no longer need to submit their collections for approval. All NFTs will appear in the public search.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those of you currently waiting, the gray warning icons on your items are gone, and your collection will appear in the public search within a week.&lt;/p&gt;— OpenSea (@opensea) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1370895902982946820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bHm5vZ"&gt;I spoke to the independent crypto journalist Amy Castor to get her opinion on this kind of NFT fraud. Castor recently wrote a &lt;a href="https://amycastor.com/2021/03/14/metakovan-the-mystery-beeple-art-buyer-and-his-nft-defi-scheme/"&gt;story for her personal website&lt;/a&gt; about the biggest sale in NFT history — of the artist Beeple’s work, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;which the famed auction house Christie’s sold for $69 million&lt;/a&gt; — alleging that Metakovan, the pseudonymous buyer, bought the work to finance a pump-and-dump scheme with another token they own, &lt;a href="https://b20.metapurse.fund/"&gt;B.20&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="7LcsZi"&gt;“Anybody can create an entity about anything and just sell it on a marketplace. There probably aren’t that many protections in place. But, I mean, the key thing is you’re not buying anything,” Castor says when I reach her by phone. “If you buy identity as a token, it’s just this coin. There’s really no intrinsic value to it, other than what somebody else is going to pay you for it,” she continues. “It’s all speculative at the end of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian planning to install 10,000 EV chargers across the US and Canada by 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A1VjnlZGEZ8e_6p3BQCseHVXjIU=/0x170:2040x1530/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68998445/A._Rivian_R1S_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photos: Rivian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="speakable-summary"&gt;Amazon-backed electric vehicle startup Rivian will install more than 10,000 fast chargers across the US and Canada by 2023, the company announced. The Rivian Adventure Network is designed to allow quick recharges along highways and also includes Level 2 charges at more remote locations near parks and other destinations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzKSgN"&gt;Rivian described the network &lt;a href="https://stories.rivian.com/charging-your-rivian"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="oBOUub"&gt;Each site will have multiple chargers and will be conveniently located on highways and main roads, often by cafes and shops. These DC fast chargers will be for Rivian owners only, with details on pricing and associated programs coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OWQ1Ct"&gt;The company also is installing waypoint Level 2 AC chargers, each with a 11.5 kW charging speed, to add about 25 miles of range every hour for Rivian’s R1T pickup and R1S SUV. These chargers will be located along routes that Rivian thinks its drivers will take. The first such waypoint chargers are being installed in Colorado’s state parks beginning in July, and will be accessible to any electric vehicle with a J1772 plug. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aj1sahKGEMe7BivjZ8vVVwWAChc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22384777/rivian_map.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Rivian&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A map of the 3,500 fast chargers Rivian is planning at 600 sites&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Nt1xa3"&gt;Rivian says drivers can locate the waypoints and fast chargers in their vehicles’ navigation systems and the Rivian app. The network will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLBb1S"&gt;It’s an ambitious plan to be sure, and Rivian is still a relatively new player in the EV market, with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18111782/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-price-specs-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18113257/rivian-r1s-suv-electric-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;SUV&lt;/a&gt; debuting late in 2018 (it began operating in stealth mode in 2009). But the company has managed to raise several huge funding rounds, with Amazon leading a $700 million round in February 2019, and Ford adding $500 million in April 2019. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238670/rivian-funding-amazon-electric-truck-suv"&gt;Rivian raised $2.65 billion&lt;/a&gt; from T. Rowe Price and Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="AiOt3u"&gt;A hacking group is demanding $50 million from Acer, &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/computer-giant-acer-hit-by-50-million-ransomware-attack/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported, in what appears to be one of the biggest ransomware demands to date. According to &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;, the attackers may have gained access to the Taiwanese computer manufacturer’s network via a Microsoft Exchange vulnerability. The REvil group that carried out a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054951/travelex-currency-exchange-offline-malware-attack-ransom"&gt;ransomware attack on Travelex&lt;/a&gt; last year is believed to be behind the Acer breach as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzuA7d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer &lt;/em&gt;said REvil is giving Acer until March 28th to pay the ransom or it will leak the data it claims to have collected. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/02/multiple-security-updates-released-for-exchange-server/"&gt;recently released&lt;/a&gt; several security updates to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316189/microsoft-exchange-server-security-exploit-china-attack-30000-organizations"&gt;fix vulnerabilities for exploits found in its Exchange&lt;/a&gt; software, but it wasn’t immediately clear whether the Acer breach was connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNwQ80"&gt;Acer did not acknowledge whether it had been the victim of a ransomware attack, but a spokesperson said in an email to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday that the company “routinely monitors its IT systems, and most cyberattacks are well defensed. Companies like us are constantly under attack, and we have reported recent abnormal situations observed to the relevant law enforcement and data protection authorities in multiple countries.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fg0QRS"&gt;The spokesperson added that the company could not provide further information: “As this is an ongoing investigation and for the sake of security, we are unable to comment on details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sh4d5s"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n80hLD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 20th 11:10AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds statement from Acer spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft may have fixed what wasn’t broke with Windows 10 BSOD printer patch</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rIZgDM"&gt;If you’re the kind of person who’d be amused to learn &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22326083/windows-10-security-update-bug-printer-crash-kyocera-ricoh-zebra-microsoft"&gt;that a humble printer can blue screen your entire Windows 10 PC,&lt;/a&gt; here’s a dose of schadenfreude to welcome you into the weekend: when Microsoft tried to &lt;em&gt;fix&lt;/em&gt; those blue screen issues &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332916/windows-10-update-fixes-printer-blue-screen-of-death-issue-crash-microsoft"&gt;with a Monday patch&lt;/a&gt;, the patch may have not gone quite as planned — some users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/m5wmsu/outofband_updates_are_now_available_to_fix_the/"&gt;started reporting&lt;/a&gt; their printers would simply spit out blank pages or ones with missing graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1KDQS"&gt;Now, the company’s &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows-message-center#1574"&gt;released a second patch&lt;/a&gt; to address those issues too (via &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-printer-glitches-microsoft-issues-second-out-of-band-patch/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0g&amp;amp;taid=6055064aac741e000115f41d&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="jWagLT"&gt;Microsoft identified an issue that affects Windows 10 devices which applied the March 2021 security update released March 9, 2021 and the out-of-band updates released March 15, 2021, and a resolution has been expedited. Affected devices might receive unexpected results when printing from some apps or to some printers. Issues might include missing or solid color graphics, misalignment/formatting issues, or printing of blank pages/labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="aGFgGr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/m8b0ai/windows_10_printing_fixed_for_real_this_time/"&gt;Some users say&lt;/a&gt; that it works, and may even fix some additional blue-screening computers. A few say they’re still having issues. If you’re affected, good luck to you!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Epic’s top execs plan to testify live and in person this May in the Fortnite app store trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DoaZxlVhtkPmXdYhPqG3_Ctapcc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68997766/VRG_TBP_Epic_VS_Apple_Textless.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SkZunV"&gt;It’s hard to believe it’s only been seven months since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368504/fortnite-apple-google-app-store-brief-incomplete-timeline"&gt;Apple booted &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;off the App Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368651/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-ban-lawsuit-epic-games-payments"&gt;Epic Games sprung its antitrust trap&lt;/a&gt;, but you won’t have to wait much longer before the behind-the-scenes legal machinations give way to courtroom drama — and, it seems, until Apple and Epic’s top executives take the stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HH4vgl"&gt;In a legal filing Friday evening, Apple revealed that CEO Tim Cook, SVP Craig Federighi, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354367/apple-phil-schiller-fellow-greg-joswiak-head-marketing-store-events"&gt;former marketing chief and current App Store boss Phil Schiller&lt;/a&gt; intend to testify live and in person in the courtroom, among many other tentative witnesses. Epic Games’ CEO Tim Sweeney and VP Mark Rein should be there as well, plus Facebook’s VP of gaming, a Microsoft VP of Xbox business development, and quite a number of directors on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEs5de"&gt;Schiller is expected to spend the most time on the witness stand by far at an estimated 11 hours of examination and cross-examination, which makes sense. Not only has he been in charge of the App Store that’s at the center of the case, but some of his emails and the emails of his subordinates have been under scrutiny — both for this case and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony"&gt;in the big tech antitrust hearing last year&lt;/a&gt;, one which ended with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504814/congress-antitrust-report-house-judiciary-committee-apple-google-amazon-facebook"&gt;the House Judiciary Committee concluding that&lt;/a&gt; “Apple exerts monopoly power in the mobile app store market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2avXFS"&gt;Apple says its executives “look forward to sharing with the court”: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UZEeRl"&gt;Our senior executives look forward to sharing with the court the very positive impact the App Store has had on innovation, economies across the world and the customer experience over the last 12 years. We feel confident the case will prove that Epic purposefully breached its agreement solely to increase its revenues, which is what resulted in their removal from the App Store. By doing that, Epic circumvented the security features of the App Store in a way that would lead to reduced competition and put consumers’ privacy and data security at tremendous risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wNRhb7"&gt;The trial &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.116.0.pdf"&gt;should tentatively begin May 3rd&lt;/a&gt;, and is expected to run several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGZBUm"&gt;You can find the full list of tentative witnesses and those who’ll be tentatively deposed below.&lt;/p&gt;
